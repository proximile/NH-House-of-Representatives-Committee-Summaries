have a break between um the 10 o'clock
 
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
hearing and the 11 so hopefully we can
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh that'll only last half an hour of
 
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
time for people to take bathroom breaks
 
00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:15.879 align:start position:0%
and get something to eat if they will uh
 
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
in a conversation yesterday or the day
 
00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:19.639 align:start position:0%
before with representative Sullivan in
 
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
the calendar it does state that we could
 
00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919 align:start position:0%
have executive session uh and I will
 
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
just uh reiterate what I have said uh to
 
00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:28.879 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan and to you folks
 
00:07:30.749 --> 00:07:30.759 align:start position:0%
during the orientation I do not like
 
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
having executive sessions on the same
 
00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
day a bill is heard I do not think we're
 
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
going to have to have that um I would
 
00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
let anyone know in advance if that would
 
00:07:42.189 --> 00:07:42.199 align:start position:0%
occur we have one bill that has to be
 
00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:44.879 align:start position:0%
out early uh and I think we'll be fine I
 
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.360 align:start position:0%
just don't like doing that because I
 
00:07:48.149 --> 00:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
think sometimes after a hearing
 
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
something can come out the next day
 
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
people think about things um and I just
 
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
don't like to push it that way so
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
although it is stated there in the
 
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
calendar uh I will not I will endeavor
 
00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:00.199 align:start position:0%
at all cost not to do that
 
00:08:02.189 --> 00:08:02.199 align:start position:0%
have any kind of executive session the
 
00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
same day
 
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
um it's very difficult for me to see I'm
 
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
not looking at the computer screen the
 
00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:10.879 align:start position:0%
regular Zoom screen that I could be able
 
00:08:12.749 --> 00:08:12.759 align:start position:0%
to see you when you are raising your
 
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
hand hopefully at the next hearing I'll
 
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
be able to exactly what Christina is
 
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
seeing um um but uh please be patient we
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
are doing the best we can with all of

this I've taken a number of Zoom classes
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
and and what have you but it's not going
 
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
to be perfect I tried to pick some
 
00:08:32.509 --> 00:08:32.519 align:start position:0%
simpler bills today that didn't have as
 
00:08:32.519 --> 00:08:34.269 align:start position:0%
simpler bills today that didn't have as
many

00:08:34.269 --> 00:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
many
 
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
um uh speakers and such so we could get
 
00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
so any questions before we have we I
 
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
hearing right not seeing any thank you
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
very much folks we're going to I guess
 
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
open the house session uh house hearing

259 and I would call on representative
 
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh yella to introduce his
 
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm here uh my
 
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
name is for the record my name is uh
 
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
Josh yella uh representative from
 
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
Fremont uh and I'm here presenting HB
 
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
259 relative to employee
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
uniforms the goal of this legislation is
 
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
for uh what can can be uh conflict
 
00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
between what an employee might want and
 
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
what a
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
employer is able to offer under the law
 
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:53.800 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
employee uh uniform leg statute right
 
00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
now defines uniform as a garment with a
 
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
company logo or fashion of distinctive
 
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
design worn by more one or more
 
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
employees and serving as a means of
 
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
identification or distinction and so if
 
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
if a garment has a distinctive logo and
 
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
is not really available for public
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
use um then you could essentially Define
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
that as an employee uniform and there
 
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.069 align:start position:0%
that as an employee uniform and there
are

00:10:33.069 --> 00:10:33.079 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:10:35.629 --> 00:10:35.639 align:start position:0%
options uh sometimes offered by
 
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
companies in other states that are
 
00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.670 align:start position:0%
companies in other states that are
premium

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
premium
 
00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:45.959 align:start position:0%
or or the employee just wants to have as
 
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
many or more employee uniforms than the
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
employer would like to provide for free
 
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.670 align:start position:0%
employer would like to provide for free
because

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
of um ease of you know maybe they don't
 
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
want to wash their clothes as much or
 
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:06.200 align:start position:0%
you know whatever situation that they
 
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
might have um the employee off requiring
 
00:11:13.629 --> 00:11:13.639 align:start position:0%
the employee
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
to only be given uh uniforms for
 
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
free uh requires that amount of overhead
 
00:11:24.629 --> 00:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
for the employer so the employer is
 
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
going to want to limit you know the
 
00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:29.959 align:start position:0%
employee uniforms offered for free to a
 
00:11:32.829 --> 00:11:32.839 align:start position:0%
limited um reasonable whatever they deem
 
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:35.240 align:start position:0%
as reasonable amount but that may not be
 
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
the same reasonable amount for the
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
employee and or there may
 
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
be uh options that are premium that
 
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
might cost um a small amount of money
 
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
more than the normal uh employee
 
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
uniforms that the employer might not
 
00:11:59.470 --> 00:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
want to eat the whole cost of and so in
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire right now if those premium
 
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
options are available but only required
 
00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
by law to be given for free the
 
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
employer sometimes chooses to not offer
 
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
them at all in this state um this
 
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:19.160 align:start position:0%
creates some tension because you know
 
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
they might be able to see a person or
 
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
employee in another state having options
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
to buy you know sweaters or jackets or
 
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
whatever that the public is not
 
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
available to buy and has this
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
distinctive design that sets them apart
 
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
from from the normal people in the
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
store and therefore are defined as
 
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.189 align:start position:0%
store and therefore are defined as
employee

00:12:43.189 --> 00:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
employee
 
00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:46.839 align:start position:0%
uniforms and so the goal is to just add
 
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
some language that allows for some
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
selling of additional uniforms or
 
00:12:59.150 --> 00:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
optional Alternatives that the offered
 
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
by the company um at some fee um
 
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
obviously you you want to encourage the
 
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
employer to to give the the standard
 
00:13:15.069 --> 00:13:15.079 align:start position:0%
uniform but what it what about optional
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
or additional um pairs of of
 
00:13:22.829 --> 00:13:22.839 align:start position:0%
uniforms uh that that the um employer
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
might not want
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
to eat the cost of as the overhead uh
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
for for its employ
 
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
employes um I think that that the
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
employees should be able to have that
 
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
option if they chose um obviously it's
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
not required but that's why I proposed
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
this legislation today and I hope that
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
you will be able to support that and I'm
 
00:13:47.069 --> 00:13:47.079 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any
 
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
representative Miss Dy are there any are
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:58.509 --> 00:13:58.519 align:start position:0%
representatives I don't see any hands
 
00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
raised but I can't tell whether there's
 
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um representative um could
 
00:14:12.629 --> 00:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
you envision a situation where an
 
00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
employer might offer a flimsy t-shirt as
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
a u uniform a single flimsy
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
t-shirt and then um offer for sale some
 
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:27.800 align:start position:0%
um nice collared shirts some sweaters or
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
sweatshirts colder uh temperatures um
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
and um basically require all uh
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
employees to wear the uniform but the
 
00:14:42.389 --> 00:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
employees would uh recognize that the
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
t-shirt is undesirable and so all
 
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
virtually all employees would be forced
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
into a situation of having to buy their
 
00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
uniform um because the flimsy t-shirt is
 
00:14:57.069 --> 00:14:57.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
wear thank you uh for the question
 
00:15:05.069 --> 00:15:05.079 align:start position:0%
um yes I guess it is potentially
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
possible for um someone to offer
 
00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:13.240 align:start position:0%
some lower
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
quality uh for free but
 
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
the the law does state that it needs to
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
be reasonably suited for the conditions
 
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
um of which the employee would be
 
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
required to wear one so if it was an
 
00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
argument could be made that if it was
 
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
you know extremely cold or whatever then
 
00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:37.399 align:start position:0%
a flimsy t-shirt might not be reasonably
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
suited if they need to you know go
 
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
outside or whatever um so an argument
 
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
can be made about how how
 
00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.509 align:start position:0%
can be made about how how
reasonable

00:15:48.509 --> 00:15:48.519 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
um that that
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh would be suited to the
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
job already in in
 
00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.269 align:start position:0%
job already in in
statute

00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative I see hand
 
00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
representative kahill yes thank you Mr
 
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
yella for bringing the bill forward I do
 
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
have a question uh does not the the uh
 
00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
existence of a premium and a and a sub
 
00:16:15.629 --> 00:16:15.639 align:start position:0%
premium or standard is that is it are
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
they not uniform in this
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
case they're not the
 
00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:22.230 align:start position:0%
case they're not the
same

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:16:25.389 --> 00:16:25.399 align:start position:0%
so so thank you for the question um the
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
uniform definition says anything that is
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
distinctive um
 
00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%
or has the logo and as a means of
 
00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:38.959 align:start position:0%
identification or distinctive and
 
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
so um the
 
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
uniform it's kind of a very broad option
 
00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
and I've worked at places that do have
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
um a standard uniform and then they have
 
00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
you know Christmas options where you
 
00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
could wear the regular t-shirt or you
 
00:17:00.749 --> 00:17:00.759 align:start position:0%
could wear a t-shirt with you know a
 
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
reef on it or you could get a you if you
 
00:17:06.189 --> 00:17:06.199 align:start position:0%
were cold you could get a fleece or
 
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
something like that and it would still
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
it still looks kind of the same um and
 
00:17:14.189 --> 00:17:14.199 align:start position:0%
still identifies you as being an
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
employee of the company and not just a
 
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
regular person standing in the store um
 
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
but it is kind of optional you don't
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
have to wear that you could wear the
 
00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
regular one without the Christmas you
 
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
it can comes in practice I think that um
 
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
it is a uniform or it's definitely under
 
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
this definition because it's so broad
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
however it is there are some flexibility
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
offered in some companies on what the
 
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
the uniform should
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
entail uh followup follow yes thank you
 
00:17:59.830 --> 00:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes I I appreciate having
 
00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:01.799 align:start position:0%
the the logo or the distinctive design
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
is in that much is uniform but uh could
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
you tell me if this is a common problem
 
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.549 align:start position:0%
 
Hampshire

00:18:15.549 --> 00:18:15.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
um I I was not really uh aware of this
 
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:26.200 align:start position:0%
issue until it was brought to my
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
attention um I
 
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
in the in the times that I uh was
 
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
working they because I was working in
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they just offered what
 
00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
they can offer um it's only comes
 
00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
into to play I think where where
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
employees are frustrated when they you
 
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
know go to a company website or they go
 
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
to another location perhaps working out
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
of the state and see more options or or
 
00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
just visit another States um
 
00:19:02.149 --> 00:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
um uh location and then they say wait a
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
minute where why are these options
 
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
available and then the um and then
 
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
there's also the frustration on the uh
 
00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:12.799 align:start position:0%
employer side to not be able to offer
 
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
everything that the company is offering
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
to other employees and puts the New
 
00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:22.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at a disadvantage I'm not sure
 
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
it applies to all companies in this
 
00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:26.360 align:start position:0%
state but it
 
00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
would it would only create kind of a a
 
00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
conflict between the employer and the
 
00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
employee where the employee the company
 
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:37.720 align:start position:0%
has other locations outside of the state
 
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
also because they would be have
 
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
different rules than than the ones in
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
this state so it would be only only
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
companies that
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
are are more widespread than just in New
 
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that helps give give an
 
00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
example of how many people are affected
 
00:19:59.630 --> 00:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
all right thank you I have a question
 
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:01.240 align:start position:0%
from representative turkot then I think

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
question I was going to and I just heard
 
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
the answer question about how common of
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:46.880 align:start position:0%

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
ahead sir thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
representative ell you mentioned that
 
00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
companies exclude uh New Hampshire
 
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
employees from buying these options from
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
The Company Store do you know how many
 
00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
States these companies operate in and
 
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
how many other states um they allow
 
00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
their employees to buy this I mean are
 
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
we looking at a situation where 49
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
states this is allowed and we're the
 
00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:11.240 align:start position:0%
only one or is it more like 5050 or do
 
00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:14.440 align:start position:0%
you have any information like
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
I did not have that information in in
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
front of me I they they operate in all
 
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
50 states the the person that brought
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
this to my attention um their company
 
00:21:30.269 --> 00:21:30.279 align:start position:0%
operates in all 50 States but I did not
 
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
uh research that and I would hap be
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
happy to uh follow up with you on that
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
that question thank
 
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
you representative Warden has his hand
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
up oh just a moment I have
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
representative huff and then
 
00:21:47.789 --> 00:21:47.799 align:start position:0%
representative Warden representative
 
00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:50.440 align:start position:0%
Huff thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
representative uh yala is there a
 
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
penalty Associated for non-compliance
 
00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.029 align:start position:0%
penalty Associated for non-compliance
with

00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:21:57.039 --> 00:22:01.190 align:start position:0%
with
this

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
that is a good question I did not see
 
00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
one in this statute however these these
 
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
people are
 
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
um they have to have a a license through
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
the the board of Labor so I think that
 
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
the board of labor would
 
00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:24.440 align:start position:0%
would have the punishments uh set up
 
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
there um that might be a better question
 
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
for for the Department
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you the department will be
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
speaking afterwards is that uh you also
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
that with your question representative H
 
00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:36.440 align:start position:0%
representative Warden thank you
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative yella in reading the
 
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:41.240 align:start position:0%
existing statute it says an employee May
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
purchase any other company garments or
 
00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
items if the employee chooses so it
 
00:22:48.669 --> 00:22:48.679 align:start position:0%
sounds like already they can buy
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
additional garments as long as they pay
 
00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
for it can you explain for us why this
 
00:22:58.029 --> 00:22:58.039 align:start position:0%
new language is needed exactly what is
 
00:22:58.039 --> 00:22:59.549 align:start position:0%
new language is needed exactly what is
the

00:22:59.549 --> 00:22:59.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
difference yes thank you for the
 
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
question uh So based on the reading of
 
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
um employ company garments um that would
 
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
be obviously something that is not does
 
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
not have a company logo or distinctive
 
00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.909 align:start position:0%
not have a company logo or distinctive
design

00:23:16.909 --> 00:23:16.919 align:start position:0%
design
 
00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
that serves as a means of identification
 
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
or distinction so if it was uh allowed
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
to be purchased by
 
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
everyone then it would would not fall
 
00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.310 align:start position:0%
everyone then it would would not fall
under

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
the the um definition of
 
00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
uniform so if it's only for employees
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
then it would be would fall under the
 
00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039 align:start position:0%
definition of uniform if it was not if
 
00:23:44.909 --> 00:23:44.919 align:start position:0%
it was open to the general public then
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
it would be considered a company garment
 
00:23:47.039 --> 00:23:49.669 align:start position:0%
it would be considered a company garment
or

00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
item okay thank you right thank you we
 
00:23:54.909 --> 00:23:54.919 align:start position:0%

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:46.120 align:start position:0%
that were on this Committee in
 
00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:49.480 align:start position:0%
2018 will remember that this particular
 
00:24:52.389 --> 00:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
language uh surrounding
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
27548 5B was amended in 2018 then
 
00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
representative uh Keith Murphy who's in
 
00:25:02.389 --> 00:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
the restaurant industry had actually had
 
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
a lot to do relative to this language
 
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
and the specific thing he was trying to
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
accomplish and I don't mean to put words
 
00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
in his mouth but when we were talking
 
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
about this language about an employee
 
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
May purchase any other company garments
 
00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
or items the intent was to allow for if
 
00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:20.360 align:start position:0%
you have an employer that says you have
 
00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
to wear a polo shirt or a t-shirt but
 
00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
the employees on their own want to wear
 
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
fleeces or other options
 
00:25:30.389 --> 00:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
uh they could purchase those and those
 
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
would not have to be provided by the
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
employer so understanding representative
 
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
Warden and yla's discussion right there
 
00:25:38.669 --> 00:25:38.679 align:start position:0%
I understand there might be some
 
00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:41.080 align:start position:0%
confusion around the language of that
 
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
but I will say that was the intent of
 
00:25:45.149 --> 00:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
those terms the thought of putting that
 
00:25:48.269 --> 00:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
language in in 2018 and the Department's
 
00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:51.320 align:start position:0%
application of that language since 2018
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
has been to say that individual
 
00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
employees if they wanted to could buy
 
00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:57.640 align:start position:0%
what you might consider these alter
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
alternative or premium options I did say
 
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
to representative Uka if we were going
 
00:26:05.149 --> 00:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
to bring up any type of concern or
 
00:26:07.549 --> 00:26:07.559 align:start position:0%
question relative to this language it
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
would just be in reference to the uh
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
inclusion of the language quote
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
including additional uniforms uh the
 
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
Department's one concern with that would
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
be is that if the employer is to say I
 
00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
want you to wear a t-shirt or a polo
 
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
shirt here is one uh polo shirt or one
 
00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
t-shirt and you're supposed to work five
 
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
or seven shifts a week that might become
 
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
impractical to the point where that
 
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
employee then has to go out and purchase
 
00:26:36.909 --> 00:26:36.919 align:start position:0%
additional uh uniforms in order to make
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
it work I would note and I'll be very
 
00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
candid in acknowledging that the
 
00:26:43.149 --> 00:26:43.159 align:start position:0%
language of the statute does not provide
 
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
a specific number which I think does
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
sometimes lead to issues of what is
 
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
enough because to representative yok's
 
00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
Point some employers might want to give
 
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
three and some employees might want to
 
00:26:57.789 --> 00:26:57.799 align:start position:0%
get eight I will say that uh that is
 
00:26:59.710 --> 00:26:59.720 align:start position:0%
been something that has come up in the
 
00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:02.360 align:start position:0%
past as a point of tension uh just how
 
00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
many should be provided in practice the
 
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
department tripic tries to say what is a
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
practical number whether that be three
 
00:27:13.389 --> 00:27:13.399 align:start position:0%
to five of whatever the Garment is um so
 
00:27:15.549 --> 00:27:15.559 align:start position:0%
I just point that out as as something
 
00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions that
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
folks have the one I did hear from
 
00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
representative Huff is was there or
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
could there be penalties If an employer
 
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
was in violation of this there could be
 
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
penalties the department has G General
 
00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
penalty Powers uh if there's a violation
 
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
of this uh of any of the laws under its
 
00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
title uh we could issue a fine uh and
 
00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
that would be after an initial warning
 
00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
and additionally if there were uh
 
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
uniforms purchased um outside of the
 
00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
bounds of this uh there could
 
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
potentially be a wage adjustment where
 
00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:50.120 align:start position:0%
the employee would be reimbursed for
 
00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.669 align:start position:0%
the employee would be reimbursed for
those

00:27:52.669 --> 00:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
purchases thank you represent ogon I do
 
00:27:57.789 --> 00:27:57.799 align:start position:0%
have two questions here in the room uh
 
00:27:59.870 --> 00:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
but I have a question first if I might
 
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
the fine would this fall under the
 
00:28:05.389 --> 00:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
clause in the law where the department
 
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
May fine up to
 
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
$2500 or is that yeah so that thank you
 
00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
for the CH uh question chairman the
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
general penalty powers of the department
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
it you can there can be a fine of up to
 
00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:18.200 align:start position:0%
$2500 per
 
00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
violation thank you I have a question
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
from representative turot representative
 
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh good to at
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
least hear you this morning Rudy you
 
00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
can't see you but uh thanks for coming
 
00:28:30.669 --> 00:28:30.679 align:start position:0%
on uh just uh two really quick questions
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
um the first one is how often do you
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
receive complaints on this section of
 
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
the uh the labor law and the second
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
question would be have you ever as a
 
00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
labor department to your knowledge ever
 
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
given out any
 
00:28:49.509 --> 00:28:49.519 align:start position:0%
penalties uh on this section so in terms
 
00:28:51.789 --> 00:28:51.799 align:start position:0%
of how common this is I do not think
 
00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's that common the instances I'm most
 
00:28:56.509 --> 00:28:56.519 align:start position:0%
directly aware of I won't name the
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
employers uh but we have done
 
00:29:00.669 --> 00:29:00.679 align:start position:0%
inspections and it's to the earlier
 
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
point on weather conditions where an
 
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
employer has said you know here's a polo
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
shirt but you always need to have a
 
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:10.360 align:start position:0%
company logo on now go out and uh you
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
know change the trash at the uh gas uh
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
pumps and it's you know 30 degrees out
 
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
so the people were buying sweatshirts
 
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
and jackets so it's most often come up
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
in those type of circumstances where
 
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
there's altered conditions they're
 
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
telling the people that they always have
 
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
to have a logo on in their only giving
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
him a t-shirt or a polo shirt in terms
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
of penalties I can get you the stats on
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
that we definitely have issued penalties
 
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
relative to this but again it's not all
 
00:29:39.509 --> 00:29:39.519 align:start position:0%
that frequent that we're citing uniform
 
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:43.640 align:start position:0%
law thank you thank you representative
 
00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
Huff I thought your hand my apolog I'm
 
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Seward word thank
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
00:29:52.509 --> 00:29:52.519 align:start position:0%
commissioner Ogden for for being here
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
today my question is as I look at this
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
language um also looked at the written
 
00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
testimony that the the sponsor provides
 
00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:07.240 align:start position:0%
us certainly seems to me that he's
 
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
addressing the same issue um that we
 
00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
addressed back in I believe 2018 was the
 
00:30:17.509 --> 00:30:17.519 align:start position:0%
year you said um and I I'd kind of like
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
to get your impression it is is that the
 
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
feeling you get that the issues that are
 
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
being identified now are the ones that
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
we did address in law and that maybe the
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
issue is communication to employers that
 
00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:38.559 align:start position:0%
there has been a change in law what was
 
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
not allowable in
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
2016 is allowable in 2021 do you have
 
00:30:47.549 --> 00:30:47.559 align:start position:0%
any feeling for that change and maybe
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
some of the impetus behind um a new bill
 
00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:53.919 align:start position:0%
on this subject um that's a fair point
 
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth I I definitely
 
00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
think that um if a large part of the
 
00:31:00.629 --> 00:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill was to address
 
00:31:04.029 --> 00:31:04.039 align:start position:0%
premium all or alternative options um as
 
00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:07.559 align:start position:0%
I noted earlier that was in 2018 what
 
00:31:09.549 --> 00:31:09.559 align:start position:0%
the language was supposed to do was to
 
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
allow for premium or alternative options
 
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
so certainly I believe that there's uh
 
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
that was intended to be addressed in
 
00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:19.559 align:start position:0%
2018 and as I've said since 2018 when
 
00:31:22.029 --> 00:31:22.039 align:start position:0%
we've conducted or looked at the any of
 
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
these issues we've applied it in the way
 
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
that an employer uh could have its
 
00:31:29.629 --> 00:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
employee purchase these premium or
 
00:31:29.639 --> 00:31:31.549 align:start position:0%
employee purchase these premium or
alternative

00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:31.559 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
00:31:34.629 --> 00:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
options thank you I don't see any hands
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
up are there any IND Representatives
 
00:31:41.509 --> 00:31:41.519 align:start position:0%

00:31:56.509 --> 00:31:56.519 align:start position:0%
remember this bill from 18 um could you
 
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
clarify if a um business issues a polo
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
with the logo on their shirt and then
 
00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
offers a fleece or a premium item maybe
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
out of their retail line that employees
 
00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.750 align:start position:0%
out of their retail line that employees
could

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
wear however but the employer does not
 
00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
mandate an outer covering with the logo
 
00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
on it would that violate this law it
 
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
would not correct that was the exam
 
00:32:24.269 --> 00:32:24.279 align:start position:0%
exact example that was discussed at
 
00:32:27.389 --> 00:32:27.399 align:start position:0%
testimony in 2018 was this example of
 
00:32:29.549 --> 00:32:29.559 align:start position:0%
they only ever need to wear the polo
 
00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
shirt but they the employee on their own
 
00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
says that they would rather wear the
 
00:32:38.909 --> 00:32:38.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%

for the online I don't know why it
 
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
didn't get me uh I intended to sign up
 
00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:23.800 align:start position:0%

for the mixup I am the sponsor of
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
hb303 um just for anybody watching
 
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
online I'm going to virtually remove
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
myself from the uh committee
 
00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
table uh we can't physically do that
 
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
here because of the locations of the
 
00:35:56.829 --> 00:35:56.839 align:start position:0%
microphones there's nowhere I could
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
really go away from the table and uh
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
still be picked up so um for the record
 
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
my name is representative Brian seaworth
 
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
I live in Pembrook I represent the um
 
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:15.640 align:start position:0%
District that includes Penbrook and Chai
 
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
Chester and I'm introducing this
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
bill as language that was suggested by
 
00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.150 align:start position:0%
bill as language that was suggested by
the

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
department and at the risk of being a
 
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
little verbose and I know imagine that
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
with me uh I'm I'm going to give a
 
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
little more background and that on this
 
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
bill because I know having worked on it
 
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh the language is sometimes confusing
 
00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
until you understand uh what we're
 
00:36:47.309 --> 00:36:47.319 align:start position:0%
trying to do here I'll start out the
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
point is not to change the effect of the
 
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
law in any way this is a housekeeping
 
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
update to existing law
 
00:36:59.710 --> 00:36:59.720 align:start position:0%
and it should not be changing how the
 
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
law actually works and there's one issue
 
00:37:04.309 --> 00:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
with that that I'm going to return to at
 
00:37:07.589 --> 00:37:07.599 align:start position:0%
the end um but where I want to start I
 
00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
did send around to the committee an
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
email that had some language in it from
 
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
a study committee that took place in the
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
previous session and um that was a study
 
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
committee in fact returning members not
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
only from last session but from two
 
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
sessions ago probably remember how we
 
00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:31.240 align:start position:0%
got this started uh last year this
 
00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
committee and then the house and then
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
the Senate formed a study committee to
 
00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:39.560 align:start position:0%
look at Labor statutes again the intent
 
00:37:43.309 --> 00:37:43.319 align:start position:0%
was to look at housekeeping issues not
 
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
looking at policy not looking at
 
00:37:48.589 --> 00:37:48.599 align:start position:0%
political uh issues but is there
 
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
language that is out of date or
 
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
inconsistent and needs to be
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
updated um I want to give some credit to
 
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
the wisdom of our previous chair
 
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan uh made the S
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
made two
 
00:38:08.109 --> 00:38:08.119 align:start position:0%
suggestions that a we limited the scope
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
of uh what that study committee focused
 
00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
on and two he suggested that rather than
 
00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:18.280 align:start position:0%
have members of this committee comb
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
through all the laws and try to
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
determine what was um problematic that
 
00:38:28.349 --> 00:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
we rely on the department of laor who
 
00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
knows all the issues and all the
 
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
language of these laws as well as
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
anybody for us where there might be
 
00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
problems and then
 
00:38:44.349 --> 00:38:44.359 align:start position:0%
the so we did that I think we had um a
 
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
successful particularly given some of
 
00:38:51.069 --> 00:38:51.079 align:start position:0%
the issues of of last year and this was
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
one of the bills that came out of that
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
committee recommended for further
 
00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.550 align:start position:0%
committee recommended for further
legislation

00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
um at this point what I want to do
 
00:39:04.589 --> 00:39:04.599 align:start position:0%
is talk a little bit about what the law
 
00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:08.079 align:start position:0%
does emphasizing that this bill won't
 
00:39:10.829 --> 00:39:10.839 align:start position:0%
change that so first of
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
all it does three things number one um
 
00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:18.599 align:start position:0%
it has been the law in New Hampshire for
 
00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
some 35 years and I I didn't know this
 
00:39:24.349 --> 00:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
except through my experience on the
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
committee um many of you probably know
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
this some don't but if you're an
 
00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:33.160 align:start position:0%
employee and you are called into work
 
00:39:35.069 --> 00:39:35.079 align:start position:0%
either is your scheduled to work or
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
you're you're called up and asked to
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
come in and you show up to work you must
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
be paid for two
 
00:39:46.109 --> 00:39:46.119 align:start position:0%
hours and that includes whether you work
 
00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:48.839 align:start position:0%
two hours and then get sent home or if
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
you're if I'm your employer and I say
 
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
listen I've got nothing for you to do
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
today just go home I still owe you two
 
00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
hour pay even if you haven't worked at
 
00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
all so that's what this law does number
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
two and and this went in at the time the
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
law was originally written there is an
 
00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
exception for municipal and County
 
00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:13.960 align:start position:0%
Employees um I actually put in a request
 
00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
to legislative research which hasn't
 
00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:20.200 align:start position:0%
been completed yet uh I imagine that
 
00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
this is a 28a issue that if we mandated
 
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
that uh subdivisions pay their
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
employees something extra the state
 
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
would have to fund the cost of of that
 
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
extra payment and I assume that's why
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
that's in here but in any case that
 
00:40:44.829 --> 00:40:44.839 align:start position:0%
provision applies to all employers
 
00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
except County and
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
Municipal third item and this was
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
introduced much more recently I believe
 
00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
2016 and addition exception was put into
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
place and this was for the ski
 
00:41:05.309 --> 00:41:05.319 align:start position:0%
Industries and snowboard and skiing
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
instructors they too have an exception
 
00:41:10.349 --> 00:41:10.359 align:start position:0%
but their exception is different in
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
their case
 
00:41:16.109 --> 00:41:16.119 align:start position:0%
um an employee can be paid for the two
 
00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:20.079 align:start position:0%
hours or can be given
 
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
um something in compensation that's
 
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
worth at least as much as the pay that
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
they are owed
 
00:41:29.069 --> 00:41:29.079 align:start position:0%
and fortunately on our uh study
 
00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
committee last year we had a
 
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
representative former representative
 
00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
canler had worked as a ski instructor so
 
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
he could help us on the committee
 
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
understand how this all works and why
 
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
it's actually uh something very welcome
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
by um instructors so I kind of put it in
 
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
my own
 
00:41:53.069 --> 00:41:53.079 align:start position:0%
terms the ski and snowboard instructors
 
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
that I know love that job they really
 
00:41:59.150 --> 00:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
love skiing they love snowboarding they
 
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
love teaching other people how to ski
 
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
and snowboard and yes they're working
 
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
for the money but I think many of them
 
00:42:08.829 --> 00:42:08.839 align:start position:0%
just getting out there and skiing is a
 
00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
much part of what why they do it as the
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
pay so you're scheduled to uh teach some
 
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
lessons you show up and there's no
 
00:42:20.349 --> 00:42:20.359 align:start position:0%
students so sorry you
 
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
know nothing for you to do here today um
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
if I'm your employer I'm going to say
 
00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
well I've got to pay you for two hours
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
so uh go over to the maintenance shed
 
00:42:34.109 --> 00:42:34.119 align:start position:0%
ask Jim if there's any anything you can
 
00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
have you do because I got to pay you
 
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
well that's not why a a ski instructor
 
00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
is doing that job and so it's actually a
 
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
much better deal for him to be give or
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
her to be given the day off and given
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
something typically uh lift tickets
 
00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
maybe for you and your family you and
 
00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
your friends that's worth more than the
 
00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
pay that that you didn't get
 
00:43:03.549 --> 00:43:03.559 align:start position:0%
um so you get to be skiing you get to
 
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
have a day off uh you get some
 
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
compensation what's not to like it works
 
00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
out for the employers
 
00:43:13.549 --> 00:43:13.559 align:start position:0%
too so that is all the existing law none
 
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
of that this bill
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
changes what this bill does change is
 
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Labor found the
 
00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:22.630 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Labor found the
very

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
occasional and uh I I won't
 
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
I seem to remember one or two I may be
 
00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
misremembering that um Town employees or
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
maybe County employees have contacted
 
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor and said it says
 
00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:41.720 align:start position:0%
here I get lift
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
tickets know where where is that and it
 
00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:48.079 align:start position:0%
if you through this in terms of the
 
00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
history of the how the law was written
 
00:43:53.309 --> 00:43:53.319 align:start position:0%
uh the intent of the law that doesn't
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
make any sense but if you just read the
 
00:43:59.549 --> 00:43:59.559 align:start position:0%
text as it's currently in the RSA yes
 
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
you can get that that the exception for
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
um employees of counties or
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities includes other
 
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
compensation that is at least equal to
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
the rate of pay uh so what this language
 
00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
does is clearly separates those two
 
00:44:18.549 --> 00:44:18.559 align:start position:0%
Clauses makes it clear that there's one
 
00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
exception Municipal and County there's a
 
00:44:25.549 --> 00:44:25.559 align:start position:0%
second exception that's different um for
 
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
snow Bo and ski
 
00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
instructors otherwise it doesn't change
 
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
things at
 
00:44:35.309 --> 00:44:35.319 align:start position:0%
all one last point I said there was an
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
issue with that and
 
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
um Mr berky I don't he I see he didn't
 
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:44.680 align:start position:0%
sign up to testify but he might be
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
available for questions contacted me and
 
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
said I see you're expanding our uh
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
exception that's great but I don't know
 
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
why you did that and I said
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
I didn't and then between some
 
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:03.400 align:start position:0%
discussions uh we we brought in uh
 
00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner Ogden and sure
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
enough there is a subtle difference in
 
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
if for those of you that are looking at
 
00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
your copy of the bill between the
 
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
language that struck and the language
 
00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
that's added back in the word instructor
 
00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:21.880 align:start position:0%
was left out and
 
00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:25.160 align:start position:0%
so not my intention at all not what I
 
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
want to do with this bill it could be
 
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
interpreted as changing the scope to
 
00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
which this
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
applies um and so I would now having
 
00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
this brought to my
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
intention um during the executive SE
 
00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
session I would propose an amendment
 
00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
that makes sure that that instructor
 
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:47.839 align:start position:0%
that comes
 
00:45:51.069 --> 00:45:51.079 align:start position:0%
between uh it's actually instructional
 
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
snowboard instructional
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
employees um that instructional should
 
00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
be inserted in the new language between
 
00:46:01.349 --> 00:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
snowboard and employees as
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
well um and that I believe would
 
00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
keep effect of the RSA exactly as it is
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
today but
 
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
clarify uh the legislative intent to be
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
what I think we all understand it as and
 
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
what how the department interprets it
 
00:46:23.349 --> 00:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative seart we have
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
any questions for
 
00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.670 align:start position:0%
any questions for
representative

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
I don't see any on my screen are there
 
00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:33.800 align:start position:0%
any questions in the committee room Mr
 
00:46:36.109 --> 00:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
Sullivan none but okay I'm told to Mr
 
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.349 align:start position:0%
 
Sullivan

00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
Sullivan
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
unmute got it um I I I raised my hand
 
00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
before representative seaworth um uh
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
indicated the his intent to amend and I
 
00:46:56.069 --> 00:46:56.079 align:start position:0%
guess I would just uh say this is u i
 
00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:57.720 align:start position:0%
I'm comfortable with the amendment that
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
M representative seaworth has proposed
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
and I would strongly urge that to uh
 
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:04.910 align:start position:0%
and I would strongly urge that to uh
move

00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
move
 
00:47:07.069 --> 00:47:07.079 align:start position:0%
forward I do have a
 
00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
question I gu that's not a question
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
sorry fine I do have a question just for
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
the committee as a whole I did receive
 
00:47:17.069 --> 00:47:17.079 align:start position:0%
an email last night Brian seor I'm not
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
sure if it from you or from um from Mr
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
berky um about this am I the only one
 
00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:24.079 align:start position:0%
that received that or did everyone has
 
00:47:26.829 --> 00:47:26.839 align:start position:0%
received that and that
 
00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:31.960 align:start position:0%
if I may clarify that came um it was
 
00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:36.079 align:start position:0%
between you and I uh commissioner Ogden
 
00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
and Mr berky and trying to clarify all
 
00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
recognizing this missing word want to
 
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
make sure I didn't know who who had
 
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
received it any other questions in the
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:54.720 --> 00:48:00.950 align:start position:0%
 
Callum

00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:03.309 --> 00:48:03.319 align:start position:0%
I can't hear we can't hear the audio in
 
00:48:05.549 --> 00:48:05.559 align:start position:0%
the commit room if you would move to a
 
00:48:07.549 --> 00:48:07.559 align:start position:0%
microphone that would be
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
great can you explain can you hear me
 
00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.390 align:start position:0%
great can you explain can you hear me
now

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
better I I'll repeat the question too
 
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
if okay if there's an issue can you
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
explain why there would be an exception
 
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.309 align:start position:0%
explain why there would be an exception
for

00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
County and
 
00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:29.750 align:start position:0%
County and
municipality

00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
and what a likely exception would be so
 
00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
the question is can I explain why there
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
is an exception and what that exception
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
might apply to and um I would say let's
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
re when uh commissioner
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
Ogden is testifying because he will have
 
00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
a better answer than I do
 
00:48:58.910 --> 00:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
as to the why as I said during my
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
testimony I believe it's a 28a issue
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
that if we place a mandate on the towns
 
00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:49:11.789 --> 00:49:11.799 align:start position:0%
counties uh which cost them money the
 
00:49:15.309 --> 00:49:15.319 align:start position:0%
Constitution requires that the state Al
 
00:49:19.309 --> 00:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
fund that cost and I I this actually if
 
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
you look at the timing this came in
 
00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:24.440 align:start position:0%
right after that Amendment the people
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
passed that Amendment to the
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
Constitution so I'm imagining that the
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
legislature was very aware of of
 
00:49:34.829 --> 00:49:34.839 align:start position:0%
possible violations and that's how it
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
came in as far as uh when this could
 
00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:42.200 align:start position:0%
happen we honestly
 
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
didn't get into that in detail because
 
00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:49.960 align:start position:0%
again the the focus of that this is not
 
00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
to revisit that policy as much as
 
00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
clarify the language to mat the policy
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
in my own head I imagine things like
 
00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
um a snowplow crew that gets notified
 
00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
well there's going to be a big storm
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
tonight you guys have to be in we're
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
going to plow all night and then it
 
00:50:16.109 --> 00:50:16.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't snow and and you might never be
 
00:50:19.069 --> 00:50:19.079 align:start position:0%
required to do any work that would seem
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
to be the kind of thing where where this
 
00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
might apply the other thing that I'll
 
00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
imagine is it's it's an exception to the
 
00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
requirement but it doesn't mean that
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
every town or every County actually uses
 
00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:37.400 align:start position:0%
it so I would imagine um that many
 
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
employees who are under a contract that
 
00:50:43.549 --> 00:50:43.559 align:start position:0%
contract might specify how this is done
 
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
um other towns or counties may as of a
 
00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
matter of policy say even though we're
 
00:50:51.789 --> 00:50:51.799 align:start position:0%
exempt from this law we follow it so
 
00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:56.440 align:start position:0%
again uh commissioner Ogden May
 
00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
practical answer those are my thoughts
 
00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you questions on
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
Zoom any hands maybe I turn my
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
microphone on again do I see any
 
00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
additional hands um via
 
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
to Ogden to testify on behalf of the
 
00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
bill hi thank you chairman uh Rudy Ogden
 
00:51:27.309 --> 00:51:27.319 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Labor just to Echo
 
00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:29.240 align:start position:0%
uh the what was put forth by
 
00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:31.480 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth uh this is a
 
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
bill that since its passage in
 
00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
2016 um we had had some concerns at the
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
department again just not knowing uh how
 
00:51:41.789 --> 00:51:41.799 align:start position:0%
we would look to say that Folks at the
 
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
counties or municipalities were going to
 
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
get uh you know additional or
 
00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
alternative compensation so it's just
 
00:51:50.829 --> 00:51:50.839 align:start position:0%
been something that we have um since
 
00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:54.520 align:start position:0%
2016 looked at as a potential concern um
 
00:51:56.309 --> 00:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
not understanding fully how we would
 
00:51:58.430 --> 00:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
apply it in terms of the questions that
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
were just asked uh representative
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
seaworth um I think spoke to it quite
 
00:52:05.069 --> 00:52:05.079 align:start position:0%
well that when this would come up it
 
00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
would be exactly those instances in
 
00:52:09.549 --> 00:52:09.559 align:start position:0%
which someone's asked to report to work
 
00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
when they report to work they are then
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
told okay go home um and they've uh been
 
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
there for less than two hours um his
 
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
point is also a good one that many
 
00:52:20.309 --> 00:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
counties and municipalities their
 
00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:22.280 align:start position:0%
employees do operate under collectively
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
bargained agreements and those
 
00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:25.880 align:start position:0%
collectively bargained agreements at
 
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
times speak to show up pay or other such
 
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
protections um so again I'm happy to
 
00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
take any questions uh but in general the
 
00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
department with uh the amendment that
 
00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth uh discussed uh
 
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
we would look at this as a way of
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
clarifying um some confusion that's been
 
00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
put into the law thank
 
00:52:50.589 --> 00:52:50.599 align:start position:0%

00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
information that's provided by the

00:56:59.870 --> 00:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
else I figured it's best that that goes
 
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
through our assistant now maybe I'm
 
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
going to be told that that's not correct
 
00:57:05.109 --> 00:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
but the goal is to have written
 
00:57:07.789 --> 00:57:07.799 align:start position:0%
testimony being presented prior to
 
00:57:09.870 --> 00:57:09.880 align:start position:0%
hearing about a half an hour before the
 
00:57:12.190 --> 00:57:12.200 align:start position:0%
hearing I received these sheets here
 
00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
these are all the individuals that have
 
00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
um logged in and said there would either
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
like to speak and if they would not like
 
00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
to speak whether they're in favor or
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
against uh and so far this worked pretty
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
well I have a good list on every single
 
00:57:28.829 --> 00:57:28.839 align:start position:0%
Le bill um I am not aware of any written
 
00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
testimony uh but again these are some of
 
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
the more simple bills that we have today
 
00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
as we get into think a little more uh
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
involved legislation in the next two or
 
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
three meetings um hopefully people will
 
00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
present them and they will be emailed to
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
everyone but I will confirm that for you
 
00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:47.960 align:start position:0%
at the lunch break uh representative
 
00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
buuy and uh get back to the committee
 
00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:54.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman welcome any
 
00:57:55.549 --> 00:57:55.559 align:start position:0%
other question questions of the chair
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
from the committee members on anything
 
00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:13.400 align:start position:0%
such so what do you think so far
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
guys not the way I like it call me an
 
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
old traditionalist like it's the old
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
fashioned way but I want to make's
 
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
comfortable it seems to
 
00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:33.430 align:start position:0%
comfortable it seems to
work

00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry was there another comment from
 
00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
the uh folks on Zoom yeah I did I just
 
00:58:41.109 --> 00:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
thank I'll be talking with her
 
00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:48.280 align:start position:0%
afterwards to see whether or not like in
 
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
the next meeting with my laptop here
 
00:58:53.589 --> 00:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
I'll be able to exactly what she
 
00:58:57.789 --> 00:58:57.799 align:start position:0%
do um as they run short on possible uh
 
00:58:59.589 --> 00:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
Personnel that we would be able to
 
00:59:02.349 --> 00:59:02.359 align:start position:0%
manage it to the the best
 
00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
see I said I went online a couple nights
 
00:59:12.029 --> 00:59:12.039 align:start position:0%
ago and I there's a lot of people on um
 
00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:17.000 align:start position:0%
YouTube how to use this and I most very
 
00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
the rudimentary stuff I didn't see
 
00:59:22.109 --> 00:59:22.119 align:start position:0%
anything that explains to me how behind
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
the scenes to to know how to move
 
00:59:26.589 --> 00:59:26.599 align:start position:0%
someone from participant to whatever and
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:36.839 align:start position:0%
on well quite frankly I was on a uh I
 
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
was in front of the um lonia Town
 
00:59:41.589 --> 00:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
Council earlier in the week and so I got
 
00:59:43.589 --> 00:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
to see it from a
 
00:59:45.789 --> 00:59:45.799 align:start position:0%
standpoint of me being the member of the
 
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
public speaking on but apparently my
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
computer has not the the best upgrade
 
00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
that I need to the newest Zoom so I they
 
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
weren't able to hear me so that
 
01:00:00.349 --> 01:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
individual knew the moderator knew that
 
01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
I needed the newest Zoom thing and said
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
well I have to move him this gentleman
 
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
to a participant so he can speak was all
 
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
the seene which isn't necessarily what
 
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
we want to do because you don't want
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
anyone to do anything unsightly in the
 
01:00:19.069 --> 01:00:19.079 align:start position:0%
background is learning all the different
 
01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:23.559 align:start position:0%
um that are it's quite me when you take
 
01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:25.000 align:start position:0%
down the layers of all different things
 
01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:26.440 align:start position:0%
in Zoom it is kind of cool what they
 
01:00:28.990 --> 01:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
developed give credit for
 
01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:32.680 align:start position:0%
that right it is 10 o' on the Node CL
 
01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
walked out of the room
 
01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to wait a second
 
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
um sorry we're going to wait one more
 
01:00:42.190 --> 01:00:42.200 align:start position:0%
minute you went to get some water or
 
01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
fine okay I am going to open the hearing
 
01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:53.559 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 301 relative to
 
01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
compensation appeals board and I
 
01:00:59.710 --> 01:00:59.720 align:start position:0%
recognize representative seor
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
introduces thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:01:05.589 --> 01:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
again apologies for not getting my uh my
 
01:01:07.069 --> 01:01:07.079 align:start position:0%
sign up done
 
01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:09.640 align:start position:0%
correctly um thank you to the committee
 
01:01:14.029 --> 01:01:14.039 align:start position:0%
for uh hearing this bill this is
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
a another bill uh a set of language
 
01:01:21.309 --> 01:01:21.319 align:start position:0%
that's associated with that labor
 
01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:24.680 align:start position:0%
statute study committee in this case as
 
01:01:28.829 --> 01:01:28.839 align:start position:0%
I said we narrowed the focus of um the
 
01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
rsas that we looked at in this that
 
01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
committee and the Department of Labor
 
01:01:36.990 --> 01:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
provided us a number of other issues
 
01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:39.400 align:start position:0%
that they' identified but were outside
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
our scope um so we accepted that
 
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
language but we didn't really discuss it
 
01:01:48.109 --> 01:01:48.119 align:start position:0%
and this is one of those where the
 
01:01:53.029 --> 01:01:53.039 align:start position:0%
department um forwarded some suggested
 
01:01:55.029 --> 01:01:55.039 align:start position:0%
language to improve in
 
01:01:55.039 --> 01:01:57.029 align:start position:0%
language to improve in
RSA

01:01:57.029 --> 01:01:57.039 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
um but it was outside the scope of the
 
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
committee so I have simply submited
 
01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:03.829 align:start position:0%
committee so I have simply submited
their

01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
suggestion uh as a bill in this case
 
01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
it's very simple what it
 
01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.750 align:start position:0%
it's very simple what it
does

01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
um it this applies to the attorney
 
01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
members of the compensation appeals
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
board right now the
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
language um identifies a perdum rate
 
01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
for when they're working the change
 
01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:31.640 align:start position:0%
language would clarify that when they're
 
01:02:34.029 --> 01:02:34.039 align:start position:0%
at hearings and they're taking a whole
 
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
day they get paid the perum rate if
 
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
they're doing other work that doesn't
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
take a whole day then the per DM is
 
01:02:45.549 --> 01:02:45.559 align:start position:0%
pro-rated to an hourly rate and they get
 
01:02:48.309 --> 01:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
paid only for the work that they've done
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
again I don't believe and I don't
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
believe the department believes this is
 
01:02:58.510 --> 01:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
a policy change um rather
 
01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.670 align:start position:0%
a policy change um rather
it's

01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh getting specific about a possible
 
01:03:07.789 --> 01:03:07.799 align:start position:0%
ambiguity in the way a
 
01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:10.839 align:start position:0%
perum might be applied if you are not
 
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
working a whole
 
01:03:20.829 --> 01:03:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:23.549 --> 01:03:23.559 align:start position:0%
questions here I'm going to go with
 
01:03:23.559 --> 01:03:25.069 align:start position:0%
questions here I'm going to go with
representative

01:03:25.069 --> 01:03:25.079 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
and then representative suan
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman
 
01:03:32.349 --> 01:03:32.359 align:start position:0%
than I think I think I see Mr Ward's uh
 
01:03:32.359 --> 01:03:36.230 align:start position:0%
than I think I think I see Mr Ward's uh
hand

01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:40.269 align:start position:0%
 
first

01:03:40.269 --> 01:03:40.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
thank my question becomes if we're going
 
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
to be prating for
 
01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
how thank you representative for your
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
question that is an excellent question
 
01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
that I don't have the full answer to
 
01:04:13.269 --> 01:04:13.279 align:start position:0%
because I imagine that
 
01:04:18.269 --> 01:04:18.279 align:start position:0%
um a day of hearings is not a a clock in
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
clock out 8 hour work day um so I would
 
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
ask that you save that question for
 
01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:27.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner Ogden and get some
 
01:04:30.430 --> 01:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
clarification from him we'll do
 
01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839 align:start position:0%
representative I think I've got a s
 
01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
similar question so um but I I'll I'll
 
01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
state it and then maybe also reserve it
 
01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
for um um the Deputy Commissioner but um
 
01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
the way I read this it sounds like if an
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
attorney um goes to a hearing regardless
 
01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
of if it's a quarter day half
 
01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
day or full day they get their um
 
01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
prum because it's the new language
 
01:05:04.589 --> 01:05:04.599 align:start position:0%
refers to other related work not the
 
01:05:08.829 --> 01:05:08.839 align:start position:0%
hearings so um I guess my question is
 
01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
whether or not um a an attorney would be
 
01:05:14.589 --> 01:05:14.599 align:start position:0%
paid a full PDM anytime he or she
 
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
attended a
 
01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
hearing thank you representative for
 
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
your question and yes I read the
 
01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
language as you've just described and
 
01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
again I I the key point to me is I don't
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
believe this change is
 
01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
intended to uh change our current policy
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
so the way it works under the existing
 
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.750 align:start position:0%
so the way it works under the existing
language

01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:45.160 align:start position:0%
is um if you're assigned to and attend
 
01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:48.200 align:start position:0%
hearings you get paid the perdum rate
 
01:05:50.269 --> 01:05:50.279 align:start position:0%
for the day that you go to hearings and
 
01:05:53.309 --> 01:05:53.319 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't matter how many hearings
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
you hear or or whether that takes part
 
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
of a day or an entire day so yes I my
 
01:06:02.829 --> 01:06:02.839 align:start position:0%
understanding of the change language is
 
01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
it would preserve that policy for
 
01:06:10.269 --> 01:06:10.279 align:start position:0%
hearings um and only apply the pr rating
 
01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
to other work thank
 
01:06:17.069 --> 01:06:17.079 align:start position:0%
you right representative Warden thank
 
01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
you representative seaworth is this
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
pration based on an8 hour day so that
 
01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
for example if the attorneys get $400
 
01:06:28.829 --> 01:06:28.839 align:start position:0%
per DM if they're doing work outside of
 
01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
a hearing it'd be divide by eight and
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:36.589 --> 01:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
hour thank you representative for the
 
01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
question and um until the questions
 
01:06:43.269 --> 01:06:43.279 align:start position:0%
start coming I I would have thought well
 
01:06:45.630 --> 01:06:45.640 align:start position:0%
yes of course that would be how to
 
01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
interpret it but now that I think about
 
01:06:52.349 --> 01:06:52.359 align:start position:0%
it I realize that is up for uh
 
01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
interpretation so
 
01:06:58.470 --> 01:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
once again I uh encourage you to Reas
 
01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
your question to commissioner Ogden when
 
01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:02.630 align:start position:0%
your question to commissioner Ogden when
he

01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
he
 
01:07:06.190 --> 01:07:06.200 align:start position:0%
testifies are there any other questions
 
01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:13.160 align:start position:0%
Zoom I don't see any except someone has
 
01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
a white piece of paper up I don't know
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
if that's a message to me or
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
not sorry that was representative
 
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
sorry on camera okay I see no other
 
01:07:26.430 --> 01:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
questions online I have any other
 
01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
questions for represent cworth in the in
 
01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:32.359 align:start position:0%
room seeing none thank you
 
01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
representative seaward I call um Rudy
 
01:07:38.269 --> 01:07:38.279 align:start position:0%
Ogden from the Department of
 
01:07:42.069 --> 01:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
Labor thank you chairman infantine um in
 
01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:44.200 align:start position:0%
terms of context for this just one thing
 
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
I would point out the compensation
 
01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
appeals board is a separate and distinct
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
board from the Department of Labor they
 
01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
are administratively attached to the
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor and what that means
 
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
is we provide certain administrative
 
01:07:58.390 --> 01:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
support namely and perhaps most
 
01:08:01.589 --> 01:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
importantly the processing of pay so the
 
01:08:04.029 --> 01:08:04.039 align:start position:0%
Genesis of this request or the Genesis
 
01:08:06.029 --> 01:08:06.039 align:start position:0%
of this cleanup was this was actually
 
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
something that was looked at by the LBA
 
01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
some time ago uh the compensation
 
01:08:12.829 --> 01:08:12.839 align:start position:0%
appeals board has been in place for over
 
01:08:16.189 --> 01:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
30 years and for 30 years the way that
 
01:08:19.390 --> 01:08:19.400 align:start position:0%
those uh individuals have been paid is
 
01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
that if they come in and do a hearing
 
01:08:24.510 --> 01:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
they get the full per DM rate if they
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
are reading uh looking at a medical
 
01:08:29.550 --> 01:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
packet if they're writing a decision if
 
01:08:31.309 --> 01:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
they're talking amongst the members
 
01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
because these boards are all three they
 
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
hold uh hearings in three panel boards
 
01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
three member panels excuse me um but if
 
01:08:41.709 --> 01:08:41.719 align:start position:0%
they're doing any of that other work uh
 
01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
what they would do is they would take
 
01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
the the full per DM rate and they would
 
01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
divide by eight and say okay this is an
 
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
hourly rate and then what they would do
 
01:08:53.470 --> 01:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
is submit that to the department and
 
01:08:56.229 --> 01:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
that is how the department has processed
 
01:08:58.510 --> 01:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
um pay to the compensation appeals board
 
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
members again going back to I believe
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
1990 or
 
01:09:06.749 --> 01:09:06.759 align:start position:0%
1991 it's some time ago so this was
 
01:09:08.910 --> 01:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
something that the LBA had pointed out
 
01:09:11.149 --> 01:09:11.159 align:start position:0%
and said relative to the processing of
 
01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:13.759 align:start position:0%
this payroll you should probably look at
 
01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
having the statute adjusted um so I
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
don't know if that answers all of the
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
questions but essentially what the
 
01:09:21.749 --> 01:09:21.759 align:start position:0%
thought is is to again not change the
 
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
way that any of these folks are actually
 
01:09:26.349 --> 01:09:26.359 align:start position:0%
getting paid is to just have the statute
 
01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
reflect the fact that this is how these
 
01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
individuals turn their time in they turn
 
01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
it in and they'll say okay it was a
 
01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%
hearing day or they'll turn it in and
 
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
they'll say um you know I worked on a
 
01:09:39.789 --> 01:09:39.799 align:start position:0%
decision for two hours or I reviewed
 
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
medical packets for two hours or things
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:50.430 --> 01:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
nature thank you Mr Ogden representative
 
01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
turkot does that answer your question
 
01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:54.229 align:start position:0%
turkot does that answer your question
actually

01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
would like to speak to it thank you Mr
 
01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you uh Deputy
 
01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
Commissioner um you did answer the
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
question but as we're Mak an attempt to
 
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
change and clarify language now I think
 
01:10:11.669 --> 01:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
it would be possibly a great opportunity
 
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
to clarify it into the RSA rather than
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
leaving it as an administrative rule
 
01:10:19.310 --> 01:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes would you be opposed
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
to when this comes back for exe
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:27.400 align:start position:0%
um clarifying it a little bit better
 
01:10:30.270 --> 01:10:30.280 align:start position:0%
down to what your hourly
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
rate actually
 
01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
is no we would be happy to consider any
 
01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
of those I will say that the language
 
01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
surrounding this largely results from
 
01:10:41.709 --> 01:10:41.719 align:start position:0%
discussions or findings we had seen from
 
01:10:43.950 --> 01:10:43.960 align:start position:0%
the LBA so if there's a way to even
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
improve upon that and make it clearer
 
01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
for everyone we would uh be in full
 
01:10:50.189 --> 01:10:50.199 align:start position:0%
support of
 
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
that representative Sullivan did that
 
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
answer your previous question
 
01:10:57.630 --> 01:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm fine thank you representative
 
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
Warden thank you another thing that
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
comes up is what if they work more than
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
eight hours in a day is it still
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
pro-rated they could earn more than they
 
01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
would have for the standard uh per DM
 
01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:12.270 align:start position:0%
would have for the standard uh per DM
for

01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:12.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
example um in practice I believe for
 
01:11:16.990 --> 01:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
that other prated work I don't know that
 
01:11:19.470 --> 01:11:19.480 align:start position:0%
we've ever seen someone put in more than
 
01:11:22.510 --> 01:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
eight hours uh to your point I imagine
 
01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
then that that would be able to they
 
01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
would just be getting that rate for more
 
01:11:27.790 --> 01:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
than eight hours but I will be honest in
 
01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
that any other questions on Zoom
 
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative kahill I see yes thank
 
01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you uh Deputy
 
01:11:43.709 --> 01:11:43.719 align:start position:0%
ogon uh should we add the the eight hour
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
as the as the standard and the basis of
 
01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:47.950 align:start position:0%
as the as the standard and the basis of
the

01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:47.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
pum to uh my earlier response to
 
01:11:53.629 --> 01:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
representative turot if if if it's found
 
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
to be clear to you whatever is is I I
 
01:11:58.229 --> 01:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
think the best product if that clarifies
 
01:12:00.669 --> 01:12:00.679 align:start position:0%
any confusion that folks have I think
 
01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
that would be worthwhile yes thank
 
01:12:07.629 --> 01:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:15.960 align:start position:0%

individuals with their hands raised that
 
01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
would like to speak on behalf

01:26:59.709 --> 01:26:59.719 align:start position:0%
testify on any other
 
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
bill cuz I'm trying to figure out
 
01:27:03.149 --> 01:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
whether you can submit I was just
 
01:27:04.870 --> 01:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
talking to Heather our assistant to
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
figure out how to do the written
 
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
testimony she talked about everyone
 
01:27:10.830 --> 01:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
really needs to go on the website and
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
hit all and send an email to all of the
 
01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
Reps to get us the written testimony
 
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
that way it'll also get to the clerk um
 
01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
but she asked she hadn't logged on
 
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
either and I have but I didn't look to
 
01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
see so yeah I haven't submitted anything
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
yet so you when you I don't know whether
 
01:27:33.390 --> 01:27:33.400 align:start position:0%
when you sign up this list I'm getting
 
01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
here you know whether or not you can
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
submit WR testimony through through that
 
01:27:42.830 --> 01:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
mechanism where you have to just do it
 
01:27:51.109 --> 01:27:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.119 --> 01:27:53.870 align:start position:0%
 
all

01:27:53.870 --> 01:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
you the designated driver
 
01:28:02.990 --> 01:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
lot yeah know it works but I'm not there
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
mentally I read something recently where
 
01:28:13.390 --> 01:28:13.400 align:start position:0%
something like uh 75% of communication
 
01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:14.390 align:start position:0%
something like uh 75% of communication
is

01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:28:17.149 --> 01:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
Visual and while this is better than a
 
01:28:17.159 --> 01:28:18.430 align:start position:0%
Visual and while this is better than a
conference

01:28:18.430 --> 01:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
conference
 
01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
call um the technology is pretty damn
 
01:28:25.149 --> 01:28:25.159 align:start position:0%
good give it that but it just
 
01:28:28.189 --> 01:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
not yeah no it's it's better to focus on
 
01:28:29.550 --> 01:28:29.560 align:start position:0%
stuff when you're
 
01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:31.709 align:start position:0%
stuff when you're
actually

01:28:31.709 --> 01:28:31.719 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:28:34.270 --> 01:28:34.280 align:start position:0%
there yeah we I picked the really simple
 
01:28:36.550 --> 01:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
ones today that I knew would be just a
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
very few people testifying we can kind
 
01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
of get this under our belt but if if
 
01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
you're in finance and if you're in some
 
01:28:46.669 --> 01:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
ways and means or maybe I guess they had
 
01:28:48.390 --> 01:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
a really big Bill and just yesterday was
 
01:28:50.430 --> 01:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
a marijuana thing and there's so many
 
01:28:52.270 --> 01:28:52.280 align:start position:0%
moving parts to some of these cars are
 
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
simple usually cleanups are the one
 
01:28:57.990 --> 01:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
simple part of a piece of legislation uh
 
01:28:59.229 --> 01:28:59.239 align:start position:0%
some of these other committies Commerce
 
01:29:02.109 --> 01:29:02.119 align:start position:0%
they got 46 bills we have
 
01:29:07.310 --> 01:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
16 um I you know tough and up yeah I've
 
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
been around here couple times when
 
01:29:10.270 --> 01:29:10.280 align:start position:0%
Commerce had so much going on they
 
01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
separated their their committee you know
 
01:29:15.109 --> 01:29:15.119 align:start position:0%
they took half a committee in one room
 
01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:16.360 align:start position:0%
and half a committee in the other room
 
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
to hear enough
 
01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
bills um so I I've always thought like
 
01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
they have fin
 
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
division one and two that they either
 
01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
need to find a way to Sugar off some
 
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
bills cuz sometimes they get some of our
 
01:29:31.229 --> 01:29:31.239 align:start position:0%
bills that we really should have here in
 
01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
Labor uh or they just have to have
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
Commerce one and commerce 2 you
 
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
know it's not like we can't sacrifice
 
01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
another 20 members take one off each
 
01:29:42.159 --> 01:29:43.629 align:start position:0%
another 20 members take one off each
committee

01:29:43.629 --> 01:29:43.639 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
right I think it it prudes some people
 
01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
cuz some people get burnt out being on
 
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
that committee for more than a couple
 
01:29:55.510 --> 01:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:57.430 --> 01:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
sorry I know you're working on J sorry
 
01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:37.730 align:start position:0%
 
sure

01:30:37.730 --> 01:30:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:37.740 --> 01:31:21.030 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:22.709 --> 01:31:22.719 align:start position:0%
you see where these kids uh you know
 
01:31:24.030 --> 01:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
fourth graders they learn about the
 
01:31:25.390 --> 01:31:25.400 align:start position:0%
state house and they usually bring them
 
01:31:27.629 --> 01:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
up here for a tour and it gets a little
 
01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
foolish after a while you know some
 
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
teachers think hey we should have a
 
01:31:32.030 --> 01:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation we should submit
 
01:31:34.830 --> 01:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
it's always you know the state with the
 
01:31:36.510 --> 01:31:36.520 align:start position:0%
state dist you see that the one
 
01:31:38.350 --> 01:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
yesterday the state
 
01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
ARA the state spider oh yeah I saw that
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
are they doing like state house visits
 
01:31:46.189 --> 01:31:46.199 align:start position:0%
later in the year or they doing them
 
01:31:48.750 --> 01:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
like I hope so virtually or I don't know
 
01:31:50.109 --> 01:31:50.119 align:start position:0%
what they're doing I really would you
 
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
know I remember I was in back then and I
 
01:31:55.669 --> 01:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
I did the tour of here you know and I
 
01:31:58.430 --> 01:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
remember that um cuz we got lost in the
 
01:31:59.669 --> 01:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
tunnel we
 
01:32:03.709 --> 01:32:03.719 align:start position:0%
know we were on but um I hope
 
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
that you know obviously all field trips
 
01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:07.350 align:start position:0%
that you know obviously all field trips
are

01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:32:09.669 --> 01:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
probably Kash right now but I'm really
 
01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
hoping come April or May possibly you
 
01:32:17.229 --> 01:32:17.239 align:start position:0%
know if enough of our population is
 
01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
vaccinated uh that they can
 
01:32:22.149 --> 01:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
feel if they're going to go back to live
 
01:32:24.629 --> 01:32:24.639 align:start position:0%
in school again that they can feel
 
01:32:26.109 --> 01:32:26.119 align:start position:0%
comfortable coming up here even if the
 
01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
Public's not here and it's just all the
 
01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:30.950 align:start position:0%
Public's not here and it's just all the
representatives

01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:32:33.109 --> 01:32:33.119 align:start position:0%
um but you know we'll see you know what
 
01:32:35.070 --> 01:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
are they when middle of marks they're
 
01:32:37.870 --> 01:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
hoping to have everyone 65 and
 
01:32:41.470 --> 01:32:41.480 align:start position:0%
over and the mark state by state I um no
 
01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
at least yeah here
 
01:32:46.109 --> 01:32:46.119 align:start position:0%
yeah so if we can get everyone over 65
 
01:32:46.119 --> 01:32:46.830 align:start position:0%
yeah so if we can get everyone over 65
and

01:32:46.830 --> 01:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
older by the end of March you start
 
01:32:53.870 --> 01:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
getting into 50 olders April and May
 
01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
yeah I know I know the only state so far
 
01:32:59.030 --> 01:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's gotten their nursing home
 
01:33:01.790 --> 01:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
population done has been West Virginia
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
but they didn't sign that CBS walens AG
 
01:33:09.870 --> 01:33:09.880 align:start position:0%
oh so yeah I always thought that you
 
01:33:13.470 --> 01:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
know yeah well like nursing home
 
01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
residents are sedentary they're not
 
01:33:19.149 --> 01:33:19.159 align:start position:0%
going anywhere show up at the nursing
 
01:33:23.189 --> 01:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
home and start stabbing folks
 
01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
you don't need to shill it
 
01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
out Walgreens to keep track of
 
01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
it agreed since they already have their
 
01:33:33.669 --> 01:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:35.709 --> 01:33:35.719 align:start position:0%
anyway yeah there's some things that I
 
01:33:40.030 --> 01:33:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
differently but I mean we like I think
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
we lost it was some awful number like a
 
01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
fifth of the residents at the uh
 
01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:49.430 align:start position:0%
fifth of the residents at the uh
veterans

01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
veterans
 
01:33:52.590 --> 01:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
home so you what T me the most about the
 
01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:53.669 align:start position:0%
home so you what T me the most about the
whole

01:33:53.669 --> 01:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
whole
 
01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
thing my my father-in-law is in a
 
01:33:58.070 --> 01:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
nursing home right
 
01:34:03.390 --> 01:34:03.400 align:start position:0%
now and um he's had his he did get it he
 
01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
survived and he's had his now his two
 
01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
shots but we couldn't see
 
01:34:10.590 --> 01:34:10.600 align:start position:0%
him you know when they shut stuff down
 
01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
in March we haven't been able to see him
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
we had a couple visits in the summer we
 
01:34:17.910 --> 01:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
could go outside 10 ft away in the tent
 
01:34:21.550 --> 01:34:21.560 align:start position:0%
we all had that m whatever uh her
 
01:34:23.629 --> 01:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
birthday in November he was in the other
 
01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
side of a glass sliding glass door and
 
01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
and what have you so what irritates me
 
01:34:32.030 --> 01:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
is that those people in the nursing
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
home got Co they got it from the staff
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
yeah and I don't know maybe I'm an old
 
01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
fashioned but Jesus Louise how come they
 
01:34:46.149 --> 01:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
want better protocols on this
 
01:34:49.229 --> 01:34:49.239 align:start position:0%
staff I mean you know all these people
 
01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:52.280 align:start position:0%
that died and
 
01:34:53.430 --> 01:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
it wasn't because of their family
 
01:34:55.870 --> 01:34:55.880 align:start position:0%
members bringing it to
 
01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:58.109 align:start position:0%
members bringing it to
them

01:34:58.109 --> 01:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:35:00.629 --> 01:35:00.639 align:start position:0%
the you know come on maybe they should
 
01:35:04.109 --> 01:35:04.119 align:start position:0%
have been more careful maybe you know I
 
01:35:06.270 --> 01:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
don't know maybe they had to get tested
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
on their day off you know on on a
 
01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
Saturday so they come back on I don't
 
01:35:11.109 --> 01:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
know I don't know what you could have
 
01:35:12.669 --> 01:35:12.679 align:start position:0%
done yeah the delayed response to
 
01:35:14.430 --> 01:35:14.440 align:start position:0%
testing is a pain in the neck especially
 
01:35:16.470 --> 01:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
with a disease like Co where there's a
 
01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
delay in having it and knowing you have
 
01:35:23.470 --> 01:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
it right and and not knowing you have't
 
01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:24.709 align:start position:0%
it right and and not knowing you have't
still

01:35:24.709 --> 01:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:35:28.109 --> 01:35:28.119 align:start position:0%
being there the big frustration for me
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
was that there were so many flagrantly
 
01:35:33.870 --> 01:35:33.880 align:start position:0%
contradictory um federal and state
 
01:35:36.750 --> 01:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
orders surrounding you know taking time
 
01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
off if you feel sick and before Co like
 
01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
I've been in situations where I felt
 
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
like absolutely garbage and still have
 
01:35:48.189 --> 01:35:48.199 align:start position:0%
to go work because you know it's a
 
01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
different economy nowadays you have to
 
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
make that money and and you know some
 
01:35:54.629 --> 01:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
folks might just think they have the
 
01:35:56.910 --> 01:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
cold or something and it turns out it's
 
01:35:56.920 --> 01:35:59.750 align:start position:0%
cold or something and it turns out it's
coron

01:35:59.750 --> 01:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:03.229 --> 01:36:03.239 align:start position:0%
virus now it's it's you
 
01:36:05.550 --> 01:36:05.560 align:start position:0%
know it's easy to be Monday Morning
 
01:36:08.550 --> 01:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
Quarterback yeah but you know there's
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot of a lot of sad
 
01:36:12.990 --> 01:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
Lessons Learned for this whole thing
 
01:36:18.030 --> 01:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
say I I fortunately not
 
01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
known anyone
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
personally that died some friends that
 
01:36:28.669 --> 01:36:28.679 align:start position:0%
had some friends and relatives but I
 
01:36:30.430 --> 01:36:30.440 align:start position:0%
died but I tremendous amount of friends
 
01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
and relatives that contracted so far
 
01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
they were
 
01:36:38.790 --> 01:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
okay both my daughters in college but
 
01:36:40.950 --> 01:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
um you know you see some of these
 
01:36:44.109 --> 01:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
stories where you know that one case in
 
01:36:46.629 --> 01:36:46.639 align:start position:0%
Texas like six members of
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
family well there was that 41y old
 
01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
congressman from Louisiana died I
 
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
think Larry King died like a month after
 
01:36:59.709 --> 01:36:59.719 align:start position:0%
he got it so the 2 we you know
 
01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
incubation period isn't always accurate
 
01:37:06.310 --> 01:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
but he was also 87 years old so true but
 
01:37:08.669 --> 01:37:08.679 align:start position:0%
you know that 41y old congressman and
 
01:37:20.189 --> 01:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:20.199 --> 01:38:50.109 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:38:50.109 --> 01:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:50.119 --> 01:40:58.870 align:start position:0%
 
for

01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:02.750 --> 01:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:06.070 --> 01:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
will I did mute them for the time being
 
01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
oh oh is
 
01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:19.830 align:start position:0%
oh oh is
that

01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:19.840 --> 01:55:24.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:55:24.910 --> 01:55:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:37.310 --> 01:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
think I got lucky I got stuffed in
 
01:55:43.189 --> 01:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:46.589 --> 01:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
y I avoided that if everyone's going to
 
01:55:48.709 --> 01:55:48.719 align:start position:0%
get ready we're going to start the uh
 
01:55:51.589 --> 01:55:51.599 align:start position:0%

me oh I broke my math number one
 
01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:48.470 align:start position:0%
me oh I broke my math number one
I

01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:53.750 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:56:53.750 --> 01:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:53.760 --> 01:57:15.350 align:start position:0%
 
know

01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
that's look at
 
01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:48.390 align:start position:0%
that's look at
that

01:57:48.390 --> 01:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:48.400 --> 01:58:18.310 align:start position:0%
 
s

01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:47.870 align:start position:0%
 
for

01:58:47.870 --> 01:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:53.229 --> 01:58:53.239 align:start position:0%
is everybody getting back to to their
 
01:58:57.030 --> 01:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
computers we have uh two minutes um I
 
01:58:59.669 --> 01:58:59.679 align:start position:0%
did speak with Heather Gully during the
 
01:59:03.470 --> 01:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
break about uh written testimony and at
 
01:59:05.950 --> 01:59:05.960 align:start position:0%
this point it is recommended that
 
01:59:07.470 --> 01:59:07.480 align:start position:0%
individuals that would like to submit
 
01:59:10.510 --> 01:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
written T testimony go on to the website
 
01:59:11.950 --> 01:59:11.960 align:start position:0%
and go to the labor
 
01:59:16.430 --> 01:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
committee page and then email all
 
01:59:18.390 --> 01:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
there's a section there to email every
 
01:59:21.270 --> 01:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
um every representative that's the best
 
01:59:25.390 --> 01:59:25.400 align:start position:0%
way for that to happen um I do not know
 
01:59:28.109 --> 01:59:28.119 align:start position:0%
if there's a portal um there's a
 
01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
mechanism to do it um Christina I don't
 
01:59:32.189 --> 01:59:32.199 align:start position:0%
know if you can answer this question if
 
01:59:35.950 --> 01:59:35.960 align:start position:0%
someone were to log on to um sign up to
 
01:59:40.189 --> 01:59:40.199 align:start position:0%
testify or to uh log in whether they
 
01:59:42.589 --> 01:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
support or do not support is there a
 
01:59:45.669 --> 01:59:45.679 align:start position:0%
mechanism when you sign up to testify on
 
01:59:50.109 --> 01:59:50.119 align:start position:0%
a bill in Zoom to uh provide written
 
01:59:53.550 --> 01:59:53.560 align:start position:0%
testimony um an email is you get to the
 
01:59:56.229 --> 01:59:56.239 align:start position:0%
end of the option and it provides an
 
01:59:58.310 --> 01:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
email for you and it is the all
 
02:00:01.310 --> 02:00:01.320 align:start position:0%
committee labor email um so you can
 
02:00:04.310 --> 02:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
either find that um during the test the
 
02:00:06.229 --> 02:00:06.239 align:start position:0%
remote sign in testimony on the very
 
02:00:08.550 --> 02:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
last page or you can go on understanding
 
02:00:10.550 --> 02:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
committees and find it
 
02:00:13.390 --> 02:00:13.400 align:start position:0%
there okay I hope that answers
 
02:00:16.629 --> 02:00:16.639 align:start position:0%
everyone's questions uh anyone uh feel
 
02:00:20.069 --> 02:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
free we got a minute here two minutes uh
 
02:00:21.870 --> 02:00:21.880 align:start position:0%
if anyone wants to speak freely they
 
02:00:28.149 --> 02:00:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:30.669 --> 02:00:30.679 align:start position:0%
that I have to bring my gavel from a
 
02:00:32.950 --> 02:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
couple years ago I saved it
 
02:00:35.990 --> 02:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
so 11 o'clock I'm going to open the
 
02:00:39.390 --> 02:00:39.400 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 258 relative to
 
02:00:42.709 --> 02:00:42.719 align:start position:0%
employee time cards time records and I
 
02:00:45.550 --> 02:00:45.560 align:start position:0%
will introduce the sponsor if he is on
 
02:00:50.149 --> 02:00:50.159 align:start position:0%
representative Josh yo Kella
 
02:00:52.790 --> 02:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative yeah thank you Mr
 
02:00:55.350 --> 02:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you uh committee for
 
02:00:58.990 --> 02:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
hearing another one of my bills today
 
02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
I uh just sent you uh an email to the to
 
02:01:08.069 --> 02:01:08.079 align:start position:0%
the um to the whole whole committee um
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
which I may be referencing throughout
 
02:01:17.229 --> 02:01:17.239 align:start position:0%
this um so the goal of this legislation
 
02:01:23.149 --> 02:01:23.159 align:start position:0%
is stemming from um the labor regulation
 
02:01:26.790 --> 02:01:26.800 align:start position:0%
8033 um F2 which
 
02:01:29.550 --> 02:01:29.560 align:start position:0%
requires that time records with entries
 
02:01:32.069 --> 02:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
that are altered shall be signed or
 
02:01:34.669 --> 02:01:34.679 align:start position:0%
initialed by the employee whose record
 
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
was altered um this requirement stems
 
02:01:43.109 --> 02:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
from um RSA
 
02:01:46.990 --> 02:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
27927 and RSA
 
02:01:50.990 --> 02:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
27549 uh Roman numo rule
 
02:01:57.149 --> 02:01:57.159 align:start position:0%
six um the so I when I requested this
 
02:02:00.189 --> 02:02:00.199 align:start position:0%
bill to be drafted that was the stated
 
02:02:03.629 --> 02:02:03.639 align:start position:0%
goal is to allow my the stated goal was
 
02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
to allow for
 
02:02:09.790 --> 02:02:09.800 align:start position:0%
electronic um records to
 
02:02:14.550 --> 02:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
be um allowed for the acknowledgement or
 
02:02:17.750 --> 02:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
signing off of changes to one's time
 
02:02:20.870 --> 02:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
sheet especially in
 
02:02:25.950 --> 02:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
uh this time of so many people working
 
02:02:30.270 --> 02:02:30.280 align:start position:0%
remotely uh changes to time
 
02:02:34.189 --> 02:02:34.199 align:start position:0%
sheets actually signing a piece of paper
 
02:02:37.510 --> 02:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
is not always uh
 
02:02:41.310 --> 02:02:41.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate in uh you know not everyone
 
02:02:43.069 --> 02:02:43.079 align:start position:0%
necessarily has a printer at home or
 
02:02:45.750 --> 02:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
whatever to print this the document out
 
02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
and sign it
 
02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:49.470 align:start position:0%
and sign it
um

02:02:49.470 --> 02:02:49.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:51.109 --> 02:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
I've talked with the labor department
 
02:02:52.830 --> 02:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
and they said that people are actually
 
02:02:56.990 --> 02:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
already doing this um some people are
 
02:03:01.149 --> 02:03:01.159 align:start position:0%
are signing or keeping electronic
 
02:03:04.270 --> 02:03:04.280 align:start position:0%
records um but it isn't technically
 
02:03:06.149 --> 02:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
allowed in the law it's kind of just
 
02:03:07.990 --> 02:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
based on what is your definition of
 
02:03:11.750 --> 02:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
signed or initialed um is an electronic
 
02:03:16.069 --> 02:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
signature or initial um appropriate and
 
02:03:19.830 --> 02:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to just clarify that in the
 
02:03:22.149 --> 02:03:22.159 align:start position:0%
in the um
 
02:03:25.470 --> 02:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
statute however I'm not sure that the
 
02:03:27.350 --> 02:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
recommended way
 
02:03:33.270 --> 02:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
from uh OS is the best way um as I as
 
02:03:36.870 --> 02:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
the um language that is
 
02:03:40.350 --> 02:03:40.360 align:start position:0%
proposed is to add another section to
 
02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:43.350 align:start position:0%
proposed is to add another section to
RSA

02:03:43.350 --> 02:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:45.030 align:start position:0%
 
27549

02:03:45.030 --> 02:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
27549
 
02:03:50.069 --> 02:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
um Roman numeral 8 that doesn't really
 
02:03:52.790 --> 02:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
address the I doesn't really address the
 
02:03:56.390 --> 02:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
issues of Roman numeral
 
02:04:01.390 --> 02:04:01.400 align:start position:0%
um six or the are RSA that I mentioned
 
02:04:08.430 --> 02:04:08.440 align:start position:0%
um and if you look at the the um
 
02:04:12.350 --> 02:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
RSA um 27
 
02:04:15.589 --> 02:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
27549 um at the very the very
 
02:04:19.629 --> 02:04:19.639 align:start position:0%
first uh language is every employer
 
02:04:22.270 --> 02:04:22.280 align:start position:0%
shall and so adding
 
02:04:25.470 --> 02:04:25.480 align:start position:0%
another adding a Roman numeral eight
 
02:04:28.629 --> 02:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
just adds uh a requirement that the
 
02:04:28.639 --> 02:04:30.390 align:start position:0%
just adds uh a requirement that the
employer

02:04:30.390 --> 02:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
employer
 
02:04:34.470 --> 02:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
shall uh do what we are do the
 
02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:36.870 align:start position:0%
shall uh do what we are do the
proposed

02:04:36.870 --> 02:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
um solution which is to permit an
 
02:04:41.790 --> 02:04:41.800 align:start position:0%
employee to electronically sign or
 
02:04:44.229 --> 02:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
acknowledge alterations to such
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
employees wages or our records um
 
02:04:51.870 --> 02:04:51.880 align:start position:0%
requiring uh an employer to allow them
 
02:04:55.549 --> 02:04:55.559 align:start position:0%
to do that makes them require them to
 
02:04:57.990 --> 02:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
have that technology and not necessarily
 
02:05:01.830 --> 02:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
every um uh employer will have that
 
02:05:03.589 --> 02:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
technology and
 
02:05:07.470 --> 02:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
so I think that this is not the
 
02:05:10.229 --> 02:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to fix the bill or not
 
02:05:12.750 --> 02:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
the appropriate way to address the issue
 
02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
but I have sent a couple of suggestions
 
02:05:21.589 --> 02:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
to the uh committee via email of how
 
02:05:25.189 --> 02:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
this language might be amended
 
02:05:29.790 --> 02:05:29.800 align:start position:0%
to uh to change to make the desired
 
02:05:34.790 --> 02:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
effect actually be instantiated into law
 
02:05:38.790 --> 02:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
um and that is to actually change those
 
02:05:43.549 --> 02:05:43.559 align:start position:0%
two either one or both of those um
 
02:05:46.069 --> 02:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
sections that the labor department is
 
02:05:49.629 --> 02:05:49.639 align:start position:0%
referencing when requiring s signature
 
02:05:51.709 --> 02:05:51.719 align:start position:0%
or uh
 
02:05:56.629 --> 02:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
initials and I am sure that the uh the
 
02:05:56.639 --> 02:05:57.830 align:start position:0%
initials and I am sure that the uh the
labor

02:05:57.830 --> 02:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
labor
 
02:06:01.709 --> 02:06:01.719 align:start position:0%
department uh in communication with them
 
02:06:03.790 --> 02:06:03.800 align:start position:0%
they seem to already be okay with this
 
02:06:07.510 --> 02:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
issue um and and recognize that it's
 
02:06:10.549 --> 02:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
already happening and so it's just
 
02:06:13.589 --> 02:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
um an effort to make it more clear in
 
02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
the law and to get
 
02:06:20.390 --> 02:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
um where I think that we should need to
 
02:06:22.430 --> 02:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
be so that it's clear to people that
 
02:06:24.750 --> 02:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
they are allowed to sign electronically
 
02:06:26.430 --> 02:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
or keep the records
 
02:06:29.830 --> 02:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
electronically um thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:06:32.470 --> 02:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
or Mr uh chairman and I'm happy to take
 
02:06:32.480 --> 02:06:34.629 align:start position:0%
or Mr uh chairman and I'm happy to take
any

02:06:34.629 --> 02:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:06:36.470 --> 02:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you
 
02:06:39.669 --> 02:06:39.679 align:start position:0%
representative um looking for questions
 
02:06:42.310 --> 02:06:42.320 align:start position:0%
I see none in the committee room my
 
02:06:44.589 --> 02:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
glasses are fogging up because of my MK
 
02:06:49.950 --> 02:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
I don't any online so the chairman has a
 
02:06:53.589 --> 02:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
um representative uh when you make a law
 
02:06:55.310 --> 02:06:55.320 align:start position:0%
that says you
 
02:06:58.229 --> 02:06:58.239 align:start position:0%
shall you have to think about everybody
 
02:07:00.549 --> 02:07:00.559 align:start position:0%
on either the most sophisticated
 
02:07:02.350 --> 02:07:02.360 align:start position:0%
companies to the least sophisticated
 
02:07:05.069 --> 02:07:05.079 align:start position:0%
companies would it be more appropriate
 
02:07:08.430 --> 02:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
to allow a May situation here they may
 
02:07:10.310 --> 02:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
allow electronic
 
02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:13.229 align:start position:0%
allow electronic
signature

02:07:13.229 --> 02:07:13.239 align:start position:0%
signature
 
02:07:15.669 --> 02:07:15.679 align:start position:0%
um that way a company can do it if they
 
02:07:18.189 --> 02:07:18.199 align:start position:0%
have a technology if they don't but by
 
02:07:18.199 --> 02:07:23.069 align:start position:0%
have a technology if they don't but by
Sha

02:07:23.069 --> 02:07:23.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:24.669 --> 02:07:24.679 align:start position:0%
answer to that if you could would you
 
02:07:27.750 --> 02:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
accept a May versus a shall yes thank
 
02:07:30.310 --> 02:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
you thank you um Mr chairman for the
 
02:07:34.189 --> 02:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
question that's actually um exactly my
 
02:07:36.270 --> 02:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
point of why I don't really like the
 
02:07:39.229 --> 02:07:39.239 align:start position:0%
language as currently written um as I
 
02:07:41.310 --> 02:07:41.320 align:start position:0%
look deeper into the
 
02:07:47.310 --> 02:07:47.320 align:start position:0%
RSA it could be changed to a a sh but I
 
02:07:50.669 --> 02:07:50.679 align:start position:0%
think that um um that
 
02:07:52.990 --> 02:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
would that would change kind of the
 
02:07:58.830 --> 02:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
whole uh RSA whereas it might just be
 
02:08:01.510 --> 02:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
better to be clarified that paper or
 
02:08:04.510 --> 02:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
electronic records are what shall be
 
02:08:08.589 --> 02:08:08.599 align:start position:0%
kept and not say that you have to do one
 
02:08:12.910 --> 02:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
or the other just have that option
 
02:08:15.350 --> 02:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
open I have one more question for you
 
02:08:17.990 --> 02:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative um you talk about um
 
02:08:21.629 --> 02:08:21.639 align:start position:0%
alter to employees wage and hour records
 
02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
what does that mean to you would that be
 
02:08:26.629 --> 02:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
uh as simple as emailing someone
 
02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
regarding a change to some kind of an
 
02:08:31.589 --> 02:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
electronic or written time card or would
 
02:08:34.549 --> 02:08:34.559 align:start position:0%
that also include someone receiving a
 
02:08:37.629 --> 02:08:37.639 align:start position:0%
raise uh and an email s they could send
 
02:08:40.270 --> 02:08:40.280 align:start position:0%
an email uh we're you know giving you a
 
02:08:42.830 --> 02:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
$3 an hour raise starting you know
 
02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
February 1st and they could acknowledge
 
02:08:46.669 --> 02:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
that in writing are
 
02:08:49.229 --> 02:08:49.239 align:start position:0%
you are you thinking about all of these
 
02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
things or was this specifically to
 
02:08:57.430 --> 02:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
just like a weekly or or hourly time
 
02:08:59.870 --> 02:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
card thank thank you for the question
 
02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:01.310 align:start position:0%
card thank thank you for the question
yes

02:09:01.310 --> 02:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:03.669 align:start position:0%
yes
um

02:09:03.669 --> 02:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:08.870 --> 02:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
this this bill directly addresses only
 
02:09:13.069 --> 02:09:13.079 align:start position:0%
manipulations of the time clock um so if
 
02:09:17.470 --> 02:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
you forgot to clock in or you had a PTO
 
02:09:19.390 --> 02:09:19.400 align:start position:0%
and so there is no clock in and so they
 
02:09:22.510 --> 02:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
had to change your record
 
02:09:24.830 --> 02:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
um uh those
 
02:09:27.069 --> 02:09:27.079 align:start position:0%
manipulations are what is changing
 
02:09:30.189 --> 02:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
because there are
 
02:09:33.990 --> 02:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
other parts of the
 
02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.790 align:start position:0%
other parts of the
um

02:09:36.790 --> 02:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:39.910 --> 02:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
notification uh and payment of wages and
 
02:09:43.229 --> 02:09:43.239 align:start position:0%
changing of people's
 
02:09:46.750 --> 02:09:46.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh hourly rate or different sections
 
02:09:52.109 --> 02:09:52.119 align:start position:0%
in um RSA 27549 that deal with that and
 
02:09:54.109 --> 02:09:54.119 align:start position:0%
while I think that all of them should be
 
02:09:57.830 --> 02:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
allowed to be done electronically
 
02:10:03.430 --> 02:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
or um via paper I think that uh it's
 
02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
more reasonable for you know a one-time
 
02:10:10.950 --> 02:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
change of someone's you pay of you know
 
02:10:15.310 --> 02:10:15.320 align:start position:0%
50 cents raise or whatever would be more
 
02:10:16.910 --> 02:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
understandable to be required to be
 
02:10:19.350 --> 02:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
paper where whereas
 
02:10:22.870 --> 02:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
um someone you know every week you know
 
02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
forgetting to clock in or clock out or
 
02:10:29.549 --> 02:10:29.559 align:start position:0%
having PTO it the in the massive amount
 
02:10:32.990 --> 02:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
of paperwork that that requires of
 
02:10:37.109 --> 02:10:37.119 align:start position:0%
changing um on a routine basis
 
02:10:41.270 --> 02:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
um seems to me to be uh have a bigger
 
02:10:44.750 --> 02:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
impact on the employers and so that
 
02:10:47.390 --> 02:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
would be I think the most important
 
02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
thing to address
 
02:10:52.390 --> 02:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
where but I'm not opposed to um allowing
 
02:10:55.270 --> 02:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
all records to be to be kept and
 
02:10:58.790 --> 02:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
acknowledged uh digitally thank you
 
02:11:04.030 --> 02:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:06.510 --> 02:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
question represent
 
02:11:09.750 --> 02:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
ad thank you Mr chairman um so I'm
 
02:11:14.510 --> 02:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
looking at um the structure of this say
 
02:11:18.790 --> 02:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
it's written it looks like um
 
02:11:21.350 --> 02:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
12 is more closely
 
02:11:25.830 --> 02:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
aligned uh with line three um when you
 
02:11:29.109 --> 02:11:29.119 align:start position:0%
signed off on this what was the logic by
 
02:11:32.310 --> 02:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
having that and after RSA
 
02:11:34.430 --> 02:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
27537 because it looks like you could
 
02:11:39.910 --> 02:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
divorce that shell um that's on line n
 
02:11:47.149 --> 02:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:47.159 --> 02:11:51.910 align:start position:0%
 
own

02:11:51.910 --> 02:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:54.310 --> 02:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
representative did you hear the question
 
02:12:00.990 --> 02:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
yes I I don't have um the the uh paper
 
02:12:03.390 --> 02:12:03.400 align:start position:0%
copy that he is
 
02:12:05.910 --> 02:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
referencing in front of me I'm looking
 
02:12:07.990 --> 02:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
at the actual
 
02:12:13.270 --> 02:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
um the actual law online and so at the
 
02:12:16.790 --> 02:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
very top of RSA uh
 
02:12:18.669 --> 02:12:18.679 align:start position:0%
27549 it
 
02:12:20.510 --> 02:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
before all of the room and numerals it
 
02:12:22.629 --> 02:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
says every employer
 
02:12:27.709 --> 02:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
shall um do these things and so I think
 
02:12:33.709 --> 02:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:37.830 --> 02:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh it I was only really looking at the
 
02:12:41.750 --> 02:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
bill um and
 
02:12:44.830 --> 02:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
as and not really looking at the whole
 
02:12:48.549 --> 02:12:48.559 align:start position:0%
RSA as it worked together um and so I
 
02:12:51.229 --> 02:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
didn't see all of the sections of this
 
02:12:51.239 --> 02:12:52.510 align:start position:0%
didn't see all of the sections of this
um

02:12:52.510 --> 02:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:57.189 --> 02:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
27549 and so I didn't think that it was
 
02:13:00.870 --> 02:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
necessary to uh correct OS when they
 
02:13:03.310 --> 02:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
they suggested this language as to meet
 
02:13:06.629 --> 02:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
my request so now that I'm looking at
 
02:13:10.189 --> 02:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
the whole RSA I think that it could
 
02:13:14.709 --> 02:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
be the language could be improved to not
 
02:13:18.709 --> 02:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
require every employee to or employer to
 
02:13:23.189 --> 02:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
have this technology and um I think it
 
02:13:25.870 --> 02:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
could just be worded better so I'm happy
 
02:13:30.510 --> 02:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
to uh propose an amendment to this bill
 
02:13:33.629 --> 02:13:33.639 align:start position:0%
or in whichever way that the um the
 
02:13:36.310 --> 02:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
committee or the committee could amend
 
02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:36.990 align:start position:0%
committee or the committee could amend
it

02:13:36.990 --> 02:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:13:40.830 --> 02:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
to reach the goal that I I tried to
 
02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
achieve with this bill representative um
 
02:13:46.030 --> 02:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
yo yo K just just hold on a moment I
 
02:13:48.870 --> 02:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
think represent wants to
 
02:13:51.709 --> 02:13:51.719 align:start position:0%
um explain him himself go ahead
 
02:13:54.750 --> 02:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
representative uh thank you uh well and
 
02:13:56.870 --> 02:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
just the only reason like I'm asking
 
02:13:59.350 --> 02:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
about this I'm looking at where the word
 
02:14:02.750 --> 02:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
shall comes in and it's in what appears
 
02:14:05.350 --> 02:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
to be a completely unrelated thing to
 
02:14:08.669 --> 02:14:08.679 align:start position:0%
what's being um proposed as an addiction
 
02:14:13.069 --> 02:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
to the RSA the word shall is referenced
 
02:14:15.270 --> 02:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
in the it's illegal in the state of
 
02:14:16.990 --> 02:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh under both state and
 
02:14:18.910 --> 02:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
federal law to employes different wages
 
02:14:21.669 --> 02:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
for the same work based solely on sex uh
 
02:14:23.549 --> 02:14:23.559 align:start position:0%
this notice shall also include the
 
02:14:26.430 --> 02:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
address phone number and email of email
 
02:14:28.669 --> 02:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
address Department Personnel to be
 
02:14:30.470 --> 02:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
contacted with complaints under the
 
02:14:32.910 --> 02:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
subdivision as well as the internet link
 
02:14:34.950 --> 02:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
to RSA
 
02:14:38.830 --> 02:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
27537 so that just looks like you know
 
02:14:42.030 --> 02:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
in an employ break room um just letting
 
02:14:44.350 --> 02:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
folks know that if you think that you
 
02:14:46.990 --> 02:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
know a lady is making less in the office
 
02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
then um this is who you contact so
 
02:14:53.189 --> 02:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
that's with the word shall in that the
 
02:14:55.350 --> 02:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
debate revolves around and then there's
 
02:14:58.629 --> 02:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
an and after RSA
 
02:15:00.870 --> 02:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
27537 and then it goes into something
 
02:15:03.310 --> 02:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
completely unrelated what I'm suggesting
 
02:15:05.990 --> 02:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
for an amendment to clarify is if you
 
02:15:08.870 --> 02:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
strike the word end as was done in line
 
02:15:12.069 --> 02:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
five um right before it goes into Roman
 
02:15:15.069 --> 02:15:15.079 align:start position:0%
numeral 7 and then you you know
 
02:15:16.870 --> 02:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
permitted employee to electronically
 
02:15:18.830 --> 02:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
sign or acknowledge alterations du
 
02:15:20.750 --> 02:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
employees waiter hours records now
 
02:15:22.750 --> 02:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
that's a completely different thing and
 
02:15:25.589 --> 02:15:25.599 align:start position:0%
you don't have you know the link to the
 
02:15:29.950 --> 02:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
last section would you believe you
 
02:15:32.229 --> 02:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
believe thank you thank you for the
 
02:15:34.470 --> 02:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
clarification of your question um I
 
02:15:37.430 --> 02:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
think you're you
 
02:15:40.589 --> 02:15:40.599 align:start position:0%
are interpreting the language based on
 
02:15:47.430 --> 02:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
the um the the text of the bill in in
 
02:15:51.390 --> 02:15:51.400 align:start position:0%
kind of how I was um and not really
 
02:15:53.709 --> 02:15:53.719 align:start position:0%
looking at the whole RSA if you pull up
 
02:15:57.149 --> 02:15:57.159 align:start position:0%
the whole RSA to
 
02:16:00.350 --> 02:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
7549 at the very very top before all the
 
02:16:03.149 --> 02:16:03.159 align:start position:0%
room and numerals there's an employer
 
02:16:06.270 --> 02:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
shall so it actually the employer shall
 
02:16:07.990 --> 02:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
do all of the Roman
 
02:16:10.910 --> 02:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
numerals is the issue that I am coming
 
02:16:13.350 --> 02:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
up against and that is not in the text
 
02:16:17.430 --> 02:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
of the bill and so it was not possible
 
02:16:20.669 --> 02:16:20.679 align:start position:0%
to really seen unless I went and go went
 
02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
and looked at the entire RSA and I and
 
02:16:27.510 --> 02:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
the only reason why seven is listed in
 
02:16:29.870 --> 02:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
there is because they made that an they
 
02:16:32.990 --> 02:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
move the an from six to seven Roman
 
02:16:36.429 --> 02:16:36.439 align:start position:0%
numeral six to rumin numeral 7 um I
 
02:16:39.990 --> 02:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
don't think that the uh the notice shall
 
02:16:43.950 --> 02:16:43.960 align:start position:0%
include um also the address and anything
 
02:16:47.110 --> 02:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
all that the rest of that line is is the
 
02:16:49.709 --> 02:16:49.719 align:start position:0%
sh that I'm talking about that would
 
02:16:51.910 --> 02:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
require employees to
 
02:16:55.429 --> 02:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
electronically um to
 
02:16:57.910 --> 02:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
allow uh employees to electronically
 
02:17:00.469 --> 02:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
sign or alteration so I think that's
 
02:17:04.429 --> 02:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
actually not the correct um place to
 
02:17:08.110 --> 02:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
amend this but I'm I'm happy that that
 
02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
the uh representative is is um willing
 
02:17:16.309 --> 02:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
to to work with me on this any other
 
02:17:18.230 --> 02:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative FAL
 
02:17:21.790 --> 02:17:21.800 align:start position:0%
bage bill online anyone I don't see any
 
02:17:25.750 --> 02:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
hands representative um appreciate
 
02:17:28.870 --> 02:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
representative avalani has his hand up
 
02:17:30.469 --> 02:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
okay I didn't see that representative
 
02:17:30.479 --> 02:17:32.830 align:start position:0%
okay I didn't see that representative
avalone

02:17:32.830 --> 02:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
avalone
 
02:17:35.709 --> 02:17:35.719 align:start position:0%
your thank you Mr chairman um a question
 
02:17:38.110 --> 02:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
of you actually could we put in an
 
02:17:40.629 --> 02:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
exception Clause after the first line
 
02:17:43.349 --> 02:17:43.359 align:start position:0%
and then reference the time to either
 
02:17:45.750 --> 02:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
being manual or
 
02:17:56.070 --> 02:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:59.429 --> 02:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
actions representative y yell Oh I
 
02:18:00.990 --> 02:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
thought it was a question of the the
 
02:18:04.429 --> 02:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
chair but um I do believe that uh an
 
02:18:08.669 --> 02:18:08.679 align:start position:0%
amendment to Roman numeral 6 um to say
 
02:18:10.910 --> 02:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
to add some clarification to that would
 
02:18:14.830 --> 02:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
be uh a valid amendment to to reach this
 
02:18:14.840 --> 02:18:16.509 align:start position:0%
be uh a valid amendment to to reach this
goal

02:18:16.509 --> 02:18:16.519 align:start position:0%
goal
 
02:18:16.519 --> 02:18:19.629 align:start position:0%
goal
absolutely

02:18:19.629 --> 02:18:19.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:21.509 --> 02:18:21.519 align:start position:0%
I don't see any other hands raised uh
 
02:18:24.309 --> 02:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
representative um I would ask that you
 
02:18:26.150 --> 02:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
know politely it's not the
 
02:18:29.509 --> 02:18:29.519 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the the committee
 
02:18:32.230 --> 02:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
um to to amend things this is your bill
 
02:18:33.429 --> 02:18:33.439 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to work with one of the
 
02:18:35.110 --> 02:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to amend it we
 
02:18:38.549 --> 02:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
would accept any amendments to your bill
 
02:18:41.469 --> 02:18:41.479 align:start position:0%
I representative Al may have
 
02:18:44.150 --> 02:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
a representative avalone on our screen
 
02:18:46.549 --> 02:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
we still have your yellow hand up do you
 
02:18:49.629 --> 02:18:49.639 align:start position:0%
have another question of the presenter I
 
02:18:51.669 --> 02:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
I have a followup um it's actually for
 
02:18:55.469 --> 02:18:55.479 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um just for process
 
02:18:58.709 --> 02:18:58.719 align:start position:0%
could we add in an exception and then
 
02:19:01.429 --> 02:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
reference the time cards um because I
 
02:19:04.150 --> 02:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
know every employee shall is the first
 
02:19:08.030 --> 02:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
first sentence in the reference RSA um
 
02:19:09.509 --> 02:19:09.519 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if we could put in an
 
02:19:12.270 --> 02:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
exception and then and then list the
 
02:19:14.469 --> 02:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
time card issue specifically as an
 
02:19:17.830 --> 02:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
exception and then have it be made um
 
02:19:20.549 --> 02:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
either uh manually or
 
02:19:23.349 --> 02:19:23.359 align:start position:0%
electronically you representative um
 
02:19:25.709 --> 02:19:25.719 align:start position:0%
having not looked at the entire RSA I
 
02:19:27.309 --> 02:19:27.319 align:start position:0%
don't know if that would run a file of
 
02:19:29.629 --> 02:19:29.639 align:start position:0%
any other part so I I really feel
 
02:19:31.070 --> 02:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable answering that question it
 
02:19:33.589 --> 02:19:33.599 align:start position:0%
would have to something to go to OS um
 
02:19:35.950 --> 02:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
to make that determination I'm sorry I
 
02:19:37.709 --> 02:19:37.719 align:start position:0%
can't be more specific but I I have not
 
02:19:39.950 --> 02:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
studied the rest of the the
 
02:19:44.389 --> 02:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:44.399 --> 02:19:46.429 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:19:46.429 --> 02:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:19:54.910 --> 02:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:56.750 --> 02:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
Sullivan you're
 
02:19:59.270 --> 02:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
mute representative Sullivan did it
 
02:20:02.510 --> 02:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
again sorry um I I was just wanting to
 
02:20:04.790 --> 02:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
make a suggestion to the chair that
 
02:20:07.710 --> 02:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps um a member of the committee
 
02:20:10.389 --> 02:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
would want to volunteer to work with um
 
02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
the sponsor to come up with a it's
 
02:20:15.469 --> 02:20:15.479 align:start position:0%
awkward getting a bill that's um being
 
02:20:20.349 --> 02:20:20.359 align:start position:0%
presented as uh not ready for um uh
 
02:20:23.309 --> 02:20:23.319 align:start position:0%
prime time um but I think it's a noble
 
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
issue um and perhaps uh one of the me
 
02:20:27.710 --> 02:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
members of the committee would want to
 
02:20:30.349 --> 02:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
work with the sponsor to uh make it
 
02:20:33.309 --> 02:20:33.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:36.110 --> 02:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
time any member of the
 
02:20:41.910 --> 02:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
committee is is welcome to do so um if
 
02:20:44.429 --> 02:20:44.439 align:start position:0%
you you're willing to I would appreciate
 
02:20:48.030 --> 02:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
if you would uh contact by email um the
 
02:20:48.040 --> 02:20:48.790 align:start position:0%
if you would uh contact by email um the
the

02:20:48.790 --> 02:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:20:48.800 --> 02:20:50.750 align:start position:0%
the
sponsor

02:20:50.750 --> 02:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
02:20:53.830 --> 02:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
um reprentative
 
02:20:53.840 --> 02:20:56.590 align:start position:0%
um reprentative
you

02:20:56.590 --> 02:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:20:59.190 --> 02:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
offer offer an
 
02:21:01.950 --> 02:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
amendment no I was just well we were
 
02:21:03.429 --> 02:21:03.439 align:start position:0%
talking about like clarifying the
 
02:21:07.590 --> 02:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
language and um I just saw that as the
 
02:21:10.469 --> 02:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
um bigger issue but um I would have to
 
02:21:13.070 --> 02:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
agree with the chairman that I'm not as
 
02:21:15.790 --> 02:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
familiar with this particular RSA as I
 
02:21:17.830 --> 02:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
wish I was um
 
02:21:21.389 --> 02:21:21.399 align:start position:0%
so the represent might be correct far as
 
02:21:26.830 --> 02:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
the structure might I don't know
 
02:21:31.309 --> 02:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative Edison um uh
 
02:21:34.389 --> 02:21:34.399 align:start position:0%
representative um yella obviously there
 
02:21:35.630 --> 02:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
needs to be some changes here and the
 
02:21:37.150 --> 02:21:37.160 align:start position:0%
bill is not ready for prime time I guess
 
02:21:39.150 --> 02:21:39.160 align:start position:0%
as they say so I would appreciate if you
 
02:21:40.389 --> 02:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
would reach out to any members of the
 
02:21:41.870 --> 02:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
committee that you know or feel
 
02:21:43.990 --> 02:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
comfortable with or even just email to
 
02:21:45.630 --> 02:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
ask for a volunteer they may be able to
 
02:21:48.110 --> 02:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
help you with this um
 
02:21:49.630 --> 02:21:49.640 align:start position:0%
we are on a tight schedule and so it
 
02:21:50.910 --> 02:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
would be something have to be done and
 
02:21:53.270 --> 02:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
presented to us in the next week or
 
02:21:55.469 --> 02:21:55.479 align:start position:0%
two any other
 
02:21:57.870 --> 02:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
questions um uh in the form of amendment
 
02:21:59.670 --> 02:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
excuse me any other questions online I
 
02:22:02.030 --> 02:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
don't see any in the uh committee room I
 
02:22:03.830 --> 02:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
don't see any so that being said thank
 
02:22:04.830 --> 02:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
you very
 
02:22:07.309 --> 02:22:07.319 align:start position:0%
much thank you your
 
02:22:10.790 --> 02:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
testimony I'd like to uh now introduce
 
02:22:12.309 --> 02:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
uh Ry
 
02:22:14.230 --> 02:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
Ogden Deputy Commissioner of the
 
02:22:16.150 --> 02:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:19.950 align:start position:0%
Department of
Labor

02:22:19.950 --> 02:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:25.630 --> 02:22:25.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:28.630 --> 02:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
Commissioner sorry I was uh muted uh yes
 
02:22:29.870 --> 02:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
just for the record Rudy Ogden
 
02:22:31.270 --> 02:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor as representative
 
02:22:34.670 --> 02:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
yaka yakola stated um this is currently
 
02:22:37.830 --> 02:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
allowable under law um employers are we
 
02:22:39.870 --> 02:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
don't have a requirement that it be done
 
02:22:41.830 --> 02:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
in hard copy or we do not have a
 
02:22:43.950 --> 02:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
Prohibition uh against it being done
 
02:22:46.309 --> 02:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
electronically just given the discussion
 
02:22:48.070 --> 02:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
one thing that I would point out is
 
02:22:50.550 --> 02:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh something to look at is it
 
02:22:53.790 --> 02:22:53.800 align:start position:0%
might be cleaner uh to address this type
 
02:22:56.389 --> 02:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
of change under RSA
 
02:22:59.150 --> 02:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
27927 um as representative Yak yaka
 
02:23:01.110 --> 02:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
stated um their recordkeeping
 
02:23:03.950 --> 02:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
requirements come from two places
 
02:23:05.950 --> 02:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
27549 and
 
02:23:10.030 --> 02:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
27927 27927 is the law that specifically
 
02:23:11.870 --> 02:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
says that an employer has to have true
 
02:23:14.349 --> 02:23:14.359 align:start position:0%
and accurate records um I just think
 
02:23:16.150 --> 02:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
that that paragraph I defer of course to
 
02:23:18.830 --> 02:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
OS and and in you folks in terms of Bill
 
02:23:21.110 --> 02:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
writing um but I think that paragraph
 
02:23:23.110 --> 02:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
might be more malleable I think that it
 
02:23:24.870 --> 02:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
might be better suited for making this
 
02:23:26.710 --> 02:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
type of change so I just offer that up
 
02:23:29.110 --> 02:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
as a potential idea but most importantly
 
02:23:30.790 --> 02:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
the department this is already allowable
 
02:23:32.670 --> 02:23:32.680 align:start position:0%
so we don't have concerns and if there
 
02:23:34.429 --> 02:23:34.439 align:start position:0%
is an intent to clarify the law I think
 
02:23:37.469 --> 02:23:37.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:41.630 --> 02:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
thing thank you Mr Ogden any questions
 
02:23:45.309 --> 02:23:45.319 align:start position:0%
uh any folks online any yellow handm
 
02:23:49.269 --> 02:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:53.710 --> 02:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
up I see none in the committee oh sorry
 
02:23:56.349 --> 02:23:56.359 align:start position:0%
right in the committee
 
02:23:58.950 --> 02:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
um I don't know why I have a brain cramp
 
02:24:01.030 --> 02:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
of having to say your name
 
02:24:04.550 --> 02:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative ad
 
02:24:10.670 --> 02:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
adant sorry um if and thank you Mr a um
 
02:24:14.070 --> 02:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
if the Department of Labor uh still
 
02:24:16.429 --> 02:24:16.439 align:start position:0%
considers the intention of this bill
 
02:24:16.439 --> 02:24:17.750 align:start position:0%
considers the intention of this bill
already

02:24:17.750 --> 02:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
already
 
02:24:17.760 --> 02:24:19.670 align:start position:0%
already
Miss

02:24:19.670 --> 02:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
Miss
 
02:24:23.349 --> 02:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
um what what what is the cleanup that
 
02:24:25.110 --> 02:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
this is trying to
 
02:24:27.269 --> 02:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
accomplish uh it's a good question
 
02:24:29.550 --> 02:24:29.560 align:start position:0%
representative in terms of cleanup as I
 
02:24:32.309 --> 02:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
referenced a moment ago RSA
 
02:24:34.790 --> 02:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
27927 essentially says that employers
 
02:24:36.910 --> 02:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
are supposed to have true and accurate
 
02:24:39.510 --> 02:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
records through regulation we've tried
 
02:24:41.950 --> 02:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
to flesh out what are true and accurate
 
02:24:44.309 --> 02:24:44.319 align:start position:0%
records and it is in regulation that we
 
02:24:48.630 --> 02:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
discuss this idea of uh a initialing um
 
02:24:51.030 --> 02:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
the or signing off on alterations to
 
02:24:53.269 --> 02:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
Time Records so I think that elevating
 
02:24:55.070 --> 02:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
something that's in regulation to
 
02:24:57.510 --> 02:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
statute sometimes is of benefit because
 
02:24:59.990 --> 02:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
regulations as you know are typically
 
02:25:01.630 --> 02:25:01.640 align:start position:0%
pushed or promulgated through the
 
02:25:03.870 --> 02:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
department uh signed off of course by
 
02:25:05.830 --> 02:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
jail car and ultimately the legislature
 
02:25:07.670 --> 02:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
as a whole but I think if there is
 
02:25:09.670 --> 02:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
opportunities to bring stuff that
 
02:25:12.429 --> 02:25:12.439 align:start position:0%
departments are doing in regulation and
 
02:25:14.550 --> 02:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
bring that up to statute so that the
 
02:25:17.030 --> 02:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
representatives can debate it and see it
 
02:25:18.630 --> 02:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
do all of those things I do think that
 
02:25:20.790 --> 02:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
at time there's a benefit to that so
 
02:25:22.469 --> 02:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
that's why I would point it out as a
 
02:25:22.479 --> 02:25:25.230 align:start position:0%
that's why I would point it out as a
potential

02:25:25.230 --> 02:25:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:27.389 align:start position:0%
 
benefit

02:25:27.389 --> 02:25:27.399 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
02:25:29.910 --> 02:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
okay are further questions in the
 
02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:31.670 align:start position:0%
okay are further questions in the
hearing

02:25:31.670 --> 02:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:25:37.510 --> 02:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:40.710 --> 02:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
online Christina are there any other
 
02:25:43.190 --> 02:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
individuals wishing to
 
02:25:46.070 --> 02:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
speak looks uh looks like representative
 
02:25:47.790 --> 02:25:47.800 align:start position:0%
Tumi has his hand
 
02:25:49.910 --> 02:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
up thank
 
02:25:49.920 --> 02:25:51.349 align:start position:0%
up thank
[Music]

02:25:51.349 --> 02:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:25:56.670 --> 02:25:56.680 align:start position:0%
you yeah I I'm not sure I if I see why
 
02:25:58.670 --> 02:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
this is needed uh I'll give you an
 
02:26:01.950 --> 02:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
example uh the last place that I worked
 
02:26:04.950 --> 02:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
we had a system where we punched in and
 
02:26:06.590 --> 02:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
we punched out
 
02:26:10.190 --> 02:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
electronically and we kept track of
 
02:26:12.469 --> 02:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
where each of us was because you know we
 
02:26:14.950 --> 02:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
had to work into actively so if we won
 
02:26:18.750 --> 02:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
an assignment we we went and pressed the
 
02:26:20.349 --> 02:26:20.359 align:start position:0%
button said that you know I'm on
 
02:26:22.710 --> 02:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
assignment and then we pressed the
 
02:26:24.910 --> 02:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
button when we got back and and said we
 
02:26:28.030 --> 02:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
were back sometimes you know we forgot
 
02:26:30.550 --> 02:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
to say we were back sometimes I would
 
02:26:30.560 --> 02:26:31.349 align:start position:0%
to say we were back sometimes I would
punch

02:26:31.349 --> 02:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
punch
 
02:26:35.670 --> 02:26:35.680 align:start position:0%
out uh forget the punch out at night and
 
02:26:38.590 --> 02:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
uh what I would do was call the
 
02:26:40.269 --> 02:26:40.279 align:start position:0%
administrative assistant and say I
 
02:26:42.070 --> 02:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
forgot to punch out last night and she
 
02:26:44.630 --> 02:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
took care of the amount of hours I
 
02:26:47.550 --> 02:26:47.560 align:start position:0%
worked on that given day uh
 
02:26:49.950 --> 02:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
what are we trying to accomplish here
 
02:26:52.870 --> 02:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't people be able to say Hey
 
02:26:57.630 --> 02:26:57.640 align:start position:0%
listen I didn't punch out or or I didn't
 
02:27:00.110 --> 02:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh record you
 
02:27:04.429 --> 02:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
know my uh unpaid uh times off or
 
02:27:06.870 --> 02:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
whatever like that why is this necessary
 
02:27:09.630 --> 02:27:09.640 align:start position:0%
I I just don't understand it or if you
 
02:27:12.630 --> 02:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
could make that clarify that for me
 
02:27:14.950 --> 02:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you representative
 
02:27:17.230 --> 02:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
Tumi in terms of the purpose of this
 
02:27:20.269 --> 02:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
again the from a statutory basis there's
 
02:27:22.030 --> 02:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
a requirement that employers have true
 
02:27:24.150 --> 02:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
and accurate records when we've tried to
 
02:27:26.870 --> 02:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
flesh out what that means at through
 
02:27:29.429 --> 02:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
regulation in
 
02:27:32.469 --> 02:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
80303 F what we've said is that if you
 
02:27:34.750 --> 02:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
have alterations to Time Records they
 
02:27:36.349 --> 02:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
should be acknowledged or initialed by
 
02:27:38.990 --> 02:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
employees now the the example you gave I
 
02:27:40.510 --> 02:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
think that that is what happens all
 
02:27:43.150 --> 02:27:43.160 align:start position:0%
across the state every day where you run
 
02:27:45.349 --> 02:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
into problems however is there have been
 
02:27:46.950 --> 02:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
occasions where we've received reced
 
02:27:49.469 --> 02:27:49.479 align:start position:0%
calls from employees saying hey I worked
 
02:27:53.389 --> 02:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
42 hours last week and my time uh my
 
02:27:55.389 --> 02:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
payroll my paycheck suggests that I
 
02:27:58.469 --> 02:27:58.479 align:start position:0%
worked 38 in certain scenarios when we
 
02:28:00.469 --> 02:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
followed up on those inspections what
 
02:28:03.190 --> 02:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
we've seen is that the person's punching
 
02:28:05.830 --> 02:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
in day in and day out punching out for
 
02:28:08.510 --> 02:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
lunch breaks all of that stuff but at
 
02:28:10.309 --> 02:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
the end of the week there might be a
 
02:28:13.190 --> 02:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
unilateral adjustment to time just the
 
02:28:15.389 --> 02:28:15.399 align:start position:0%
employer going in and saying okay I'm
 
02:28:17.950 --> 02:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
I'm moving the time down down um the
 
02:28:19.990 --> 02:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
example you gave again the employees
 
02:28:22.389 --> 02:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
prompting it and the employers
 
02:28:24.990 --> 02:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
correcting it so that is good um where
 
02:28:26.870 --> 02:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
we're looking for the acknowledgement is
 
02:28:28.230 --> 02:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
just so that we don't have these
 
02:28:30.469 --> 02:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
unilateral adjustments because in
 
02:28:33.429 --> 02:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
certain instances that's led to time uh
 
02:28:36.750 --> 02:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
in which has not been reflective or
 
02:28:42.230 --> 02:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:48.990 --> 02:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:52.469 align:start position:0%
 
Mr

02:28:52.469 --> 02:28:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:55.710 --> 02:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
Prout see that representative
 
02:28:59.190 --> 02:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
pro thank you Mr chairman so it kind of
 
02:29:00.790 --> 02:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
seems like the Crux of this problem is
 
02:29:02.150 --> 02:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
the fact that the word you know
 
02:29:04.910 --> 02:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
signature or initial is used in the
 
02:29:07.110 --> 02:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
rules and that doesn't perfectly
 
02:29:09.469 --> 02:29:09.479 align:start position:0%
translate over to a digital time card
 
02:29:13.230 --> 02:29:13.240 align:start position:0%
where I think people would prefer to you
 
02:29:15.429 --> 02:29:15.439 align:start position:0%
know track it as digital audit trail of
 
02:29:17.429 --> 02:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
who made a change when which doesn't
 
02:29:19.550 --> 02:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
perfectly map to the signature and
 
02:29:22.030 --> 02:29:22.040 align:start position:0%
initial language in the rules so is the
 
02:29:24.870 --> 02:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
real fix here to maybe work with the
 
02:29:27.030 --> 02:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
department and uh change the rule to
 
02:29:28.830 --> 02:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that digital audit records
 
02:29:32.950 --> 02:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
might be viable in lie of signature and
 
02:29:35.110 --> 02:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
initial and not try to get into the
 
02:29:37.670 --> 02:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
debate of what a digital signature is
 
02:29:39.110 --> 02:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
and would the department be open to that
 
02:29:42.910 --> 02:29:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:45.590 --> 02:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
change thank you representative it we we
 
02:29:47.070 --> 02:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
would be open to look looking that I
 
02:29:49.230 --> 02:29:49.240 align:start position:0%
would say and representative infantine
 
02:29:51.950 --> 02:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
commented on this earlier a lot of times
 
02:29:54.469 --> 02:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
it you have to consider there's a whole
 
02:29:56.750 --> 02:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh array of employers out there and
 
02:29:59.429 --> 02:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
payroll systems and timekeeping systems
 
02:30:01.190 --> 02:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
and we do try and work with each
 
02:30:03.990 --> 02:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
employer to understand their system and
 
02:30:06.349 --> 02:30:06.359 align:start position:0%
and uh the capabilities of such we would
 
02:30:09.070 --> 02:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
be open to of course looking at our rule
 
02:30:10.950 --> 02:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
I mean if if we would be happy to
 
02:30:14.469 --> 02:30:14.479 align:start position:0%
clarify our rule to say that uh you know
 
02:30:16.269 --> 02:30:16.279 align:start position:0%
initialed or signed and and be clear
 
02:30:17.990 --> 02:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
that that could be done electronically
 
02:30:19.910 --> 02:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
but we're happy to work with anybody on
 
02:30:24.870 --> 02:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:26.630 --> 02:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
informative thank you thank you

questions Christina are there any other
 
02:30:36.510 --> 02:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
individuals wishing to speak not at this
 
02:30:39.750 --> 02:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
time all right thank you that being the
 
02:30:42.349 --> 02:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
case I will uh announce that there were
 
02:30:45.309 --> 02:30:45.319 align:start position:0%

of the School District Governor
 
02:32:02.070 --> 02:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
governance Association and I believe uh
 
02:32:04.510 --> 02:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
she has provided lengthy written
 
02:32:07.349 --> 02:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill uh before I get
 
02:32:09.510 --> 02:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
into the bill itself just so everybody's
 
02:32:12.429 --> 02:32:12.439 align:start position:0%
aware and uh prior to executing this
 
02:32:14.469 --> 02:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
bill of course it'll be made available
 
02:32:17.230 --> 02:32:17.240 align:start position:0%
but the original bill didn't quite
 
02:32:20.870 --> 02:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
capture the true intent so the last
 
02:32:23.750 --> 02:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
lines of this bill has been changed
 
02:32:25.750 --> 02:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
slightly so I'm going to read that for
 
02:32:28.469 --> 02:32:28.479 align:start position:0%
you and what it says now is both the
 
02:32:30.710 --> 02:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
notice and the electronic copy of the
 
02:32:32.630 --> 02:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
tenative agreement shall remain on the
 
02:32:34.590 --> 02:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
public employers internet website for
 
02:32:37.830 --> 02:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
not less than 30 days after reaching the
 
02:32:37.840 --> 02:32:39.110 align:start position:0%
not less than 30 days after reaching the
tenative

02:32:39.110 --> 02:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
tenative
 
02:32:41.469 --> 02:32:41.479 align:start position:0%
agreement and then it says no new or
 
02:32:43.230 --> 02:32:43.240 align:start position:0%
amended collective bargaining agreement
 
02:32:46.309 --> 02:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
shall be ratified by the public employer
 
02:32:48.510 --> 02:32:48.520 align:start position:0%
until after the Internet Posting has
 
02:32:52.309 --> 02:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
expired again that'll be made
 
02:32:55.190 --> 02:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
available uh before I get into exactly
 
02:32:56.710 --> 02:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
what the bill does I want to give you a
 
02:32:59.389 --> 02:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
little background uh personal background
 
02:33:01.590 --> 02:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
which I believe is very relative to this
 
02:33:03.870 --> 02:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
bill I've been a member of the Allied
 
02:33:06.429 --> 02:33:06.439 align:start position:0%
Pilots Association for 36 years and
 
02:33:08.269 --> 02:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
that's a independent Union that
 
02:33:12.550 --> 02:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
represents currently 14,500 Pilots uh of
 
02:33:15.429 --> 02:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
American Airlines and during my time as
 
02:33:16.910 --> 02:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
a union member
 
02:33:18.990 --> 02:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
I have served at the national level for
 
02:33:21.269 --> 02:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
almost uh nearly eight years of
 
02:33:24.190 --> 02:33:24.200 align:start position:0%
full-time Union work uh in different
 
02:33:27.510 --> 02:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
roles one as a h one of 16 board of
 
02:33:30.150 --> 02:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
directors I was at the Boston base
 
02:33:32.670 --> 02:33:32.680 align:start position:0%
chairman representing 550 Pilots based
 
02:33:35.870 --> 02:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
in the New England area uh V various
 
02:33:37.990 --> 02:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
National Committee chairs and most
 
02:33:39.910 --> 02:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
relevant to this
 
02:33:43.389 --> 02:33:43.399 align:start position:0%
discussion uh an elected member of the
 
02:33:47.950 --> 02:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
the pilots negotiating uh committee
 
02:33:51.670 --> 02:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
what HB 348 is about is adding a little
 
02:33:53.830 --> 02:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
bit of transparency into the collective
 
02:33:56.910 --> 02:33:56.920 align:start position:0%
bargaining process there are generally
 
02:33:59.389 --> 02:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
two parties uh in the collective
 
02:34:01.950 --> 02:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement or that they that
 
02:34:05.190 --> 02:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
the agreements ultimately impact those
 
02:34:07.990 --> 02:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
being the taxpayers and the members of
 
02:34:11.150 --> 02:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
the public sector unions themselves the
 
02:34:14.469 --> 02:34:14.479 align:start position:0%
issue is that for the majority of these
 
02:34:17.349 --> 02:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
situations the two part parties are at a
 
02:34:19.510 --> 02:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
minimum one layer removed from the
 
02:34:22.910 --> 02:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
negotiating process and are sometimes
 
02:34:24.830 --> 02:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
provided little to no knowledge about
 
02:34:27.630 --> 02:34:27.640 align:start position:0%
what went on in uh NE
 
02:34:30.670 --> 02:34:30.680 align:start position:0%
negotiations until those agreements have
 
02:34:34.550 --> 02:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
been uh signed now it is true that these
 
02:34:36.590 --> 02:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh labor Agreements are eventually
 
02:34:39.030 --> 02:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
posted on the labor relations website
 
02:34:41.309 --> 02:34:41.319 align:start position:0%
but again that's after the
 
02:34:44.110 --> 02:34:44.120 align:start position:0%
fact so what this bill would do would
 
02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
provide both the union member and the
 
02:34:49.550 --> 02:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
interested taxpayers the ability to
 
02:34:52.110 --> 02:34:52.120 align:start position:0%
review a tenative agreement before it
 
02:34:55.670 --> 02:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
became a collective bargain bargaining
 
02:34:59.550 --> 02:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
agreement uh being ratified by the party
 
02:35:01.469 --> 02:35:01.479 align:start position:0%
responsible and it would also give them
 
02:35:03.670 --> 02:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
a little bit of time to provide input to
 
02:35:06.269 --> 02:35:06.279 align:start position:0%
their respective authorizing bodies uh
 
02:35:08.309 --> 02:35:08.319 align:start position:0%
for those unfamiliar with the process
 
02:35:10.830 --> 02:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
typical negotiation process each side
 
02:35:13.389 --> 02:35:13.399 align:start position:0%
designates individuals to negotiate the
 
02:35:16.429 --> 02:35:16.439 align:start position:0%
tenative agreement that ta is in given a
 
02:35:18.750 --> 02:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
thumbs up or down by the authorizing or
 
02:35:21.269 --> 02:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
approving body and then once the TA is
 
02:35:22.910 --> 02:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
ratified it does become a collective
 
02:35:22.920 --> 02:35:24.190 align:start position:0%
ratified it does become a collective
bargaining

02:35:24.190 --> 02:35:24.200 align:start position:0%
bargaining
 
02:35:26.870 --> 02:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
agreement so under this bill after the
 
02:35:29.710 --> 02:35:29.720 align:start position:0%
TA tenative agreement is reached there'
 
02:35:30.870 --> 02:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
be two
 
02:35:33.510 --> 02:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
requirements uh that would apply and
 
02:35:35.550 --> 02:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
this is key solely to the public
 
02:35:38.469 --> 02:35:38.479 align:start position:0%
employer has places no burdens on the
 
02:35:42.269 --> 02:35:42.279 align:start position:0%
unions this would be solely a uh burden
 
02:35:45.309 --> 02:35:45.319 align:start position:0%
on the public employer the first of the
 
02:35:45.319 --> 02:35:46.790 align:start position:0%
on the public employer the first of the
two

02:35:46.790 --> 02:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:35:48.830 --> 02:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
the first would require that the public
 
02:35:52.309 --> 02:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
employer post on their website a notice
 
02:35:55.590 --> 02:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
stating that a TA had been reached the
 
02:35:57.910 --> 02:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
second requirement would mandate a
 
02:36:00.110 --> 02:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
posting of the tenative agreement
 
02:36:02.670 --> 02:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
itself both of these would need to
 
02:36:05.030 --> 02:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
remain on the website for no less than
 
02:36:07.830 --> 02:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
30 days before the approving bodies
 
02:36:11.550 --> 02:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
could vote the tenative agreement up or
 
02:36:15.190 --> 02:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
down now anticipating a couple possible
 
02:36:15.200 --> 02:36:17.990 align:start position:0%
down now anticipating a couple possible
questions

02:36:17.990 --> 02:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:20.469 --> 02:36:20.479 align:start position:0%
I was mentioned earlier that what about
 
02:36:22.750 --> 02:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
if the public employer does not have a
 
02:36:26.190 --> 02:36:26.200 align:start position:0%
website I in this day and age I assume
 
02:36:28.870 --> 02:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
that everybody would have a website at
 
02:36:32.590 --> 02:36:32.600 align:start position:0%
this time but if if that's not the case
 
02:36:34.429 --> 02:36:34.439 align:start position:0%
uh prior to executing the bill we could
 
02:36:36.309 --> 02:36:36.319 align:start position:0%
also add language that would allow
 
02:36:39.070 --> 02:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
posting on their bulletin boards or you
 
02:36:39.080 --> 02:36:40.190 align:start position:0%
posting on their bulletin boards or you
know

02:36:40.190 --> 02:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:36:42.510 --> 02:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
whatever was
 
02:36:42.520 --> 02:36:44.070 align:start position:0%
whatever was
needed

02:36:44.070 --> 02:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
needed
 
02:36:47.030 --> 02:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
um I assume somebody is going to mention
 
02:36:49.830 --> 02:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
that 30 days might be a long time to
 
02:36:52.070 --> 02:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
wait and that that would delay the
 
02:36:54.349 --> 02:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
process well the way I look at it as
 
02:36:56.309 --> 02:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
being a negotiator if I know that 30
 
02:36:59.750 --> 02:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
days is part of the
 
02:37:02.750 --> 02:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
process I'm gonna use that and account
 
02:37:04.750 --> 02:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
for that 30 days into my bargaining
 
02:37:06.590 --> 02:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
process I would
 
02:37:09.469 --> 02:37:09.479 align:start position:0%
also submit that in a way that could
 
02:37:11.870 --> 02:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
cause the parties to actually get to
 
02:37:14.790 --> 02:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
their agreement a little bit uh
 
02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:20.710 align:start position:0%
their agreement a little bit uh
earlier

02:37:20.710 --> 02:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:24.670 --> 02:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
um I believe that's what I have I thank
 
02:37:26.550 --> 02:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman then be happy to take
 
02:37:26.560 --> 02:37:32.150 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman then be happy to take
any

02:37:32.150 --> 02:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:35.150 --> 02:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
questions any questions hearing room we
 
02:37:37.910 --> 02:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
have a panelist who has
 
02:37:44.790 --> 02:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:44.800 --> 02:37:46.990 align:start position:0%
 
rep

02:37:46.990 --> 02:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
rep
 
02:37:51.070 --> 02:37:51.080 align:start position:0%
um so your experience with these kind of
 
02:37:53.590 --> 02:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
negotiations um
 
02:37:56.150 --> 02:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
has what is the average time that you've
 
02:37:58.870 --> 02:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
seen between a agreement being reached
 
02:38:00.510 --> 02:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
and the final
 
02:38:03.269 --> 02:38:03.279 align:start position:0%
vot I can only speak to
 
02:38:06.550 --> 02:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
my my personal history the way it works
 
02:38:09.309 --> 02:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
at our our Union is when the two parties
 
02:38:11.870 --> 02:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
come to a tenative agreement it goes
 
02:38:13.630 --> 02:38:13.640 align:start position:0%
back in our case it'll come to our board
 
02:38:16.550 --> 02:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
of directors then our board directors
 
02:38:18.590 --> 02:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
actually takes it on I don't remember
 
02:38:20.630 --> 02:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
the time frame it can be different but
 
02:38:22.950 --> 02:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 15 to 30 days they
 
02:38:24.710 --> 02:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
actually go on a road show to all the
 
02:38:26.670 --> 02:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
crew bases in our case I think we've got
 
02:38:29.830 --> 02:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
about 12 crew bases right now maybe 13
 
02:38:32.830 --> 02:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
they do that then they go back the board
 
02:38:36.110 --> 02:38:36.120 align:start position:0%
of directors votes on whether to send it
 
02:38:38.110 --> 02:38:38.120 align:start position:0%
to the membership or the
 
02:38:41.110 --> 02:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
ultimate uh you know vote give it gives
 
02:38:43.830 --> 02:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
it the ultimate vote up or down so I
 
02:38:45.950 --> 02:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
would say for us it's probably on
 
02:38:49.269 --> 02:38:49.279 align:start position:0%
average 30 to can be even a little bit
 
02:38:51.710 --> 02:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
longer um I think maybe a little bit of
 
02:38:54.150 --> 02:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
a difference is uh in the railway Labor
 
02:38:57.349 --> 02:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
Act with uh what we're part of of
 
02:39:00.790 --> 02:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
contracts do not necessarily expire they
 
02:39:05.070 --> 02:39:05.080 align:start position:0%
become amendable so it slight difference
 
02:39:10.550 --> 02:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
there follow um so this would by default
 
02:39:14.230 --> 02:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
acire a 30-day window in there opposed
 
02:39:16.389 --> 02:39:16.399 align:start position:0%
to agreement
 
02:39:16.399 --> 02:39:22.670 align:start position:0%
to agreement
that's

02:39:22.670 --> 02:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:24.990 --> 02:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
correct I have a representative I
 
02:39:27.110 --> 02:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
believe Tumi then
 
02:39:29.830 --> 02:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
Sullivan and then Huff representative
 
02:39:32.269 --> 02:39:32.279 align:start position:0%
Tumi that correct yeah thank you uh
 
02:39:35.030 --> 02:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative turot for your
 
02:39:38.389 --> 02:39:38.399 align:start position:0%
testimony one question uh does this
 
02:39:42.230 --> 02:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
apply to airline pilots this law will it
 
02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
apply to airline
 
02:39:44.640 --> 02:39:47.590 align:start position:0%
apply to airline
pilots

02:39:47.590 --> 02:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
pilots
 
02:39:50.230 --> 02:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
as written no this would reply this this
 
02:39:53.030 --> 02:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
would apply to uh well I guess
 
02:39:55.590 --> 02:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
technically it no because we're not a
 
02:39:59.630 --> 02:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
public employer no okay thank you not
 
02:40:02.990 --> 02:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
only that but for instance our our Union
 
02:40:05.950 --> 02:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
America uh the Allied Pilots Association
 
02:40:07.950 --> 02:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
is based out of Texas so I mean this is
 
02:40:10.710 --> 02:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire law it's not you know
 
02:40:12.910 --> 02:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't apply to my particular
 
02:40:15.830 --> 02:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
Union that's correct thank you thank you
 
02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:17.150 align:start position:0%
Union that's correct thank you thank you
representative

02:40:17.150 --> 02:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:40:20.269 --> 02:40:20.279 align:start position:0%
Sullivan thank you
 
02:40:23.590 --> 02:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
um uh representative I recognize that
 
02:40:25.910 --> 02:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
you've got a lot of experience uh with a
 
02:40:29.110 --> 02:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
private sector Union um I've got 30
 
02:40:32.550 --> 02:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
years of experience uh negotiating for
 
02:40:35.750 --> 02:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
um public sector unions in New Hampshire
 
02:40:39.110 --> 02:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
and um there are some issues that I that
 
02:40:42.630 --> 02:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh I like you to uh address with regard
 
02:40:45.590 --> 02:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
to the public sector um there are tight
 
02:40:49.750 --> 02:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
timelines with regard to um uh the
 
02:40:51.389 --> 02:40:51.399 align:start position:0%
public sector negotiations and there's
 
02:40:54.269 --> 02:40:54.279 align:start position:0%
also a step that you didn't uh uh
 
02:40:57.750 --> 02:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
include in your um testimony and that is
 
02:41:01.510 --> 02:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
the um the approval of a uh collective
 
02:41:03.389 --> 02:41:03.399 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement by the legislative
 
02:41:05.349 --> 02:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
body that would be a school district
 
02:41:10.150 --> 02:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
meeting a town meeting or um uh
 
02:41:12.389 --> 02:41:12.399 align:start position:0%
potentially a city council or
 
02:41:17.230 --> 02:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
such um so that
 
02:41:20.389 --> 02:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
and the um there are deadlines for
 
02:41:25.630 --> 02:41:25.640 align:start position:0%
getting um the uh the cost items um
 
02:41:28.349 --> 02:41:28.359 align:start position:0%
published and those those deadlines
 
02:41:32.309 --> 02:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
require in an sb2 town where there's um
 
02:41:37.349 --> 02:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
um vote by ballot um the deadlines are
 
02:41:40.429 --> 02:41:40.439 align:start position:0%
um require
 
02:41:43.150 --> 02:41:43.160 align:start position:0%
um parties to be done with their
 
02:41:45.429 --> 02:41:45.439 align:start position:0%
negotiations effectively um by the first
 
02:41:47.309 --> 02:41:47.319 align:start position:0%
first week in
 
02:41:51.110 --> 02:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
January um and if you are dealing with
 
02:41:54.190 --> 02:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
mediations or uh fact findings you have
 
02:41:56.750 --> 02:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
to back everything up um earlier than
 
02:42:00.230 --> 02:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
that um and then if you add in a 30-day
 
02:42:02.910 --> 02:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
timeline for um posting the tenative
 
02:42:06.110 --> 02:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
agreement um that backs it up that much
 
02:42:08.630 --> 02:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
further uh negotiations typically begin
 
02:42:10.670 --> 02:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
in the um at the start of a school year
 
02:42:13.510 --> 02:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
for school districts and
 
02:42:16.150 --> 02:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
um that leaves a very limited amount of
 
02:42:18.429 --> 02:42:18.439 align:start position:0%
time already if you back it up another
 
02:42:21.990 --> 02:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
30 days um you've really cramped the
 
02:42:25.910 --> 02:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
process pretty seriously um in
 
02:42:28.230 --> 02:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
addition um I don't want to be rude
 
02:42:30.550 --> 02:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
representative have a question yes I
 
02:42:32.469 --> 02:42:32.479 align:start position:0%
well I would like I I'm I'd like to
 
02:42:34.870 --> 02:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
point these things out and ask the
 
02:42:38.070 --> 02:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor to uh address these issues um
 
02:42:39.389 --> 02:42:39.399 align:start position:0%
well let let me let me stop there and
 
02:42:41.230 --> 02:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
I'll ask for a
 
02:42:41.240 --> 02:42:43.590 align:start position:0%
I'll ask for a
followup

02:42:43.590 --> 02:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
followup
 
02:42:46.230 --> 02:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
okay I really didn't he a question in
 
02:42:48.510 --> 02:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
there so I'm not sure what what you want
 
02:42:51.230 --> 02:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
I I I guess what I'm what I'm asking is
 
02:42:55.630 --> 02:42:55.640 align:start position:0%
um how how do you feel how do you see um
 
02:42:59.309 --> 02:42:59.319 align:start position:0%
public sector uh unions and U employers
 
02:43:02.070 --> 02:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with the um the timelines that
 
02:43:07.030 --> 02:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
are inflicted by this um this this Bill
 
02:43:08.309 --> 02:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think I
 
02:43:10.910 --> 02:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
addressed that in the testimony and I uh
 
02:43:13.110 --> 02:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
anticipating a question similar to this
 
02:43:16.030 --> 02:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
that was you just the two part parties
 
02:43:17.710 --> 02:43:17.720 align:start position:0%
recognizing that there's a 30-day
 
02:43:19.349 --> 02:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
requirement just going to have to build
 
02:43:20.710 --> 02:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
that into your
 
02:43:22.620 --> 02:43:22.630 align:start position:0%
timelines followup Mr
 
02:43:22.630 --> 02:43:25.150 align:start position:0%
timelines followup Mr
[Music]

02:43:25.150 --> 02:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:43:29.790 --> 02:43:29.800 align:start position:0%
chairman there's um my experience also
 
02:43:32.830 --> 02:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
is that uh it takes a fair amount of
 
02:43:36.790 --> 02:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
time to go from a final negotiating
 
02:43:39.110 --> 02:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
session where you reach an agreement in
 
02:43:41.269 --> 02:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
a point in time where there's an actual
 
02:43:43.190 --> 02:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
written fully developed collective
 
02:43:46.510 --> 02:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
bargaining tenative agreement um
 
02:43:50.630 --> 02:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
available for the parties to um to sign
 
02:43:54.950 --> 02:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
um typically at a ratification meeting
 
02:43:57.110 --> 02:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
the document that's uh documents that
 
02:44:00.710 --> 02:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
are used are simply the the the issues
 
02:44:03.150 --> 02:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
that are have been changed or added to
 
02:44:06.830 --> 02:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
the collective bargaining agreement um
 
02:44:09.870 --> 02:44:09.880 align:start position:0%
if you're looking for a full tenative um
 
02:44:11.790 --> 02:44:11.800 align:start position:0%
Collective baring agreement that might
 
02:44:14.790 --> 02:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
take a a period of weeks as well um how
 
02:44:19.469 --> 02:44:19.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:21.990 --> 02:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
that I believe I would say the exact
 
02:44:24.910 --> 02:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
same thing I just said last question
 
02:44:28.309 --> 02:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
that would be you know the deadlines you
 
02:44:30.630 --> 02:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
got you got
 
02:44:33.110 --> 02:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
app thought process as you're doing your
 
02:44:35.670 --> 02:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
negotiations I mean wouldn't be any
 
02:44:38.269 --> 02:44:38.279 align:start position:0%
different if we if we set an artificial
 
02:44:41.550 --> 02:44:41.560 align:start position:0%
deadline at aerica for the our Pilots or
 
02:44:43.389 --> 02:44:43.399 align:start position:0%
somebody set an artificial deadline on
 
02:44:44.950 --> 02:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
our we're going to have to take into
 
02:44:46.510 --> 02:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
effect account the full process the
 
02:44:50.590 --> 02:44:50.600 align:start position:0%
process doesn't end at a TA you know if
 
02:44:53.309 --> 02:44:53.319 align:start position:0%
you've got 30 days to let the public
 
02:44:55.389 --> 02:44:55.399 align:start position:0%
view then you've got to build that into
 
02:44:58.469 --> 02:44:58.479 align:start position:0%
your process it's the same that we do at
 
02:45:02.990 --> 02:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
for our Pilots we can't the day we uh
 
02:45:05.830 --> 02:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
come to a tenative agreement we can't
 
02:45:07.590 --> 02:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
have our board of directors go yep we
 
02:45:09.349 --> 02:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
agree to it send it out to the
 
02:45:11.550 --> 02:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
membership the next Daye there got to be
 
02:45:13.830 --> 02:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
a a time period where the membership can
 
02:45:15.710 --> 02:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
actually take a look at it that's what
 
02:45:20.389 --> 02:45:20.399 align:start position:0%
this bill does it gives the ability of
 
02:45:24.190 --> 02:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
the both not only just the the the
 
02:45:27.670 --> 02:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers but it gives the union members
 
02:45:29.510 --> 02:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
actually a little bit of time to look at
 
02:45:32.870 --> 02:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
it so again it's it's a process you know
 
02:45:35.150 --> 02:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
the time and you got to address it
 
02:45:35.160 --> 02:45:36.750 align:start position:0%
the time and you got to address it
that's

02:45:36.750 --> 02:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:45:40.790 --> 02:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
all any additional followup
 
02:45:44.750 --> 02:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
representor no I'm I'm dissatisfied but
 
02:45:47.030 --> 02:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh understand
 
02:45:50.469 --> 02:45:50.479 align:start position:0%
right representative Huff yes thank you
 
02:45:52.590 --> 02:45:52.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
02:45:55.710 --> 02:45:55.720 align:start position:0%
um representative terot I've been
 
02:45:58.750 --> 02:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
looking at this and I don't see it
 
02:46:00.349 --> 02:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
saying anywhere
 
02:46:05.309 --> 02:46:05.319 align:start position:0%
expressly that the 30-day is required to
 
02:46:07.670 --> 02:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
be up before another portion of the
 
02:46:07.680 --> 02:46:08.910 align:start position:0%
be up before another portion of the
agreement

02:46:08.910 --> 02:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
02:46:12.190 --> 02:46:12.200 align:start position:0%
occurs so I'm just not I'm not
 
02:46:14.309 --> 02:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
understanding why everybody is talking
 
02:46:16.550 --> 02:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
about this back the process this just

um at the very beginning of my testimony
 
02:46:29.590 --> 02:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
I read an amendment that clarifies it a
 
02:46:32.750 --> 02:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
little bit more to what we're talking
 
02:46:34.269 --> 02:46:34.279 align:start position:0%
about right now okay thank you and that

02:46:53.670 --> 02:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
curious if that tenative agreement is
 
02:46:55.590 --> 02:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
posted for 30
 
02:46:57.910 --> 02:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
days and
 
02:47:02.670 --> 02:47:02.680 align:start position:0%
the in the public sector unions in the
 
02:47:04.950 --> 02:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um have the opportunity to
 
02:47:07.950 --> 02:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
look at it do they have an opportunity
 
02:47:10.670 --> 02:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
to try to make changes in those
 
02:47:13.910 --> 02:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:16.750 align:start position:0%
 
don't

02:47:16.750 --> 02:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
don't
 
02:47:19.830 --> 02:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh say did you say a question again rep
 
02:47:22.830 --> 02:47:22.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if they the taxpayers
 
02:47:25.309 --> 02:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
see the tenative agreement online um
 
02:47:27.269 --> 02:47:27.279 align:start position:0%
they're not going to have any input in
 
02:47:28.910 --> 02:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
um the outcome of that tenative
 
02:47:28.920 --> 02:47:30.190 align:start position:0%
um the outcome of that tenative
agreement

02:47:30.190 --> 02:47:30.200 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
02:47:32.630 --> 02:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
correct uh the way the bill is written
 
02:47:34.590 --> 02:47:34.600 align:start position:0%
that's correct there it's there
 
02:47:37.710 --> 02:47:37.720 align:start position:0%
specifically for the individuals to look
 
02:47:42.030 --> 02:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:45.389 --> 02:47:45.399 align:start position:0%
mean member I I believe you were former
 
02:47:48.309 --> 02:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
requirement uh this applied to your
 
02:47:51.349 --> 02:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
particular Union this
 
02:47:53.590 --> 02:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
um your membership would have the
 
02:47:56.750 --> 02:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look at it um it would
 
02:47:58.910 --> 02:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
also give them the opportunity obviously
 
02:48:03.030 --> 02:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
to give input to your negotiators or
 
02:48:05.110 --> 02:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
your president of the association or
 
02:48:07.590 --> 02:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
whoever um is that going to be enough to
 
02:48:13.190 --> 02:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
influence a change U by the union that I
 
02:48:18.910 --> 02:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:21.389 --> 02:48:21.399 align:start position:0%
you I believe that's
 
02:48:21.399 --> 02:48:23.110 align:start position:0%
you I believe that's
repres

02:48:23.110 --> 02:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
repres
 
02:48:25.230 --> 02:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
representative my list of everybody got
 
02:48:27.870 --> 02:48:27.880 align:start position:0%
Nam to faces representative
 
02:48:30.190 --> 02:48:30.200 align:start position:0%
buar thank you Mr
 
02:48:33.990 --> 02:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:35.870 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
question

02:48:35.870 --> 02:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:48:39.990 --> 02:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh I I'm a little bit confused about why
 
02:48:42.710 --> 02:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
you would want to make a tenative a
 
02:48:46.070 --> 02:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
tenative agreement public
 
02:48:49.070 --> 02:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
prior to it being agreed
 
02:48:53.070 --> 02:48:53.080 align:start position:0%
upon by both parties because things can
 
02:48:59.349 --> 02:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:06.429 --> 02:49:06.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:09.870 --> 02:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
question the whole idea of having a
 
02:49:13.469 --> 02:49:13.479 align:start position:0%
30-day period is to provide transparency
 
02:49:15.510 --> 02:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
and give both the
 
02:49:20.190 --> 02:49:20.200 align:start position:0%
members and the again
 
02:49:23.229 --> 02:49:23.239 align:start position:0%
ultimate responsible part from the
 
02:49:24.790 --> 02:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
public the
 
02:49:28.190 --> 02:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
taxpayers actual time to review what is
 
02:49:29.990 --> 02:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
in the tenative agreement before it
 
02:49:33.830 --> 02:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
becomes a certified Collective
 
02:49:38.349 --> 02:49:38.359 align:start position:0%
barain followup follow representa uh
 
02:49:41.070 --> 02:49:41.080 align:start position:0%
then why don't you put in your
 
02:49:46.070 --> 02:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
bill the ratified agreement made
 
02:49:49.469 --> 02:49:49.479 align:start position:0%
public because the uh thank you m thank
 
02:49:52.670 --> 02:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
you Char the ratified collective
 
02:49:55.630 --> 02:49:55.640 align:start position:0%

02:50:16.190 --> 02:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
now once it's it's a done deal this
 
02:50:18.389 --> 02:50:18.399 align:start position:0%
gives the
 
02:50:18.399 --> 02:50:30.510 align:start position:0%
gives the
opportunity

02:50:30.510 --> 02:50:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:35.710 --> 02:50:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:38.990 --> 02:50:39.000 align:start position:0%

02:51:19.229 --> 02:51:19.239 align:start position:0%
yes I'm here Mr chair can you hear me
 
02:51:23.309 --> 02:51:23.319 align:start position:0%
yes uh so uh my name is n Grace I'm with
 
02:51:25.309 --> 02:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal
 
02:51:29.030 --> 02:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
Association uh and we oppose this bill
 
02:51:31.110 --> 02:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
um there are really three reasons uh
 
02:51:33.349 --> 02:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
that we oppose the bill uh I did hear a
 
02:51:35.349 --> 02:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
number of questions from Representatives
 
02:51:37.830 --> 02:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
that I do want to address throughout my
 
02:51:40.229 --> 02:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
testimony um the first is that tenative
 
02:51:42.469 --> 02:51:42.479 align:start position:0%
is not defined while it seems pretty
 
02:51:44.590 --> 02:51:44.600 align:start position:0%
clear that you know the committee has
 
02:51:46.510 --> 02:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
has an understanding of what that means
 
02:51:49.229 --> 02:51:49.239 align:start position:0%
it's not defined actually in the chapter
 
02:51:51.349 --> 02:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh nor is it defined as part of this
 
02:51:55.030 --> 02:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
bill so there could be confusion about
 
02:51:56.670 --> 02:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
what that means and I think we heard
 
02:52:01.110 --> 02:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
some of that today um where you know
 
02:52:03.750 --> 02:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
what what is the tentative agreement uh
 
02:52:07.670 --> 02:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
for example I used to be a a member of a
 
02:52:11.670 --> 02:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
union and I was on the negotiating team
 
02:52:14.229 --> 02:52:14.239 align:start position:0%
and at times we would go and negotiate
 
02:52:16.830 --> 02:52:16.840 align:start position:0%
with management come back to the union
 
02:52:19.190 --> 02:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
and say hey we have what we are calling
 
02:52:21.630 --> 02:52:21.640 align:start position:0%
a tentative agreement the major points
 
02:52:24.030 --> 02:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
are agreed upon um and everyone in the
 
02:52:25.389 --> 02:52:25.399 align:start position:0%
union was fine with that but there
 
02:52:27.750 --> 02:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't anything written out yet for the
 
02:52:30.750 --> 02:52:30.760 align:start position:0%
union to vote on and approve um I assume
 
02:52:33.469 --> 02:52:33.479 align:start position:0%
the similar similarly the same thing
 
02:52:35.550 --> 02:52:35.560 align:start position:0%
takes place when the select board is
 
02:52:37.910 --> 02:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
discussing collective bargaining
 
02:52:40.309 --> 02:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
agreement negotiations among itself in
 
02:52:40.319 --> 02:52:41.630 align:start position:0%
agreement negotiations among itself in
non-public

02:52:41.630 --> 02:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
non-public
 
02:52:43.750 --> 02:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
session uh and that really plays into
 
02:52:46.630 --> 02:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
the timeline here because of course if
 
02:52:50.469 --> 02:52:50.479 align:start position:0%
you have a generalized agreement it may
 
02:52:53.070 --> 02:52:53.080 align:start position:0%
be the case that there's a sticking
 
02:52:55.590 --> 02:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
point or two on one side or the other uh
 
02:52:57.790 --> 02:52:57.800 align:start position:0%
if this has to be posted on the website
 
02:53:00.229 --> 02:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
you're posting something for 30 days
 
02:53:02.950 --> 02:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
then going back renegotiating that one
 
02:53:04.710 --> 02:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
sticking point and again you have
 
02:53:07.830 --> 02:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
another 30-day period of that it has to
 
02:53:10.510 --> 02:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
be posted um and that's going to cause
 
02:53:13.030 --> 02:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
some some serious
 
02:53:15.990 --> 02:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
concerns uh this second reason that we
 
02:53:19.750 --> 02:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill is that the cost items
 
02:53:21.190 --> 02:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
are really the items that the
 
02:53:22.990 --> 02:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
legislative body that is the towns
 
02:53:24.469 --> 02:53:24.479 align:start position:0%
people are concerned with they're the
 
02:53:26.389 --> 02:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
they're the things that cost the money
 
02:53:28.429 --> 02:53:28.439 align:start position:0%
you know that generally the the towns
 
02:53:30.630 --> 02:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
people are going to be concerned with uh
 
02:53:34.630 --> 02:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
you know procedures for um how someone
 
02:53:37.590 --> 02:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
is uh fired and and how that whole
 
02:53:40.750 --> 02:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
process works that's not a cost item um
 
02:53:41.990 --> 02:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's something that's negotiated
 
02:53:45.030 --> 02:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
between the union and the uh the
 
02:53:47.630 --> 02:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
governing body um it's not something
 
02:53:49.389 --> 02:53:49.399 align:start position:0%
that the town's people generally have
 
02:53:51.710 --> 02:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
input on um their
 
02:53:54.830 --> 02:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
concern as the statutes are written Now
 
02:53:58.550 --> 02:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
is really with uh the financial aspect
 
02:54:01.710 --> 02:54:01.720 align:start position:0%
um and all of those cost items have to
 
02:54:03.990 --> 02:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
be discussed and disclosed with the
 
02:54:07.990 --> 02:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
legislative body prior to a vote so the
 
02:54:09.910 --> 02:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
towns people have to understand how much
 
02:54:12.269 --> 02:54:12.279 align:start position:0%
this contract is going to cost them uh
 
02:54:13.830 --> 02:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
over whatever period of years that it
 
02:54:17.030 --> 02:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
runs and each of those items and how
 
02:54:17.040 --> 02:54:18.030 align:start position:0%
runs and each of those items and how
that

02:54:18.030 --> 02:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:54:21.469 --> 02:54:21.479 align:start position:0%
functions um all the other non-cost
 
02:54:22.670 --> 02:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
items are more along the lines of
 
02:54:25.190 --> 02:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
employer employee relationship um
 
02:54:30.550 --> 02:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
generally and actually uh you know under
 
02:54:33.510 --> 02:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
the current statutes uh the town meeting
 
02:54:35.590 --> 02:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
can't dictate to the select board you
 
02:54:39.630 --> 02:54:39.640 align:start position:0%
know uh here's how you have to relate to
 
02:54:42.150 --> 02:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
specific employees and the select for
 
02:54:43.790 --> 02:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
gets to set those policies those
 
02:54:46.630 --> 02:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
personnel policies um it doesn't really
 
02:54:46.640 --> 02:54:47.429 align:start position:0%
personnel policies um it doesn't really
make

02:54:47.429 --> 02:54:47.439 align:start position:0%
make
 
02:54:51.750 --> 02:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
sense to uh to have that become part of
 
02:54:56.429 --> 02:54:56.439 align:start position:0%
a vote um and lastly as was pointed out
 
02:54:58.590 --> 02:54:58.600 align:start position:0%
uh all agreements reached by collective
 
02:55:02.030 --> 02:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
bargaining um are public records they're
 
02:55:05.070 --> 02:55:05.080 align:start position:0%
required to be sent to the
 
02:55:08.630 --> 02:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
plrb uh and those are made available so
 
02:55:10.670 --> 02:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
um there's already this public access in
 
02:55:12.870 --> 02:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
addition anyone can go in make a right
 
02:55:16.190 --> 02:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
to no law request and uh request copies
 
02:55:20.429 --> 02:55:20.439 align:start position:0%
of any ratified uh agreements um prior
 
02:55:21.990 --> 02:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
to ratification there's still the
 
02:55:23.510 --> 02:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
possibility of of
 
02:55:26.710 --> 02:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
negotiation um occurring I'm happy to
 
02:55:30.790 --> 02:55:30.800 align:start position:0%

on the front lines for the past 10
 
02:56:41.750 --> 02:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
months during the pandemic serving as

professionals healthcare workers and and
 
02:56:50.550 --> 02:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
much more uh I'm here today in in
 
02:56:54.309 --> 02:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
opposition uh as well to House Bill 348
 
02:56:56.590 --> 02:56:56.600 align:start position:0%
rep Sullivan's already pointed out the
 
02:56:58.229 --> 02:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
problems associated with the time
 
02:57:00.150 --> 02:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
limitations the bill imposed as they
 
02:57:02.790 --> 02:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
relate to getting the cost items before
 
02:57:05.510 --> 02:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
the governing body for funding uh I
 
02:57:08.469 --> 02:57:08.479 align:start position:0%
recorded our position in opposition not
 
02:57:11.110 --> 02:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
because we're opposed to transparency
 
02:57:12.990 --> 02:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
but primarily because we believe the
 
02:57:16.269 --> 02:57:16.279 align:start position:0%
bill has drafted Ed is unnecessary and
 
02:57:18.870 --> 02:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
may lead to a lot more confusion than
 
02:57:22.990 --> 02:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
Clarity and uh here's why for starters
 
02:57:24.429 --> 02:57:24.439 align:start position:0%
and some of this has already been said
 
02:57:27.309 --> 02:57:27.319 align:start position:0%
but uh all all signed and executed
 
02:57:28.790 --> 02:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
public sector collective bargaining
 
02:57:30.990 --> 02:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
Agreements are readily and easily
 
02:57:33.349 --> 02:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
accessible on the website of the state's
 
02:57:35.429 --> 02:57:35.439 align:start position:0%
Public Employee Labor Relations Board
 
02:57:37.429 --> 02:57:37.439 align:start position:0%
the site's easy to find it's easy to
 
02:57:39.950 --> 02:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
navigate and it's updated regularly in
 
02:57:41.870 --> 02:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
fact I I checked it this morning and it
 
02:57:44.870 --> 02:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
was updated just three days ago uh on
 
02:57:44.880 --> 02:57:46.110 align:start position:0%
was updated just three days ago uh on
January

02:57:46.110 --> 02:57:46.120 align:start position:0%
January
 
02:57:48.630 --> 02:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
25th um but as you can see in the
 
02:57:50.830 --> 02:57:50.840 align:start position:0%
language of the bill it would require a
 
02:57:52.910 --> 02:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
Public Employee to post notice of a
 
02:57:55.590 --> 02:57:55.600 align:start position:0%
tentative agreement on any new or
 
02:57:57.830 --> 02:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
amended collective bargaining agreement
 
02:58:00.910 --> 02:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
which we believe could create confusion
 
02:58:04.030 --> 02:58:04.040 align:start position:0%
among the public who we presume uh this
 
02:58:06.790 --> 02:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
legislation is is aimed at educating on
 
02:58:09.950 --> 02:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
new contracts now I understand uh from
 
02:58:12.510 --> 02:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
from the sponsor that uh his efforts are
 
02:58:14.870 --> 02:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
also aimed at that Ed ating union
 
02:58:17.389 --> 02:58:17.399 align:start position:0%
members uh but I will say speaking for
 
02:58:19.429 --> 02:58:19.439 align:start position:0%
our Union uh we don't need any help on
 
02:58:22.070 --> 02:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
that uh we have a a process that we've
 
02:58:24.950 --> 02:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
gone through for a long time uh the the
 
02:58:28.590 --> 02:58:28.600 align:start position:0%
members elect representatives to uh the
 
02:58:30.710 --> 02:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
bargaining committee and we communicate
 
02:58:32.790 --> 02:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
with them on a regular basis and give
 
02:58:36.269 --> 02:58:36.279 align:start position:0%
them ample time to review a tenative
 
02:58:38.550 --> 02:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
agreement um but again tentative
 
02:58:41.790 --> 02:58:41.800 align:start position:0%
agreement is just that tentative uh and
 
02:58:43.550 --> 02:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
the gentleman before me pointed out that
 
02:58:45.670 --> 02:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's not uh defined in the
 
02:58:48.990 --> 02:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
bill um but it is defined in Websters as
 
02:58:53.349 --> 02:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
simply not fully worked out so we're not
 
02:58:55.750 --> 02:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
sure as to why sponsors of the
 
02:58:57.510 --> 02:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
legislation would want to notify the
 
02:58:59.269 --> 02:58:59.279 align:start position:0%
public of an agreement that's yet to be
 
02:59:01.349 --> 02:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
reviewed and approved by the workers who
 
02:59:03.550 --> 02:59:03.560 align:start position:0%
would be covered under the contract not
 
02:59:05.269 --> 02:59:05.279 align:start position:0%
to mention again presented before the
 
02:59:07.750 --> 02:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
governing body of a municipality for a
 
02:59:10.750 --> 02:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
vote on cost items uh it's it's
 
02:59:12.750 --> 02:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
important to note that tenative
 
02:59:15.150 --> 02:59:15.160 align:start position:0%
agreements that are between the employer
 
02:59:18.150 --> 02:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
and the union include the original or
 
02:59:20.309 --> 02:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
current contract language as well as any
 
02:59:23.550 --> 02:59:23.560 align:start position:0%
new proposed language or changes so this
 
02:59:25.349 --> 02:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
creates another possibility for
 
02:59:27.830 --> 02:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
confusion as members of the public might
 
02:59:30.590 --> 02:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
mistakenly view the entire agreement as
 
02:59:33.389 --> 02:59:33.399 align:start position:0%
entirely new and view all Associated
 
02:59:37.469 --> 02:59:37.479 align:start position:0%
cost as completely new additional cost
 
02:59:38.590 --> 02:59:38.600 align:start position:0%
in other words it could give the
 
02:59:40.269 --> 02:59:40.279 align:start position:0%
impression that the cost of the contract
 
02:59:42.269 --> 02:59:42.279 align:start position:0%
is much higher than it it truly is or
 
02:59:44.670 --> 02:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
the new C uh cost
 
02:59:46.830 --> 02:59:46.840 align:start position:0%
now if the legislation is aimed at
 
02:59:49.070 --> 02:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
giving the public uh a chance to oppose
 
02:59:52.030 --> 02:59:52.040 align:start position:0%
a contract for whatever reason uh then
 
02:59:53.710 --> 02:59:53.720 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that when a
 
02:59:56.469 --> 02:59:56.479 align:start position:0%
tenative agreement is finally ratified
 
02:59:58.389 --> 02:59:58.399 align:start position:0%
or approved by the members who be
 
03:00:00.990 --> 03:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
covered the law requires that the new
 
03:00:02.469 --> 03:00:02.479 align:start position:0%
Financial Obligations to the
 
03:00:05.510 --> 03:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
municipality be presented and voting on
 
03:00:07.190 --> 03:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh by the governing body of the
 
03:00:09.070 --> 03:00:09.080 align:start position:0%
municipality as the gentleman before we
 
03:00:12.070 --> 03:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
pointed out thereby making any true new
 
03:00:14.229 --> 03:00:14.239 align:start position:0%
cost crystal clear to the public in in
 
03:00:15.870 --> 03:00:15.880 align:start position:0%
providing the public with an opportunity
 
03:00:18.110 --> 03:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
to weigh in with their elected leaders
 
03:00:21.750 --> 03:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
if they so choose uh look we're we're
 
03:00:23.910 --> 03:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
proud of the contracts we secure for our
 
03:00:26.269 --> 03:00:26.279 align:start position:0%
members we're certainly not looking to
 
03:00:28.469 --> 03:00:28.479 align:start position:0%
Shield them from public view in fact we
 
03:00:30.349 --> 03:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
post them on our website too and and
 
03:00:33.950 --> 03:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
often uh boast of them on social media
 
03:00:36.190 --> 03:00:36.200 align:start position:0%
because we are proud of them we just
 
03:00:37.750 --> 03:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
want to be sure that what the public
 
03:00:40.429 --> 03:00:40.439 align:start position:0%
sees is what is actually approved by our
 
03:00:43.070 --> 03:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
members through a ratification vote as
 
03:00:46.349 --> 03:00:46.359 align:start position:0%
opposed to something that again is uh
 
03:00:49.229 --> 03:00:49.239 align:start position:0%
what's just defined is not fully worked
 
03:00:51.750 --> 03:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
out and we want the public to know as
 
03:00:53.590 --> 03:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
they already do under current law what
 
03:00:56.670 --> 03:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
the true new cost of the contract is uh
 
03:00:59.990 --> 03:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
we welcome uh an invitation to to work
 
03:01:01.670 --> 03:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
with the the committee and the sponsor
 
03:01:04.429 --> 03:01:04.439 align:start position:0%
to refine the language of the bill um
 
03:01:06.349 --> 03:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
but until such time we ask that you
 
03:01:09.590 --> 03:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
retain it and I I thank you um for your
 
03:01:12.309 --> 03:01:12.319 align:start position:0%

17,000 uh members across state in um
 
03:02:10.680 --> 03:02:11.510 align:start position:0%
17,000 uh members across state in um
public

03:02:11.510 --> 03:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
public
 
03:02:14.110 --> 03:02:14.120 align:start position:0%
education and uh I can hear you a little
 
03:02:14.120 --> 03:02:18.590 align:start position:0%
education and uh I can hear you a little
bit

03:02:18.590 --> 03:02:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:25.110 --> 03:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:27.710 --> 03:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
um there I just trying to put my mic up
 
03:02:29.110 --> 03:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
is that a little bit
 
03:02:33.429 --> 03:02:33.439 align:start position:0%
better yes thank you okay terrific um so
 
03:02:38.070 --> 03:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
I think uh we we also you know have uh
 
03:02:41.269 --> 03:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
of you know over uh 100 collective
 
03:02:42.429 --> 03:02:42.439 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements out there with
 
03:02:45.910 --> 03:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
school districts and um I'm here I I
 
03:02:48.630 --> 03:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
signed up similar to Mr Durkin um signed
 
03:02:51.910 --> 03:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
up in opposition to the bill uh again
 
03:02:54.590 --> 03:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
not because I think there's any issue
 
03:02:59.150 --> 03:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
with the intent um but that I think uh
 
03:03:01.630 --> 03:03:01.640 align:start position:0%
as he said it could be unintentionally
 
03:03:06.150 --> 03:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh misleading to voters um uh so without
 
03:03:07.710 --> 03:03:07.720 align:start position:0%
going through my entire testimony
 
03:03:10.950 --> 03:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
because I think uh both M Mr Grace and
 
03:03:13.870 --> 03:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
Mr Durkin covered most of it you know I
 
03:03:16.790 --> 03:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
I would Echo uh the points that Mr Gray
 
03:03:18.630 --> 03:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
made about the tentative agreement not
 
03:03:21.750 --> 03:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
being defined um you
 
03:03:25.830 --> 03:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
know the points about the um cost items
 
03:03:29.269 --> 03:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
is I think is a key one 273
 
03:03:33.550 --> 03:03:33.560 align:start position:0%
A3 uh Roman 2B states only cost items
 
03:03:35.070 --> 03:03:35.080 align:start position:0%
shall be submitted to the legislative
 
03:03:37.990 --> 03:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
body of the public employer for approval
 
03:03:39.830 --> 03:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
at the next annual meeting of the
 
03:03:43.830 --> 03:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
legislative body and so if the tenative
 
03:03:47.870 --> 03:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
agreement with non-cost items is posted
 
03:03:49.790 --> 03:03:49.800 align:start position:0%
uh as been stated I think that could be
 
03:03:52.469 --> 03:03:52.479 align:start position:0%
confusing to what it is is in the
 
03:03:55.309 --> 03:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
purview of the legislative body uh
 
03:03:58.590 --> 03:03:58.600 align:start position:0%
versus the governing body um as Mr Grace
 
03:04:01.590 --> 03:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
said the one who is has the employer
 
03:04:04.150 --> 03:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
employee relationship versus the
 
03:04:08.910 --> 03:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayer uh uh uh relationship which is
 
03:04:10.790 --> 03:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
you know obviously responsible for
 
03:04:12.710 --> 03:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
funding the contract and I think that's
 
03:04:16.190 --> 03:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
why when this was uh when 273a was
 
03:04:19.950 --> 03:04:19.960 align:start position:0%
conceived it was to you know keep those
 
03:04:23.070 --> 03:04:23.080 align:start position:0%
uh Lanes distinct um for for that
 
03:04:28.070 --> 03:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
purpose um the uh I I I also think that
 
03:04:30.190 --> 03:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
tenative agreements take all kinds of
 
03:04:33.630 --> 03:04:33.640 align:start position:0%
forms when they are um when they are
 
03:04:34.870 --> 03:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
when they finally are finished I would
 
03:04:37.229 --> 03:04:37.239 align:start position:0%
Echo some of the concerns about timeline
 
03:04:39.389 --> 03:04:39.399 align:start position:0%
of of you know dotting the eyes and
 
03:04:42.710 --> 03:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
crossing the te's on some of these um
 
03:04:43.990 --> 03:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
complicated issues issues when you're
 
03:04:47.190 --> 03:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
talking about insurance or uh things
 
03:04:50.630 --> 03:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
like that but many of them don't will
 
03:04:52.590 --> 03:04:52.600 align:start position:0%
include the additions to certain
 
03:04:53.990 --> 03:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
provisions of collective bargaining
 
03:04:57.510 --> 03:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
agreements or uh or or or the changes
 
03:04:59.750 --> 03:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
you know the as you're familiar with the
 
03:05:02.990 --> 03:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
italics and Crossing out of of of of
 
03:05:04.710 --> 03:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
bills when they're amending
 
03:05:07.830 --> 03:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
statutes um and so if you don't so
 
03:05:10.070 --> 03:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
depending on the format it could sort of
 
03:05:12.670 --> 03:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
go both ways you may have too much of
 
03:05:16.510 --> 03:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
the picture and as as a voter not be
 
03:05:19.269 --> 03:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
clear on what it is is in the purview of
 
03:05:20.990 --> 03:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
of your vote when it comes time to
 
03:05:23.550 --> 03:05:23.560 align:start position:0%
voting on the uh on the on the
 
03:05:25.670 --> 03:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
ratification on the warrant which I
 
03:05:29.469 --> 03:05:29.479 align:start position:0%
think does explain the cost items U for
 
03:05:31.870 --> 03:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
the for the public or you don't have
 
03:05:33.830 --> 03:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
enough that you might not realize that
 
03:05:36.950 --> 03:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
well there's a there's an agreement here
 
03:05:39.590 --> 03:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
the unions agreed to uh the employers
 
03:05:43.070 --> 03:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
agreed to a a 5% raise for example and
 
03:05:45.269 --> 03:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
you as a voter you may
 
03:05:48.070 --> 03:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
be U outraged that that agreement would
 
03:05:49.950 --> 03:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
have been reached but what you didn't
 
03:05:51.630 --> 03:05:51.640 align:start position:0%
know when you read the tenative
 
03:05:55.229 --> 03:05:55.239 align:start position:0%
agreement was that there was also uh a
 
03:05:57.830 --> 03:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
provision not on the tenative agreement
 
03:06:00.070 --> 03:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
that there's a major Savings in the
 
03:06:01.870 --> 03:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
health insurance for example that
 
03:06:06.269 --> 03:06:06.279 align:start position:0%
offsets that so um so I think the
 
03:06:09.830 --> 03:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of this could be
 
03:06:14.269 --> 03:06:14.279 align:start position:0%
uh to to uh um ultimately mislead
 
03:06:18.269 --> 03:06:18.279 align:start position:0%
um voters and as has been stated again
 
03:06:21.469 --> 03:06:21.479 align:start position:0%
uh you can readily link to the plrb
 
03:06:23.630 --> 03:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
website where you can see those
 
03:06:28.349 --> 03:06:28.359 align:start position:0%
agreements um lastly I I just heard the
 
03:06:32.269 --> 03:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
The Proposal on the amendment um we
 
03:06:34.510 --> 03:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
would have concerns about that uh as
 
03:06:36.950 --> 03:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
well and and and what that could do to
 
03:06:39.870 --> 03:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
back up the process as it is for both
 
03:06:41.550 --> 03:06:41.560 align:start position:0%
the employers and the employees the
 
03:06:44.229 --> 03:06:44.239 align:start position:0%
negotiating process does take time
 
03:06:46.229 --> 03:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
um in some cases you're starting in the
 
03:06:50.269 --> 03:06:50.279 align:start position:0%
summer before uh you know January um
 
03:06:52.389 --> 03:06:52.399 align:start position:0%
deadline as representative Sullivan
 
03:06:54.429 --> 03:06:54.439 align:start position:0%
indicated and uh you know this could
 
03:06:56.349 --> 03:06:56.359 align:start position:0%
potentially push it back even even
 
03:06:59.389 --> 03:06:59.399 align:start position:0%
further so I'll close my testimony there
 
03:07:01.910 --> 03:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh and um happy to take any
 
03:07:04.910 --> 03:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr Durkin I'm
 
03:07:07.150 --> 03:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
looking for questions online I don't see
 
03:07:08.750 --> 03:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
any hand at this point in the committee
 
03:07:11.150 --> 03:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
room representative seaworth thank you
 
03:07:14.190 --> 03:07:14.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um and thank you Mr hoggins
 
03:07:16.190 --> 03:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
for your uh
 
03:07:20.070 --> 03:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
testimony there was something I I think
 
03:07:22.910 --> 03:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
I heard you said and I'm I'm not clear
 
03:07:25.870 --> 03:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
if I understood it so I'm going to ask
 
03:07:28.830 --> 03:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
for in uh clarification hopefully I'll
 
03:07:32.510 --> 03:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
get to the question uh quickly you you
 
03:07:34.830 --> 03:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
talked a bit about the distinction
 
03:07:37.429 --> 03:07:37.439 align:start position:0%
between the governing body and the
 
03:07:40.229 --> 03:07:40.239 align:start position:0%
legislative body uh which have different
 
03:07:43.070 --> 03:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
roles in in approving specific
 
03:07:45.190 --> 03:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
spefically the legislative body only
 
03:07:48.630 --> 03:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
approves cost items the governing body
 
03:07:51.349 --> 03:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
approves uh the entire
 
03:07:56.389 --> 03:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
agreement as a voter in the town I I
 
03:08:00.269 --> 03:08:00.279 align:start position:0%
have roles in both of those I will in a
 
03:08:02.469 --> 03:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
town meeting town I vote as part of the
 
03:08:05.030 --> 03:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
legislative body I also elect the
 
03:08:09.229 --> 03:08:09.239 align:start position:0%
government body um so I
 
03:08:12.429 --> 03:08:12.439 align:start position:0%
I I'm trying to distinguish between
 
03:08:15.070 --> 03:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
these two roles and what I I thought you
 
03:08:18.630 --> 03:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
implied is that the governing body
 
03:08:21.070 --> 03:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps sharing
 
03:08:23.990 --> 03:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
information about a tenative agreement
 
03:08:26.590 --> 03:08:26.600 align:start position:0%
particularly when they're non-cost items
 
03:08:30.110 --> 03:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
would not be permitted under the current
 
03:08:34.030 --> 03:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
law um because of that conflict because
 
03:08:36.389 --> 03:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
it's not something that as a member of
 
03:08:40.389 --> 03:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
the legisl body I would be voting on is
 
03:08:44.070 --> 03:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
was that your implication or no
 
03:08:46.229 --> 03:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
I to uh thank you for the question
 
03:08:48.870 --> 03:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
represent not not quite um I guess my
 
03:08:53.389 --> 03:08:53.399 align:start position:0%
point in in in saying that was that uh
 
03:08:56.269 --> 03:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
if a tenative agreement is posted I
 
03:09:00.190 --> 03:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
think it could be uh confusing to voters
 
03:09:05.590 --> 03:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
as to um what their role is in voting up
 
03:09:07.750 --> 03:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
or down the warrant uh which contains
 
03:09:11.070 --> 03:09:11.080 align:start position:0%
the cost items and so um that was my
 
03:09:13.630 --> 03:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
point in in saying that um
 
03:09:17.349 --> 03:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
as you said you are voted up or down as
 
03:09:19.990 --> 03:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
a as a select board member or School
 
03:09:23.190 --> 03:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
Board member and uh if if I'm a voter
 
03:09:24.550 --> 03:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
and I don't like the way that you're
 
03:09:27.190 --> 03:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
running the school district or running
 
03:09:29.710 --> 03:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
the town you know that's my opportunity
 
03:09:34.110 --> 03:09:34.120 align:start position:0%
to to vote on that is my
 
03:09:36.670 --> 03:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
point thank you for the clarification
 
03:09:39.269 --> 03:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question any
 
03:09:41.910 --> 03:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
other questions in the committee
 
03:09:48.710 --> 03:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:51.429 --> 03:09:51.439 align:start position:0%
online Christina I don't see any
 
03:09:53.269 --> 03:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
questions on the members on Zoom are
 
03:09:55.030 --> 03:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
there any additional people on Zoom that

establish a study committee that will do

the following first it will compare
 
04:02:56.710 --> 04:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
safety and health standards that the

employees thank you you'll also study
 
04:03:14.510 --> 04:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
the impact adopting um the the impact of
 
04:03:16.950 --> 04:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
adopting OSHA standards would have on
 
04:03:18.389 --> 04:03:18.399 align:start position:0%
public sector
 
04:03:20.990 --> 04:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
employers further it would study the
 
04:03:22.990 --> 04:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
degree to which New Hampshire public
 
04:03:26.389 --> 04:03:26.399 align:start position:0%
sector employers I I had a log back in
 
04:03:28.269 --> 04:03:28.279 align:start position:0%
because I lost my audio for some reason
 
04:03:29.990 --> 04:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
so what's the question excuse me
 
04:03:32.790 --> 04:03:32.800 align:start position:0%
somebody out
 
04:03:34.990 --> 04:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
there is
 
04:03:39.550 --> 04:03:39.560 align:start position:0%
muted you're not presenting please uh
 
04:03:41.510 --> 04:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
keep your microphone muted so we don't
 
04:03:44.710 --> 04:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
interfere with the speaker my apologies
 
04:03:47.630 --> 04:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
representative suin please continue

thank you
 
04:03:53.710 --> 04:03:53.720 align:start position:0%
um let's see where we um you'll study
 
04:03:55.469 --> 04:03:55.479 align:start position:0%
the degree to which New Hampshire public
 
04:03:57.149 --> 04:03:57.159 align:start position:0%
sector employers may be applying
 
04:03:59.590 --> 04:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
standards that exceed the standards
 
04:04:00.990 --> 04:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
currently applied by the New Hampshire
 
04:04:02.070 --> 04:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
04:04:05.429 --> 04:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
Labor um you would finally study the
 
04:04:07.189 --> 04:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
amount of funding that the US Department
 
04:04:10.229 --> 04:04:10.239 align:start position:0%
of Labor would provide to New Hampshire
 
04:04:12.429 --> 04:04:12.439 align:start position:0%
to support the implementation of a state
 
04:04:14.710 --> 04:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
private sector OSHA
 
04:04:18.269 --> 04:04:18.279 align:start position:0%
plan last year I sponsored a bill that
 
04:04:19.710 --> 04:04:19.720 align:start position:0%
would have committed New Hampshire to
 
04:04:21.990 --> 04:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
creating and adopting a state plan for
 
04:04:23.110 --> 04:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
public sector
 
04:04:25.469 --> 04:04:25.479 align:start position:0%
oia in the process of moving the bill
 
04:04:28.070 --> 04:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
through the legislative process um it
 
04:04:29.510 --> 04:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
became apparent that there were many
 
04:04:31.070 --> 04:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
unknowns that made it difficult to
 
04:04:33.189 --> 04:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
commit to a state plan prior to getting
 
04:04:35.670 --> 04:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
answers to those unknowns this study
 
04:04:37.630 --> 04:04:37.640 align:start position:0%
committee will provide the information
 
04:04:40.710 --> 04:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
needed to know what we are committing to
 
04:04:43.229 --> 04:04:43.239 align:start position:0%
it also gives the committee and more
 
04:04:45.149 --> 04:04:45.159 align:start position:0%
importantly the New Hampshire Department
 
04:04:47.670 --> 04:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
of Labor until November of
 
04:04:50.469 --> 04:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
2022 to complete that
 
04:04:53.750 --> 04:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
study in new Hamp in in New Hampshire
 
04:04:55.990 --> 04:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
public sector workers workplaces are
 
04:04:57.990 --> 04:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
covered by RSA
 
04:05:02.910 --> 04:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:05.149 --> 04:05:05.159 align:start position:0%
employees let me give some background on
 
04:05:07.469 --> 04:05:07.479 align:start position:0%
public sector OIP many people are
 
04:05:07.479 --> 04:05:08.870 align:start position:0%
public sector OIP many people are
unaware

04:05:08.870 --> 04:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
unaware
 
04:05:10.710 --> 04:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
that uh public sector employees in New
 
04:05:12.910 --> 04:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire aren't covered by OIP and many
 
04:05:14.550 --> 04:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
people are surprised to find out that
 
04:05:18.710 --> 04:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
they aren't um currently 28 States and
 
04:05:22.469 --> 04:05:22.479 align:start position:0%
territories have a state oia plan 22 of
 
04:05:25.149 --> 04:05:25.159 align:start position:0%
those plans I believe were established
 
04:05:28.750 --> 04:05:28.760 align:start position:0%
when the um when the Act was first um
 
04:05:32.389 --> 04:05:32.399 align:start position:0%
passed by Congress and those 22 plans
 
04:05:34.389 --> 04:05:34.399 align:start position:0%
cover private and public sector
 
04:05:37.189 --> 04:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
workplaces so essentially the state
 
04:05:40.349 --> 04:05:40.359 align:start position:0%
applies the oia standards to all
 
04:05:44.990 --> 04:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
employees in those States 22 States six
 
04:05:48.670 --> 04:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
plans which I believe were adopted um
 
04:05:52.590 --> 04:05:52.600 align:start position:0%
sometime after the um uh the Act was
 
04:05:56.229 --> 04:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
passed um six plan Six States cover only
 
04:05:59.590 --> 04:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
public sector workplaces Federal ocean
 
04:06:01.950 --> 04:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
covers private sector work uh work sites
 
04:06:05.990 --> 04:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
in the states and the and and the state
 
04:06:09.110 --> 04:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
um covers the state uh work workers but
 
04:06:11.469 --> 04:06:11.479 align:start position:0%
applies the OSHA standards that is a
 
04:06:14.030 --> 04:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
type of plan that um I would propose for
 
04:06:16.830 --> 04:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we would continue to let
 
04:06:20.750 --> 04:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
the the federal osia cover um private
 
04:06:23.550 --> 04:06:23.560 align:start position:0%
sector workers um but we would create a
 
04:06:26.590 --> 04:06:26.600 align:start position:0%
plan that would have public sector
 
04:06:28.950 --> 04:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
workers also covered by oia standards
 
04:06:30.269 --> 04:06:30.279 align:start position:0%
but applied by the New Hampshire
 
04:06:32.030 --> 04:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
04:06:32.040 --> 04:06:33.590 align:start position:0%
Department of

04:06:33.590 --> 04:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
Labor
 
04:06:36.429 --> 04:06:36.439 align:start position:0%
um adopting an oous uh state plan for
 
04:06:38.550 --> 04:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
public sector workplaces would leave
 
04:06:40.070 --> 04:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
public sector health and safety in the
 
04:06:42.269 --> 04:06:42.279 align:start position:0%
hands of the New Hampshire do but would
 
04:06:44.550 --> 04:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
use OSHA safety St safety and health
 
04:06:47.349 --> 04:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
standards for public sector
 
04:06:50.229 --> 04:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
employees the federal oan program would
 
04:06:53.229 --> 04:06:53.239 align:start position:0%
continue to cover the private sector
 
04:06:55.630 --> 04:06:55.640 align:start position:0%
workplaces the new state plan would
 
04:06:58.309 --> 04:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
cover State County Municipal and public
 
04:06:58.319 --> 04:07:00.110 align:start position:0%

points the enhancements to the current
 
04:07:07.309 --> 04:07:07.319 align:start position:0%

04:07:11.110 --> 04:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
by a 50-50 matched funding from the
 
04:07:13.070 --> 04:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
Federal Department of Labor so we would
 
04:07:15.070 --> 04:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
be getting federal dollars to help
 
04:07:15.080 --> 04:07:16.149 align:start position:0%
be getting federal dollars to help
support

04:07:16.149 --> 04:07:16.159 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:07:18.950 --> 04:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
this penalties and fines however would
 
04:07:20.349 --> 04:07:20.359 align:start position:0%
be established through the process of
 
04:07:22.429 --> 04:07:22.439 align:start position:0%
developing the state plan and enforced
 
04:07:24.189 --> 04:07:24.199 align:start position:0%
by the New Hampshire Department of Labor
 
04:07:25.990 --> 04:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
just as the New Hampshire Department of
 
04:07:29.910 --> 04:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
Labor um addresses violations in health
 
04:07:31.910 --> 04:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
um health and safety standards
 
04:07:34.630 --> 04:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
today the feds do not mandate any
 
04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
specific levels of fines or
 
04:07:39.550 --> 04:07:39.560 align:start position:0%
penalties by developing an ocean state
 
04:07:42.269 --> 04:07:42.279 align:start position:0%
plan for the public sector the 50/50
 
04:07:44.710 --> 04:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
funding will provide resources that we
 
04:07:46.950 --> 04:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
presently don't have these resources
 
04:07:48.590 --> 04:07:48.600 align:start position:0%
would likely include some additional
 
04:07:51.109 --> 04:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
Staffing but the cost of that Staffing
 
04:07:53.469 --> 04:07:53.479 align:start position:0%
will more will more than be offset by
 
04:07:57.950 --> 04:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:00.469 --> 04:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
funds once in place the New Hampshire
 
04:08:02.670 --> 04:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
State OSHA plan will provide the
 
04:08:05.109 --> 04:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
following enhanced health and safety
 
04:08:07.149 --> 04:08:07.159 align:start position:0%
standards at least as strong as the OSHA
 
04:08:07.159 --> 04:08:08.429 align:start position:0%
standards at least as strong as the OSHA
standards

04:08:08.429 --> 04:08:08.439 align:start position:0%
standards
 
04:08:10.429 --> 04:08:10.439 align:start position:0%
enhanced training for inspectors
 
04:08:11.910 --> 04:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
employers and
 
04:08:14.389 --> 04:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
employees enhanced inspection and
 
04:08:17.389 --> 04:08:17.399 align:start position:0%
investigation procedures the 50-50 uh
 
04:08:19.309 --> 04:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
federal state funding to cover any
 
04:08:21.550 --> 04:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
additional costs and part of the costs
 
04:08:23.070 --> 04:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
that the New Hampshire Department of
 
04:08:25.550 --> 04:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
Labor presently spends on public sector
 
04:08:28.950 --> 04:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
health and safety it further offer a
 
04:08:31.389 --> 04:08:31.399 align:start position:0%
consultancy program new to the public
 
04:08:34.070 --> 04:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
sector that sends a consultant to a work
 
04:08:36.630 --> 04:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
site to provide guidance to employers
 
04:08:38.469 --> 04:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
who want to be Pro proactive about
 
04:08:41.070 --> 04:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
making sure the workplace is safe this
 
04:08:43.149 --> 04:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
is not an inspection so it allows an
 
04:08:45.269 --> 04:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
employer to improve workplace safety
 
04:08:46.910 --> 04:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
without risk of a
 
04:08:49.910 --> 04:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
penalty if we eventually adopt State a
 
04:08:52.309 --> 04:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
state plan for public sector workplaces
 
04:08:54.670 --> 04:08:54.680 align:start position:0%
we will improve workplace safety bring
 
04:08:56.189 --> 04:08:56.199 align:start position:0%
Federal funding back to New Hampshire
 
04:08:58.349 --> 04:08:58.359 align:start position:0%
from Washington and through that funding
 
04:08:59.950 --> 04:08:59.960 align:start position:0%
will'll provide resources to our
 
04:09:01.670 --> 04:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
department of labor to conduct
 
04:09:04.030 --> 04:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
inspections and investigations at a
 
04:09:06.990 --> 04:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
higher level than ever I emphasize this
 
04:09:09.670 --> 04:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
is a study committee it will allow us to
 
04:09:12.309 --> 04:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
make um a fully informed decision if a
 
04:09:14.070 --> 04:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
public sector oan legislation is
 
04:09:16.189 --> 04:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
proposed in
 
04:09:18.790 --> 04:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
20123 and uh with that I will be happy
 
04:09:21.630 --> 04:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:24.630 --> 04:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative are
 
04:09:31.309 --> 04:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:34.429 --> 04:09:34.439 align:start position:0%
bill I see none in the committee
 
04:09:42.790 --> 04:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:45.990 --> 04:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
online one last time any questions for
 
04:09:46.000 --> 04:09:47.950 align:start position:0%
online one last time any questions for
the

04:09:47.950 --> 04:09:47.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:09:52.469 --> 04:09:52.479 align:start position:0%
sponsor seeing none thank you but oh
 
04:09:56.149 --> 04:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
I Samantha Wooten is has her hand raised
 
04:09:58.030 --> 04:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
will she be uh someone who wants to
 
04:10:03.109 --> 04:10:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:06.109 --> 04:10:06.119 align:start position:0%
testifying I have a question
 
04:10:08.269 --> 04:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
04:10:12.269 --> 04:10:12.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um this we heard a
 
04:10:15.349 --> 04:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
great a great many comments on this when
 
04:10:18.309 --> 04:10:18.319 align:start position:0%
we brought this forward before it um it
 
04:10:22.070 --> 04:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
appeared to be a really um big process
 
04:10:23.510 --> 04:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
that we would have to do but we heard
 
04:10:26.870 --> 04:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
from um Rudy Ogden on this as well do
 
04:10:28.870 --> 04:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
you remember some of his comments on
 
04:10:31.469 --> 04:10:31.479 align:start position:0%
this I believe Rudy Ogden will be um
 
04:10:34.030 --> 04:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
testifying later so um I guess I will
 
04:10:38.469 --> 04:10:38.479 align:start position:0%
let him speak for himself um and um uh
 
04:10:40.950 --> 04:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
leave leave that for later but um I I
 
04:10:43.950 --> 04:10:43.960 align:start position:0%
would agree that this is a u a fairly
 
04:10:46.229 --> 04:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
involved process it would take several
 
04:10:47.750 --> 04:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
years even if we were fully committed
 
04:10:49.590 --> 04:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
now and frankly the the work of the
 
04:10:51.590 --> 04:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
study committee is work that we would
 
04:10:54.550 --> 04:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
have to do um if we had made the
 
04:10:56.429 --> 04:10:56.439 align:start position:0%
commitment so essentially we're getting
 
04:11:00.149 --> 04:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
a jump start on the um learning process
 
04:11:02.030 --> 04:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
um before we make a full commitment to
 
04:11:05.990 --> 04:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
the U public sector OIP U plan so thank
 
04:11:10.469 --> 04:11:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:15.510 --> 04:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:18.870 --> 04:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
spor seeing none thank you again for
 
04:11:18.880 --> 04:11:20.109 align:start position:0%
spor seeing none thank you again for
your

04:11:20.109 --> 04:11:20.119 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:11:24.870 --> 04:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
testimony um I now uh have signed up
 
04:11:28.710 --> 04:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
ahead ahead of time Susie Nord a member
 
04:11:32.710 --> 04:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
of the public in support of this
 
04:11:35.710 --> 04:11:35.720 align:start position:0%
bill and if there's someone that could
 
04:11:38.070 --> 04:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
help I think she needs to be promoted so
 
04:11:40.790 --> 04:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
she can speak there I see you are
 
04:11:42.630 --> 04:11:42.640 align:start position:0%

my name is Susie Nord and I work for the
 
04:11:51.389 --> 04:11:51.399 align:start position:0%
National Council for occupational safety
 
04:11:54.030 --> 04:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
and health and I apologize my computer
 
04:11:57.550 --> 04:11:57.560 align:start position:0%
is getting messages so we may hear beeps
 
04:11:59.109 --> 04:11:59.119 align:start position:0%
unfortunately if I mute that you won't
 
04:12:01.990 --> 04:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
hear me um so anyway the National
 
04:12:03.550 --> 04:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
Council for occupational safety and
 
04:12:06.229 --> 04:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
health or national Kos our mission is to
 
04:12:08.469 --> 04:12:08.479 align:start position:0%
advance worker health and safety through
 
04:12:11.389 --> 04:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
training education research and advocacy
 
04:12:15.670 --> 04:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
we support the um the bill
 
04:12:18.309 --> 04:12:18.319 align:start position:0%
because there
 
04:12:18.319 --> 04:12:20.269 align:start position:0%
because there
is

04:12:20.269 --> 04:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:12:23.990 --> 04:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
currently in there's currently statutes
 
04:12:24.000 --> 04:12:25.149 align:start position:0%
currently in there's currently statutes
on

04:12:25.149 --> 04:12:25.159 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:12:28.870 --> 04:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
the um on the books
 
04:12:32.269 --> 04:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
which sorry I'm a little distracted by
 
04:12:33.950 --> 04:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
the messages on my computer I'm not used
 
04:12:39.469 --> 04:12:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:41.790 --> 04:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
or oh my goodness let me start over
 
04:12:44.550 --> 04:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
again so we're in favor of public sector
 
04:12:48.349 --> 04:12:48.359 align:start position:0%
OSHA's State plans um because they do a
 
04:12:50.750 --> 04:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
couple of things right
 
04:12:53.830 --> 04:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
now public sector employees are under
 
04:12:55.910 --> 04:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction of the Department of
 
04:12:57.389 --> 04:12:57.399 align:start position:0%
Labor the New Hampshire Department of
 
04:13:00.630 --> 04:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
Labor and that was um has been the case
 
04:13:03.109 --> 04:13:03.119 align:start position:0%
for actually I believe several decades
 
04:13:05.950 --> 04:13:05.960 align:start position:0%
but it is it was only put into Statute
 
04:13:09.229 --> 04:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
in 2019 actually by this committee and
 
04:13:11.670 --> 04:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
um at that time the testimony of the
 
04:13:13.349 --> 04:13:13.359 align:start position:0%
department was that they did the best
 
04:13:14.790 --> 04:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
that they could with the resources that
 
04:13:16.830 --> 04:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
they had but that they understood that
 
04:13:19.469 --> 04:13:19.479 align:start position:0%
there is certainly um a PRI the the
 
04:13:21.510 --> 04:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
federal oosha certainly does a much more
 
04:13:25.309 --> 04:13:25.319 align:start position:0%
robust investigation of um any incidents
 
04:13:29.990 --> 04:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
and workplace traumas so um that's one
 
04:13:32.510 --> 04:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why um and I believe
 
04:13:34.750 --> 04:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
you'll hear from Samantha Wooten later
 
04:13:36.870 --> 04:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
and I'll let her speak for herself but
 
04:13:38.950 --> 04:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons um her
 
04:13:38.960 --> 04:13:40.750 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons um her
father's

04:13:40.750 --> 04:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
father's
 
04:13:40.760 --> 04:13:42.469 align:start position:0%
father's
um

04:13:42.469 --> 04:13:42.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:45.550 --> 04:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
fatality really brought to light the
 
04:13:47.349 --> 04:13:47.359 align:start position:0%
shortcomings of what the New Hampshire
 
04:13:49.229 --> 04:13:49.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor is able to do with
 
04:13:52.149 --> 04:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
the resources that it has to allocate
 
04:13:57.469 --> 04:13:57.479 align:start position:0%
and um you know the state plan is it's
 
04:14:00.070 --> 04:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's as representative Sullivan said
 
04:14:03.550 --> 04:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
many many states have them um States
 
04:14:05.950 --> 04:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
from all over the country of diff of all
 
04:14:10.149 --> 04:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
different politic iCal um bents as you
 
04:14:13.070 --> 04:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
will um it's really it's it's a it's a
 
04:14:16.750 --> 04:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan issue because the the um
 
04:14:19.109 --> 04:14:19.119 align:start position:0%
original OSHA plan which was passed
 
04:14:21.670 --> 04:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
actually 50 years ago this year it went
 
04:14:24.109 --> 04:14:24.119 align:start position:0%
into effect didn't cover public
 
04:14:26.630 --> 04:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
employees because it didn't want to
 
04:14:29.870 --> 04:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
bring big government down on the states
 
04:14:31.990 --> 04:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
and towns it wanted the the states to
 
04:14:34.550 --> 04:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
take care of themselves and to figure
 
04:14:36.870 --> 04:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
this out themselves and New Hampshire I
 
04:14:38.510 --> 04:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
don't believe they did it 50 years ago
 
04:14:40.750 --> 04:14:40.760 align:start position:0%
but I think it was 20 or 30 years ago
 
04:14:43.910 --> 04:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
did put some information that at the
 
04:14:46.830 --> 04:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
time matched what OSHA was doing into
 
04:14:48.510 --> 04:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and thought that
 
04:14:50.750 --> 04:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
that was enough because we in New
 
04:14:53.750 --> 04:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire believe in minimal government
 
04:14:56.149 --> 04:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
interference um but the problem with
 
04:15:00.349 --> 04:15:00.359 align:start position:0%
that has been that it's much harder for
 
04:15:03.550 --> 04:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
public employers to know what their um
 
04:15:06.229 --> 04:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are it's much harder
 
04:15:09.830 --> 04:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Labor to keep up
 
04:15:11.389 --> 04:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
with what the latest and greatest that
 
04:15:13.070 --> 04:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
is going on at the federal level because
 
04:15:16.030 --> 04:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
the federal government has the resources
 
04:15:19.229 --> 04:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
to hear um to put in new standards and
 
04:15:22.590 --> 04:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
to understand what um what the the
 
04:15:28.309 --> 04:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
latest um research is on occupational um
 
04:15:33.550 --> 04:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
hazards um so we 100% support this this
 
04:15:35.870 --> 04:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
has always been sort of a tail wagging
 
04:15:37.550 --> 04:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
the dog um
 
04:15:39.630 --> 04:15:39.640 align:start position:0%
or you know
 
04:15:42.670 --> 04:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
because they don't need to
 
04:15:45.109 --> 04:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
have legislation to start I mean the
 
04:15:47.070 --> 04:15:47.080 align:start position:0%
governor could say let's do this and
 
04:15:49.309 --> 04:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
tell the Department of Labor to do it
 
04:15:50.910 --> 04:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
however the Department of Labor couldn't
 
04:15:53.309 --> 04:15:53.319 align:start position:0%
do it without knowing the information
 
04:15:56.630 --> 04:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
that this study committee is designed to
 
04:15:59.070 --> 04:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
um to find out because obviously you
 
04:16:00.389 --> 04:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
don't want to say yes we want to do
 
04:16:03.670 --> 04:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
something and find out that it costs you
 
04:16:05.710 --> 04:16:05.720 align:start position:0%
know you I don't even know what the
 
04:16:08.389 --> 04:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
scale would be but the thing is is that
 
04:16:10.910 --> 04:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
in the interim while there aren't um
 
04:16:12.510 --> 04:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
OSHA standards in place for New
 
04:16:14.910 --> 04:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire different departments and
 
04:16:17.550 --> 04:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
different municipalities and different
 
04:16:21.070 --> 04:16:21.080 align:start position:0%
Industries such as um the First
 
04:16:24.229 --> 04:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
Responders police and fire all have some
 
04:16:26.950 --> 04:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
form of professional safety standards in
 
04:16:28.870 --> 04:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
place and so one of the things that this
 
04:16:31.550 --> 04:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
will do is to understand where we are
 
04:16:34.469 --> 04:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
versus where we need to be to qualify
 
04:16:37.189 --> 04:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
for the matching funds which would lower
 
04:16:39.590 --> 04:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
the cost of a what we're doing now and
 
04:16:41.670 --> 04:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
enable the state of New Hampshire to
 
04:16:43.870 --> 04:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
offer resources to our smaller towns and
 
04:16:47.790 --> 04:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
cities and school districts and um fire
 
04:16:49.830 --> 04:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
departments and that they don't
 
04:16:51.950 --> 04:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
currently have through this consultancy
 
04:16:54.670 --> 04:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
program and so the national C supports
 
04:16:57.070 --> 04:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
this bill 100% and we'll do anything
 
04:16:59.710 --> 04:16:59.720 align:start position:0%
that we can to help with the committee
 
04:17:03.149 --> 04:17:03.159 align:start position:0%
and um any questions that anybody has
 
04:17:06.229 --> 04:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
about it that I can find out so and with
 
04:17:07.790 --> 04:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
that I'll leave it I apologize for
 
04:17:10.710 --> 04:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
getting tripped up at the beginning um I
 
04:17:13.590 --> 04:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
stopped work to to be here and work
 
04:17:16.030 --> 04:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
didn't stop me so I
 
04:17:18.030 --> 04:17:18.040 align:start position:0%
apologize all right thank you for your
 
04:17:20.830 --> 04:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
testimony are there any questions for
 
04:17:20.840 --> 04:17:22.550 align:start position:0%
testimony are there any questions for
this

04:17:22.550 --> 04:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:17:24.750 --> 04:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none in the committee
 
04:17:29.429 --> 04:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
room are is there anyone online with a
 
04:17:31.950 --> 04:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
question no hands up
 
04:17:35.710 --> 04:17:35.720 align:start position:0%
today thank you very much and thank you
 
04:17:37.590 --> 04:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
Miss Nord for your
 
04:17:41.429 --> 04:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
testimony um next up on my list I have
 
04:17:43.510 --> 04:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner Rudy
 
04:17:43.520 --> 04:17:45.070 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner Rudy
Ogden

04:17:45.070 --> 04:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
Ogden
 
04:17:50.550 --> 04:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh he is neutral on this bill um but can
 
04:17:54.070 --> 04:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
inform us as to what is going
 
04:17:57.710 --> 04:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
on go ahead Mr Ogden uh good afternoon
 
04:17:59.590 --> 04:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for allowing me the
 
04:18:02.590 --> 04:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak to this um to be
 
04:18:04.830 --> 04:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
clear this was a conversation in the
 
04:18:08.109 --> 04:18:08.119 align:start position:0%
last uh session talked extensively about
 
04:18:10.030 --> 04:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
this concept of moving towards an Noha
 
04:18:12.710 --> 04:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
state plan um as representative Sullivan
 
04:18:14.670 --> 04:18:14.680 align:start position:0%
indicated in his introduction of this
 
04:18:17.309 --> 04:18:17.319 align:start position:0%
bill in that discussion there were many
 
04:18:20.269 --> 04:18:20.279 align:start position:0%
questions related to how far off are we
 
04:18:22.870 --> 04:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
how much do our standards need to change
 
04:18:25.109 --> 04:18:25.119 align:start position:0%
where are the cities and towns at
 
04:18:27.950 --> 04:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
relative to existing OSHA standards so I
 
04:18:30.109 --> 04:18:30.119 align:start position:0%
would say that I think that the work um
 
04:18:32.109 --> 04:18:32.119 align:start position:0%
contemplated by this study committee
 
04:18:34.710 --> 04:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
committee would be work well worth it in
 
04:18:36.149 --> 04:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
the sense that these are things that
 
04:18:38.670 --> 04:18:38.680 align:start position:0%
should be answer should be looked at uh
 
04:18:40.189 --> 04:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
and that would allow individuals to make
 
04:18:42.950 --> 04:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
a more informed decision going forward
 
04:18:46.389 --> 04:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
relative to the move towards OSHA State
 
04:18:49.070 --> 04:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
Standards um I would note it was spoken
 
04:18:50.830 --> 04:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
to the fact that the Department of Labor
 
04:18:53.469 --> 04:18:53.479 align:start position:0%
recognizes that it should in and uh has
 
04:18:56.030 --> 04:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
to do a better job relative to safety
 
04:18:57.590 --> 04:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's something that we you know I think
 
04:18:59.309 --> 04:18:59.319 align:start position:0%
that every day we try and strive towards
 
04:19:02.389 --> 04:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
doing more uh across all areas of our
 
04:19:04.309 --> 04:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
agency's activities but specific to
 
04:19:06.189 --> 04:19:06.199 align:start position:0%
safety it it is a function in which
 
04:19:07.870 --> 04:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
we've tried to make improvements over
 
04:19:09.910 --> 04:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
the last few years I think we have made
 
04:19:11.670 --> 04:19:11.680 align:start position:0%
improvements but certainly there's
 
04:19:13.990 --> 04:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
improvements that still have to be made
 
04:19:15.870 --> 04:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
um I do think that this type of study
 
04:19:17.990 --> 04:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
committee would help inform certain of
 
04:19:20.269 --> 04:19:20.279 align:start position:0%
those improvements regardless of whether
 
04:19:22.349 --> 04:19:22.359 align:start position:0%
ultimately an OSHA state plan is adopted
 
04:19:24.550 --> 04:19:24.560 align:start position:0%
I think this worth work would be worth
 
04:19:26.990 --> 04:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
it in the sense of uh giving us a better
 
04:19:28.910 --> 04:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
barometer of where things are at and
 
04:19:31.070 --> 04:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
where they should be I'm happy to take
 
04:19:31.080 --> 04:19:32.189 align:start position:0%
where they should be I'm happy to take
any

04:19:32.189 --> 04:19:32.199 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:19:34.510 --> 04:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
04:19:36.309 --> 04:19:36.319 align:start position:0%
are there questions for Deputy
 
04:19:36.319 --> 04:19:39.710 align:start position:0%
are there questions for Deputy
Commissioner

04:19:39.710 --> 04:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:43.030 --> 04:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
Ogden I see none in the committee room
 
04:19:50.550 --> 04:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:54.510 --> 04:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
raised um so thank you very much Deputy
 
04:19:56.910 --> 04:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioner for your
 
04:20:00.030 --> 04:20:00.040 align:start position:0%
testimony at this point we've gone
 
04:20:03.229 --> 04:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
through all the um people who have
 
04:20:06.710 --> 04:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
signed up to testify ahead of time and I
 
04:20:09.149 --> 04:20:09.159 align:start position:0%
want to see if there's uh members of the
 
04:20:12.349 --> 04:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
public who or uh members of the
 
04:20:15.469 --> 04:20:15.479 align:start position:0%
legislature that are online and want to
 
04:20:17.830 --> 04:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
speak but did not sign
 
04:20:25.510 --> 04:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:29.670 --> 04:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
me right
 
04:20:32.309 --> 04:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you uh Mr chairman
 
04:20:33.630 --> 04:20:33.640 align:start position:0%
members of the committee again for the
 
04:20:35.710 --> 04:20:35.720 align:start position:0%
record Jim Durkin legislative agent for
 
04:20:38.550 --> 04:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
ask me Council 93 representing 4,000
 
04:20:40.750 --> 04:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
public sector workers in New Hampshire
 
04:20:43.030 --> 04:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
I'll be very brief uh we're strongly in
 
04:20:45.990 --> 04:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
favor of this legislation and we thank
 
04:20:48.429 --> 04:20:48.439 align:start position:0%
and commend uh representative Sullivan
 
04:20:50.750 --> 04:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
and the many co-sponsors for for filing
 
04:20:54.990 --> 04:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
it uh look it it just seems ludicrous
 
04:20:57.149 --> 04:20:57.159 align:start position:0%
that we would have one set of standards
 
04:21:00.750 --> 04:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
for the private sector and a separate uh
 
04:21:03.870 --> 04:21:03.880 align:start position:0%
probably lesser set of standards for uh
 
04:21:06.269 --> 04:21:06.279 align:start position:0%
the people in the public sector um again
 
04:21:08.670 --> 04:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
this is just a study who realized that a
 
04:21:12.269 --> 04:21:12.279 align:start position:0%
lot of work would uh need to be done and
 
04:21:14.670 --> 04:21:14.680 align:start position:0%
some uh substantial money would need to
 
04:21:16.670 --> 04:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
be expended to actually Implement
 
04:21:19.469 --> 04:21:19.479 align:start position:0%
something like this down the road uh but
 
04:21:21.429 --> 04:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
there's clearly it's hard to argue
 
04:21:23.429 --> 04:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
against the need to study this and put a
 
04:21:26.830 --> 04:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
plan in place uh I think uh you know es
 
04:21:29.030 --> 04:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
especially the the need for this has
 
04:21:32.070 --> 04:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
always been there uh but now with the
 
04:21:35.429 --> 04:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
the covid-19 uh pandemic uh I think it
 
04:21:38.349 --> 04:21:38.359 align:start position:0%
it becomes even stronger and clearer uh
 
04:21:40.269 --> 04:21:40.279 align:start position:0%
that we need to get a good system in
 
04:21:42.990 --> 04:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
place to protect public sector workers I
 
04:21:44.469 --> 04:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
thank you again for your
 
04:21:47.710 --> 04:21:47.720 align:start position:0%
time thank you very much for your are
 
04:21:51.630 --> 04:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:54.229 --> 04:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
questions I see no hands raised in the
 
04:21:58.389 --> 04:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
committee room any questions from
 
04:22:01.710 --> 04:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
online seeing none thank you again for
 
04:22:01.720 --> 04:22:03.070 align:start position:0%
online seeing none thank you again for
your

04:26:13.269 --> 04:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
to speak before you again I'm here in
 
04:26:15.790 --> 04:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill
 
04:26:20.109 --> 04:26:20.119 align:start position:0%
448 on July 21st of 2016 my life was
 
04:26:23.269 --> 04:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
forever changed my father Tom won worked
 
04:26:25.269 --> 04:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
for the town of northfield's Department
 
04:26:27.590 --> 04:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
of Public Works and on this day the
 
04:26:29.229 --> 04:26:29.239 align:start position:0%
employees were moving a trailer with a
 
04:26:31.550 --> 04:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
bucket in a backo there were two
 
04:26:34.590 --> 04:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
equipment operators and two flaggers my
 
04:26:36.790 --> 04:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
dad was one of the flaggers
 
04:26:39.149 --> 04:26:39.159 align:start position:0%
while approaching the end location my
 
04:26:41.870 --> 04:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
father was fatally pinned between the
 
04:26:43.630 --> 04:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
trailer and the
 
04:26:46.710 --> 04:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
loader excuse me I apologize um it is
 
04:26:49.070 --> 04:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
still unclear how and why my father is
 
04:26:51.790 --> 04:26:51.800 align:start position:0%
caught in between the two machines the
 
04:26:53.990 --> 04:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
accident crushed his pelvis causing
 
04:26:57.149 --> 04:26:57.159 align:start position:0%
internal injuries that killed him I am
 
04:27:00.030 --> 04:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
by no means an expert on workplace
 
04:27:02.950 --> 04:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
safety however I am taking the necessary
 
04:27:05.070 --> 04:27:05.080 align:start position:0%
steps to gain the Insight while
 
04:27:08.550 --> 04:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
obtaining my m 's degree in occupational
 
04:27:10.910 --> 04:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
safety I would have thought that since
 
04:27:13.349 --> 04:27:13.359 align:start position:0%
this accident resulted in the tragic and
 
04:27:16.229 --> 04:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
untimely death of my healthy father
 
04:27:18.030 --> 04:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
there would have been a thorough
 
04:27:20.429 --> 04:27:20.439 align:start position:0%
investigation or potentially a root
 
04:27:24.510 --> 04:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
cause analysis I was proven wrong I do
 
04:27:25.950 --> 04:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
not place blame on the town of
 
04:27:28.590 --> 04:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
Northfield or the Department of Labor I
 
04:27:30.750 --> 04:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
believe they did the best they could
 
04:27:32.429 --> 04:27:32.439 align:start position:0%
with the funding and administrative
 
04:27:35.630 --> 04:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
support they had behind them at the time
 
04:27:38.189 --> 04:27:38.199 align:start position:0%
if the state of New Hampshire more
 
04:27:40.189 --> 04:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
specifically the town of Northfield were
 
04:27:43.870 --> 04:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
held to the same standards I may know
 
04:27:45.830 --> 04:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
what it would happened to my dad I still
 
04:27:48.950 --> 04:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
may not that's obvious that's an issue
 
04:27:51.269 --> 04:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
as well but there was no accident
 
04:27:53.309 --> 04:27:53.319 align:start position:0%
reconstruction to find out what happened
 
04:27:55.790 --> 04:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
there was no follow-up interviews with
 
04:27:58.670 --> 04:27:58.680 align:start position:0%
the employees that were on scene and
 
04:28:00.550 --> 04:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
again i' would like to say I understand
 
04:28:02.269 --> 04:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Labor did not
 
04:28:06.269 --> 04:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
have the capability to do that the lack
 
04:28:08.109 --> 04:28:08.119 align:start position:0%
of Investigation however did make me
 
04:28:11.269 --> 04:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
feel as though my father's death meant
 
04:28:12.990 --> 04:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
nothing and it was somehow not as
 
04:28:15.149 --> 04:28:15.159 align:start position:0%
important as a public sector employee
 
04:28:18.149 --> 04:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
where OSHA has jurisdiction if this was
 
04:28:20.389 --> 04:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
a private sector business OSHA would
 
04:28:22.429 --> 04:28:22.439 align:start position:0%
have been there almost immediately
 
04:28:24.189 --> 04:28:24.199 align:start position:0%
beginning an investigation and
 
04:28:26.389 --> 04:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
implementing a plan of action to ensure
 
04:28:28.309 --> 04:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
that a tragic accident like my father's
 
04:28:30.910 --> 04:28:30.920 align:start position:0%
would not happen again throughout my
 
04:28:33.590 --> 04:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
journey from my father's passing up
 
04:28:35.990 --> 04:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
until this day I have met so many
 
04:28:37.710 --> 04:28:37.720 align:start position:0%
incredible individuals who work
 
04:28:40.109 --> 04:28:40.119 align:start position:0%
tirelessly to ensure the safety of
 
04:28:43.429 --> 04:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
others safety and occupational in the
 
04:28:45.830 --> 04:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
occupational stance is oftentimes pushed
 
04:28:47.429 --> 04:28:47.439 align:start position:0%
to the sidelines because it comes with
 
04:28:49.710 --> 04:28:49.720 align:start position:0%
an expense or may stall a project
 
04:28:52.149 --> 04:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
deadline but I truly want you all to
 
04:28:54.229 --> 04:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
think about the ones you love is there a
 
04:28:55.910 --> 04:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
price you would pay to ensure they
 
04:28:58.550 --> 04:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
returned home safely every
 
04:29:01.750 --> 04:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
day clearly this is a painful topic for
 
04:29:04.309 --> 04:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
me to discuss and even more painful to
 
04:29:07.149 --> 04:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
live my life without seeing my dad's
 
04:29:10.109 --> 04:29:10.119 align:start position:0%
bright eyes and handsome smile I'm using
 
04:29:12.349 --> 04:29:12.359 align:start position:0%
my voice today and every day because I
 
04:29:14.590 --> 04:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
do not want another daughter to feel the
 
04:29:17.590 --> 04:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
heartache that I feel daily I believe
 
04:29:20.349 --> 04:29:20.359 align:start position:0%
it's time for action and it needs to be
 
04:29:22.590 --> 04:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
clear that every worker in whatever
 
04:29:24.389 --> 04:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
capacity they are employed should have
 
04:29:27.790 --> 04:29:27.800 align:start position:0%
the same basic safety rights on a side
 
04:29:31.149 --> 04:29:31.159 align:start position:0%
note I also agree that this is a
 
04:29:35.309 --> 04:29:35.319 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan issue safety is nonpartisan
 
04:29:38.149 --> 04:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
I I have spoken time and time again with
 
04:29:40.670 --> 04:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
the governor and he supports the
 
04:29:43.750 --> 04:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
committee I just it's important to take
 
04:29:46.229 --> 04:29:46.239 align:start position:0%

04:29:49.070 --> 04:29:49.080 align:start position:0%

04:57:58.310 --> 04:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
P so I'm guessing when if I were to log
 
04:58:01.510 --> 04:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
on to zoom just like you two
 
04:58:05.670 --> 04:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
are Christina could probably give us the
 
04:58:08.628 --> 04:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
control yes to do this
 
04:58:10.670 --> 04:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
stuff that something we want to under
 
04:58:15.270 --> 04:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
take me no no we oh we we oh
 
04:58:17.788 --> 04:58:17.798 align:start position:0%
yeah I think think between a bunch of us
 
04:58:19.470 --> 04:58:19.480 align:start position:0%
and figured it
 
04:58:21.990 --> 04:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
out thank you do I hear volunteers to
 
04:58:22.000 --> 04:58:24.708 align:start position:0%
out thank you do I hear volunteers to
take

04:58:24.708 --> 04:58:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:30.788 --> 04:58:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:33.310 --> 04:58:33.320 align:start position:0%
it because after you know we're going to
 
04:58:34.948 --> 04:58:34.958 align:start position:0%
we're going to be able to finish
 
04:58:38.230 --> 04:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
probably our hearings in three sets
 
04:58:42.390 --> 04:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
three days then after that much of it's
 
04:58:46.190 --> 04:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
going to be some um executive sessions
 
04:58:49.310 --> 04:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
for us so at this point the public can
 
04:58:51.910 --> 04:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
listen and then it's just the
 
04:58:54.708 --> 04:58:54.718 align:start position:0%
representatives um so that that I can
 
04:58:57.070 --> 04:58:57.080 align:start position:0%
see being a little easier I just gotta
 
04:59:00.270 --> 04:59:00.280 align:start position:0%
somehow get some find some tutorial
 
04:59:02.110 --> 04:59:02.120 align:start position:0%
whether Christina you can find me one I
 
04:59:04.270 --> 04:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
looked on YouTube YouTu and and zoom and
 
04:59:07.430 --> 04:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
I could not find one that shows me how
 
04:59:10.470 --> 04:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
to manage what you're doing
 
04:59:16.110 --> 04:59:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:18.310 --> 04:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
something Mr
 
04:59:21.590 --> 04:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
chairman um I had a I had a I had a
 
04:59:23.470 --> 04:59:23.480 align:start position:0%
brief session with Christina and a few
 
04:59:25.590 --> 04:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
just a handful of other members and she
 
04:59:28.750 --> 04:59:28.760 align:start position:0%
was very informative and uh as far as
 
04:59:30.430 --> 04:59:30.440 align:start position:0%
promoting and demoting that sort of
 
04:59:32.190 --> 04:59:32.200 align:start position:0%
thing it's really just a couple of
 
04:59:32.200 --> 04:59:33.990 align:start position:0%
thing it's really just a couple of
clicks

04:59:33.990 --> 04:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
clicks
 
04:59:35.750 --> 04:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
all right excellent so in case anyone
 
04:59:38.270 --> 04:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
didn't know Mike represent kahill has
 
04:59:44.350 --> 04:59:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:47.910 --> 04:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
so yeah thanks uh M Mr chairman the
 
04:59:49.310 --> 04:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
other point I'd like to make is far as
 
04:59:52.510 --> 04:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
executive sessions we've often had um
 
04:59:54.590 --> 04:59:54.600 align:start position:0%
people from the agencies or other
 
04:59:56.310 --> 04:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
interested parties that sometimes put
 
04:59:59.948 --> 04:59:59.958 align:start position:0%
their two cents and and U sometimes it's
 
05:00:02.708 --> 05:00:02.718 align:start position:0%
helpful you're correct it has been in in
 
05:00:04.990 --> 05:00:05.000 align:start position:0%
in in years past I will agree with you
 
05:00:06.948 --> 05:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure uh all of you that have
 
05:00:09.510 --> 05:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
served on this committee will testify to
 
05:00:10.708 --> 05:00:10.718 align:start position:0%
the fact that when we are sitting here
 
05:00:12.230 --> 05:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
at deliberation every once in a while
 
05:00:15.270 --> 05:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
something gets brought up and a lobbyist
 
05:00:17.948 --> 05:00:17.958 align:start position:0%
or someone from the
 
05:00:21.150 --> 05:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
uh Gallery have had provided some you
 
05:00:22.750 --> 05:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
know some pretty good information to
 
05:00:25.030 --> 05:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
while some to make their
 
05:00:27.510 --> 05:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
decisions um yeah we have to try to play
 
05:00:28.670 --> 05:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
that by
 
05:00:28.680 --> 05:00:30.470 align:start position:0%
that by
year

05:00:30.470 --> 05:00:30.480 align:start position:0%

towns of hener and
 
05:01:16.350 --> 05:01:16.360 align:start position:0%
Bradford this bill is intended to set up
 
05:01:18.150 --> 05:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
a commission to study the wages
 
05:01:19.708 --> 05:01:19.718 align:start position:0%
necessary in different parts of the
 
05:01:21.510 --> 05:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
state that would allow workers and
 
05:01:23.190 --> 05:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
Working Families of different
 
05:01:25.150 --> 05:01:25.160 align:start position:0%
configurations to actually meet their
 
05:01:25.160 --> 05:01:26.510 align:start position:0%
configurations to actually meet their
basic

05:01:26.510 --> 05:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
basic
 
05:01:28.990 --> 05:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
needs it will also look at what it costs
 
05:01:30.868 --> 05:01:30.878 align:start position:0%
the state and New Hampshire taxpayers to
 
05:01:32.990 --> 05:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
make up the difference when wages do
 
05:01:34.990 --> 05:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
fall short of those
 
05:01:37.270 --> 05:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
needs uh the pandemic we've been going
 
05:01:38.670 --> 05:01:38.680 align:start position:0%
through for almost a year now has
 
05:01:40.990 --> 05:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
greatly exacerbated some of the strains
 
05:01:42.628 --> 05:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
that were already facing low wage
 
05:01:43.830 --> 05:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
workers in New
 
05:01:46.030 --> 05:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we know for example that
 
05:01:47.788 --> 05:01:47.798 align:start position:0%
hunger has increased homelessness has
 
05:01:49.350 --> 05:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
increased just to mention a couple of
 
05:01:49.360 --> 05:01:50.030 align:start position:0%
increased just to mention a couple of
the

05:01:50.030 --> 05:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:01:52.830 --> 05:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
indicators um of suffering but even
 
05:01:54.270 --> 05:01:54.280 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic things were not
 
05:01:56.070 --> 05:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
great for low-wage workers across the
 
05:01:58.548 --> 05:01:58.558 align:start position:0%
state uh despite the Boom in jobs low
 
05:02:01.310 --> 05:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
unemployment and gains for top level
 
05:02:04.390 --> 05:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
earners we can AR about Solutions what's
 
05:02:07.270 --> 05:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate what is ideologically sound
 
05:02:09.110 --> 05:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
and we often do but we need to have a
 
05:02:11.548 --> 05:02:11.558 align:start position:0%
shared set of funds I mean a shared set
 
05:02:14.150 --> 05:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
of facts before uh we can begin to
 
05:02:16.590 --> 05:02:16.600 align:start position:0%
discuss what is needed and craft
 
05:02:18.230 --> 05:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate policies to bring us out of
 
05:02:20.590 --> 05:02:20.600 align:start position:0%
this pandemic and start building a state
 
05:02:22.110 --> 05:02:22.120 align:start position:0%
where everyone can uh everyone can
 
05:02:24.510 --> 05:02:24.520 align:start position:0%
Thrive Working Families businesses a
 
05:02:27.708 --> 05:02:27.718 align:start position:0%
single mother a couple or working family
 
05:02:29.948 --> 05:02:29.958 align:start position:0%
struggling to put food on the table
 
05:02:31.628 --> 05:02:31.638 align:start position:0%
things look very different in different
 
05:02:33.390 --> 05:02:33.400 align:start position:0%
regions of our state and one-size
 
05:02:36.470 --> 05:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
solutions just will not do uh let's take
 
05:02:38.350 --> 05:02:38.360 align:start position:0%
a quick look at what we do know and the
 
05:02:40.350 --> 05:02:40.360 align:start position:0%
partial idea of what we might need to
 
05:02:42.910 --> 05:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
know in order to decide what a living
 
05:02:44.350 --> 05:02:44.360 align:start position:0%
wage in the different regions of New
 
05:02:45.910 --> 05:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would actually look
 
05:02:48.030 --> 05:02:48.040 align:start position:0%
like uh different regions in New
 
05:02:49.590 --> 05:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire show great disparities in
 
05:02:51.670 --> 05:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
wages and job opportunities these
 
05:02:53.390 --> 05:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
disparities also exist when you look at
 
05:02:55.750 --> 05:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
the cost of living but in general across
 
05:02:57.470 --> 05:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire increases in cost of
 
05:03:00.150 --> 05:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
living especially housing along with
 
05:03:01.868 --> 05:03:01.878 align:start position:0%
stagnant wages for the bottom half of
 
05:03:03.750 --> 05:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
workers has led difficult economic
 
05:03:05.470 --> 05:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
realities for thousands of granite
 
05:03:08.708 --> 05:03:08.718 align:start position:0%
Staters median family income in 2017
 
05:03:11.190 --> 05:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
ranged from 45,000 in Coos County to
 
05:03:14.830 --> 05:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
85,000 in Rockingham County we all know
 
05:03:16.390 --> 05:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
there's a north south divide in New
 
05:03:17.708 --> 05:03:17.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when it comes to Economic
 
05:03:19.150 --> 05:03:19.160 align:start position:0%
Opportunity and we need to take this

Solutions but across the state wages
 
05:03:27.510 --> 05:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
below the 50% median have been stagnant
 
05:03:29.750 --> 05:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
for the decade or more decade or more
 
05:03:32.670 --> 05:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
even before the Corona virus hit uh
 
05:03:33.910 --> 05:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
we've all heard about how great the
 
05:03:36.110 --> 05:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
economy was doing before the pandemic
 
05:03:37.430 --> 05:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
and it's true that the New Hampshire
 
05:03:39.030 --> 05:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
economy was growing and unemployment
 
05:03:41.110 --> 05:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
numbers were falling but behind these
 
05:03:43.030 --> 05:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
figures lurked growing inequality and
 
05:03:45.030 --> 05:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
stress for Working Families trying to
 
05:03:46.750 --> 05:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
keep up with an economy that was not
 
05:03:49.270 --> 05:03:49.280 align:start position:0%

05:03:57.868 --> 05:03:57.878 align:start position:0%
growth numbers we had before the
 
05:03:59.830 --> 05:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic and most of these figures are
 
05:04:01.430 --> 05:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
from either the New Hampshire fiscal
 
05:04:03.990 --> 05:04:04.000 align:start position:0%

priorities from 2008 to
 
05:04:12.830 --> 05:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
2018 the net increase in jobs was
 
05:04:15.070 --> 05:04:15.080 align:start position:0%
27,500 the industries with the largest
 
05:04:17.030 --> 05:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
job growth were health care and social
 
05:04:19.470 --> 05:04:19.480 align:start position:0%

and transportation and warehousing with
 
05:04:38.150 --> 05:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
2,000 jobs of these industries that were
 
05:04:40.390 --> 05:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
the largest drivers of job growth all of
 
05:04:42.510 --> 05:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
them except professional and Technical
 
05:04:44.948 --> 05:04:44.958 align:start position:0%
Services have average weekly wages below
 
05:04:47.470 --> 05:04:47.480 align:start position:0%
the Statewide average of a thousand per
 
05:04:51.510 --> 05:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
week or 27 $27 an hour only workers
 
05:04:53.070 --> 05:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
making more than this average have seen
 
05:04:55.270 --> 05:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
their wages increase to levels before
 
05:04:57.070 --> 05:04:57.080 align:start position:0%
the Great Recession of
 
05:04:59.230 --> 05:04:59.240 align:start position:0%
2008 it's true that the tight labor
 
05:05:01.150 --> 05:05:01.160 align:start position:0%
market in New Hampshire has helped push
 
05:05:02.990 --> 05:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
lower wages higher
 
05:05:04.750 --> 05:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
however workers earning incomes below
 
05:05:06.350 --> 05:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
the average have barely had their
 
05:05:09.750 --> 05:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
purchasing power restored to pre2 2008
 
05:05:12.670 --> 05:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
levels workers who earned an average
 
05:05:14.948 --> 05:05:14.958 align:start position:0%
wage or less over this period have
 
05:05:17.190 --> 05:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
experienced what feels like a pay cut
 
05:05:19.310 --> 05:05:19.320 align:start position:0%
workers earning at the 20th percentile
 
05:05:22.190 --> 05:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
or lower in other words 16 or $17 an
 
05:05:24.270 --> 05:05:24.280 align:start position:0%
hour have experienced what feels like a
 
05:05:27.270 --> 05:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
very drastic pay cut and all this comes
 
05:05:29.910 --> 05:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic as far as the cost
 
05:05:32.270 --> 05:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
of living let's get housing low wage
 
05:05:33.548 --> 05:05:33.558 align:start position:0%
work workers the majority of them
 
05:05:35.390 --> 05:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
renters have experienced and are
 
05:05:37.070 --> 05:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
experiencing a severe shortage of
 
05:05:39.948 --> 05:05:39.958 align:start position:0%
housing available in our state from 2014
 
05:05:42.830 --> 05:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
to 2019 rental costs have increased by
 
05:05:45.030 --> 05:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
nearly 22% for a two-bedroom apartment
 
05:05:47.670 --> 05:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh vacancy rate of
 
05:05:50.708 --> 05:05:50.718 align:start position:0%
units across the state sits at below
 
05:05:53.390 --> 05:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
1% according to the US Department of
 
05:05:55.990 --> 05:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
Housing and Urban Development families
 
05:05:58.510 --> 05:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
who pay more than 30% of their income
 
05:06:00.948 --> 05:06:00.958 align:start position:0%
for housing are considered cost burdened
 
05:06:02.628 --> 05:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
and may have difficulty affording
 
05:06:04.390 --> 05:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
Necessities such as food clothing
 
05:06:06.628 --> 05:06:06.638 align:start position:0%
transportation and medical
 
05:06:09.070 --> 05:06:09.080 align:start position:0%
care may have difficulty meeting their
 
05:06:10.590 --> 05:06:10.600 align:start position:0%
basic needs that's important because
 
05:06:12.350 --> 05:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
this is what we would be concerned with
 
05:06:14.270 --> 05:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
in a study of the sort commissioned by
 
05:06:16.750 --> 05:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
this bill workers who cannot meet their
 
05:06:18.470 --> 05:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
basic needs for food heating
 
05:06:21.070 --> 05:06:21.080 align:start position:0%
Transportation Etc based on the most
 
05:06:23.990 --> 05:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
recent estimates from 2017 approximately
 
05:06:26.230 --> 05:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
47% almost half of New Hampshire's
 
05:06:28.910 --> 05:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
renters were spending more than 30% of
 
05:06:30.948 --> 05:06:30.958 align:start position:0%
their income on rental costs in other
 
05:06:32.430 --> 05:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
words almost half of renters in New
 
05:06:34.628 --> 05:06:34.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire meet that cost burden Federal
 
05:06:36.590 --> 05:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
criteria and may have difficulty making
 
05:06:39.110 --> 05:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
ends meet do we know how many of these
 
05:06:41.590 --> 05:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
renters are full-time workers I would
 
05:06:42.750 --> 05:06:42.760 align:start position:0%
like to know and I think it would give
 
05:06:44.510 --> 05:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
us a clear picture of the difficulties
 
05:06:47.750 --> 05:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
facing low wage earners in the state the
 
05:06:49.030 --> 05:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
other question is how many of these
 
05:06:50.590 --> 05:06:50.600 align:start position:0%
workers are depending on safety net
 
05:06:52.150 --> 05:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
programs to supplement their salaries
 
05:06:54.830 --> 05:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
and meet their basic needs I believe uh
 
05:06:56.868 --> 05:06:56.878 align:start position:0%
we as taxpayers have a right to know
 
05:06:58.270 --> 05:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
what kind of companies are these
 
05:07:00.830 --> 05:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
potential cost burden employees working
 
05:07:03.670 --> 05:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
for I think it's one one thing uh if
 
05:07:05.150 --> 05:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
they're working for a small family
 
05:07:07.910 --> 05:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
business in Coos or Grafton County and
 
05:07:09.150 --> 05:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
another thing if they're working for a
 
05:07:10.990 --> 05:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
large corporation in nashille or
 
05:07:13.350 --> 05:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County but we can't begin to
 
05:07:15.150 --> 05:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
discuss the problem and devise policy
 
05:07:16.948 --> 05:07:16.958 align:start position:0%
until we have a shared set of facts we
 
05:07:18.510 --> 05:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
can agree
 
05:07:21.110 --> 05:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
upon if we intend to ensure that working
 
05:07:22.310 --> 05:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire can work
 
05:07:24.030 --> 05:07:24.040 align:start position:0%
full-time jobs and pay their way with
 
05:07:26.030 --> 05:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
dignity without relying on tax
 
05:07:28.070 --> 05:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
subsidized safety net services or
 
05:07:30.110 --> 05:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
private charity we need to know how many
 
05:07:31.830 --> 05:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
of them fit into this description of
 
05:07:34.110 --> 05:07:34.120 align:start position:0%
cost burden and unable to meet their
 
05:07:37.110 --> 05:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
needs despite employment we do know that
 
05:07:39.270 --> 05:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
federal and state sa safety net programs
 
05:07:41.948 --> 05:07:41.958 align:start position:0%
lift an estimated 140,000 New Hampshire
 
05:07:44.470 --> 05:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
ites above the poverty line each year
 
05:07:46.270 --> 05:07:46.280 align:start position:0%
how much of this taxpayer money is going
 
05:07:48.230 --> 05:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
to prop up business bottom lines who
 
05:07:50.390 --> 05:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
owners whose owners are raking in
 
05:07:52.628 --> 05:07:52.638 align:start position:0%
profits while their employees rely on
 
05:07:54.430 --> 05:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
welfare programs to meet their basic
 
05:07:57.030 --> 05:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
needs if we decide we don't need to know
 
05:07:59.070 --> 05:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
are we saying that this is
 
05:08:01.788 --> 05:08:01.798 align:start position:0%
okay a living wage is not a minimum wage
 
05:08:03.270 --> 05:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
we all know that New Hampshire is the
 
05:08:05.430 --> 05:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
only state in New England that still
 
05:08:07.868 --> 05:08:07.878 align:start position:0%
follows the federal minimum wage of 725
 
05:08:14.150 --> 05:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:14.160 --> 05:08:19.470 align:start position:0%
 
remained

05:08:19.470 --> 05:08:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:19.480 --> 05:08:23.470 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:08:23.470 --> 05:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:25.788 --> 05:08:25.798 align:start position:0%

Hampshire what where one more time
 
05:11:50.030 --> 05:11:50.040 align:start position:0%

giving me this opportunity to um speak
 
05:12:01.590 --> 05:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
to you today about this bill um I'm a
 
05:12:03.350 --> 05:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
member of raised up New Hampshire and
 
05:12:07.910 --> 05:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
we're a group of um faith-based um labor
 
05:12:10.150 --> 05:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
and Grassroots organization that work on
 
05:12:12.948 --> 05:12:12.958 align:start position:0%
economic justice issues in the state and
 
05:12:15.230 --> 05:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
um I would like to uh say that I'm in
 
05:12:18.548 --> 05:12:18.558 align:start position:0%
favor of House Bill 563 which would
 
05:12:20.350 --> 05:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
establish a committee to determine the
 
05:12:22.788 --> 05:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
level of living wages in various parts
 
05:12:25.390 --> 05:12:25.400 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire um in the
 
05:12:27.470 --> 05:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
interest of transparency I think it is
 
05:12:29.470 --> 05:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
also important for taxpayers to
 
05:12:30.868 --> 05:12:30.878 align:start position:0%
understand how much we spend in
 
05:12:33.150 --> 05:12:33.160 align:start position:0%
corporate welfare to provide basic human
 
05:12:35.670 --> 05:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
needs when companies pay their workers
 
05:12:38.270 --> 05:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
far less than a living wage more
 
05:12:39.948 --> 05:12:39.958 align:start position:0%
important than that I think it is useful
 
05:12:42.390 --> 05:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
for the state to understand what graters
 
05:12:45.270 --> 05:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
are spending to live this type of thing
 
05:12:47.548 --> 05:12:47.558 align:start position:0%
is done in other states and I've sent an
 
05:12:49.830 --> 05:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
email to the committee that included
 
05:12:53.230 --> 05:12:53.240 align:start position:0%
links um to um other states reports that
 
05:12:55.948 --> 05:12:55.958 align:start position:0%
would be similar to this one our New
 
05:12:58.230 --> 05:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution states that the
 
05:13:00.070 --> 05:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
state government derives its power from
 
05:13:01.990 --> 05:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
the consent of the Govern the
 
05:13:04.270 --> 05:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
legislature makes policy decisions and
 
05:13:06.350 --> 05:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
appropriates resources to benefit our
 
05:13:08.910 --> 05:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
state's economy these decisions should
 
05:13:10.910 --> 05:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
not be limited to ensuring profits for
 
05:13:13.150 --> 05:13:13.160 align:start position:0%
the few but also seek to improve the
 
05:13:15.628 --> 05:13:15.638 align:start position:0%
quality of life of the many our
 
05:13:17.270 --> 05:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
constitution also says that our
 
05:13:19.390 --> 05:13:19.400 align:start position:0%
government is instituted for the general
 
05:13:21.788 --> 05:13:21.798 align:start position:0%
good and that people of New Hampshire
 
05:13:23.910 --> 05:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
have the right to seek and obtain
 
05:13:26.150 --> 05:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
happiness given that I think it is the
 
05:13:28.430 --> 05:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility of our elected government
 
05:13:30.110 --> 05:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
to be aware of what it takes for New
 
05:13:31.788 --> 05:13:31.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's residents to live a health
 
05:13:35.030 --> 05:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
healthy stable and happy life I believe
 
05:13:36.948 --> 05:13:36.958 align:start position:0%
that the information gathered under this
 
05:13:38.830 --> 05:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
proposal would help the government of
 
05:13:40.470 --> 05:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire make better
 
05:13:42.390 --> 05:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
policy decisions regarding things like
 
05:13:44.830 --> 05:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
minimum wages but it would also help to
 
05:13:47.110 --> 05:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
inform decisions about where the state
 
05:13:48.990 --> 05:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
needs to invest its
 
05:13:52.190 --> 05:13:52.200 align:start position:0%
resources where is housing too expensive
 
05:13:54.150 --> 05:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
where do we need more support for child
 
05:13:57.190 --> 05:13:57.200 align:start position:0%
care where do we need more reliable
 
05:14:00.350 --> 05:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
internet we do this with roads um we
 
05:14:02.270 --> 05:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
should also be making smart investments
 
05:14:04.590 --> 05:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
in quality of life in infrastructure for
 
05:14:04.600 --> 05:14:05.390 align:start position:0%
in quality of life in infrastructure for
our

05:14:05.390 --> 05:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:14:07.628 --> 05:14:07.638 align:start position:0%
people when Granite Staters have
 
05:14:09.750 --> 05:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
stability it will release their P
 
05:14:11.830 --> 05:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
potential to build stronger communities
 
05:14:14.830 --> 05:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
and a more vibrant economy New Hampshire
 
05:14:16.868 --> 05:14:16.878 align:start position:0%
is a state where deaths currently exceed
 
05:14:18.670 --> 05:14:18.680 align:start position:0%
births for a net loss and natural
 
05:14:21.628 --> 05:14:21.638 align:start position:0%
population growth we rely on moving on
 
05:14:23.430 --> 05:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
people moving in from other states to
 
05:14:25.910 --> 05:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
maintain our population of working age
 
05:14:28.990 --> 05:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
people um it's particularly difficult
 
05:14:33.110 --> 05:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
and challenging for families um and I've
 
05:14:34.750 --> 05:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
I've also put in a link to a New
 
05:14:37.030 --> 05:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fiscal policy Institute study
 
05:14:38.788 --> 05:14:38.798 align:start position:0%
from a couple of years ago that that
 
05:14:41.670 --> 05:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
shows that we need to treat our people
 
05:14:43.830 --> 05:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
as the tremendous asset that they are
 
05:14:45.670 --> 05:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
and support them in ways that will help
 
05:14:48.510 --> 05:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
them Thrive the information we gather
 
05:14:51.110 --> 05:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
with this proposal will help us do that
 
05:14:51.120 --> 05:14:53.548 align:start position:0%
with this proposal will help us do that
thank

05:14:53.548 --> 05:14:53.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:56.990 --> 05:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you do I have any questions uh
 
05:14:59.868 --> 05:14:59.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:02.150 --> 05:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
room no questions to Comm room do I have
 
05:15:06.548 --> 05:15:06.558 align:start position:0%
any questions for the speaker um on Zoom
 
05:15:11.150 --> 05:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
see any hands or any yellow raised
 
05:15:15.470 --> 05:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
hands Christina I don't see any No Hands
 
05:15:18.628 --> 05:15:18.638 align:start position:0%
um I do have representative Kaplan back
 
05:15:21.830 --> 05:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
okay um thank you very much Miss St and
 
05:15:25.150 --> 05:15:25.160 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to call again uh
 
05:15:30.548 --> 05:15:30.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:30.558 --> 05:15:33.948 align:start position:0%
 
Kaplan

05:15:33.948 --> 05:15:33.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:33.958 --> 05:15:34.670 align:start position:0%
 
go

05:15:34.670 --> 05:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
go
 
05:15:37.628 --> 05:15:37.638 align:start position:0%
ahead okay hi sorry I I lost my uh
 
05:15:40.510 --> 05:15:40.520 align:start position:0%
connection there sorry about that um I
 
05:15:43.390 --> 05:15:43.400 align:start position:0%
guess I'll just pick up where I was
 
05:15:46.110 --> 05:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
um a living wage is not a minimum wage
 
05:15:47.270 --> 05:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
we all know that New Hampshire is the
 
05:15:48.430 --> 05:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
only state New England that still
 
05:15:50.910 --> 05:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
follows a federal minimum wage of 7025
 
05:15:54.070 --> 05:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
an hour uh but a living wage is the
 
05:15:55.910 --> 05:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
actual wage that workers need to earn in
 
05:15:57.548 --> 05:15:57.558 align:start position:0%
order to meet their basic needs food
 
05:15:59.670 --> 05:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
plus Child Care Plus Health Health Care
 
05:16:02.390 --> 05:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
Plus housing transportation and other
 
05:16:04.430 --> 05:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
necessities uh the living wage has been
 
05:16:06.190 --> 05:16:06.200 align:start position:0%
calculated in different places using
 
05:16:07.750 --> 05:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
different parameters but in general it's
 
05:16:09.990 --> 05:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
a tool to guarantee workers and working
 
05:16:11.708 --> 05:16:11.718 align:start position:0%
families are self-sufficient and able to
 
05:16:13.310 --> 05:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
stand on their own feet to meet their
 
05:16:15.708 --> 05:16:15.718 align:start position:0%
needs isn't that all of our aim
 
05:16:17.070 --> 05:16:17.080 align:start position:0%
regardless of
 
05:16:18.990 --> 05:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
Ideology Now this commission if
 
05:16:20.510 --> 05:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
established by Statute would have the
 
05:16:22.230 --> 05:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
power to determine the parameters and
 
05:16:24.670 --> 05:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
organizations to carry out the study
 
05:16:26.670 --> 05:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
geared to finding out living wage would
 
05:16:28.628 --> 05:16:28.638 align:start position:0%
be in different parts of the state I
 
05:16:30.868 --> 05:16:30.878 align:start position:0%
believe the state agency the economic
 
05:16:32.830 --> 05:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
and labor Market information Bureau part
 
05:16:34.390 --> 05:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire employment security
 
05:16:36.948 --> 05:16:36.958 align:start position:0%
agency which is federally funded the F
 
05:16:38.670 --> 05:16:38.680 align:start position:0%
the bureau develops and disseminates
 
05:16:40.510 --> 05:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
labor market information and measures
 
05:16:42.350 --> 05:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
labor market outcomes to assist public
 
05:16:44.390 --> 05:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
officials private employers Educators
 
05:16:46.990 --> 05:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
and trainers this is from their website
 
05:16:48.270 --> 05:16:48.280 align:start position:0%
I believe they would be the indicated
 
05:16:50.030 --> 05:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
agency to carry out this research and I
 
05:16:52.230 --> 05:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
trust that being taxpayer funded to do
 
05:16:54.070 --> 05:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
this sort of work that the cost of the
 
05:16:56.548 --> 05:16:56.558 align:start position:0%
legislature would be minimal in
 
05:16:58.230 --> 05:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
conclusion the pandemic has made it all
 
05:17:00.150 --> 05:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
the more visible that as a society we
 
05:17:02.110 --> 05:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
often function as if we didn't depend on
 
05:17:04.708 --> 05:17:04.718 align:start position:0%
the labor of underpaid essential workers
 
05:17:07.030 --> 05:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
our grocery clerks warehouse workers par
 
05:17:09.430 --> 05:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
Educators carers for the elderly and for
 
05:17:11.750 --> 05:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
children cleaners Hospital staff and
 
05:17:13.150 --> 05:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
others in our lowest paying but
 
05:17:15.788 --> 05:17:15.798 align:start position:0%
absolutely indispensable Fields the time
 
05:17:17.788 --> 05:17:17.798 align:start position:0%
we dedicated ourselves to having a close
 
05:17:19.350 --> 05:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
look at the gap between the wages that
 
05:17:21.390 --> 05:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
are unoffered for these people and the
 
05:17:23.270 --> 05:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
costs necessary for them to survive in a
 
05:17:26.430 --> 05:17:26.440 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient and dignified manner now
 
05:17:27.990 --> 05:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
I recognize that the idea of a living
 
05:17:29.670 --> 05:17:29.680 align:start position:0%
wage is seen as a progressive policy
 
05:17:31.830 --> 05:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
agenda but look that close ly I think
 
05:17:33.510 --> 05:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
Ronald Reagan would have approved of the
 
05:17:35.270 --> 05:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
actual intent which is to wean the
 
05:17:37.110 --> 05:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
private sector off the habit of relying

05:18:35.590 --> 05:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
deposit every quarter or every year I
 
05:18:37.310 --> 05:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
did I did not uh Mr chair I did not
 
05:18:39.270 --> 05:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
speak to anybody at the labor department
 
05:18:42.230 --> 05:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
um I did research through uh the the
 
05:18:44.788 --> 05:18:44.798 align:start position:0%
internet and I just looked at what this
 
05:18:47.030 --> 05:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh agency that I mentioned in my in my
 
05:18:49.590 --> 05:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh in my talk to this now the uh
 
05:18:51.110 --> 05:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
economic and labor market information
 
05:18:53.070 --> 05:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
Bureau which is part of the Employment
 
05:18:55.590 --> 05:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
Security Agency is uh charged with doing
 
05:18:57.270 --> 05:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
this sort of research and I looked at
 
05:18:58.708 --> 05:18:58.718 align:start position:0%
what they have online and there's
 
05:19:00.548 --> 05:19:00.558 align:start position:0%
nothing that specifically targets a
 
05:19:03.070 --> 05:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
living wage
 
05:19:07.070 --> 05:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um I'm getting old but I
 
05:19:11.750 --> 05:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
recall um a few years ago did this did
 
05:19:14.590 --> 05:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
the state or did a committee such as
 
05:19:16.430 --> 05:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
this undertake this to come up with the
 
05:19:19.150 --> 05:19:19.160 align:start position:0%
number a few years ago in the
 
05:19:21.470 --> 05:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
legislature as far as I know Mr chair
 
05:19:23.270 --> 05:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
that that didn't happen there was a I
 
05:19:24.628 --> 05:19:24.638 align:start position:0%
think there was some
 
05:19:27.070 --> 05:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
legislation uh in the previous session
 
05:19:30.230 --> 05:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
that that was tabled but that's my
 
05:19:32.030 --> 05:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
understanding commission has never
 
05:19:34.030 --> 05:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
actually been set up thank you and this
 
05:19:35.670 --> 05:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
is one of these those you believe would
 
05:19:38.270 --> 05:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
you believe questions representative
 
05:19:39.670 --> 05:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
would you believe I don't think a lot of
 
05:19:41.788 --> 05:19:41.798 align:start position:0%
senators are into going on these study
 
05:19:43.990 --> 05:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
committees and you might want to reduce
 
05:19:47.470 --> 05:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
the uh the number to one since I hear
 
05:19:49.708 --> 05:19:49.718 align:start position:0%
that they're not being too favorable to
 
05:19:52.548 --> 05:19:52.558 align:start position:0%
study committees these days if you would
 
05:19:54.708 --> 05:19:54.718 align:start position:0%
believe well I think the the number is
 
05:19:56.708 --> 05:19:56.718 align:start position:0%
too but yes that's an amendment that uh
 
05:19:59.510 --> 05:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
you know that's actually practical
 
05:20:01.910 --> 05:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely any other questions from the
 
05:20:04.190 --> 05:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
members here in the
 
05:20:07.548 --> 05:20:07.558 align:start position:0%
committee room any I see a hand off I
 
05:20:09.788 --> 05:20:09.798 align:start position:0%
believe that is representative to me is
 
05:20:09.798 --> 05:20:11.708 align:start position:0%
believe that is representative to me is
that

05:20:11.708 --> 05:20:11.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:20:15.350 --> 05:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
correct yes yes it is uh quick question
 
05:20:18.868 --> 05:20:18.878 align:start position:0%

this time around with this hearing but
 
05:21:10.990 --> 05:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
sorry about that so honorable chair and
 
05:21:13.190 --> 05:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Gail
 
05:21:16.590 --> 05:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
Kenny um I'm a resident of Kanan and I'm
 
05:21:18.548 --> 05:21:18.558 align:start position:0%
a minister with the United Church of
 
05:21:21.030 --> 05:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
Christ and I'm speaking today on behalf
 
05:21:23.910 --> 05:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
of the economic Justice team of this
 
05:21:26.590 --> 05:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
particular New Hampshire denomination um
 
05:21:28.310 --> 05:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
just so you know the United Church of
 
05:21:30.708 --> 05:21:30.718 align:start position:0%
Christ um many people also just know us
 
05:21:31.788 --> 05:21:31.798 align:start position:0%
as the
 
05:21:33.788 --> 05:21:33.798 align:start position:0%
congregationalists is the largest
 
05:21:36.868 --> 05:21:36.878 align:start position:0%
Protestant denomination in New Hampshire
 
05:21:39.590 --> 05:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm also an ongoing contact with uh
 
05:21:41.470 --> 05:21:41.480 align:start position:0%
individuals from a number of Faith
 
05:21:43.590 --> 05:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
communities and I believe that there is
 
05:21:46.310 --> 05:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
widespread support among Faith leaders
 
05:21:48.670 --> 05:21:48.680 align:start position:0%
for the kind of study that's envisioned
 
05:21:50.150 --> 05:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
in House Bill
 
05:21:52.750 --> 05:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
563 so in religious circles in our
 
05:21:55.510 --> 05:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
circles we often use the word
 
05:21:58.030 --> 05:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
discernment uh to describe the process
 
05:22:00.390 --> 05:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
by which we look deeply with a moral
 
05:22:03.190 --> 05:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
lens into matters of concern that have
 
05:22:05.830 --> 05:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
an impact on our Collective Humanity so
 
05:22:07.590 --> 05:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
that we can make good decisions about
 
05:22:09.628 --> 05:22:09.638 align:start position:0%
our actions and so that we can
 
05:22:12.548 --> 05:22:12.558 align:start position:0%
understand their impact we also believe
 
05:22:15.070 --> 05:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
that Discerning or seeking a
 
05:22:17.190 --> 05:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
comprehensive understanding of the lived
 
05:22:19.110 --> 05:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
realities of individuals in our
 
05:22:22.030 --> 05:22:22.040 align:start position:0%
communities is a really really important
 
05:22:25.150 --> 05:22:25.160 align:start position:0%
component of public policym and for this
 
05:22:28.350 --> 05:22:28.360 align:start position:0%
reason we believe that a legislative
 
05:22:31.190 --> 05:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
study committee um with the purpose
 
05:22:34.150 --> 05:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
which is outlined in um House Bill
 
05:22:39.470 --> 05:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
563 will be of immense assistance to all
 
05:22:41.990 --> 05:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
Committees of the general court and
 
05:22:43.470 --> 05:22:43.480 align:start position:0%
especially those that deal with
 
05:22:45.750 --> 05:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
Workforce issues and economic
 
05:22:48.030 --> 05:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
development issues and safety net
 
05:22:51.310 --> 05:22:51.320 align:start position:0%
Services issues um the reality is I I
 
05:22:53.430 --> 05:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
think you heard a moment ago
 
05:22:56.830 --> 05:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
that some of the fastest growing sectors
 
05:22:59.110 --> 05:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire economy um in
 
05:23:02.270 --> 05:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
non-pandemic times are lower wage
 
05:23:04.990 --> 05:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
sectors um of our economy and that
 
05:23:08.270 --> 05:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
includes retail food service and I want
 
05:23:10.430 --> 05:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
to emphasize home health and some of the
 
05:23:14.628 --> 05:23:14.638 align:start position:0%
lower paid um Health Care uh jobs um
 
05:23:16.510 --> 05:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
both those scen and those behind the
 
05:23:18.868 --> 05:23:18.878 align:start position:0%
scenes and and there are more but those
 
05:23:20.708 --> 05:23:20.718 align:start position:0%
are some critical ones retail Food
 
05:23:23.548 --> 05:23:23.558 align:start position:0%
Service home health and if I were a
 
05:23:26.430 --> 05:23:26.440 align:start position:0%
state legislator today I would
 
05:23:28.910 --> 05:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
definitely want to know the impact on
 
05:23:33.030 --> 05:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
our state and our communities um of of
 
05:23:34.510 --> 05:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
this kind of work and the wages that are
 
05:23:36.548 --> 05:23:36.558 align:start position:0%
paid and how much and I would really
 
05:23:40.868 --> 05:23:40.878 align:start position:0%
like to know how much it costs us in tax
 
05:23:44.270 --> 05:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
dollars to subsidize workers in these SE
 
05:23:47.670 --> 05:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
sectors um I'd want to understand the
 
05:23:49.750 --> 05:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
implications uh
 
05:23:52.270 --> 05:23:52.280 align:start position:0%
particularly um when I learn that there
 
05:23:55.150 --> 05:23:55.160 align:start position:0%
are major corporations that are active
 
05:23:58.230 --> 05:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that actually coach or
 
05:24:02.230 --> 05:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
educate their their low-wage employees
 
05:24:06.030 --> 05:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
on how to access taxpayer supported
 
05:24:08.390 --> 05:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
services so that they can supplement
 
05:24:11.110 --> 05:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
their low wages and still survive in the
 
05:24:13.190 --> 05:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and I want to be
 
05:24:15.190 --> 05:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
clear about one thing I and we
 
05:24:18.470 --> 05:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely do not begrudge helping such
 
05:24:20.990 --> 05:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
workers with Services um that are
 
05:24:23.750 --> 05:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
supported by our tax dollars but I think
 
05:24:26.670 --> 05:24:26.680 align:start position:0%
it's our moral imperative and our
 
05:24:30.030 --> 05:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
calling um to not just assist our
 
05:24:32.310 --> 05:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
neighbors in need need but also
 
05:24:33.830 --> 05:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
understand the Dynamics that are
 
05:24:37.270 --> 05:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
creating their need and I'd want to
 
05:24:43.590 --> 05:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
know that um by subsidizing corporate
 
05:24:46.470 --> 05:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
the corporate profit sheet how much is
 
05:24:49.190 --> 05:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
that costing us I think that we really
 
05:24:53.190 --> 05:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
need to understand that Dynamic um and
 
05:24:55.430 --> 05:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
an additional point there are many
 
05:24:57.948 --> 05:24:57.958 align:start position:0%
excellent resources um Employment
 
05:24:59.708 --> 05:24:59.718 align:start position:0%
Security is just one in the work that
 
05:25:02.030 --> 05:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
they do but that they other work uh
 
05:25:04.670 --> 05:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
resources in the community um that I
 
05:25:06.750 --> 05:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
won't speak for directly but but a
 
05:25:10.868 --> 05:25:10.878 align:start position:0%
number of um analytical organizations um
 
05:25:13.310 --> 05:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
economic analytical organizations that
 
05:25:16.310 --> 05:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
would really be willing to support um
 
05:25:19.150 --> 05:25:19.160 align:start position:0%
such a committee and provide resources
 
05:25:22.670 --> 05:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
provide statistics and provide analyses
 
05:25:25.310 --> 05:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
right now in terms of driving public
 
05:25:27.590 --> 05:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
policymaking I don't think there's any
 
05:25:30.708 --> 05:25:30.718 align:start position:0%
one place where someone can go and get
 
05:25:32.750 --> 05:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
get the kind of analytical information
 
05:25:35.470 --> 05:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's um envisioned in this bill
 
05:25:37.708 --> 05:25:37.718 align:start position:0%
but we need it and you need it I think
 
05:25:40.070 --> 05:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
in order to do the most effect effective
 
05:25:43.990 --> 05:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
policymaking so overall I just I would
 
05:25:47.830 --> 05:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
strongly urge you and implore you uh to
 
05:25:49.868 --> 05:25:49.878 align:start position:0%
support and ought to pass on this
 
05:25:53.110 --> 05:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
particular Bill and to engage in the
 
05:25:55.868 --> 05:25:55.878 align:start position:0%
kind of legislative discernment that is
 
05:25:59.590 --> 05:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
so critical um to try trying to make
 
05:26:02.430 --> 05:26:02.440 align:start position:0%
good decisions will have a positive
 
05:26:04.270 --> 05:26:04.280 align:start position:0%
impact on all of the communities of our
 
05:26:07.470 --> 05:26:07.480 align:start position:0%

um there you're the second speaker in a
 
05:27:28.190 --> 05:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
row to talk about corporate welfare
 
05:27:31.470 --> 05:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
subsidizing corporate profit sheets
 
05:27:34.030 --> 05:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
could you tell me if are if there are
 
05:27:35.830 --> 05:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
and if they are who the names of these
 
05:27:40.230 --> 05:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
corporations are in New Hampshire that
 
05:27:40.240 --> 05:27:42.230 align:start position:0%
corporations are in New Hampshire that
are

05:27:42.230 --> 05:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:27:45.470 --> 05:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
are that you feel we are subsidizing
 
05:27:48.628 --> 05:27:48.638 align:start position:0%
because they're paying low wages and I'm
 
05:27:50.470 --> 05:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
being sincere with my question I I'm not
 
05:27:52.948 --> 05:27:52.958 align:start position:0%
aware of this yes
 
05:27:55.750 --> 05:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
um absolutely
 
05:27:59.750 --> 05:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
um there are um let's just say Walmart
 
05:28:03.070 --> 05:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
for example is um one of the largest
 
05:28:07.270 --> 05:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
employers in the nation and um Walmart
 
05:28:07.280 --> 05:28:08.750 align:start position:0%
employers in the nation and um Walmart
has

05:28:08.750 --> 05:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
has
 
05:28:12.030 --> 05:28:12.040 align:start position:0%
consistently um provided resources to
 
05:28:16.030 --> 05:28:16.040 align:start position:0%
their employees on how to access Public
 
05:28:18.830 --> 05:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
Services um knowing I think that full
 
05:28:21.430 --> 05:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
well that that many if not most of their
 
05:28:24.910 --> 05:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
Frontline workers um don't earn enough
 
05:28:27.470 --> 05:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
to thrive and in order to be able to
 
05:28:29.390 --> 05:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
survive or to support a family in New
 
05:28:32.110 --> 05:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um McDonald similarly has
 
05:28:35.868 --> 05:28:35.878 align:start position:0%
provided um resources and information to
 
05:28:39.750 --> 05:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
um to their to their employees um on on
 
05:28:43.030 --> 05:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
how to um access services that at one
 
05:28:47.788 --> 05:28:47.798 align:start position:0%
point um they had an an an online um
 
05:28:52.430 --> 05:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
system to help employees try to plan um
 
05:28:54.708 --> 05:28:54.718 align:start position:0%
their economic resources you know in
 
05:28:57.670 --> 05:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
order to be able to thrive or to survive
 
05:29:01.350 --> 05:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
actually and um I I don't have specific
 
05:29:02.788 --> 05:29:02.798 align:start position:0%
information about others but I could
 
05:29:04.430 --> 05:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
certainly get that for you but the
 
05:29:07.230 --> 05:29:07.240 align:start position:0%
reality is that uh we're really talking
 
05:29:10.150 --> 05:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
about major out ofate corporations um
 
05:29:12.670 --> 05:29:12.680 align:start position:0%
who play low pay low wages but
 
05:29:14.788 --> 05:29:14.798 align:start position:0%
understand that in order to keep their
 
05:29:16.628 --> 05:29:16.638 align:start position:0%
workers coming back to work they've got
 
05:29:18.470 --> 05:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
to help them in other ways in order to
 
05:29:20.750 --> 05:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
to thrive and so they do this by saying
 
05:29:22.270 --> 05:29:22.280 align:start position:0%
you know this is how you can access
 
05:29:23.670 --> 05:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
these Services you know whether it's
 
05:29:26.190 --> 05:29:26.200 align:start position:0%
food stamps or whether it's healthy kids
 
05:29:28.150 --> 05:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
or um heating assistance or whatever it
 
05:29:30.350 --> 05:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
might be and we need to understand that
 
05:29:32.830 --> 05:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
Dynamic I think it's really critical I
 
05:29:34.230 --> 05:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
would like to understand it for the
 
05:29:36.030 --> 05:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire and and I hope
 
05:29:38.948 --> 05:29:38.958 align:start position:0%

05:32:21.948 --> 05:32:21.958 align:start position:0%
became obsessed with this topic after a
 
05:32:23.948 --> 05:32:23.958 align:start position:0%
briefing with the New Hampshire fiscal
 
05:32:27.788 --> 05:32:27.798 align:start position:0%
policy Institute on what it is to live
 
05:32:30.470 --> 05:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and how EXP expensive
 
05:32:33.030 --> 05:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
it is to live in New Hampshire um
 
05:32:36.868 --> 05:32:36.878 align:start position:0%
because the the default on living wages
 
05:32:39.708 --> 05:32:39.718 align:start position:0%
that the New Hampshire fiscal policy
 
05:32:41.830 --> 05:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
Institute uses is the
 
05:32:44.310 --> 05:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
MIT uh living wage
 
05:32:48.190 --> 05:32:48.200 align:start position:0%
calculator and it only goes by County so
 
05:32:50.990 --> 05:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
not only are you uh aggregating
 
05:32:52.948 --> 05:32:52.958 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County with Manchester and
 
05:32:54.868 --> 05:32:54.878 align:start position:0%
nsha and all of their surrounding or
 
05:32:57.310 --> 05:32:57.320 align:start position:0%
many of their surrounding towns but then
 
05:32:59.990 --> 05:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
you're also putting with marac County
 
05:33:02.350 --> 05:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
aaging in a wealthy town like New London
 
05:33:02.360 --> 05:33:03.430 align:start position:0%
aaging in a wealthy town like New London
with

05:33:03.430 --> 05:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:33:05.990 --> 05:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield uh and I could go county by
 
05:33:09.868 --> 05:33:09.878 align:start position:0%
county on how that doesn't work um that
 
05:33:11.750 --> 05:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
also includes issues around
 
05:33:14.350 --> 05:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
transportation that aren't factored in
 
05:33:18.590 --> 05:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
issues around um the dependence on the
 
05:33:21.910 --> 05:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
property tax in most towns and cities in
 
05:33:26.470 --> 05:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and uh it also these this
 
05:33:28.548 --> 05:33:28.558 align:start position:0%
information is important to Economic
 
05:33:32.270 --> 05:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
Development groups who try to sell New
 
05:33:34.788 --> 05:33:34.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as a place for especially
 
05:33:37.350 --> 05:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
high-tech workers to come and live my
 
05:33:40.430 --> 05:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
husband is a software engineer and you
 
05:33:43.390 --> 05:33:43.400 align:start position:0%
know so say he were looking at he's
 
05:33:44.750 --> 05:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
lived in New Hampshire his whole life
 
05:33:46.990 --> 05:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
but let's use him as an example you know
 
05:33:49.070 --> 05:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't just be someone like my
 
05:33:52.030 --> 05:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
husband looking for work here but me too
 
05:33:54.788 --> 05:33:54.798 align:start position:0%
you know and I the low wage job as a
 
05:33:58.350 --> 05:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
State Rep so $100 a year haha okay I
 
05:34:00.390 --> 05:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
bombed on my joke but oh well
 
05:34:03.150 --> 05:34:03.160 align:start position:0%
you know what I'm talking about um but
 
05:34:05.430 --> 05:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
anyway that's why I feel that this is
 
05:34:08.350 --> 05:34:08.360 align:start position:0%
very necessary this bill is because we
 
05:34:10.548 --> 05:34:10.558 align:start position:0%
we can't just use the county aggregate
 
05:34:13.470 --> 05:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
aggregated information and as someone
 
05:34:16.910 --> 05:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
who is advocated for a minimum wage
 
05:34:19.788 --> 05:34:19.798 align:start position:0%
specific to New Hampshire issues of how
 
05:34:21.910 --> 05:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
much it costs to live in New Hampshire
 
05:34:23.470 --> 05:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
is something that we should all be
 
05:34:25.708 --> 05:34:25.718 align:start position:0%
considering as we look at the
 
05:34:29.310 --> 05:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
$725 an hour so this data this
 
05:34:31.788 --> 05:34:31.798 align:start position:0%
information we would Gather By A study
 
05:34:35.110 --> 05:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
would be useful in so many ways to make
 
05:34:38.788 --> 05:34:38.798 align:start position:0%
sure that the workforce that we need uh
 
05:34:40.948 --> 05:34:40.958 align:start position:0%
has what it's has what it needs to
 
05:34:43.310 --> 05:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
survive and anything else I would say
 
05:34:44.948 --> 05:34:44.958 align:start position:0%
would be repeating what the other folks
 
05:34:47.830 --> 05:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
have already said Thank
 
05:34:51.548 --> 05:34:51.558 align:start position:0%
you thank you any questions from uh the
 
05:34:53.300 --> 05:34:53.310 align:start position:0%
representatives on
 
05:34:53.310 --> 05:34:56.830 align:start position:0%
representatives on
[Music]

05:34:56.830 --> 05:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:59.510 --> 05:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
Zoom I don't see any representatives in
 
05:34:59.520 --> 05:35:00.830 align:start position:0%
Zoom I don't see any representatives in
the

05:35:00.830 --> 05:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:35:03.830 --> 05:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
L representative this is will infantine
 
05:35:07.270 --> 05:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
I do have a question
 
05:35:09.470 --> 05:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
um I don't
 
05:35:09.480 --> 05:35:11.670 align:start position:0%
um I don't
doubt

05:35:11.670 --> 05:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
doubt
 
05:35:14.830 --> 05:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
the the importance of getting this
 
05:35:16.948 --> 05:35:16.958 align:start position:0%
information my concern and I'd like to
 
05:35:18.628 --> 05:35:18.638 align:start position:0%
know your response to it is that this is
 
05:35:20.868 --> 05:35:20.878 align:start position:0%
a herculan effort with something that
 
05:35:23.470 --> 05:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
you'd pay a company you know $200,000 a
 
05:35:24.990 --> 05:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
year to put together and you're asking
 
05:35:27.510 --> 05:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
three representatives and two senators
 
05:35:29.270 --> 05:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh with the help of the Department of
 
05:35:30.590 --> 05:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
Labor and appointment security is are a
 
05:35:33.190 --> 05:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
little tasked right now uh to try to get
 
05:35:36.590 --> 05:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
something done by November 1st
 
05:35:39.390 --> 05:35:39.400 align:start position:0%
um I mean the calculus the the the
 
05:35:41.110 --> 05:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
statistics and everything required in
 
05:35:43.230 --> 05:35:43.240 align:start position:0%
that is this something that's going to
 
05:35:46.070 --> 05:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
be manageable by these individuals I
 
05:35:48.990 --> 05:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
would say Mr chair sure these are things
 
05:35:51.948 --> 05:35:51.958 align:start position:0%
you can think about but looking at the
 
05:35:53.830 --> 05:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
questions in and of themselves to
 
05:35:57.628 --> 05:35:57.638 align:start position:0%
determine that uh doesn't cost any money
 
05:36:00.470 --> 05:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
in and of itself uh
 
05:36:02.470 --> 05:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
maybe that is what the study would come
 
05:36:04.590 --> 05:36:04.600 align:start position:0%
up with is what it would cost to track
 
05:36:07.070 --> 05:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
this on an ongoing basis but I think we
 
05:36:08.628 --> 05:36:08.638 align:start position:0%
have enough
 
05:36:11.030 --> 05:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
information uh before us that it
 
05:36:14.390 --> 05:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't require that much that many
 
05:36:16.430 --> 05:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
resources overall I think I'm probably
 
05:36:17.868 --> 05:36:17.878 align:start position:0%
not the right person to determine how
 
05:36:21.070 --> 05:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
much that would be but um this would be
 
05:36:24.230 --> 05:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
a benefit to everybody to have this
 
05:36:27.990 --> 05:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
information and to even assess what is
 
05:36:30.750 --> 05:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
needed to live in today's Society I I
 
05:36:32.788 --> 05:36:32.798 align:start position:0%
failed to mention that one of the things
 
05:36:35.190 --> 05:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
that the MIT calculators also doesn't
 
05:36:38.070 --> 05:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
include is child care costs which if
 
05:36:40.590 --> 05:36:40.600 align:start position:0%
you're a family that needs child care
 
05:36:43.230 --> 05:36:43.240 align:start position:0%
that eats up such a large portion of
 
05:36:46.110 --> 05:36:46.120 align:start position:0%
your income it's amazing same for if
 
05:36:47.910 --> 05:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
your health care bills are higher
 
05:36:50.510 --> 05:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
because your plan is crappier or you're
 
05:36:53.830 --> 05:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
between the ages of 26 and
 
05:36:56.948 --> 05:36:56.958 align:start position:0%
64 uh it also doesn't include student
 
05:37:00.470 --> 05:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
loan debt so when looking at the issues
 
05:37:03.910 --> 05:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
around living wage simply by determining
 
05:37:07.390 --> 05:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
the things that cost money nowadays in a
 
05:37:09.670 --> 05:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
modern society in an expensive State
 
05:37:13.270 --> 05:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
like New Hampshire I don't think uh that
 
05:37:15.708 --> 05:37:15.718 align:start position:0%
exploration in and of itself would need
 
05:37:19.190 --> 05:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
to be uh expensive but it can outline
 
05:37:21.070 --> 05:37:21.080 align:start position:0%
what that would need to be on an ongoing
 
05:37:24.670 --> 05:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
basis that would be more expensive for
 
05:37:26.470 --> 05:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
sure so I don't know that I can I don't
 
05:37:28.230 --> 05:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
think I answered your question but I do
 
05:37:30.150 --> 05:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
think that the exploration of this
 
05:37:34.150 --> 05:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
is of such benefit um that the shortterm
 
05:37:37.628 --> 05:37:37.638 align:start position:0%
work of this study would be very
 
05:37:40.830 --> 05:37:40.840 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you any questions the
 
05:37:41.990 --> 05:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
05:37:44.430 --> 05:37:44.440 align:start position:0%

great uh good afternoon chairman intini
 
05:38:35.628 --> 05:38:35.638 align:start position:0%
and members of the House committee for
 
05:38:39.030 --> 05:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
the record is Viola C and I'm
 
05:38:41.510 --> 05:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
representing the gr State organizing
 
05:38:43.670 --> 05:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
project uh the gr State organizing
 
05:38:46.670 --> 05:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
project is a grassroot nonpartisan
 
05:38:49.430 --> 05:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
organization that brings Faith labor and
 
05:38:51.468 --> 05:38:51.478 align:start position:0%
Community groups together to work for a
 
05:38:55.110 --> 05:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
more just World um I'm here to express
 
05:38:57.670 --> 05:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
our support for HB
 
05:39:00.350 --> 05:39:00.360 align:start position:0%
563 through our work in community
 
05:39:02.670 --> 05:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
organizing we've had several stories
 
05:39:04.910 --> 05:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
from full-time workers who have to
 
05:39:06.670 --> 05:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
depend on public assistance to care for
 
05:39:09.590 --> 05:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
their families uh what we hear from time
 
05:39:12.030 --> 05:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
and again is that these Working Families
 
05:39:14.830 --> 05:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
have time to se their programs because
 
05:39:16.430 --> 05:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
they canot support themselves through
 
05:39:19.270 --> 05:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
work since their wages are so
 
05:39:22.070 --> 05:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
low uh what we have to ask ourselves is
 
05:39:23.750 --> 05:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
why why are these workers who are
 
05:39:26.110 --> 05:39:26.120 align:start position:0%
already doing their part contributing to
 
05:39:28.190 --> 05:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
our economy and the wellbeing of their
 
05:39:31.270 --> 05:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
families why are they working 30 35 40
 
05:39:33.270 --> 05:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
hours a week and they still need that
 
05:39:34.990 --> 05:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
helping hand in form of housing
 
05:39:38.430 --> 05:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
assistance would stamp um I believe that
 
05:39:40.390 --> 05:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
from the previous speakers and what we
 
05:39:42.070 --> 05:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
already know in terms of the data that's
 
05:39:44.070 --> 05:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
available that we may already have some
 
05:39:47.510 --> 05:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
of the answers to why that is uh we know
 
05:39:50.548 --> 05:39:50.558 align:start position:0%
that some Industries and large
 
05:39:52.830 --> 05:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
corporations uh some of them have chosen
 
05:39:55.150 --> 05:39:55.160 align:start position:0%
to pass on their obligation of paying
 
05:39:57.390 --> 05:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
workers at decent wage that is needed to
 
05:40:00.150 --> 05:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
afford basic needs to taxpayers
 
05:40:02.270 --> 05:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
um and also we cannot ignore the fact
 
05:40:04.990 --> 05:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
that wages for Lage workers have
 
05:40:07.350 --> 05:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
stagnated over the years while the
 
05:40:11.030 --> 05:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
living costs continue to rise uh we also
 
05:40:13.468 --> 05:40:13.478 align:start position:0%
know that our neighboring New England
 
05:40:15.468 --> 05:40:15.478 align:start position:0%
states have pass and V to raise the
 
05:40:17.910 --> 05:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
minimum wage whereas New Hampshire's
 
05:40:19.628 --> 05:40:19.638 align:start position:0%
minimum wage defaults to the federal
 
05:40:22.990 --> 05:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
rate of $725 an hour the lowest in the
 
05:40:26.150 --> 05:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
region so for most Lage workers who are
 
05:40:30.110 --> 05:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
heads of households $7 an hour 25
 
05:40:34.708 --> 05:40:34.718 align:start position:0%
cents an hour $725 C an hour $8 even 12
 
05:40:37.948 --> 05:40:37.958 align:start position:0%
even 15 cannot help them to afford the
 
05:40:39.830 --> 05:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
basic needs that they need without
 
05:40:40.868 --> 05:40:40.878 align:start position:0%
getting that
 
05:40:43.230 --> 05:40:43.240 align:start position:0%
assistance um studies that have been
 
05:40:45.070 --> 05:40:45.080 align:start position:0%
done and some of them have already been
 
05:40:47.990 --> 05:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
qued by some of the um previous
 
05:40:50.430 --> 05:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
speakers uh one of them includes the
 
05:40:52.510 --> 05:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
economic policy Institute they have a
 
05:40:54.390 --> 05:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
family budget calculator and I would
 
05:40:57.670 --> 05:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
encourage all of you to check it out um
 
05:40:59.910 --> 05:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
and they estimate that if you one
 
05:41:02.230 --> 05:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
working adult with a child in Caro
 
05:41:05.070 --> 05:41:05.080 align:start position:0%
County you need about
 
05:41:10.270 --> 05:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
$59,000 annually or an equivalent of
 
05:41:12.990 --> 05:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
$4,997 a month to attain a modest
 
05:41:16.310 --> 05:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
standard of living so we know some of
 
05:41:19.270 --> 05:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
the information exists but I know that
 
05:41:22.190 --> 05:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
we might not be a fully in support of
 
05:41:23.830 --> 05:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
all the information that is collected by
 
05:41:25.510 --> 05:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
Economic Policy Institute we have an
 
05:41:27.590 --> 05:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity here for New Hampshire to
 
05:41:30.990 --> 05:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
collect our own data and analyze on data
 
05:41:32.990 --> 05:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
so with HB
 
05:41:35.708 --> 05:41:35.718 align:start position:0%
563 we can determine how many working
 
05:41:37.868 --> 05:41:37.878 align:start position:0%
people in our Outpost are utilizing
 
05:41:40.430 --> 05:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
Public Assistance we can determine what
 
05:41:43.430 --> 05:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's basic needs budget is we
 
05:41:45.270 --> 05:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
can determine what a living wage is for
 
05:41:47.590 --> 05:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
workers to sustain themselves working
 
05:41:50.110 --> 05:41:50.120 align:start position:0%
fulltime we can also determine how we
 
05:41:52.868 --> 05:41:52.878 align:start position:0%
can repurpose some of the funds that
 
05:41:55.270 --> 05:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
workers are relying on that they may not
 
05:41:57.708 --> 05:41:57.718 align:start position:0%
meet once we have policies in place that
 
05:42:00.590 --> 05:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
can lift our wages and we can recoverus
 
05:42:02.468 --> 05:42:02.478 align:start position:0%
those fund for other programs and people
 
05:42:05.270 --> 05:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
that need it the most so through the
 
05:42:07.708 --> 05:42:07.718 align:start position:0%
committee's finding I hope that New
 
05:42:09.750 --> 05:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
Hamshire can get on a path to helping
 
05:42:12.350 --> 05:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
working families and businesses that are
 
05:42:15.110 --> 05:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
doing their fair share I like to
 
05:42:17.270 --> 05:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
encourage um the committee members to
 
05:42:20.350 --> 05:42:20.360 align:start position:0%
look at the study that bont did in
 
05:42:23.510 --> 05:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
2017 they had a um I believe it was
 
05:42:27.430 --> 05:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
called The Living wage study committee
 
05:42:29.750 --> 05:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
and they looked at different aspects of
 
05:42:31.230 --> 05:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
what was happening in B in different
 
05:42:33.830 --> 05:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
parts of the state they looked at what
 
05:42:36.548 --> 05:42:36.558 align:start position:0%
their B basic need budget was they
 
05:42:39.070 --> 05:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
looked at the cost um it looked at wages
 
05:42:40.670 --> 05:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
they looked at what implications would
 
05:42:44.030 --> 05:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
be if wages were raised um and that
 
05:42:46.190 --> 05:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
information really helped them to inform
 
05:42:48.548 --> 05:42:48.558 align:start position:0%
their policies and Vermont is one of the
 
05:42:50.670 --> 05:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
states that has a higher wage than New
 
05:42:53.310 --> 05:42:53.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire their current minimum wage is
 
05:42:57.350 --> 05:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
$175 cents an hour where we below um
 
05:42:58.670 --> 05:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
where we higher than what we have
 
05:43:01.990 --> 05:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
currently yeah so I would like to urge
 
05:43:05.030 --> 05:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
committee members support HB
 
05:43:08.910 --> 05:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
563 and vote out to pass on this bill
 
05:43:12.190 --> 05:43:12.200 align:start position:0%
just one last point that I have to make
 
05:43:15.430 --> 05:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
um I had um the committee asked from
 
05:43:17.750 --> 05:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
information on some of the companies in
 
05:43:20.310 --> 05:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that we are subsidizing um
 
05:43:22.788 --> 05:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
I would like to direct you to Americans
 
05:43:27.030 --> 05:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
for fair tax uh Americans for fair for
 
05:43:29.070 --> 05:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
tax fairness it's a report that was
 
05:43:30.190 --> 05:43:30.200 align:start position:0%
published in
 
05:43:34.110 --> 05:43:34.120 align:start position:0%
2014 and they list uh different states
 
05:43:36.350 --> 05:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
and different companies and actually
 
05:43:38.430 --> 05:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
Walmart is one of the main companies
 
05:43:41.110 --> 05:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
listed on there and they really show us
 
05:43:44.310 --> 05:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
how many of their workers um are relying
 
05:43:47.990 --> 05:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
on subsidies and what that cost is in
 
05:43:51.708 --> 05:43:51.718 align:start position:0%
terms of of of of taxpayers money so um
 
05:43:54.030 --> 05:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to send this to Comm members
 
05:43:56.628 --> 05:43:56.638 align:start position:0%
but that's just a portion and so this
 
05:43:58.510 --> 05:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
study would help us to assess what other
 
05:43:59.868 --> 05:43:59.878 align:start position:0%
companies are out there that we're not
 
05:44:02.230 --> 05:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
aware of so I hope that you consider
 
05:44:05.270 --> 05:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
passing this legislation thank you very
 
05:44:07.590 --> 05:44:07.600 align:start position:0%

Bill
 
05:47:57.638 --> 05:48:00.030 align:start position:0%
Bill
231

05:48:00.030 --> 05:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
231
 
05:48:03.628 --> 05:48:03.638 align:start position:0%
all right guys years and years ago I
 
05:48:07.190 --> 05:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
learned in the legislature that
 
05:48:10.110 --> 05:48:10.120 align:start position:0%
um Walmart had this thing going on in
 
05:48:12.270 --> 05:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
Alabama or Mississippi so they knew that
 
05:48:14.910 --> 05:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
if you made under a certain salary a
 
05:48:20.070 --> 05:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
year you could benefit you could get um
 
05:48:23.628 --> 05:48:23.638 align:start position:0%
U Alabama paid Healthcare so they made
 
05:48:25.708 --> 05:48:25.718 align:start position:0%
sure all their employees are under
 
05:48:29.350 --> 05:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
that so that kind of struck me
 
05:48:32.190 --> 05:48:32.200 align:start position:0%
so I boycott Walmart I'm one of the only
 
05:48:34.110 --> 05:48:34.120 align:start position:0%
people I yell at my wife if I ever see a
 
05:48:36.510 --> 05:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
freaking Walmart bag in the
 
05:48:39.468 --> 05:48:39.478 align:start position:0%
house so I'd like to see everybody do
 
05:48:41.830 --> 05:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
that because I think they're uh good for
 
05:48:45.390 --> 05:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
their stockholders and terrible for the
 
05:48:48.468 --> 05:48:48.478 align:start position:0%
general public that's just me I've G on
 
05:48:50.030 --> 05:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
record that I hate Walmart but that's
 
05:48:52.788 --> 05:48:52.798 align:start position:0%
just me cuz I think they do I think they
 
05:48:55.310 --> 05:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
got some really smart people who play
 
05:48:57.510 --> 05:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
the game really
 
05:48:57.520 --> 05:48:59.270 align:start position:0%
the game really
badly

05:48:59.270 --> 05:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
badly
 
05:49:03.150 --> 05:49:03.160 align:start position:0%
but sorry that's
 
05:49:07.230 --> 05:49:07.240 align:start position:0%
my personal opinion well they don't have
 
05:49:09.948 --> 05:49:09.958 align:start position:0%
to you know it's it's a game they play
 
05:49:11.990 --> 05:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
and they go to certain places so they
 
05:49:14.708 --> 05:49:14.718 align:start position:0%
can uh uh get tax credits or they do
 
05:49:16.868 --> 05:49:16.878 align:start position:0%
this or they do that really smart people
 
05:49:19.230 --> 05:49:19.240 align:start position:0%
they utilize the system well but
 
05:49:22.350 --> 05:49:22.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes I I question you know I'm I'm
 
05:49:23.590 --> 05:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
an insurance business so when they took
 
05:49:25.350 --> 05:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
out a bunch of life insurance policies
 
05:49:27.628 --> 05:49:27.638 align:start position:0%
on a lot of their employees we're not
 
05:49:29.628 --> 05:49:29.638 align:start position:0%
talking about key part you know people
 
05:49:31.350 --> 05:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about they buy these
 
05:49:32.910 --> 05:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
General life insurance policies for all
 
05:49:34.390 --> 05:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
these managers all these stores all over
 
05:49:36.990 --> 05:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
the country because someone did the math
 
05:49:38.468 --> 05:49:38.478 align:start position:0%
to figure out a certain propensity of
 
05:49:41.270 --> 05:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
them will die any given year just by
 
05:49:44.590 --> 05:49:44.600 align:start position:0%
either natural causes or or accidents or
 
05:49:46.390 --> 05:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
what have you so they go out without
 
05:49:48.030 --> 05:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
them knowing buy4 million dollar life
 
05:49:50.030 --> 05:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
insurance policy on these 40 30 year
 
05:49:52.468 --> 05:49:52.478 align:start position:0%
olds when they passed
 
05:49:56.548 --> 05:49:56.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:01.590 --> 05:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:03.230 --> 05:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
I'm all for capitalism but you you got
 
05:50:05.110 --> 05:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
to stop somewhere there's ethics
 
05:50:06.350 --> 05:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
involved that's
 
05:50:06.360 --> 05:50:09.390 align:start position:0%
involved that's
something

05:50:09.390 --> 05:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:12.310 --> 05:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
question so I I put my money where my
 
05:50:13.468 --> 05:50:13.478 align:start position:0%
mouth was I
 
05:50:15.670 --> 05:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
stopped shall a
 
05:50:18.628 --> 05:50:18.638 align:start position:0%
Walmart now I know that you know even
 
05:50:23.270 --> 05:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
I've had to in a bind you know my
 
05:50:26.430 --> 05:50:26.440 align:start position:0%
daughter rore M is's playing
 
05:50:29.110 --> 05:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
soccer and we get out there we drive out
 
05:50:29.120 --> 05:50:31.510 align:start position:0%
soccer and we get out there we drive out
there

05:50:31.510 --> 05:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:50:33.708 --> 05:50:33.718 align:start position:0%
and that I forgot
 
05:50:36.190 --> 05:50:36.200 align:start position:0%
my you know an hour and a half away from
 
05:50:38.190 --> 05:50:38.200 align:start position:0%
home like well where's the closest door
 
05:50:52.350 --> 05:50:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:54.830 --> 05:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
so and after the first
 
05:50:57.350 --> 05:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
zillion whatever
 
05:51:00.270 --> 05:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
right right Josh don't
 
05:51:00.280 --> 05:51:03.030 align:start position:0%
right right Josh don't
need4

05:51:03.030 --> 05:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
need4
 
05:51:05.390 --> 05:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
now pisses me off they come into town
 
05:51:07.910 --> 05:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
right everyone gets all sight and they
 
05:51:09.030 --> 05:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
put the butcher the Baker and the
 
05:51:10.468 --> 05:51:10.478 align:start position:0%
Candlestick maker out of business
 
05:51:12.230 --> 05:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
because they undercut them and then what
 
05:51:14.390 --> 05:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
they do is they Curry favor by going
 
05:51:16.788 --> 05:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
every boy scout group every football
 
05:51:19.750 --> 05:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
team every cheerleading squad every you
 
05:51:22.708 --> 05:51:22.718 align:start position:0%
know Garden Club then they all give them
 
05:51:25.670 --> 05:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
donations you know and if you go into
 
05:51:26.788 --> 05:51:26.798 align:start position:0%
Walmart when they come into a store
 
05:51:28.468 --> 05:51:28.478 align:start position:0%
they'll have a whole list on the wall w
 
05:51:30.708 --> 05:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
a they gave to all the local charities
 
05:51:32.310 --> 05:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
but to do that they had to earn money
 
05:51:33.990 --> 05:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
and that puts out some of these other
 
05:51:36.548 --> 05:51:36.558 align:start position:0%
local businesses so it's a you know it's
 
05:51:39.110 --> 05:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
a it's a tough
 
05:51:42.390 --> 05:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
one my personal opinion is Walmart
 
05:51:44.510 --> 05:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
didn't order hurt this country by
 
05:51:46.350 --> 05:51:46.360 align:start position:0%
putting people out of business by buying
 
05:51:49.750 --> 05:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
few products from overseas put American
 
05:51:52.110 --> 05:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturers out of business I'm big
 
05:51:54.670 --> 05:51:54.680 align:start position:0%
for you well and that's like I I was
 
05:51:55.830 --> 05:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
talking I was talking to a friend of
 
05:51:58.910 --> 05:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
mine about the U minimum w bills we have
 
05:52:01.708 --> 05:52:01.718 align:start position:0%
coming up this year and um this was
 
05:52:03.750 --> 05:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
after President Biden put the admin
 
05:52:06.430 --> 05:52:06.440 align:start position:0%
executive order in for $15 an hour
 
05:52:08.510 --> 05:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
contractors and he thought that was just
 
05:52:11.590 --> 05:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
$15 blanket across the country and he's
 
05:52:13.030 --> 05:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
like oh man that's really going to put
 
05:52:14.868 --> 05:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
you know Main Street out of business and
 
05:52:18.310 --> 05:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
setting aside whether that's true or not
 
05:52:19.670 --> 05:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
like think of what you're talking about
 
05:52:22.868 --> 05:52:22.878 align:start position:0%
with Walmart Amazon in particular like I
 
05:52:27.230 --> 05:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
think Amazon last year I don't know what
 
05:52:30.070 --> 05:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
percentage of the diaper Market that
 
05:52:33.110 --> 05:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
they cornered but they choked out almost
 
05:52:35.750 --> 05:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
everybody Amazon yeah cuz it didn't used
 
05:52:37.510 --> 05:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
to be toys or R had
 
05:52:40.990 --> 05:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
to they they sold more diapers than
 
05:52:42.510 --> 05:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
anybody and then you're right Walmart
 
05:52:44.628 --> 05:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
came into them and then Amazon came in
 
05:52:48.150 --> 05:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
too yeah I think Amazon's a problem
 
05:52:48.160 --> 05:52:50.270 align:start position:0%
too yeah I think Amazon's a problem
personally

05:52:50.270 --> 05:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
personally
 
05:52:54.468 --> 05:52:54.478 align:start position:0%
uh it when do you when you know and how
 
05:52:57.190 --> 05:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
and how Monopoly and as you see with the
 
05:52:59.670 --> 05:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh GameStop stuff going on right now a
 
05:53:02.150 --> 05:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
lot of the uh all the Reddit stuff oh I

05:53:05.390 --> 05:53:05.400 align:start position:0%

05:53:07.948 --> 05:53:07.958 align:start position:0%
is trying to I want to go buy a GameStop
 
05:53:10.670 --> 05:53:10.680 align:start position:0%

05:53:13.150 --> 05:53:13.160 align:start position:0%
yeah the guy figure out how to beat yeah
 
05:53:16.070 --> 05:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
is that hilarious like yeah no because
 
05:53:18.670 --> 05:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
if you the rules are the rules yeah
 
05:53:21.468 --> 05:53:21.478 align:start position:0%
exactly rul you know my libertarian
 
05:53:23.750 --> 05:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
friends have that like non-aggression
 
05:53:26.788 --> 05:53:26.798 align:start position:0%
principle where you enter into agreement
 
05:53:28.868 --> 05:53:28.878 align:start position:0%
that's the agreement so the agreement
 
05:53:31.310 --> 05:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
cannot be one way for those hedge fund
 
05:53:34.590 --> 05:53:34.600 align:start position:0%
houss and then another way for
 
05:53:38.830 --> 05:53:38.840 align:start position:0%
Representatives you are on YouTube being
 
05:53:41.510 --> 05:53:41.520 align:start position:0%

05:59:31.628 --> 05:59:31.638 align:start position:0%
comfortable uh we could easily add
 
05:59:34.070 --> 05:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
another five or six um the room could
 
05:59:36.990 --> 05:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
probably hold 10 but I think we're at a
 
05:59:38.590 --> 05:59:38.600 align:start position:0%
a good Comfort level here with everyone
 
05:59:42.430 --> 05:59:42.440 align:start position:0%

05:59:51.030 --> 05:59:51.040 align:start position:0%

06:00:05.150 --> 06:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
case you were you are
 
06:00:08.230 --> 06:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
wondering um any questions of anyone in
 
06:00:11.830 --> 06:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
the committee of the
 
06:00:14.548 --> 06:00:14.558 align:start position:0%
chair yes representative
 
06:00:18.788 --> 06:00:18.798 align:start position:0%
s um I um noticed that those bills that
 
06:00:22.230 --> 06:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
you scheduled for the afternoon of um uh
 
06:00:24.468 --> 06:00:24.478 align:start position:0%
next Thursday two of them definitely are
 
06:00:27.510 --> 06:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
minimum wage bills the third one um
 
06:00:31.948 --> 06:00:31.958 align:start position:0%
addresses the minimum um uh salary for
 
06:00:35.830 --> 06:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
um uh the U
 
06:00:39.150 --> 06:00:39.160 align:start position:0%
uh some of the professors at the U
 
06:00:42.750 --> 06:00:42.760 align:start position:0%
associate colleges um and I don't know
 
06:00:45.548 --> 06:00:45.558 align:start position:0%
that that pairs well with the other
 
06:00:48.670 --> 06:00:48.680 align:start position:0%
two um so I I just would suggest you
 
06:00:50.548 --> 06:00:50.558 align:start position:0%
might want to take a look at that and
 
06:00:56.430 --> 06:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:56.440 --> 06:01:13.830 align:start position:0%
 
out

06:01:13.830 --> 06:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:13.840 --> 06:01:14.670 align:start position:0%
 
Mr

06:01:14.670 --> 06:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
06:01:18.510 --> 06:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
chairman representative K uh I I have no
 
06:01:21.830 --> 06:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
objection to that scheduling of of that
 
06:01:24.830 --> 06:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
bill no I I do you know I having read it
 
06:01:27.990 --> 06:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
um I'll see what I can do uh the the the
 
06:01:31.628 --> 06:01:31.638 align:start position:0%
rule 67 allows me to call both of the
 
06:01:33.990 --> 06:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage bills I can have them
 
06:01:34.000 --> 06:01:39.430 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage bills I can have them
introduced

06:01:39.430 --> 06:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:41.468 --> 06:01:41.478 align:start position:0%
um I don't know let me think about it
 
06:01:43.310 --> 06:01:43.320 align:start position:0%
I'll talk to representative Sullivan
 
06:01:45.270 --> 06:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
we'll see uh maybe I just postpone that
 
06:01:48.510 --> 06:01:48.520 align:start position:0%
to the next day um we can open and close
 
06:01:50.510 --> 06:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
that hearing and or
 
06:01:52.468 --> 06:01:52.478 align:start position:0%
just you know it all depends it all
 
06:01:53.910 --> 06:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
depends how long those this hearing
 
06:01:56.230 --> 06:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
lasts those two hearings on the um
 
06:01:58.788 --> 06:01:58.798 align:start position:0%
minimum wage the origin I looked at it
 
06:02:00.590 --> 06:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you I took a look at
 
06:02:03.310 --> 06:02:03.320 align:start position:0%
it and since it required 75% of the
 
06:02:09.590 --> 06:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
salary received um so um yeah I guess
 
06:02:11.030 --> 06:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
we'll have to play it by year if only
 
06:02:13.628 --> 06:02:13.638 align:start position:0%
one person testifies on behalf of it uh
 
06:02:14.750 --> 06:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
we'll know it's something that we can
 
06:02:17.150 --> 06:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
open open it
 
06:02:19.110 --> 06:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
um but thank you for pointing that out
 
06:02:22.750 --> 06:02:22.760 align:start position:0%

06:05:04.718 --> 06:05:06.750 align:start position:0%
on
Anne

06:05:06.750 --> 06:05:06.760 align:start position:0%

um my name is Anie Mal Anie Malachi I
 
06:05:20.990 --> 06:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
can't pronounce my own name today
 
06:05:23.830 --> 06:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
too it's contagious I think it's lack of
 
06:05:26.510 --> 06:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
caffeine is what's happening um so I'm
 
06:05:27.910 --> 06:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
the executive director for the
 
06:05:30.070 --> 06:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
commission for human rights and I'm here
 
06:05:32.910 --> 06:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
for informational purposes um while just
 
06:05:35.468 --> 06:05:35.478 align:start position:0%
a little background about the commission
 
06:05:37.708 --> 06:05:37.718 align:start position:0%
um we're not taking a specific position
 
06:05:40.468 --> 06:05:40.478 align:start position:0%
on this bill um but there could be some
 
06:05:42.670 --> 06:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
uh items for thought and there could
 
06:05:46.670 --> 06:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
also be questions that um the uh the
 
06:05:49.910 --> 06:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
group may have um relative to how this
 
06:05:53.270 --> 06:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
bill would uh and the changes U
 
06:05:55.990 --> 06:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
connected within could
 
06:05:56.000 --> 06:05:57.750 align:start position:0%
connected within could
um

06:05:57.750 --> 06:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:01.030 --> 06:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh what the changes could do to RSA 354
 
06:06:04.190 --> 06:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
d a um for a bit of context the
 
06:06:05.750 --> 06:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
commission for human rights as a state
 
06:06:08.110 --> 06:06:08.120 align:start position:0%
agency we were established in
 
06:06:11.070 --> 06:06:11.080 align:start position:0%
1965 um as I said by RSA
 
06:06:13.548 --> 06:06:13.558 align:start position:0%
354a for the purpose of eliminating
 
06:06:15.390 --> 06:06:15.400 align:start position:0%
discrimination against people who have
 
06:06:17.468 --> 06:06:17.478 align:start position:0%
been historically victimized by
 
06:06:20.430 --> 06:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
discrimination um and uh thus this has
 
06:06:22.230 --> 06:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
created protected
 
06:06:25.030 --> 06:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
classes we also have jurisdiction over
 
06:06:27.830 --> 06:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
the areas of employment public
 
06:06:30.868 --> 06:06:30.878 align:start position:0%
accommodations um housing and education
 
06:06:34.910 --> 06:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
was recently added to our RSA as of
 
06:06:37.708 --> 06:06:37.718 align:start position:0%
2019 and the commission is a neutral
 
06:06:42.510 --> 06:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:45.150 --> 06:06:45.160 align:start position:0%
receive investigate and pass upon
 
06:06:47.110 --> 06:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
complaints of illegal discrimination in
 
06:06:49.788 --> 06:06:49.798 align:start position:0%
the areas that I mentioned before um and
 
06:06:53.110 --> 06:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
relative to um HB
 
06:06:55.350 --> 06:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
231 there are some
 
06:06:59.788 --> 06:06:59.798 align:start position:0%
areas uh towards the end that would have
 
06:07:01.868 --> 06:07:01.878 align:start position:0%
uh statutory language
 
06:07:01.878 --> 06:07:03.548 align:start position:0%
uh statutory language
changes

06:07:03.548 --> 06:07:03.558 align:start position:0%
changes
 
06:07:06.868 --> 06:07:06.878 align:start position:0%
and the there was a Senate Bill earlier
 
06:07:09.310 --> 06:07:09.320 align:start position:0%
this week um and I believe it was Senate
 
06:07:09.320 --> 06:07:10.628 align:start position:0%
this week um and I believe it was Senate
Bill

06:07:10.628 --> 06:07:10.638 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
06:07:13.788 --> 06:07:13.798 align:start position:0%
69 I'm sorry Senate Bill
 
06:07:16.948 --> 06:07:16.958 align:start position:0%
60 yes Senate Bill 69 that deal that
 
06:07:19.350 --> 06:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
deals with pregnancy the language
 
06:07:22.430 --> 06:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
contained in that bill um is a bit more
 
06:07:26.430 --> 06:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
clear and more concise um and would be
 
06:07:28.270 --> 06:07:28.280 align:start position:0%
more lines with the work that we are
 
06:07:31.788 --> 06:07:31.798 align:start position:0%
currently doing um Senate Bill 69 it
 
06:07:35.110 --> 06:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
just restates in a very clear way the
 
06:07:37.948 --> 06:07:37.958 align:start position:0%
work that the commission currently does
 
06:07:42.230 --> 06:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
whereas the uh the specifics here um
 
06:07:43.708 --> 06:07:43.718 align:start position:0%
make it a bit more
 
06:07:47.670 --> 06:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
confusing and if there are any um
 
06:07:49.830 --> 06:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
additional questions that you might have
 
06:07:51.670 --> 06:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
for me I will certainly be here for the
 
06:07:53.990 --> 06:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
length of the hearing to answer any
 
06:07:57.030 --> 06:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
questions and if it's possible if I have
 
06:07:58.948 --> 06:07:58.958 align:start position:0%
something to interject I would hopefully
 
06:08:00.868 --> 06:08:00.878 align:start position:0%
be able to raise my hand and at some
 
06:08:03.270 --> 06:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
point be recognized thank you
 
06:08:06.070 --> 06:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
all thank you do I have any questions
 
06:08:10.468 --> 06:08:10.478 align:start position:0%
for the speaker um anyone on Zoom have
 
06:08:10.478 --> 06:08:14.628 align:start position:0%
for the speaker um anyone on Zoom have
any

06:08:14.628 --> 06:08:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:16.910 --> 06:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none anyone here in the
 
06:08:16.920 --> 06:08:18.510 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none anyone here in the
committee

06:08:18.510 --> 06:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:08:22.628 --> 06:08:22.638 align:start position:0%
room I do have a question for you um and
 
06:08:25.110 --> 06:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
you may I apologize I was getting a a
 
06:08:27.548 --> 06:08:27.558 align:start position:0%
text from the legislature here uh and I
 
06:08:29.350 --> 06:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
and I missed a couple sentences of what
 
06:08:29.360 --> 06:08:30.548 align:start position:0%
and I missed a couple sentences of what
you

06:08:30.548 --> 06:08:30.558 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:08:34.670 --> 06:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
said um the bill that was heard two days
 
06:08:36.468 --> 06:08:36.478 align:start position:0%
ago in the
 
06:08:40.468 --> 06:08:40.478 align:start position:0%
Senate um that I
 
06:08:42.948 --> 06:08:42.958 align:start position:0%
believe the hearing went a couple hours
 
06:08:45.548 --> 06:08:45.558 align:start position:0%
and then the information I read was
 
06:08:47.868 --> 06:08:47.878 align:start position:0%
correct they actually
 
06:08:52.110 --> 06:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
did um exec and ought to pass is that an
 
06:08:54.628 --> 06:08:54.638 align:start position:0%
identical Bill to
 
06:08:59.030 --> 06:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
231 so to thank you for the question um
 
06:09:04.190 --> 06:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
so a a bit of History um last uh last
 
06:09:08.350 --> 06:09:08.360 align:start position:0%
session Senator Martha Fuller Clark um
 
06:09:12.750 --> 06:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
had a bill that was um uh
 
06:09:15.868 --> 06:09:15.878 align:start position:0%
sb68 and that went through um quite a
 
06:09:19.628 --> 06:09:19.638 align:start position:0%
few hearings and with covid everything
 
06:09:22.150 --> 06:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
changed um
 
06:09:25.830 --> 06:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
and there's a so and just bear with me
 
06:09:26.948 --> 06:09:26.958 align:start position:0%
just one moment because there there are
 
06:09:29.910 --> 06:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
two bills that are so similar and I
 
06:09:31.788 --> 06:09:31.798 align:start position:0%
apologize because I believe I'm getting
 
06:09:35.350 --> 06:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
the two confused okay um I am as well
 
06:09:38.190 --> 06:09:38.200 align:start position:0%
and that's why I I I asked and yeah so
 
06:09:40.430 --> 06:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at my notes right now okay
 
06:09:43.788 --> 06:09:43.798 align:start position:0%
so the the two bills are Senate Bill 68
 
06:09:46.990 --> 06:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
and there's also Senate Bill 69 okay
 
06:09:48.868 --> 06:09:48.878 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
06:09:52.350 --> 06:09:52.360 align:start position:0%
69 is um there were and and of course
 
06:09:54.070 --> 06:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
the hearings for both were also on
 
06:09:56.868 --> 06:09:56.878 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and they were backto back um so
 
06:09:58.990 --> 06:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
I apologize for not having all of that
 
06:10:02.070 --> 06:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
ready um so Senate Bill
 
06:10:08.270 --> 06:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
69 is the um complete version
 
06:10:11.708 --> 06:10:11.718 align:start position:0%
of uh this house bill 231 and what I
 
06:10:15.670 --> 06:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
mean by that is uh Senator Marsha Fuller
 
06:10:18.990 --> 06:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
Clark along she's the chair or was the
 
06:10:21.990 --> 06:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
chair of the lactation Council on that
 
06:10:24.310 --> 06:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
Council there are quite a few um
 
06:10:27.390 --> 06:10:27.400 align:start position:0%
agencies as well as um New Hampshire
 
06:10:30.830 --> 06:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
businesses that have a seat at the table
 
06:10:33.110 --> 06:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
there was full consensus as they worked
 
06:10:36.990 --> 06:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
through what the bill should be and um
 
06:10:41.788 --> 06:10:41.798 align:start position:0%
Dave J of the Bia gave testimony um on
 
06:10:46.628 --> 06:10:46.638 align:start position:0%
uh sb69 on Tuesday and on the lactation
 
06:10:49.548 --> 06:10:49.558 align:start position:0%
Council which has since been dissolved
 
06:10:52.548 --> 06:10:52.558 align:start position:0%
um the commission has two seats so one
 
06:10:55.670 --> 06:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
of our investigators participates or
 
06:10:58.310 --> 06:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
participated with the Council and also
 
06:11:01.310 --> 06:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
um a local attorney who practices before
 
06:11:03.830 --> 06:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
the commission uh was in participation
 
06:11:05.868 --> 06:11:05.878 align:start position:0%
as well so there are some other state
 
06:11:08.670 --> 06:11:08.680 align:start position:0%
agencies that participated in creating s
 
06:11:11.430 --> 06:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
sp69 and that one is certainly um the
 
06:11:14.628 --> 06:11:14.638 align:start position:0%
language is uh something
 
06:11:18.548 --> 06:11:18.558 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't involve uh RSA
 
06:11:22.708 --> 06:11:22.718 align:start position:0%
354a which would be preferred um and the
 
06:11:25.990 --> 06:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
language is something that um a a group
 
06:11:27.788 --> 06:11:27.798 align:start position:0%
of people work together and there was
 
06:11:29.868 --> 06:11:29.878 align:start position:0%
consensus along with the business
 
06:11:35.430 --> 06:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
Community to make S sp69 what it is um
 
06:11:37.868 --> 06:11:37.878 align:start position:0%
with HB
 
06:11:41.590 --> 06:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
231 and the redefinition in some of the
 
06:11:46.030 --> 06:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
areas here for um for RSA 354a which is
 
06:11:51.030 --> 06:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
the commission statute um the language
 
06:11:55.468 --> 06:11:55.478 align:start position:0%
um is not as clean as in
 
06:11:58.670 --> 06:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
sb68 and that's why it's confusing s
 
06:12:01.510 --> 06:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
sp68 deals with pregnancy and that
 
06:12:04.948 --> 06:12:04.958 align:start position:0%
language is very clean um and I worked
 
06:12:08.548 --> 06:12:08.558 align:start position:0%
with the the senator I previously it was
 
06:12:11.990 --> 06:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
a last session and then it got tabled
 
06:12:14.310 --> 06:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
and so it's been brought back so the
 
06:12:17.910 --> 06:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
commission worked hand inand with the
 
06:12:19.830 --> 06:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
senator to make sure that the language
 
06:12:22.590 --> 06:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
was clean and and very clear so that
 
06:12:24.350 --> 06:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
small businesses large businesses
 
06:12:27.548 --> 06:12:27.558 align:start position:0%
attorneys would have um clear guidance
 
06:12:30.468 --> 06:12:30.478 align:start position:0%
on what was needed relative to pregnancy
 
06:12:33.310 --> 06:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
so I know it's a bit disjointed so two
 
06:12:35.750 --> 06:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
different bills or are basically
 
06:12:37.708 --> 06:12:37.718 align:start position:0%
covering the same
 
06:12:41.750 --> 06:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
thing did that answer your question
 
06:12:44.628 --> 06:12:44.638 align:start position:0%
doeses read up on both Senate Bill 68
 
06:12:46.990 --> 06:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
and 69 to
 
06:12:51.150 --> 06:12:51.160 align:start position:0%
see clear on the differences any other
 
06:12:53.150 --> 06:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
if if I could answer one more thing um
 
06:12:57.788 --> 06:12:57.798 align:start position:0%
so in an early draft of the bill that
 
06:13:01.190 --> 06:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
Senator Fuller Clark put forth some of
 
06:13:03.270 --> 06:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
the the majority of the content from
 
06:13:08.670 --> 06:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
this from HB 231 was that early draft um
 
06:13:11.350 --> 06:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
prior to consensus building and and
 
06:13:15.868 --> 06:13:15.878 align:start position:0%
information gathering and that turned
 
06:13:18.868 --> 06:13:18.878 align:start position:0%
into Senate Bill
 
06:13:23.430 --> 06:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
69 if that's helpful and so with
 
06:13:27.190 --> 06:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
that the commission's RSA was
 
06:13:31.270 --> 06:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
removed and made into a separate bill um
 
06:13:37.110 --> 06:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:37.120 --> 06:13:39.590 align:start position:0%
 
confusion

06:13:39.590 --> 06:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
06:13:42.868 --> 06:13:42.878 align:start position:0%
hopefully understood um I see
 
06:13:42.878 --> 06:13:44.350 align:start position:0%
hopefully understood um I see
representative

06:13:44.350 --> 06:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:13:46.990 --> 06:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
kahill has a question for you go ahead
 
06:13:49.350 --> 06:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
representative yes uh thank you Mr chair
 
06:13:51.868 --> 06:13:51.878 align:start position:0%
and thank you Miss Malachi is there
 
06:13:55.910 --> 06:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
anything in House Bill 231 that would
 
06:13:58.750 --> 06:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
need to be added to
 
06:14:03.110 --> 06:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
sb69 to have the best possible product
 
06:14:04.830 --> 06:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
no to answer your question and thank you
 
06:14:06.468 --> 06:14:06.478 align:start position:0%
for that um
 
06:14:10.150 --> 06:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
sb69 is a cleaner product um and I
 
06:14:13.548 --> 06:14:13.558 align:start position:0%
believe it it serves the purpose of what
 
06:14:15.510 --> 06:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
we're looking to do in terms of
 
06:14:19.788 --> 06:14:19.798 align:start position:0%
pregnancy protection and then um X SB
 
06:14:25.270 --> 06:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
sb68 serves the purpose of HB 231 and
 
06:14:32.110 --> 06:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
SB um 69 cleans up the language that is
 
06:14:34.548 --> 06:14:34.558 align:start position:0%
attempted in in this one for the
 
06:14:36.910 --> 06:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
commission statute however it's a lot
 
06:14:38.830 --> 06:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
cleaner and it doesn't it doesn't
 
06:14:41.948 --> 06:14:41.958 align:start position:0%
include um language that that isn't
 
06:14:45.310 --> 06:14:45.320 align:start position:0%
necessary if that makes sense follow up
 
06:14:48.590 --> 06:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman follow up uh so if we were
 
06:14:51.868 --> 06:14:51.878 align:start position:0%
to uh retain this bill just in case
 
06:14:54.150 --> 06:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
something went wrong that wouldn't cost
 
06:14:57.750 --> 06:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
us anything correct us meaning money I
 
06:14:59.430 --> 06:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
me no I mean there wouldn't be any
 
06:15:01.430 --> 06:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
downside to doing that if we held this
 
06:15:04.030 --> 06:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
for next year just in case the other
 
06:15:06.070 --> 06:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
bills didn't make it across the finish
 
06:15:09.708 --> 06:15:09.718 align:start position:0%
line so um thank you for the redirect
 
06:15:13.070 --> 06:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
there um if we if if the other one did
 
06:15:16.110 --> 06:15:16.120 align:start position:0%
not make it across the finish line and
 
06:15:20.230 --> 06:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
if HB 231 was held over then it would
 
06:15:22.670 --> 06:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
need to go through the exact same
 
06:15:25.190 --> 06:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
changes as s
 
06:15:25.200 --> 06:15:26.750 align:start position:0%
changes as s
sp69

06:15:26.750 --> 06:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
sp69
 
06:15:26.760 --> 06:15:28.468 align:start position:0%
sp69
has

06:15:28.468 --> 06:15:28.478 align:start position:0%
has
 
06:15:31.230 --> 06:15:31.240 align:start position:0%
completed so we we could just as well
 
06:15:34.030 --> 06:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
vote to itl this bill today on some
 
06:15:34.040 --> 06:15:35.468 align:start position:0%
vote to itl this bill today on some
other

06:15:35.468 --> 06:15:35.478 align:start position:0%
other
 
06:15:39.708 --> 06:15:39.718 align:start position:0%
occasion uh that would certainly be well
 
06:15:42.788 --> 06:15:42.798 align:start position:0%
within the purview of the legislature I
 
06:15:46.430 --> 06:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
dare not tell you what to do thank you
 
06:15:50.670 --> 06:15:50.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:53.468 --> 06:15:53.478 align:start position:0%
there okay any other further questions
 
06:15:55.110 --> 06:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
for the
 
06:15:55.120 --> 06:15:58.390 align:start position:0%
for the
speaker

06:15:58.390 --> 06:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:02.350 --> 06:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
I see none thank you very much thank you
 
06:16:04.830 --> 06:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
I'd like to Now call our second uh
 
06:16:08.110 --> 06:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
speaker uh Rudy Ogden M Department of
 
06:16:10.110 --> 06:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
Labor Commissioner assistant
 
06:16:16.788 --> 06:16:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:20.190 --> 06:16:20.200 align:start position:0%
us I am um I would just being mindful of
 
06:16:21.868 --> 06:16:21.878 align:start position:0%
everyone's time and keeping it short I'm
 
06:16:23.708 --> 06:16:23.718 align:start position:0%
happy to hear anyone's questions but I
 
06:16:25.670 --> 06:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
would Echo the sentiments just offered
 
06:16:27.628 --> 06:16:27.638 align:start position:0%
that essentially I think that you'll see
 
06:16:30.708 --> 06:16:30.718 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 69 offering a cleaner
 
06:16:35.750 --> 06:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
product on on this um specifically the
 
06:16:37.830 --> 06:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
department with this bill does have some
 
06:16:40.510 --> 06:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
concerns due to the lack of clarity on
 
06:16:43.788 --> 06:16:43.798 align:start position:0%
what break time should be provided uh so
 
06:16:46.270 --> 06:16:46.280 align:start position:0%
again I just echoing director Malachi's
 
06:16:48.310 --> 06:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
thoughts I think Senate Bill 69 cleans
 
06:16:49.830 --> 06:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
up some of the concepts for your
 
06:16:52.708 --> 06:16:52.718 align:start position:0%

lactating the bill before you is based
 
06:18:53.350 --> 06:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
on a Senate bill from last session that
 
06:18:55.030 --> 06:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
never reached the house because of
 
06:18:57.708 --> 06:18:57.718 align:start position:0%
shutdowns and delays caused by the covid
 
06:19:00.150 --> 06:19:00.160 align:start position:0%

Employees experienc with state employees
 
06:19:14.948 --> 06:19:14.958 align:start position:0%

06:19:17.190 --> 06:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
positive benefits for the employer
 
06:19:18.868 --> 06:19:18.878 align:start position:0%
employees and their
 
06:19:22.430 --> 06:19:22.440 align:start position:0%

places of employment of fewer than six
 
06:20:08.350 --> 06:20:08.360 align:start position:0%

breastfeeding Mr chair and committee
 
06:20:33.830 --> 06:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
members I sponsored HB 231 because I
 
06:20:36.670 --> 06:20:36.680 align:start position:0%
strongly believe this bill is pro bus
 
06:20:40.468 --> 06:20:40.478 align:start position:0%
pro- employee and pro- family it helps
 
06:20:42.830 --> 06:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
businesses recruit and retain quality
 
06:20:46.190 --> 06:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
employees in an important demographic it
 
06:20:48.390 --> 06:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
builds loyalty in employees who
 
06:20:51.310 --> 06:20:51.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate their employers reasonable
 
06:20:53.868 --> 06:20:53.878 align:start position:0%
accommodations it reduces the time and
 
06:20:56.350 --> 06:20:56.360 align:start position:0%
cost from employee turnover
 
06:20:58.190 --> 06:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
and needing to find and train
 
06:21:01.190 --> 06:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
Replacements it's a winwin win as
 
06:21:03.190 --> 06:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
working mothers are able to stay with
 
06:21:03.200 --> 06:21:03.948 align:start position:0%
working mothers are able to stay with
their

their
 
06:21:06.110 --> 06:21:06.120 align:start position:0%

06:21:09.070 --> 06:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
committee's work to make h231 the best

suggested by Senator
 
06:25:51.390 --> 06:25:51.400 align:start position:0%
Bradley S sp69 I testified that is the
 
06:25:55.030 --> 06:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
other that's the pumping only bill so
 
06:25:57.910 --> 06:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
that Bill explicitly states that it
 
06:26:01.030 --> 06:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
excludes breastfeeding during work hours
 
06:26:05.390 --> 06:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
and there was testimony that was
 
06:26:09.110 --> 06:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
um opposition it was opposite there was
 
06:26:10.670 --> 06:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
two different people that testified
 
06:26:13.510 --> 06:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
saying opposite things so the sponsor of
 
06:26:16.390 --> 06:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
that bill Senator
 
06:26:20.190 --> 06:26:20.200 align:start position:0%
Whitley said that s sp69 does not
 
06:26:20.200 --> 06:26:21.670 align:start position:0%
Whitley said that s sp69 does not
exclude

06:26:21.670 --> 06:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
exclude
 
06:26:23.628 --> 06:26:23.638 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding it just excluded
 
06:26:25.708 --> 06:26:25.718 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding from the definition of
 
06:26:25.718 --> 06:26:27.070 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding from the definition of
expressing

06:26:27.070 --> 06:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
expressing
 
06:26:30.708 --> 06:26:30.718 align:start position:0%
milk another person testified saying we
 
06:26:32.270 --> 06:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
are not recommending breastfeeding
 
06:26:34.110 --> 06:26:34.120 align:start position:0%
during work
 
06:26:37.990 --> 06:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:41.468 --> 06:26:41.478 align:start position:0%
h231 is compliant with federal and state
 
06:26:45.190 --> 06:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
laws and the EEOC enforcement guidances
 
06:26:46.750 --> 06:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
I know I'm going on here do you want me
 
06:26:46.760 --> 06:26:47.628 align:start position:0%
I know I'm going on here do you want me
to

06:26:47.628 --> 06:26:47.638 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:26:50.510 --> 06:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
continue just a few more minutes please
 
06:26:51.468 --> 06:26:51.478 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
06:26:55.390 --> 06:26:55.400 align:start position:0%
you what I testified about s sp69 is
 
06:26:57.750 --> 06:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
that it may not be lawful and the
 
06:27:02.468 --> 06:27:02.478 align:start position:0%
reasons why are because there's an EEOC
 
06:27:05.190 --> 06:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement guidance on pregnancy and
 
06:27:08.948 --> 06:27:08.958 align:start position:0%
related medical conditions and it states
 
06:27:10.948 --> 06:27:10.958 align:start position:0%
that discriminating against an employee
 
06:27:15.430 --> 06:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
for pumping and breastfeeding is
 
06:27:18.750 --> 06:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
discriminatory s
 
06:27:22.230 --> 06:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
sp69 serves to fill a gap in the federal
 
06:27:25.390 --> 06:27:25.400 align:start position:0%
law that left out protections for
 
06:27:29.030 --> 06:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
teachers restaurant workers
 
06:27:33.150 --> 06:27:33.160 align:start position:0%
managers and employees whose babies
 
06:27:35.788 --> 06:27:35.798 align:start position:0%
don't latch right away maybe they need
 
06:27:39.910 --> 06:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
surgery on their mouth on their cheek on
 
06:27:42.788 --> 06:27:42.798 align:start position:0%
their tongue they can't
 
06:27:46.830 --> 06:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
latch so that bill sb69 closes the Gap
 
06:27:49.430 --> 06:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
only for hourly workers this bill is
 
06:27:52.548 --> 06:27:52.558 align:start position:0%
more inclusive it closes the gap for
 
06:27:56.468 --> 06:27:56.478 align:start position:0%
everyone the question I have is
 
06:27:58.190 --> 06:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
how can you spend so much money on
 
06:27:58.200 --> 06:27:59.468 align:start position:0%
how can you spend so much money on
supporting

06:27:59.468 --> 06:27:59.478 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
06:28:02.270 --> 06:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding and exclude breastfeeding
 
06:28:04.270 --> 06:28:04.280 align:start position:0%
just this week
 
06:28:08.070 --> 06:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
$9.5 million was put into the 2021
 
06:28:13.430 --> 06:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:15.270 --> 06:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding the Department of Health
 
06:28:17.030 --> 06:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
and Human Services and the New Hampshire
 
06:28:19.468 --> 06:28:19.478 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding task force just gave out
 
06:28:22.628 --> 06:28:22.638 align:start position:0%
grants to create 43 different lactation
 
06:28:25.150 --> 06:28:25.160 align:start position:0%
stations at businesses all over New New
 
06:28:26.948 --> 06:28:26.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't see how you can
 
06:28:28.430 --> 06:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
exclude breastfeeding and support
 
06:28:31.030 --> 06:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding at the same
 
06:28:33.830 --> 06:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
time there are also other laws like
 
06:28:36.830 --> 06:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
title s the Civil Rights Act which
 
06:28:38.670 --> 06:28:38.680 align:start position:0%
includes the pregnancy Discrimination
 
06:28:42.670 --> 06:28:42.680 align:start position:0%
Act that I I believe
 
06:28:47.390 --> 06:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
sb69 may not be um taken into
 
06:28:50.230 --> 06:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
consideration and there's also four or
 
06:28:52.910 --> 06:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
five different case law that have come
 
06:28:56.070 --> 06:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
out that establish that lactation is a
 
06:29:00.190 --> 06:29:00.200 align:start position:0%

pregnancy thank you happy to answer any

I have any questions amongst any members
 
06:29:15.590 --> 06:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:18.430 --> 06:29:18.440 align:start position:0%
lob seeing none do I have any questions
 
06:29:20.910 --> 06:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
amongst the uh Representatives on Zoom I
 
06:29:23.110 --> 06:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
do see one hand I believe that
 
06:29:27.788 --> 06:29:27.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:30.430 --> 06:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:29:32.750 --> 06:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
um if I'm hearing you correctly you're
 
06:29:35.670 --> 06:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
saying that um um there are some things
 
06:29:38.910 --> 06:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
that are in um House Bill
 
06:29:42.270 --> 06:29:42.280 align:start position:0%
231 um that you believe ought to be
 
06:29:47.030 --> 06:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the final bill um I we
 
06:29:50.350 --> 06:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
also heard a few minutes ago that sb69
 
06:29:55.110 --> 06:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
is a cleaner bill um would it would it
 
06:29:59.910 --> 06:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
make more sense for us to amend s sp69
 
06:30:03.628 --> 06:30:03.638 align:start position:0%
to address um any existing faults or are
 
06:30:08.230 --> 06:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
you suggesting that s uh HB 231 is a
 
06:30:13.230 --> 06:30:13.240 align:start position:0%
better bill for us to uh um Carry
 
06:30:15.430 --> 06:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
forward thank you for your question
 
06:30:17.548 --> 06:30:17.558 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan I think the best
 
06:30:19.670 --> 06:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
idea would be to merge the two bills
 
06:30:21.750 --> 06:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
whichever number you want to
 
06:30:25.510 --> 06:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
keep um I know rep AEL and Senator
 
06:30:27.628 --> 06:30:27.638 align:start position:0%
Whitley the sponsors of those two bills
 
06:30:29.868 --> 06:30:29.878 align:start position:0%
are meeting the first week of February
 
06:30:32.270 --> 06:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
to go over
 
06:30:36.310 --> 06:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
that um what I testified for with
 
06:30:40.548 --> 06:30:40.558 align:start position:0%
regards to sb69 the pumping only Bill is
 
06:30:42.468 --> 06:30:42.478 align:start position:0%
that these bills should be merged and
 
06:30:45.990 --> 06:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
that I don't believe sb69 is lawful I
 
06:30:48.468 --> 06:30:48.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:48.478 --> 06:30:52.628 align:start position:0%
 
unconstitutional

06:30:52.628 --> 06:30:52.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:55.948 --> 06:30:55.958 align:start position:0%
followup followup Mr chairman yes yes
 
06:30:57.910 --> 06:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
followup yeah
 
06:31:01.788 --> 06:31:01.798 align:start position:0%
um Do You Believe sb69 could be amended
 
06:31:04.990 --> 06:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
to make it lawful absolutely I think
 
06:31:06.708 --> 06:31:06.718 align:start position:0%
that everybody is willing to work
 
06:31:08.830 --> 06:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
together there perhaps have been
 
06:31:10.430 --> 06:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
scheduling conflicts that haven't made
 
06:31:13.110 --> 06:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
that possible this bill was originally
 
06:31:15.110 --> 06:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
drafted by Martha Fuller
 
06:31:18.070 --> 06:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
Clark um a week
 
06:31:21.230 --> 06:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
after my lawsuit was heard in the New
 
06:31:22.990 --> 06:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme
 
06:31:27.548 --> 06:31:27.558 align:start position:0%
Court and it was was pulled after U Miss
 
06:31:33.510 --> 06:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
Malachi um spoke to Senator filler Clark
 
06:31:37.830 --> 06:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
um and we tried to work on it after that
 
06:31:41.468 --> 06:31:41.478 align:start position:0%
and now rep Abel has taken it over um
 
06:31:43.948 --> 06:31:43.958 align:start position:0%
Senator Fuller former Senator Fuller
 
06:31:46.070 --> 06:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
Clark will also be at the meeting in
 
06:31:48.830 --> 06:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
February if she can attend she's been
 
06:31:48.840 --> 06:31:50.430 align:start position:0%
February if she can attend she's been
invited

06:31:50.430 --> 06:31:50.440 align:start position:0%
invited
 
06:31:54.708 --> 06:31:54.718 align:start position:0%
um I've made this my whole life I am so
 
06:31:58.070 --> 06:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
so dedicated to these issues that I'm
 
06:32:00.990 --> 06:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
going into $200,000 worth of debt to
 
06:32:03.750 --> 06:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
become a lawyer and I love it I had no
 
06:32:05.830 --> 06:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
idea that this was my passion when this
 
06:32:08.310 --> 06:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
happened to me but I can tell you how
 
06:32:10.590 --> 06:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
horrible it has been to lose my
 
06:32:13.548 --> 06:32:13.558 align:start position:0%
income for my husband to have to carry
 
06:32:17.190 --> 06:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
our family for my parents to have to dip
 
06:32:19.708 --> 06:32:19.718 align:start position:0%
into their retirement money to help us
 
06:32:22.350 --> 06:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
because we couldn't make it on our own
 
06:32:25.190 --> 06:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
for the backlash that I received
 
06:32:27.910 --> 06:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
um for bringing up the
 
06:32:32.590 --> 06:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
lawsuit etc etc what it has done is made
 
06:32:35.628 --> 06:32:35.638 align:start position:0%
me more active in the legislature and I
 
06:32:38.708 --> 06:32:38.718 align:start position:0%
have been able to work with legislators
 
06:32:40.510 --> 06:32:40.520 align:start position:0%
from every
 
06:32:43.788 --> 06:32:43.798 align:start position:0%
party and it's been an invaluable
 
06:32:45.990 --> 06:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
experience that I've enjoyed very much I
 
06:32:48.868 --> 06:32:48.878 align:start position:0%
hope to continue to do that and I know
 
06:32:51.230 --> 06:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
we can find a solution I know Reb Abel
 
06:32:55.670 --> 06:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
and myself both feel will make any
 
06:32:57.948 --> 06:32:57.958 align:start position:0%
amendments necessary to get something
 
06:33:00.270 --> 06:33:00.280 align:start position:0%
passed the problem
 
06:33:04.670 --> 06:33:04.680 align:start position:0%
is for the last seven years every Bill
 
06:33:06.990 --> 06:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
we've put forth all the accommodations
 
06:33:09.670 --> 06:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
in them to actually help lactating
 
06:33:12.468 --> 06:33:12.478 align:start position:0%
employees have been removed the only
 
06:33:15.070 --> 06:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
Provisions that have passed have been to
 
06:33:17.310 --> 06:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
form an advisory Council on lactation
 
06:33:17.320 --> 06:33:18.510 align:start position:0%
form an advisory Council on lactation
and

06:33:18.510 --> 06:33:18.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:33:21.030 --> 06:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
pregnancy so it's time to get something
 
06:33:23.190 --> 06:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
past you know it's a pandemic right now
 
06:33:27.190 --> 06:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
as you all know and it turns out that
 
06:33:29.468 --> 06:33:29.478 align:start position:0%
the World Health Organization
 
06:33:31.708 --> 06:33:31.718 align:start position:0%
recommends even mothers that have been
 
06:33:33.628 --> 06:33:33.638 align:start position:0%
infected with covid continue direct
 
06:33:35.510 --> 06:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
access breastfeeding because the
 
06:33:38.070 --> 06:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
antibodies pass through the milk to the
 
06:33:41.190 --> 06:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
baby it's like vaccinating the
 
06:33:44.830 --> 06:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
baby so it's kind of pandemic urgent to
 
06:33:46.150 --> 06:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
pass this
 
06:33:49.110 --> 06:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
legislation um and I hope to be as
 
06:33:53.468 --> 06:33:53.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:53.478 --> 06:33:55.190 align:start position:0%
 
done

06:33:55.190 --> 06:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
done
 
06:33:59.350 --> 06:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:01.948 --> 06:34:01.958 align:start position:0%
speaker I see none in the Legislative
 
06:34:04.708 --> 06:34:04.718 align:start position:0%

06:34:58.628 --> 06:34:58.638 align:start position:0%
for additional testimony thank you um I
 
06:35:01.388 --> 06:35:01.398 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I I wanted to say before
 
06:35:06.708 --> 06:35:06.718 align:start position:0%
we moved forward it is um very important
 
06:35:10.230 --> 06:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
I I believe that we clarify and we
 
06:35:13.270 --> 06:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
compare apples to apples and oranges to
 
06:35:16.070 --> 06:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
oranges and
 
06:35:21.310 --> 06:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
um the HB 231 although uh Miss Frederick
 
06:35:24.468 --> 06:35:24.478 align:start position:0%
worked on on that um the the legis
 
06:35:27.190 --> 06:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
islative information there um what she
 
06:35:29.510 --> 06:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
stated was was accurate that it was
 
06:35:31.788 --> 06:35:31.798 align:start position:0%
something that she was a part of with uh
 
06:35:35.190 --> 06:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
Senator uh former Senator fer Clark um
 
06:35:38.910 --> 06:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
the difference is that HB 231 was an
 
06:35:43.388 --> 06:35:43.398 align:start position:0%
initial draft and not a completed work
 
06:35:43.398 --> 06:35:44.708 align:start position:0%
initial draft and not a completed work
and

06:35:44.708 --> 06:35:44.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:35:44.718 --> 06:35:47.070 align:start position:0%
and
so

06:35:47.070 --> 06:35:47.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:35:50.070 --> 06:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
sb69 which is moving its way through now
 
06:35:53.030 --> 06:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
is the completed work and that means
 
06:35:55.110 --> 06:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
that the eyes have been d the Tes have
 
06:35:57.868 --> 06:35:57.878 align:start position:0%
been crossed that the commission has
 
06:36:00.868 --> 06:36:00.878 align:start position:0%
been consulted regarding any changes
 
06:36:03.110 --> 06:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
that potentially need to be made the
 
06:36:07.110 --> 06:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
commission is the um authoritative body
 
06:36:09.948 --> 06:36:09.958 align:start position:0%
we are the ones that will take a charge
 
06:36:12.628 --> 06:36:12.638 align:start position:0%
of discrimination in whatever area in
 
06:36:14.190 --> 06:36:14.200 align:start position:0%
the areas of course that we have
 
06:36:16.628 --> 06:36:16.638 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction um and if a person comes to
 
06:36:19.430 --> 06:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
us and and has a charge that they would
 
06:36:22.510 --> 06:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
like to file um due to conf
 
06:36:24.910 --> 06:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
confidentiality we can't
 
06:36:28.070 --> 06:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
disclose what the um background
 
06:36:30.590 --> 06:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
information of that charge is um
 
06:36:32.788 --> 06:36:32.798 align:start position:0%
everyone that comes to us feels that
 
06:36:34.830 --> 06:36:34.840 align:start position:0%
they have a charge they may have a
 
06:36:38.030 --> 06:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
charge or they may not have a charge um
 
06:36:40.230 --> 06:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
but that is something that has to be
 
06:36:42.030 --> 06:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
done they have to meet the the legal
 
06:36:44.230 --> 06:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
standards and the burdens that we have
 
06:36:46.468 --> 06:36:46.478 align:start position:0%
as we move through the process in order
 
06:36:50.468 --> 06:36:50.478 align:start position:0%
for um for us to complete to for for us
 
06:36:52.270 --> 06:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
to docket a charge of
 
06:36:54.830 --> 06:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
discrimination um it is also important
 
06:36:57.990 --> 06:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
to understand that the work that was
 
06:37:01.788 --> 06:37:01.798 align:start position:0%
done on S sp69 previously and what is
 
06:37:03.948 --> 06:37:03.958 align:start position:0%
present what has already been presented
 
06:37:06.910 --> 06:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
as I said before is the completed work
 
06:37:09.070 --> 06:37:09.080 align:start position:0%
um I have I will I don't have any
 
06:37:11.708 --> 06:37:11.718 align:start position:0%
meetings scheduled at this point um I
 
06:37:16.230 --> 06:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
will be reaching out um to the senator
 
06:37:19.670 --> 06:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
um Senator Hennessy and I will go from
 
06:37:22.750 --> 06:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
there to determine who needs to who I'll
 
06:37:24.708 --> 06:37:24.718 align:start position:0%
need to talk to in terms of any
 
06:37:28.628 --> 06:37:28.638 align:start position:0%
amendments for 69 um but as um Mr Ogden
 
06:37:31.868 --> 06:37:31.878 align:start position:0%
stated um and as I've stated earlier
 
06:37:37.110 --> 06:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
that their 60 sb69 and HB
 
06:37:41.750 --> 06:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
231 um do not need to be combined of the
 
06:37:45.030 --> 06:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
two the stronger more complete more
 
06:37:48.830 --> 06:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
finished polished most most consensus
 
06:37:50.990 --> 06:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
would be
 
06:37:54.190 --> 06:37:54.200 align:start position:0%
sb69 and so even if the word breast
 
06:37:57.070 --> 06:37:57.080 align:start position:0%
feeding is left out um it is already
 
06:37:59.310 --> 06:37:59.320 align:start position:0%
covered in our statute and of the
 
06:38:02.430 --> 06:38:02.440 align:start position:0%
charges that we take we take very few in
 
06:38:05.590 --> 06:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
the areas in the area of pregnancy
 
06:38:07.830 --> 06:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
discrimination and if one looks at our
 
06:38:09.388 --> 06:38:09.398 align:start position:0%
statute they'll have a clearer
 
06:38:11.990 --> 06:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
understanding of what pregnancy means um
 
06:38:13.468 --> 06:38:13.478 align:start position:0%
I think there was a little confusion
 
06:38:15.510 --> 06:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
there that um that was shared in
 
06:38:18.468 --> 06:38:18.478 align:start position:0%
testimony um that's not 100% accurate as
 
06:38:20.990 --> 06:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
to what we cover um breastfeeding is
 
06:38:23.750 --> 06:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
covered already and um and the way the
 
06:38:27.150 --> 06:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
statute Works New Hampshire covers um
 
06:38:28.830 --> 06:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
smaller businesses so you have to have
 
06:38:32.430 --> 06:38:32.440 align:start position:0%
at least six employees so um that's the
 
06:38:34.270 --> 06:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
way the law is applied so we don't want
 
06:38:37.350 --> 06:38:37.360 align:start position:0%
to be more burdensome at the commission
 
06:38:39.468 --> 06:38:39.478 align:start position:0%
than the state of New Hampshire is on
 
06:38:42.310 --> 06:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
businesses and uh although we enforce
 
06:38:45.030 --> 06:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
the law we certainly want to partner
 
06:38:46.990 --> 06:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
with businesses to help them meet
 
06:38:48.868 --> 06:38:48.878 align:start position:0%
whatever burden they need to meet we
 
06:38:51.030 --> 06:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
want to work with employees and other
 
06:38:53.230 --> 06:38:53.240 align:start position:0%
individuals so that they understand what
 
06:38:56.070 --> 06:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
their place of business or what um a
 
06:38:58.670 --> 06:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
hotel or or some place of accommodation
 
06:39:00.388 --> 06:39:00.398 align:start position:0%
what their responsibilities are to them
 
06:39:02.670 --> 06:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
as a citizen so I wanted to make that
 
06:39:06.190 --> 06:39:06.200 align:start position:0%
very very clear that there um that
 
06:39:08.670 --> 06:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
there's some confusion in the language
 
06:39:11.948 --> 06:39:11.958 align:start position:0%
um although very emotive testimony um in
 
06:39:16.388 --> 06:39:16.398 align:start position:0%
HB 231 the clearer cleaner more concise
 
06:39:19.230 --> 06:39:19.240 align:start position:0%
with the most consensus and with the
 
06:39:21.350 --> 06:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
agreement of the business industry
 
06:39:23.350 --> 06:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
business and industry as well as the
 
06:39:26.150 --> 06:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
department of lab labor is going to be
 
06:39:28.628 --> 06:39:28.638 align:start position:0%
sb69 so thank you very much for
 
06:39:30.190 --> 06:39:30.200 align:start position:0%
indulging me and if you have any
 
06:39:32.230 --> 06:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
additional questions I'm available for
 
06:39:34.230 --> 06:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
that as
 
06:39:36.388 --> 06:39:36.398 align:start position:0%
well representative
 
06:39:39.310 --> 06:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
Sullivan thank you
 
06:39:44.190 --> 06:39:44.200 align:start position:0%
um let me try this um would I be correct
 
06:39:48.628 --> 06:39:48.638 align:start position:0%
in in thinking that um in your opinion
 
06:39:54.548 --> 06:39:54.558 align:start position:0%
SB uh 69 is good to go as is however
 
06:39:56.788 --> 06:39:56.798 align:start position:0%
if through meetings with any of these
 
06:39:56.798 --> 06:39:57.910 align:start position:0%
if through meetings with any of these
interested

06:39:57.910 --> 06:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
interested
 
06:40:02.910 --> 06:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
parties um a useful amendment is uh uh
 
06:40:05.628 --> 06:40:05.638 align:start position:0%
suggested you would be open to that yes
 
06:40:06.910 --> 06:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
that is thank you very much for the
 
06:40:08.788 --> 06:40:08.798 align:start position:0%
question representative Sullivan and the
 
06:40:10.708 --> 06:40:10.718 align:start position:0%
answer to that would be yes it is ready
 
06:40:15.510 --> 06:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
to go as it is however after meeting um
 
06:40:19.110 --> 06:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
if it is deemed that um the senator
 
06:40:21.590 --> 06:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
would like to add something um then we
 
06:40:23.350 --> 06:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
would certainly look at that and agree
 
06:40:26.430 --> 06:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
to it um and our job my job here is to
 
06:40:29.310 --> 06:40:29.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that anything that's added
 
06:40:32.350 --> 06:40:32.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't undo something else or become
 
06:40:34.670 --> 06:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
overly burdensome or additionally
 
06:40:42.070 --> 06:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:43.990 --> 06:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
354a all right thank you for your
 
06:40:45.548 --> 06:40:45.558 align:start position:0%

baky seeing none in the
 
06:40:57.150 --> 06:40:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:59.468 --> 06:40:59.478 align:start position:0%
Zoom Christina do we have any additional
 
06:41:01.430 --> 06:41:01.440 align:start position:0%

06:41:06.708 --> 06:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
so we have a Roberta burner who's got
 
06:41:09.548 --> 06:41:09.558 align:start position:0%
her a hand up but I believe it's rep AEL
 
06:41:12.030 --> 06:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
um under the name of his wife so he has
 
06:41:14.510 --> 06:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:18.310 --> 06:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
up okay I will recognize representative
 
06:41:20.708 --> 06:41:20.718 align:start position:0%
Abel representative AEL this is uh
 
06:41:23.868 --> 06:41:23.878 align:start position:0%
representative will infantine uh uh we
 
06:41:26.110 --> 06:41:26.120 align:start position:0%
did have someone call in we did uh
 
06:41:27.868 --> 06:41:27.878 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill on your behalf
 
06:41:29.990 --> 06:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth did that and
 
06:41:32.070 --> 06:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
then we had some testimony uh written
 
06:41:35.670 --> 06:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
testimony that was read on your behalf
 
06:41:38.868 --> 06:41:38.878 align:start position:0%
yes thank thank you can you all hear me
 
06:41:42.388 --> 06:41:42.398 align:start position:0%
um I I experienced some at the last
 
06:41:47.310 --> 06:41:47.320 align:start position:0%
minute some technical problems that uh I
 
06:41:49.468 --> 06:41:49.478 align:start position:0%
couldn't connect the the the the
 
06:41:54.110 --> 06:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate way um you have heard uh you
 
06:41:57.670 --> 06:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
have heard then my what I how I would
 
06:42:02.910 --> 06:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
have introduced the bill um I still
 
06:42:06.990 --> 06:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
believe that if if if I may make a
 
06:42:10.468 --> 06:42:10.478 align:start position:0%
suggestion you can take it uh if if you
 
06:42:15.990 --> 06:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
so desire if you wish um I believe that
 
06:42:22.388 --> 06:42:22.398 align:start position:0%
the best uh um the best way forward at
 
06:42:27.190 --> 06:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
this time would be it would be to retain
 
06:42:30.590 --> 06:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
the bill and let us work through some
 
06:42:35.150 --> 06:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
some things with with the Senate um so
 
06:42:37.868 --> 06:42:37.878 align:start position:0%
that we don't lose we don't lose the
 
06:42:42.990 --> 06:42:43.000 align:start position:0%
bill um I I I disagree with the uh
 
06:42:47.270 --> 06:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
previous speaker that the Senate bill is
 
06:42:51.388 --> 06:42:51.398 align:start position:0%
is necessarily clearer uh than this but
 
06:42:53.350 --> 06:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
the point the the the point is to get
 
06:42:56.990 --> 06:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
leg ation through so that we're helping
 
06:43:00.628 --> 06:43:00.638 align:start position:0%

want to get into a
 
06:45:29.350 --> 06:45:29.360 align:start position:0%

Al

06:45:39.350 --> 06:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
Al
 
06:45:43.430 --> 06:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
righty thank you chairman I'm actually
 
06:45:44.910 --> 06:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to do was read you
 
06:45:46.510 --> 06:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
testimony from other New Hampshire
 
06:45:48.190 --> 06:45:48.200 align:start position:0%
employees that have been discriminated
 
06:45:50.708 --> 06:45:50.718 align:start position:0%
against it's in the report I sent
 
06:45:54.468 --> 06:45:54.478 align:start position:0%
you however um I'm sort of sensing that
 
06:45:56.708 --> 06:45:56.718 align:start position:0%
maybe it would be best if I didn't just
 
06:46:01.270 --> 06:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
read it to you you have it um I agree
 
06:46:06.628 --> 06:46:06.638 align:start position:0%
with rep AEL that um in case sb69 gets
 
06:46:09.388 --> 06:46:09.398 align:start position:0%
killed because it may not be
 
06:46:13.670 --> 06:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
lawful then HB 231 would still be
 
06:46:17.548 --> 06:46:17.558 align:start position:0%
alive um and perhaps we could
 
06:46:21.190 --> 06:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
amend s sp69 together if all the parties
 
06:46:24.310 --> 06:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
are willing to work together um if you
 
06:46:26.110 --> 06:46:26.120 align:start position:0%
want me to read some of the testimony
 
06:46:29.548 --> 06:46:29.558 align:start position:0%
from other New Hampshire employees I can
 
06:46:31.468 --> 06:46:31.478 align:start position:0%
uh if you if they have been sent to us
 
06:46:34.510 --> 06:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
uh we will read them uh trust me uh I I
 
06:46:36.030 --> 06:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
know I can speak for myself and I'm sure
 
06:46:37.190 --> 06:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
many of the other committee members we
 
06:46:39.750 --> 06:46:39.760 align:start position:0%

06:46:41.388 --> 06:46:41.398 align:start position:0%

06:46:47.030 --> 06:46:47.040 align:start position:0%

while the bill was
 
06:46:56.788 --> 06:46:56.798 align:start position:0%
um exec ought to pass they admitted
 
06:46:58.270 --> 06:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
there were some changes that could be
 
06:47:01.030 --> 06:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
made and they were willing to amend um
 
06:47:03.430 --> 06:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
the bill is that how you understand it
 
06:47:12.590 --> 06:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
