have to use this room for those bills
 
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 align:start position:0%
which we expect or may have a number of
 
00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
people wanting to testify and so before
 
00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 align:start position:0%
we go ahead into the hearing process I'd
 
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 align:start position:0%
like to go over some of the rules
 
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
associated with our ability to use this
 
00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 align:start position:0%
room which is a very important room here
 
00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire it's the
 
00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 align:start position:0%
house of the people and in the general
 
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
court we have rules and I'm going to go
 
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 align:start position:0%
through a few of them right now if in
 
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 align:start position:0%
fact there's anything in the pockets
 
00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
right in front of you where you're
 
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 align:start position:0%

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
person that sits at that please don't
 
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
take any of that material we oftentimes
 
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 align:start position:0%
distribute there shouldn't be much there
 
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 align:start position:0%
today seeing we we're not having a
 
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 align:start position:0%
session this week nor are we having one
 
00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
next next week in there food and drink
 
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
in the hall here we recognize that we
 
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
want to stay hydrated however the only
 
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
beverage allowed in the hall is water
 
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
so coffee is not allowed here Pepsi Coke
 
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
not allowed here in the house itself but
 
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
water yes and please you know do hydrate
 
00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 align:start position:0%
as we go along all the house rules that
 
00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 align:start position:0%
are here for the representatives and
 
00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 align:start position:0%
when Senators come in as well are
 
00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 align:start position:0%
applicable to us here today
 
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
so there be no signage in here
 
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 align:start position:0%
advocating your position or advocating
 
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
against your position there will be no
 
00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 align:start position:0%
clapping showing of Expressions such as
 
00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 align:start position:0%
that especially emotion and we also
 
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 align:start position:0%
don't want the clapping
 
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.649 align:start position:0%
don't want the clapping
uh

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:18.659 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 align:start position:0%
we also have rules where there's a
 
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
wearing of materials sometimes people
 
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
wear hats and all that with
 
00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 align:start position:0%
literature in the Hat
 
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 align:start position:0%
Etc are not allowed
 
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 align:start position:0%
so just generally another thing that I
 
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
do always here when I'm running I'm
 
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 align:start position:0%
meeting an education that if we have a
 
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
parent showing up with children I
 
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
oftentimes will allow that parent with
 
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
those children to come up and speak as
 
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
they come so we can get the youngsters
 
00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 align:start position:0%
out and back to what they need to be
 
00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
doing I'm talking about young ones now
 
00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
that are preschool and up through the
 
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
first Elementary grades right up through
 
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 align:start position:0%
about fifth grade we'll try to get
 
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 align:start position:0%
people Audi as quick as we can and also
 
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
there are some people that travel
 
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 align:start position:0%
extensive distances in our state down
 
00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
for these hearings and I'm not seeing a
 
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 align:start position:0%
whole lot out here right now so I think
 
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to be good with that but
 
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
oftentimes I will try to get somebody
 
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
that's coming down from Pittsburgh or
 
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 align:start position:0%
Colebrook or up where traffic's pretty
 
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
heavy in the southern part of the state
 
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
a certain hours a day try to get them
 
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
out as well in a timely fashion
 
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
if we have testimony we've had some
 
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
testimony in the past where we've had
 
00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 align:start position:0%
numerous pink cards in order to speak
 
00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:36.590 align:start position:0%
numerous pink cards in order to speak
today

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
there's a pink card similar to the one
 
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
I'm holding up right here if you want to
 
00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 align:start position:0%
speak you need to have one of these
 
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
filled out and presented to the folks
 
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
out back in the ante room and they will
 
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
be brought down to us here at the well
 
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
so we can get you lined up
 
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
I will oftentimes also if a senator
 
00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
walks in and wants to testify try to get
 
00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
them up and have them present or state
 
00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 align:start position:0%
what they want as quickly as possible we
 
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 align:start position:0%
have 24 senators in the state here of
 
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
which they are on not just one committee
 
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
they may be on two three or four
 
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
different committees and a lot going on
 
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
that particular day and they can't hang
 
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
around here for an hour and a half
 
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
waiting for their opportunity to speak
 
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
so we'll just put them right into the
 
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
queue and have them uh present their
 
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
position that applies it's applicable
 
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 align:start position:0%
also to our officials such as the
 
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
governor and and council members on the
 
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 align:start position:0%
governor's Council
 
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
I think that takes us through most of
 
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
what we're going to be doing today if
 
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 align:start position:0%
you're going to be testifying today and
 
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
if you have written testimony it's
 
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
appreciated if you do not go through and
 
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 align:start position:0%
read it verbatim try to summarize it and
 
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
then to leave a copy of that written
 
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
testimony so the written testimony can
 
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
be entered into the record
 
00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
so we'll have that available and that
 
00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 align:start position:0%
can be provided to the people out in the
 
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
ante room or dropped off here with one
 
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
of the Reps sitting in front of you here
 
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
the folks sitting out front are the
 
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
members of the House Education committee
 
00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
we have 20 people on the house committee
 
00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:11.639 align:start position:0%
and this year we have 10 Republicans and
 
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
10 Democrats on that committee so I'd
 
00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 align:start position:0%
like to go ahead now and open up this
 
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 align:start position:0%
hearing this hearing is a hearing on HB
 
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.189 align:start position:0%
hearing this hearing is a hearing on HB
61.

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
61.
 
00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:23.330 align:start position:0%
61.
yeah

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 align:start position:0%
and we do have copies of that available
 
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
not in this chamber here but they can be
 
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 align:start position:0%
available up in the clerk's office area
 
00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
and they're also in the ante room as
 
00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:33.350 align:start position:0%
and they're also in the ante room as
well

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
so with that I'd like to open up and I'd
 
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
like to invite down our Prime sponsor of
 
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 align:start position:0%
this bill representative Peter Petrino
 
00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:43.639 align:start position:0%
who is going to be introducing the bill
 
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
and one other thing we may at times ask
 
00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:50.819 align:start position:0%
this room fills up go into time limits
 
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
however when I had the prime sponsor the
 
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
person that's responsible for
 
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
introducing this I oftentimes will give
 
00:06:59.809 --> 00:06:59.819 align:start position:0%
a lot of latitude to the prime sponsor
 
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
so they have the ability to use more
 
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
than two three four five minutes if
 
00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
that's necessary so welcome
 
00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:09.189 align:start position:0%
that's necessary so welcome

00:07:58.189 --> 00:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
Friends
 
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
consist of teachers
 
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
and I consider myself speaking today
 
00:08:05.089 --> 00:08:05.099 align:start position:0%
more so as an educator
 
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:07.860 align:start position:0%
than I do as a legislator now in fact
 
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:09.780 align:start position:0%
last night I had a dream that I was back
 
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
at school and I couldn't find my
 
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.350 align:start position:0%
at school and I couldn't find my
classroom

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.210 align:start position:0%
classroom
that's

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
that's the truth
 
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
well I taught for 19 years in an
 
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:21.720 align:start position:0%
all-boys Catholic High School
 
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:24.780 align:start position:0%
in my last 21 years in two New Hampshire
 
00:08:26.809 --> 00:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
public high schools
 
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:28.860 align:start position:0%
I served for many years as the
 
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
department chair
 
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
supervising upwards to 13 teachers at a
 
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:33.949 align:start position:0%
supervising upwards to 13 teachers at a
time

00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:33.959 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
I've interviewed and hired many teachers
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
along the way
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
I was the chair of my school district's
 
00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
last complete revision of the K-12
 
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
social studies curriculum revision
 
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
and extensive documents that we worked
 
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:49.980 align:start position:0%
on for a number of years
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
and using the New Hampshire Department
 
00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:54.779 align:start position:0%
of education's curriculum framework as
 
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
our guide
 
00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
in all that time
 
00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:02.519 align:start position:0%
in all my encounters with educators
 
00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
from across the country
 
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
I never ever heard
 
00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
of critical race Theory
 
00:09:12.889 --> 00:09:12.899 align:start position:0%
or divisive Concepts never heard of it
 
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
in fact when I first heard of it just a
 
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
few years ago I had to look it up
 
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
and even then I wasn't exactly sure what
 
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
it was all about and I had to do more
 
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.170 align:start position:0%
it was all about and I had to do more
research

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
so to be honest I really never
 
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:28.860 align:start position:0%
understood why there was need
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
for this law
 
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
in the first place
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
now those who support the law claim it
 
00:09:36.769 --> 00:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
is meant to prevent discrimination in
 
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:39.660 align:start position:0%
schools and in the workplace however you
 
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
may recall that the original House Bill
 
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
focused exclusively on race and gender
 
00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
and the governor made it clear that
 
00:09:51.769 --> 00:09:51.779 align:start position:0%
there was no way he would support that
 
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
so it was later amended in the Senate to
 
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
include discrimination
 
00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:58.140 align:start position:0%
of all kinds
 
00:09:59.810 --> 00:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
as such
 
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
it was explained that with the amended
 
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:03.829 align:start position:0%
it was explained that with the amended
version

00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
version
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
a school could not teach that
 
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
able-bodied people are inherently
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
oppressive against disabled people
 
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
that younger Americans broadly
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
discriminate against older Americans
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
that this notion is absolutely laughable
 
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:23.100 align:start position:0%
it's ludicrous so far-fetched no such
 
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
discussions as these examples occur in
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
the classroom those who went to the
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
profession are for the most part loving
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
caring compassionate and selfless
 
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
individuals far from being prejudiced
 
00:10:37.009 --> 00:10:37.019 align:start position:0%
and discriminatory
 
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
the amended version was simply an
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
attempt to camouflage the Bill's
 
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
original intent
 
00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:45.959 align:start position:0%
to prevent honest and open discussion on
 
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
matters of race and gender that some
 
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
people simply don't like
 
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
and they don't want disgust
 
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
the law has nothing to do with real
 
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.769 align:start position:0%
the law has nothing to do with real
discrimination

00:10:57.769 --> 00:10:57.779 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:01.140 align:start position:0%
or honest academic inquiry
 
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
instead the law was meant to silence
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
teaches voices
 
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
I'd like to go back to the days
 
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
when teachers were respected
 
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:15.180 align:start position:0%
23 years ago I stood here in this
 
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:17.700 align:start position:0%
chamber before the entire house
 
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:19.740 align:start position:0%
and received the standing ovation when
 
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
the speaker presented me with a
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
commendation for being named the New
 
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:26.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire teacher of the year
 
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
I don't know when the last time was
 
00:11:30.769 --> 00:11:30.779 align:start position:0%
that a New Hampshire teacher of the year
 
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
was presented before the house and
 
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
received such accolades certainly not in
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
the last four years that I have been
 
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:41.220 align:start position:0%
in the house
 
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
instead last year I sat in this room
 
00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:47.220 align:start position:0%
and I heard a speech in which teachers
 
00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:55.740 align:start position:0%
what has happened over the years
 
00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.050 align:start position:0%
what has happened over the years
where

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:11:58.910 --> 00:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
has the respect
 
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:05.700 align:start position:0%
teachers just want to teach as we always
 
00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.190 align:start position:0%
teachers just want to teach as we always
have

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:09.839 align:start position:0%
without the interference of the states
 
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
without the fear of an Inquisition
 
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
or the loss of our credentials
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
all because maybe a student
 
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted the class discussion
 
00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
or just wanted to be a crankster
 
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
as one of my former colleagues told me
 
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
that how during a lesson on the Civil
 
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
Rights Movement
 
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
one of her students said
 
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:36.180 align:start position:0%
Miss is this something I'm going to have
 
00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:38.220 align:start position:0%
to report you on
 
00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
it wasn't funny to her
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
even with the guidelines from the
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
teach is still wonder
 
00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
if they can refer to the KKK
 
00:12:57.769 --> 00:12:57.779 align:start position:0%
as an inherently racist group
 
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
how is an elementary teacher
 
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
who is celebrating Martin Luther King Jr
 
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
day with their students
 
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
supposed to respond when her first
 
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
grader asks
 
00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
why why were some white people so mean
 
00:13:15.769 --> 00:13:15.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
I've always understood that laws are
 
00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
enacted to address pressing problems in
 
00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.090 align:start position:0%
enacted to address pressing problems in
society

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
society
 
00:13:24.769 --> 00:13:24.779 align:start position:0%
some would argue that there are much
 
00:13:26.569 --> 00:13:26.579 align:start position:0%
greater concerns than the perceived
 
00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
discrimination in the classroom and
 
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
workplace school shootings
 
00:13:33.889 --> 00:13:33.899 align:start position:0%
being one instance
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
yet there are those who would not
 
00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
sacrifice an inch of their second
 
00:13:40.129 --> 00:13:40.139 align:start position:0%
amendment rights
 
00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:41.700 align:start position:0%
to deal with the problem of school
 
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:42.949 align:start position:0%
to deal with the problem of school
shootings

00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
shootings
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
so why then would we sacrifice our first
 
00:13:48.889 --> 00:13:48.899 align:start position:0%
amendment rights of free speech to
 
00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
stifle honest and open discussion in the
 
00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
classrooms especially when there is no
 
00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.009 align:start position:0%
classrooms especially when there is no
urgent

00:13:55.009 --> 00:13:55.019 align:start position:0%
urgent
 
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
of a particularly disturbing nature
 
00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:06.839 align:start position:0%
recently I and the co-sponsors of this
 
00:14:06.839 --> 00:14:08.030 align:start position:0%
recently I and the co-sponsors of this
legislation

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
received an email
 
00:14:12.829 --> 00:14:12.839 align:start position:0%
from the vowed racist
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
who called us Auntie White
 
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
for proposing this bill
 
00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:20.220 align:start position:0%
and as he said
 
00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
and I quote
 
00:14:24.769 --> 00:14:24.779 align:start position:0%
kids are rejecting the critical race
 
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:28.740 align:start position:0%
Theory BS being taught in the classroom
 
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
and he spelled out the expletive
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
they are sick of being force-fed
 
00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
anti-white hate and they are sick of end
 
00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.170 align:start position:0%
anti-white hate and they are sick of end
behavior

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:39.180 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
wherever they look
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
and he spelled out the n-word
 
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
I want to make it very clear
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
that I am not suggesting that those who
 
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
support the current law are racist there
 
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
are many good people who sincerely
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
believe that the law is
 
00:14:53.519 --> 00:14:55.610 align:start position:0%
believe that the law is
anti-discriminatory

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
anti-discriminatory
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
however there are racists as evident
 
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
from the email I received that believe
 
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:05.940 align:start position:0%
that the law promotes their agenda
 
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:07.980 align:start position:0%
there were those who would argue that
 
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
the sentiments expressed in that email
 
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
reflect the actual intent of the
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
to silence teaches voices
 
00:15:20.449 --> 00:15:20.459 align:start position:0%
to suppress discussion on matters they
 
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
don't want disgust
 
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
those who truly love freedom are not
 
00:15:26.279 --> 00:15:27.590 align:start position:0%
those who truly love freedom are not
afraid

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
afraid
 
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
to have an honest and open exchange of
 
00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.310 align:start position:0%
to have an honest and open exchange of
ideas

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
ideas
 
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:34.740 align:start position:0%
there is nothing more Un-American than
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
being close-minded and stifling free
 
00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.949 align:start position:0%
being close-minded and stifling free
expression

00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:39.959 align:start position:0%
expression
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
now some will say the teachers are wrong
 
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
they can still Teach as they always have
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
they will say the racists are wrong
 
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
that the law is actually meant to
 
00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:52.860 align:start position:0%
prevent discrimination
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
what's really wrong is this law
 
00:15:58.970 --> 00:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
and it's clear that there is a lot of
 
00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:02.519 align:start position:0%
confusion and uncertainty and that alone
 
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
makes it a bad law
 
00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
more so
 
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
it is an insult to every teacher
 
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
in a detriment to every student
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
and I ask for your consideration to
 
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
repeal this law
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for listening to my
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
testimony and I am happy to answer any
 
00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.290 align:start position:0%
testimony and I am happy to answer any
questions

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative are
 
00:16:29.329 --> 00:16:29.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:29.339 --> 00:16:32.269 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
question I I keep reading and rereading
 
00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:42.620 align:start position:0%
through the law that you want to repeal
 
00:16:47.689 --> 00:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
and I still am unsure what in the law
 
00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
itself what in the wording
 
00:16:50.699 --> 00:16:51.350 align:start position:0%
itself what in the wording
um

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
makes a teacher unable to teach about
 
00:16:58.249 --> 00:16:58.259 align:start position:0%
slavery about racism about Martin Luther
 
00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
King about the Civil Rights Movement
 
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
about being able to have honest
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
discussions because talking about a
 
00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:10.220 align:start position:0%
topic and teaching that somebody is
 
00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:12.839 align:start position:0%
inherently better than another
 
00:17:14.809 --> 00:17:14.819 align:start position:0%
are two different things and so I'm
 
00:17:17.809 --> 00:17:17.819 align:start position:0%
hoping you can enlighten me in what in
 
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:19.980 align:start position:0%
this bill what in this law actually
 
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
stops a teacher from teaching all of the
 
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:25.740 align:start position:0%
you know about all of those issues thank
 
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
you yes thank you for asking the
 
00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:28.490 align:start position:0%
you yes thank you for asking the
question

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:31.020 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned before I can't see why
 
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
there was a need for this law to begin
 
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
with because any of the concerns that
 
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
this law supposedly was supposed to
 
00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
address was never an issue to begin with
 
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is this
 
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
regardless of what the law may or may
 
00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
not say teachers are in fact very
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
confused the examples that I gave them
 
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:52.740 align:start position:0%
my testimony are real they're not made
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
up I hear it from my former colleagues
 
00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
and friends all the time why do we have
 
00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:01.980 align:start position:0%
this law can I teach this can I say that
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Education put out
 
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
a directive
 
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
and in it it uses the words inherently
 
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
racist tell me is the KKK inherently
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
racist can a teacher actually say that
 
00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
does the teacher say hmm if I say that
 
00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:20.220 align:start position:0%
in class like that student just kind of
 
00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
being silly Miss is this something I
 
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
have to report you on is that something
 
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
really teachers want to have hanging
 
00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:29.220 align:start position:0%
over their head maybe the law just needs
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
to be changed no maybe the law just
 
00:18:33.049 --> 00:18:33.059 align:start position:0%
needs to go
 
00:18:33.059 --> 00:18:34.130 align:start position:0%
needs to go
okay

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:34.140 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:36.059 align:start position:0%
thank you very much further questions
 
00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:37.740 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:40.140 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative thank
 
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.409 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative thank

00:18:42.409 --> 00:18:42.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
is representative Ammon in the
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
we now had the prime give the bill now
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have if you is there if
 
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
there is written testimony would you
 
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
please try to summarize and speak to
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
your your intent and your primary points
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair good morning members
 
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Keith Ammon I
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:29.220 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of disinformation about
 
00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:31.799 align:start position:0%
this law
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
and I thought one easy way to clear it
 
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
up and just to get this into the record
 
00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:38.039 align:start position:0%
is to not read the whole
 
00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
law that's looking to be repealed
 
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
but at least the The major portion of it
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
there are two sections of the law that
 
00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:49.980 align:start position:0%
are going that that would be repealed
 
00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
have if this bill passes and this is the
 
00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
second attempt uh to try to repeal these
 
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.350 align:start position:0%
second attempt uh to try to repeal these
laws

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
laws
 
00:19:59.570 --> 00:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
the first one has to do with teaching on
 
00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.490 align:start position:0%
the first one has to do with teaching on
discrimination

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
in the other section which is even a
 
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
larger section has to do with
 
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
the freedom from the Discrimination in
 
00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
public workplaces
 
00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:14.220 align:start position:0%
and education
 
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
so the these sections of law there's
 
00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
repeating sections I won't have to read
 
00:20:21.529 --> 00:20:21.539 align:start position:0%
the same thing over and over again
 
00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
but I would like to start with uh
 
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
prohibit prohibition on teaching
 
00:20:27.529 --> 00:20:27.539 align:start position:0%
discrimination this is what the law
 
00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
actually says there's a lot of again
 
00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:32.039 align:start position:0%
misinformation about this law
 
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:33.780 align:start position:0%
there's no such thing as divisive
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
Concepts in this bill so if you're
 
00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:37.799 align:start position:0%
someone say that they're referencing
 
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
something that doesn't exist
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
it says no pupil in any public school in
 
00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:43.799 align:start position:0%
the state shall be taught instructed
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
inculcated or compelled to express
 
00:20:48.169 --> 00:20:48.179 align:start position:0%
belief in or support of any one or more
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
of the following
 
00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
that one's age sex gender identity
 
00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
sexual orientation race Creed color
 
00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
marital status familial status mental or
 
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
physical disability religion or national
 
00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:04.460 align:start position:0%
origin is inherently Superior to people
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
of any
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
of those other things
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
so no individual is inherently Superior
 
00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
based on those traits
 
00:21:15.409 --> 00:21:15.419 align:start position:0%
also that an individual by virtue of is
 
00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
or her age sex gender identity sexual
 
00:21:21.049 --> 00:21:21.059 align:start position:0%
orientation race Creed color marital
 
00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:22.860 align:start position:0%
status familial status mental or
 
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
physical disability
 
00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
religion or national origin is
 
00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
inherently racist sexist or oppressive
 
00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
whether consciously or unconsciously
 
00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
again it's about the individual
 
00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
it's not about a group of people it's
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
nothing in this section shall be
 
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
construed to prohibit discussing as part
 
00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
of a larger course of academic

section

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:17.820 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on to say any person
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
who's aggrieved by a violation has a has
 
00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
a recourse to try to work it out
 
00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
so that's what the law actually says the
 
00:22:27.049 --> 00:22:27.059 align:start position:0%
section on
 
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
prohibition of public employers applies
 
00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
to teaching
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:40.740 align:start position:0%
so we hear that this law is vague and
 
00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:41.870 align:start position:0%
so we hear that this law is vague and
unclear

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
unclear
 
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:44.039 align:start position:0%
it seems very clear to me
 
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice the Department
 
00:22:48.529 --> 00:22:48.539 align:start position:0%
of Education and the Human Rights
 
00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:50.820 align:start position:0%
Council has put out clear guidance
 
00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:52.740 align:start position:0%
on how to
 
00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:56.940 align:start position:0%
navigate this law for educators
 
00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
public employees have limitations by
 
00:23:04.559 --> 00:23:05.570 align:start position:0%
public employees have limitations by
Nature

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
Nature
 
00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:07.740 align:start position:0%
on their freedom of speech
 
00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
a teacher hired to teach history
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
can't teach math because they want to
 
00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:16.140 align:start position:0%
they have to fulfill their role as a
 
00:23:18.049 --> 00:23:18.059 align:start position:0%
public educator
 
00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:19.860 align:start position:0%
they say it prohibits accurate teaching
 
00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
of History it's clear in the law that it
 
00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:23.820 align:start position:0%
does not
 
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
that matter is still an open question
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
there's a pending lawsuit as you may
 
00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.669 align:start position:0%
there's a pending lawsuit as you may
know

00:23:34.669 --> 00:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
that will decide that matter
 
00:23:39.289 --> 00:23:39.299 align:start position:0%
we heard in September the judge would
 
00:23:39.299 --> 00:23:40.250 align:start position:0%
we heard in September the judge would
issue

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
a ruling 30
 
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:44.940 align:start position:0%
or sorry 60 to 90 days
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
from September we still don't have that
 
00:23:46.559 --> 00:23:47.630 align:start position:0%
from September we still don't have that
ruling

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
ruling
 
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
and just it just to iterate
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
because someone files a lawsuit doesn't
 
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
so the purpose of this law
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
is to foster a truly colorblind and
 
00:24:12.289 --> 00:24:12.299 align:start position:0%
gender-blind society and make sure that
 
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:14.820 align:start position:0%
our children in school are being taught
 
00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
those values
 
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
and that's the end of my testimony I'll
 
00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:24.169 --> 00:24:24.179 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the committee
 
00:24:27.169 --> 00:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
yes representative Ellison
 
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh you just made a
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
statement about clear guidance on this
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
which was coming from the New Hampshire
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Education if in fact the
 
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
guidance is clear why are we hearing so
 
00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
many stories from teachers that it's not
 
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
I guess I would ask rhetorically
 
00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:52.860 align:start position:0%
what have they done to engage the
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to clear up
 
00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
those uncertainties
 
00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.029 align:start position:0%
those uncertainties
um

00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:02.090 align:start position:0%
um
unfortunately

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
there is uh a need
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
among some to try to instill
 
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
something called Collective guilt
 
00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.830 align:start position:0%
something called Collective guilt
where

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
they they think it's important
 
00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
teach some kids that because of the way
 
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
they were born they should feel guilty
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
about it
 
00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:24.529 align:start position:0%
about it
and

00:25:24.529 --> 00:25:24.539 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
it could be
 
00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
that that's the source of the confusion
 
00:25:31.789 --> 00:25:31.799 align:start position:0%
the law states that we treat everyone as
 
00:25:33.529 --> 00:25:33.539 align:start position:0%
individuals regardless of those
 
00:25:33.539 --> 00:25:34.850 align:start position:0%
individuals regardless of those
characteristics

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:34.860 align:start position:0%
characteristics
 
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:37.740 align:start position:0%
there's nothing clearer than that to me
 
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
when you start mixing it up
 
00:25:42.529 --> 00:25:42.539 align:start position:0%
with your group identity that's where
 
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
the confusion comes in
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much further
 
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee thank you
 
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
very much representative thank you
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have representative Tim
 
00:25:54.600 --> 00:26:02.529 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have representative Tim
Horrigan

00:26:02.529 --> 00:26:02.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan I see you put down
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
four minutes can you keep down to about
 
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
three oh that's right yes thank you very
 
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
much uh thank you Mr chair so I'm
 
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
representative Tim hawer again from the
 
00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:12.900 align:start position:0%
town of Durham
 
00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.390 align:start position:0%
town of Durham
um

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:16.860 align:start position:0%
first of all although this I should be
 
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
shortening my remarks my previous uh
 
00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
representative made a comment about
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
Collective guilt and that struck home
 
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:25.140 align:start position:0%
for me because
 
00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:26.820 align:start position:0%
um although the Oregon side of my family
 
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
not can also so pedigree came over in
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
the mid 19th century pretty much uh
 
00:26:33.409 --> 00:26:33.419 align:start position:0%
stayed out as much as they could out of
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
the Civil War and inspires they were on
 
00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
the pro-union and anti-slavery side of
 
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
it but my mother's family was very much
 
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
divided and in fact I probably
 
00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have been here if not
 
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:47.330 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have been here if not
um

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
if not the house slaves in Tennessee who
 
00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
are looking after my great-grandfather's
 
00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:55.140 align:start position:0%
family including my great-grandfather
 
00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
had not uh warned them of a that John
 
00:26:59.450 --> 00:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
Brown was coming and they would have
 
00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:01.860 align:start position:0%
been killed along with a number of other
 
00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
people at the slave rebellion so I've
 
00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
got a certain amount of collective guilt
 
00:27:09.409 --> 00:27:09.419 align:start position:0%
guilt there so and I accept that slavery
 
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
is part part of our history
 
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.409 align:start position:0%
is part part of our history
um

00:27:12.409 --> 00:27:12.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:14.039 align:start position:0%
so it takes out all the divisive
 
00:27:16.029 --> 00:27:16.039 align:start position:0%
language enter the law book by section
 
00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:19.860 align:start position:0%
297 of chapter law 2021 better known as
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
hb2 the Budget Trailer bill and the
 
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
first language that language may appear
 
00:27:27.649 --> 00:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
to be anti-discriminatory but is in fact
 
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
racist sexist ableist and every other
 
00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
type of big hit basically perpetually
 
00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
the myth that everybody you know isn't
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
like me you know I'm white male
 
00:27:37.919 --> 00:27:39.169 align:start position:0%
like me you know I'm white male
Christian

00:27:39.169 --> 00:27:39.179 align:start position:0%
Christian
 
00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
Etc are pretty much
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
the generic white male human being in
 
00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:44.700 align:start position:0%
every regard
 
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:45.890 align:start position:0%
every regard
um

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:45.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
we're but there's people come in all
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
shapes sizes and colors and that's a
 
00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:52.860 align:start position:0%
good thing and
 
00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
so but we can't actually have a gender
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
blind Society even sounds like an
 
00:27:59.630 --> 00:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
idealistic thing but that's actually uh
 
00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:02.940 align:start position:0%
you know not not fair to those who are
 
00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
uh say gender identity other than mine
 
00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
which they call CIS male um
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
they have I talked about the legislative
 
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
history my written testimony actually I
 
00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
left out
 
00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:15.380 align:start position:0%
and I type out it was originally
 
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
sections 330 and 331 of the houses where
 
00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
is the Budget Trailer development acts
 
00:28:24.049 --> 00:28:24.059 align:start position:0%
before that was HP 544
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
um there's a bill sponsored in 2021 by
 
00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:27.900 align:start position:0%
the member from New Boston he just spoke
 
00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:31.559 align:start position:0%
also the uh majority leader who was also
 
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
the majority leader back then and the
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
vice chair of the committee so fair is
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
there were some fairly uh high-powered
 
00:28:39.169 --> 00:28:39.179 align:start position:0%
members of the majority caucus behind it
 
00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
that mostly dealt with the operation of
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
state agencies he kind of at least
 
00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:46.860 align:start position:0%
ostensibly dealt only in passing and
 
00:28:49.149 --> 00:28:49.159 align:start position:0%
education so I'm actually going to just
 
00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:52.200 align:start position:0%
argue that HB 61 may have been sent to
 
00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
the wrong committee at HB 544 actually
 
00:28:58.190 --> 00:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
went to Edna we had a rather interesting
 
00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
hearing which I participated in Edna
 
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
and actually
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
what the Senate put in section 297 of
 
00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:08.460 align:start position:0%
the Budget Trailer Bill and I'm sure I'm
 
00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:10.260 align:start position:0%
like boring you I'm sure like your eyes
 
00:29:12.409 --> 00:29:12.419 align:start position:0%
are glazing over at all these uh section
 
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
numbers that was actually put in by the
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
Senate and that language
 
00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:17.940 align:start position:0%
um it's almost it's mostly about the
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
commission on human rights and
 
00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
restricting uh what it can do so that
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
really they'll probably arguably should
 
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
have been the committee I said on
 
00:29:27.169 --> 00:29:27.179 align:start position:0%
Judiciary but here we are and I'm happy
 
00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:29.220 align:start position:0%
Judiciary is going to have over 80 bills
 
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
I'm happy not to have another bill so
 
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
does have one section related to
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
education and that
 
00:29:39.049 --> 00:29:39.059 align:start position:0%
section is especially egregious um our
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
state and our nation can't cannot be
 
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
great unless our students know our Real
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
History you know including the uh less
 
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
Savory more unpleasant side of the of
 
00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:50.220 align:start position:0%
that history which I alluded to at the
 
00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
beginning of my remarks
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
and HB 19340 effectively prevents the
 
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
public schools from teaching that
 
00:29:59.630 --> 00:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
history and
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
um I actually would have preferred
 
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
taking out all the bills the last one
 
00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
193.40 they put an amendment they serve
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
like uh just revise the language to make
 
00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:11.460 align:start position:0%
it say the opposite of what the original
 
00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
Bill said and that's fine I can live
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
with that I would have heard just
 
00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
deleting it funny one very very small
 
00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:17.930 align:start position:0%
deleting it funny one very very small
irony

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:17.940 align:start position:0%
irony
 
00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
of each which is carried over from
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
representative Oregon you've gone well
 
00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:25.140 align:start position:0%
over three minutes now can you try to
 
00:30:27.169 --> 00:30:27.179 align:start position:0%
conclude yeah marks I'll wrap up one
 
00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
more thing there was nothing
 
00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:31.860 align:start position:0%
uh there's nothing last time which
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
prevented educational providers who are
 
00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:35.940 align:start position:0%
subsidized by tax paid School vouchers
 
00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:37.860 align:start position:0%
from teaching so-called divisive
 
00:30:39.529 --> 00:30:39.539 align:start position:0%
Concepts and
 
00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:41.700 align:start position:0%
these providers are actually not uh
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the revised language of uh
 
00:30:47.149 --> 00:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
of this bill because it is leaving one
 
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
part remaining although changing the
 
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
meaning to me the opposite was intent
 
00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
it's not just sort of a small irony of
 
00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
the legislation that we're overturning
 
00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
but just thought I'd bring it up so
 
00:31:00.289 --> 00:31:00.299 align:start position:0%
thanks for your patience and
 
00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:01.860 align:start position:0%
if anybody wants to ask me any questions
 
00:31:03.289 --> 00:31:03.299 align:start position:0%
they're welcome to although the chair
 
00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
would probably are there any questions
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
not see any thank you very much thank
 
00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:11.340 align:start position:0%

that's how I want to start my testimony
 
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing support to this bill first
 
00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
of all because in my background it's a
 
00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
human relations
 
00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:26.690 align:start position:0%

for
um

00:32:27.409 --> 00:32:27.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
a big Corporation for almost 11 years
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%

town
 
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
it is critical for people like myself
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
who work in an industry that we deal
 
00:32:45.529 --> 00:32:45.539 align:start position:0%
with different backgrounds religions
 
00:32:45.539 --> 00:32:47.330 align:start position:0%

00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
hurdles
 
00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:52.460 align:start position:0%
is critical for us to learn
 
00:32:56.409 --> 00:32:56.419 align:start position:0%
why people come here why people
 
00:32:59.210 --> 00:32:59.220 align:start position:0%
sometimes don't want to talk why people
 
00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:02.460 align:start position:0%
sometimes cry why people
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
need support and it workplace and it's a
 
00:33:09.289 --> 00:33:09.299 align:start position:0%
cultural relations why sometimes
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
customers they have a hard time speaking
 
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
to someone
 
00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
for example I would work I work in a
 
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
dealership for many years
 
00:33:21.529 --> 00:33:21.539 align:start position:0%
is critical for us
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
when I went to college I'm so grateful
 
00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:25.980 align:start position:0%
that I learned
 
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
by studying sociology
 
00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:31.860 align:start position:0%
cultural anthropology the background of
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
many people
 
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:35.640 align:start position:0%
the suffering
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
for example a lot of times when we did a
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
presentation in my school
 
00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:45.299 align:start position:0%
they asked for us to give in
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
I'm honest opinion why do you think
 
00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:50.220 align:start position:0%
immigrants come here for me it was
 
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
critical and it I'm so grateful that I
 
00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:55.740 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to share
 
00:33:57.889 --> 00:33:57.899 align:start position:0%
that I move here because of the word and
 
00:33:59.690 --> 00:33:59.700 align:start position:0%
El Salvador that I used to hire
 
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
underneath my bed for many days with no
 
00:34:04.009 --> 00:34:04.019 align:start position:0%
food no water
 
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
just try to protect my life
 
00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:09.300 align:start position:0%
and it's good for me to share the good
 
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
part of my life too that I have a
 
00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
brother who's a famous artist Jose Raul
 
00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
Alfaro he's a artist who paint a
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
beautiful oil paints
 
00:34:24.169 --> 00:34:24.179 align:start position:0%
this is the things that we want to share
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
I don't want people to try to erase my
 
00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
history or the history of many of us
 
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:32.220 align:start position:0%
that we've been here for so long
 
00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
many of us who provide and many of us
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
that we try to be part of this Society
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
what I'm asking you this committee is to
 
00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
support this bill
 
00:34:45.169 --> 00:34:45.179 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to say I'm better than
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
you or you better than me
 
00:34:50.089 --> 00:34:50.099 align:start position:0%
we only want respect and to find
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
finalize my testimony
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
I got an email from a white supremacy

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
first I want to say I'm glad you're here

and I'm glad you're going to stay
 
00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
um but I have the same question for you
 
00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:23.220 align:start position:0%
that I had for the sponsor which is what
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
in the law that
 
00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
this bill tries to repeal keeps you from
 
00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:31.980 align:start position:0%
saying those things or for from talking
 
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
at work about the oppression that you
 
00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:37.980 align:start position:0%
suffered the oppression that you suffer
 
00:36:41.569 --> 00:36:41.579 align:start position:0%
now any of that what in the law keeps
 
00:36:43.609 --> 00:36:43.619 align:start position:0%
that from happening because I don't see
 
00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:47.220 align:start position:0%
it I see the law as protecting you from
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
somebody saying they're better than you
 
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
because of their color
 
00:36:56.089 --> 00:36:56.099 align:start position:0%
sex whatever and so I'm not
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
understanding can you explain to me
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%

passed they give the right to people
 
00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:07.740 align:start position:0%
like the these groups who sent me an
 
00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
email to be more open to discriminate
 
00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
against us to be more open to call us
 
00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:14.700 align:start position:0%
whatever they want to call us and give
 
00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:17.940 align:start position:0%
the right to people in the community to
 
00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:20.460 align:start position:0%

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:39.300 align:start position:0%

in we pay you 500 to report a teacher
 
00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:43.500 align:start position:0%

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:03.780 align:start position:0%
feel so comfortable about discriminate
 
00:38:06.589 --> 00:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
about the lbdt community about people
 
00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:09.060 align:start position:0%
who call her about different backgrounds
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
but now they feel they have the right to
 
00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:13.140 align:start position:0%
be whatever they want to be and they
 
00:38:14.569 --> 00:38:14.579 align:start position:0%

yes everyone say the language is clear
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
but it's not because it's these things
 
00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
are happening and I see it in my own
 
00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
community and I hear from teachers that
 
00:38:32.329 --> 00:38:32.339 align:start position:0%

today I'm here to talk in support of
 
00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:53.460 align:start position:0%
House Bill 61
 
00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
because it is a
 
00:39:58.370 --> 00:39:58.380 align:start position:0%
a great way we can take a step forward
 
00:39:59.870 --> 00:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
as a state
 
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
to improve the learning and exploration
 
00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
of these
 
00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
race gender diversity topics in our
 
00:40:09.349 --> 00:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
state and in our schools and in our
 
00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
workplaces that will help build a more
 
00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
healthy safe and Equitable place that we
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:19.609 --> 00:40:19.619 align:start position:0%
um it's known that inequities
 
00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
disproportionately affect the well-being
 
00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
of populations protected against
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
discrimination in our state
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
unfortunately many of these
 
00:40:29.569 --> 00:40:29.579 align:start position:0%
discriminatory policies and
 
00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
discrimination inequities relate to
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
poverty and contribute it contribute to
 
00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:38.060 align:start position:0%
Poverty for our children and families
 
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
poverty is one of the most dangerous
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
threats to our children's behavioral and
 
00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:45.140 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:48.180 align:start position:0%
that children face today
 
00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
however giving children a simple space
 
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
and safe area for them to explore these
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
topics learn about these topics in an
 
00:40:59.329 --> 00:40:59.339 align:start position:0%
age appropriate way and express the
 
00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
challenges that they're facing can help
 
00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
improve and Empower them to make changes
 
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
they would like to see in the world this
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
sense of empowerment can lead to better
 
00:41:11.569 --> 00:41:11.579 align:start position:0%
outcomes for health and mental health
 
00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
and better financial and educational
 
00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
opportunities as well
 
00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:18.300 align:start position:0%
by giving children this safe space to
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
talk in our schools we have the ability
 
00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:23.420 align:start position:0%
to make sure our children feel heard
 
00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:26.280 align:start position:0%

House Bill 61's repeal of the old bill
 
00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
will remove the chilling effect that the
 
00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
the current law as it stands has on on
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
children and teachers from being able to
 
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
discuss these topics freely in an
 
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
age-appropriate manner in their
 
00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:43.550 align:start position:0%

it's easier for me my name is Deborah
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
Nelson and I live in Hanover where I
 
00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
currently serve on the Hanover and
 
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
Dresden school boards although I am not
 
00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
speaking today on behalf of either board
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
I do however want the committee to know
 
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
that both the Dresden and Hanover School
 
00:42:45.609 --> 00:42:45.619 align:start position:0%
boards unanimously passed a resolution
 
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:49.380 align:start position:0%
months ago against the divisive Concepts
 
00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
bill I think it's fair to note that
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
there have been many education bills
 
00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:57.180 align:start position:0%
proposed and voted on over the last two
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
years that are deeply concerning to
 
00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
school boards parents students members
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%

00:43:08.809 --> 00:43:08.819 align:start position:0%

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
American studies for three decades in
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's public school system
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
one important goal was to educate my
 
00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
students about America's past and to
 
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
examine various periods in history with
 
00:43:25.609 --> 00:43:25.619 align:start position:0%
a critical eye I encourage my students
 
00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:28.740 align:start position:0%
to question to read multiple sources of
 
00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
information and to draw connections when
 
00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:33.660 align:start position:0%
appropriate between the past and the
 
00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:35.030 align:start position:0%
appropriate between the past and the
present

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
present
 
00:43:37.849 --> 00:43:37.859 align:start position:0%
we used to watch a video during our
 
00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
study of the McCarthy period that
 
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
included an interview with a New
 
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire teacher
 
00:43:47.329 --> 00:43:47.339 align:start position:0%
who recalled worrying that something she
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
said at the time might prompt students
 
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
to report her and that she could lose
 
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
her job
 
00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:57.180 align:start position:0%
I remember my students being appalled by
 
00:43:59.390 --> 00:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
what they thought was her paranoia
 
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
and I had to clarify that class
 
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
discussion could be reported to outside
 
00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
groups and teachers could be punished
 
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
and lose their jobs although I reassured
 
00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
them that those days were in the past
 
00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:15.839 align:start position:0%
imagine my dismay to learn that those
 
00:44:17.329 --> 00:44:17.339 align:start position:0%
days are back
 
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
since the passage of what we refer to as
 
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
the divisive Concepts bill and the
 
00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:24.050 align:start position:0%
the divisive Concepts bill and the
attendant

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
attendant
 
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
no doubt deliberate uncertainty over
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
what teachers can and cannot teach what
 
00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
works they can and cannot assign what
 
00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:36.060 align:start position:0%
discussions can and cannot take place
 
00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire classrooms have
 
00:44:41.329 --> 00:44:41.339 align:start position:0%
experienced a great deal of turmoil it
 
00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:43.980 align:start position:0%
seems some legislators think that
 
00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
students benefit from what I am calling
 
00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
narrowed history yet high school
 
00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
students in particular thrive on
 
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
complication they Delight in Nuance they
 
00:44:59.450 --> 00:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
are curious about mistakes in history
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
and they quickly see through efforts to
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
shut away information and limit access
 
00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
ask any parent of a teenager ask any
 
00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
parent of a curious child ask any
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
teenager and they will tell you this is
 
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
the stuff of learning I think it's
 
00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
dangerous therefore to suggest that
 
00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
students should not learn about both the
 
00:45:24.109 --> 00:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
positive and negative elements of our
 
00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:26.940 align:start position:0%
past in thinking about the curriculum my
 
00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
colleagues and I taught I'm struck by
 
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
the number of topics that could now be
 
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:35.400 align:start position:0%

is this the classroom discussion that

we do not damage them when we encourage

them to think

equally important our teachers are

the forces who wish to diminish public

questions from the committee

questions from the committee
yes

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
I know what you're going to ask
 
00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
on the surface that seems like a
 
00:49:23.569 --> 00:49:23.579 align:start position:0%
reasonable question
 
00:49:25.849 --> 00:49:25.859 align:start position:0%
it seems like the text is
 
00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
straightforward and yet there are
 
00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
bounties that have been established by
 
00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
right-wing groups and yet the Department
 
00:49:35.809 --> 00:49:35.819 align:start position:0%
of Education has made very clear that it
 
00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
sees itself in an adversarial position
 
00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
with public school teachers and
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
administrators that doesn't make sense
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
if the language is so easy
 
00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
why is there a problem
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
and the problem is because under the
 
00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:55.980 align:start position:0%
surface of that seemingly open language
 
00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:00.180 align:start position:0%
there are dark Forces that want to
 
00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:03.380 align:start position:0%
dismantle any conversation about race
 
00:50:05.809 --> 00:50:05.819 align:start position:0%
gender identity
 
00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
equal rights
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
it may not have been the intention of
 
00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
those who wrote the Bill I don't happen
 
00:50:16.609 --> 00:50:16.619 align:start position:0%
to believe in that particular train of
 
00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:20.660 align:start position:0%
thought but the reality is that language
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
has led to significant problems in the
 
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
classroom that didn't exist when I was
 
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
in the classroom
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
that's the reality of the current
 
00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:31.730 align:start position:0%
that's the reality of the current
language

00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:31.740 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:33.660 align:start position:0%
like it or not
 
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
people do feel Under Pressure teachers
 
00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:40.260 align:start position:0%
do feel examined they do feel guarded
 
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
because what is to prevent a student
 
00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
from saying as you discussed this
 
00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:51.300 align:start position:0%
historically racial tense issue moment
 
00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:54.900 align:start position:0%
I as a student felt discriminated
 
00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:56.089 align:start position:0%
I as a student felt discriminated
against

00:50:56.089 --> 00:50:56.099 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:50:58.609 --> 00:50:58.619 align:start position:0%
I as a white student felt that
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
conversation made me uncomfortable
 
00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:06.780 align:start position:0%
everybody is uncomfortable when we talk
 
00:51:09.049 --> 00:51:09.059 align:start position:0%
about race they should be
 
00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:12.180 align:start position:0%
everybody should be uncomfortable when
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
conversations come up about a whole
 
00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
range of things about our past we are
 
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
not perfect we have encouraged all kinds
 
00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:26.220 align:start position:0%
of horrible actions towards immigrants
 
00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
towards Catholics towards Jews towards
 
00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:34.140 align:start position:0%
gay people if as a teacher you are
 
00:51:36.049 --> 00:51:36.059 align:start position:0%
trying to help your students be more
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
empathetic more prepared to live in a
 
00:51:43.809 --> 00:51:43.819 align:start position:0%
complex world you examine those elements
 
00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:48.300 align:start position:0%
and then a student decides uh done with
 
00:51:50.569 --> 00:51:50.579 align:start position:0%
that you're putting me in a place I
 
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
don't feel comfortable I'm going to
 
00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
report you to the Department of
 
00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:57.420 align:start position:0%
Education how many times
 
00:51:59.450 --> 00:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
should that happen
 
00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
what does that do to morale how does
 
00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
that undermine a teacher
 
00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
trying to have those good conversations
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
I will be honest with you very little
 
00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:15.900 align:start position:0%
intimidated me when I was teaching
 
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:18.300 align:start position:0%
I was fine having those complicated
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
conversations I was fine when the
 
00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
principal called me in I was fine
 
00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:27.900 align:start position:0%
with all sorts of issues that came up
 
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
maybe it's because I'm tall maybe it's
 
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
because my father brought me up that way
 
00:52:34.849 --> 00:52:34.859 align:start position:0%
maybe it's because
 
00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
I just don't
 
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
roll over easily but that's not the case
 
00:52:43.450 --> 00:52:43.460 align:start position:0%
for a lot of people teaching is hard
 
00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
parents can be mean
 
00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:49.140 align:start position:0%
in the 30 years though that I taught at
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
Lebanon High School could you please
 
00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:54.200 align:start position:0%
wrap it up
 
00:52:58.190 --> 00:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
thank you I never had a single complaint
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
from a parent about what I was teaching
 
00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
not once
 
00:53:06.109 --> 00:53:06.119 align:start position:0%

um we have gone now about 45 minutes and
 
00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:12.180 align:start position:0%
we're averaging close to seven to eight
 
00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:14.700 align:start position:0%
minutes per per testimony we're going to
 
00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
have to cut that down
 
00:53:18.589 --> 00:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
or else we're going to end up having to
 
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
recess this uh around 12 30 1 o'clock we
 
00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:25.020 align:start position:0%

tremendous capital in their workplaces

doing diversity equity and inclusion
 
00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
training they're working to try create
 
00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
more Innovative and inclusive workplaces
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
where we can address competition
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
challenging problems that we have in
 
00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:42.300 align:start position:0%
this state right now we are a state
 
00:54:45.170 --> 00:54:45.180 align:start position:0%
surrounded by others that are far more
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
Progressive in terms of our work in the
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
Dei field as Baby Boomers like myself
 
00:54:53.809 --> 00:54:53.819 align:start position:0%
are aging out and leaving the workflow
 
00:54:57.290 --> 00:54:57.300 align:start position:0%
Force our businesses are challenged to
 
00:54:59.569 --> 00:54:59.579 align:start position:0%
bring enough new workers into the
 
00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
workplace we need to have students who
 
00:55:06.290 --> 00:55:06.300 align:start position:0%
are future Workforce come in with the
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
skills to critically assess issues and
 
00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:12.839 align:start position:0%
to your question that is why we oppose
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
this bill it's important for teachers to
 
00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
be able to explore the systems that are
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
in place around a problem because that's
 
00:55:23.329 --> 00:55:23.339 align:start position:0%
the type of assessment that we're
 
00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
looking for when they come into the
 
00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
workplace we need employees that are
 
00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:30.900 align:start position:0%
able to understand the problems address
 
00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:33.300 align:start position:0%
them and creatively come up with
 
00:55:36.829 --> 00:55:36.839 align:start position:0%
solutions that work for everyone and we
 
00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
are working to create a more inclusive
 
00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:41.700 align:start position:0%
workspace and we believe that teachers
 
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
are trying to create an inclusive
 
00:55:47.569 --> 00:55:47.579 align:start position:0%
classroom and for that reason it is very
 
00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
important to have the freedom to be able
 
00:55:53.089 --> 00:55:53.099 align:start position:0%
to discuss these issues and assess them
 
00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:56.220 align:start position:0%
the the dark history that we need to
 
00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
assess we need to make sure that we
 
00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:00.300 align:start position:0%
don't repeat the mistakes that we've
 
00:56:02.569 --> 00:56:02.579 align:start position:0%
made in the past and that we move
 
00:56:05.690 --> 00:56:05.700 align:start position:0%
forward with a more united country so
 
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I'll yield my
 
00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
time to the next person thank you very
 
00:56:12.770 --> 00:56:12.780 align:start position:0%
much you're giving back about 55 seconds
 
00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:17.270 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:56:19.849 --> 00:56:19.859 align:start position:0%
it's not saying thank you oh and I I I'm
 
00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:22.140 align:start position:0%
sorry if it wasn't clear I think I I
 
00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
okay we we've have a representative just
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
came into Hall and I know that they have
 
00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
other meetings that got represented uh
 
00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
we've talked often about you're from
 
00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:48.420 align:start position:0%
Peterborough absolutely we talked on the
 
00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
horn the other day I think Peter has
 
00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:51.260 align:start position:0%
mentioned meeting you a couple of times
 
00:56:53.930 --> 00:56:53.940 align:start position:0%
welcome I thank you for letting me speak
 
00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
I'll be as quick as possible I didn't
 
00:56:57.770 --> 00:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
prepare a testimony but I did just want
 
00:56:59.569 --> 00:56:59.579 align:start position:0%
to tell the committee really quickly
 
00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
that as a third grader I had a bit of an
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
identity crisis I grew up to a white
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
mother in a white Community with no one
 
00:57:10.609 --> 00:57:10.619 align:start position:0%
who looks like me anywhere near me I
 
00:57:12.589 --> 00:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
didn't know my history I didn't know
 
00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
where I came from who I was or what my
 
00:57:17.329 --> 00:57:17.339 align:start position:0%
people have done to help build this
 
00:57:19.730 --> 00:57:19.740 align:start position:0%
great nation of ours because of that
 
00:57:22.609 --> 00:57:22.619 align:start position:0%
because of that identity crisis it made
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
it really hard to feel confident in
 
00:57:27.109 --> 00:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
going out and being a human being being
 
00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
someone who can live a full life and if
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
it wasn't for my third grade teacher who
 
00:57:35.569 --> 00:57:35.579 align:start position:0%
took me aside in the middle of the third
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
grade class right before we learned
 
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
about civil rights and sat me down and
 
00:57:42.530 --> 00:57:42.540 align:start position:0%
said this is your history this is your
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
story I need you to pay attention I need
 
00:57:47.569 --> 00:57:47.579 align:start position:0%
you to listen and I need you to work
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
hard to understand it because without
 
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
this without your history then you won't
 
00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
be the full person that you're meant to
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
be in this world I think of the kids who
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
are in conval right now the kids who are
 
00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
across this state who are like me who
 
00:58:05.329 --> 00:58:05.339 align:start position:0%
have a history that needs to be told
 
00:58:07.549 --> 00:58:07.559 align:start position:0%
that needs to be taught to them yet
 
00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
don't have it and if teachers feel that
 
00:58:12.890 --> 00:58:12.900 align:start position:0%
they are able to tell that history to
 
00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
their students if I didn't have a third
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
grade teacher who was willing to go out
 
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
of her way to make sure that I learned
 
00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
and listened to my history that I very
 
00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
well wouldn't be here in front of you
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
today and I know many people here in
 
00:58:27.049 --> 00:58:27.059 align:start position:0%
this audience and across the state
 
00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be the same person they are or
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
here today at all so I urge this
 
00:58:33.890 --> 00:58:33.900 align:start position:0%
committee to protect our history to
 
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
allow schools to have full and
 
00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
full-throated and comprehensive
 
00:58:40.609 --> 00:58:40.619 align:start position:0%
discussions on what this country has
 
00:58:42.109 --> 00:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
done and what our full history is
 
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
because without understanding where we
 
00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
have come and where we are we will never
 
00:58:49.970 --> 00:58:49.980 align:start position:0%
know where we're going and I want us as
 
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
a country to come together and to be
 
00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:53.700 align:start position:0%
unified and to to move forward together
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
but we're not going to be able to do
 
00:58:57.650 --> 00:58:57.660 align:start position:0%
that if we don't understand our full
 
00:59:00.289 --> 00:59:00.299 align:start position:0%
history as it happens so I urge the
 
00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
committee to support legislation not
 
00:59:06.289 --> 00:59:06.299 align:start position:0%
just hb6 not just to oppose hb61 but to
 
00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:08.460 align:start position:0%
support legislation throughout your term
 
00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
here in this committee to make sure that
 
00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:11.700 align:start position:0%
we're having a comprehensive discussion
 
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
on history and learning it as it
 
00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
happened so thank you Mr Kevin I'll take
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
any questions if there are any thank you
 
00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
very much representative wheeler
 
00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
I just thank you for coming and that's a
 
00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
very good testimony you gave
 
00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:29.630 align:start position:0%
very good testimony you gave
um

00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:31.609 --> 00:59:31.619 align:start position:0%
great third grade teacher it sounds like
 
00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:33.900 align:start position:0%
I just want to Echo
 
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative lexus's question what in
 
00:59:40.849 --> 00:59:40.859 align:start position:0%
just because this is important to me too
 
00:59:42.490 --> 00:59:42.500 align:start position:0%
to understand
 
00:59:48.589 --> 00:59:48.599 align:start position:0%
what in uh RSA 19340 Pro would prohibit
 
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
the teaching of the concepts that you're
 
00:59:52.849 --> 00:59:52.859 align:start position:0%
talking about well I think the speaker
 
00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:55.140 align:start position:0%
not right before me but the woman in the
 
00:59:57.710 --> 00:59:57.720 align:start position:0%
blue vest Illustrated that well but I
 
01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:00.540 align:start position:0%
think from my perspective having worked
 
01:00:02.089 --> 01:00:02.099 align:start position:0%
with the teachers talked to many of them
 
01:00:05.569 --> 01:00:05.579 align:start position:0%
specifically that teacher who had helped
 
01:00:07.549 --> 01:00:07.559 align:start position:0%
me in third grade but also other social
 
01:00:09.049 --> 01:00:09.059 align:start position:0%
studies teachers who are in my home
 
01:00:11.569 --> 01:00:11.579 align:start position:0%
District of commval they as soon as this
 
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
legislation was introduced two years ago
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
felt a chilling effect in their schools
 
01:00:18.289 --> 01:00:18.299 align:start position:0%
they had Parents contacting them asking
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
to illustrate the entire curriculum to
 
01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:23.640 align:start position:0%
them that's accessible to that you're
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
stopping people's ability to teach and I
 
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
think the chilling effect that was felt
 
01:00:31.150 --> 01:00:31.160 align:start position:0%
by simply introducing this legislation
 
01:00:34.609 --> 01:00:34.619 align:start position:0%
is evidence enough to show where we
 
01:00:36.289 --> 01:00:36.299 align:start position:0%
could go if the legislation was fully
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
implemented thank you thank you further
 
01:00:39.359 --> 01:00:40.609 align:start position:0%
implemented thank you thank you further
questions

01:00:40.609 --> 01:00:40.619 align:start position:0%

moved here when I was six years old and
 
01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
have gone through the whole education
 
01:01:12.109 --> 01:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
system here I'm here to testify and
 
01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:13.980 align:start position:0%
support not only as myself but as the
 
01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:16.980 align:start position:0%
assistant mayor in Portsmouth of hb61 we
 
01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:19.980 align:start position:0%
are racial Justice municipality and
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:23.700 align:start position:0%
I am here to say that what we need to
 
01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are doing here in
 
01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:26.700 align:start position:0%
education in New Hampshire is making
 
01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
sure that we are explaining and allowing
 
01:01:30.589 --> 01:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
students to discover all narratives of
 
01:01:32.569 --> 01:01:32.579 align:start position:0%
History we know that history has not
 
01:01:34.609 --> 01:01:34.619 align:start position:0%
just hold in a black and white story or
 
01:01:38.329 --> 01:01:38.339 align:start position:0%
in the ages in the ageism story it is in
 
01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
the U.S our history is essentially a
 
01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:42.180 align:start position:0%
five-lane highway where people are
 
01:01:43.609 --> 01:01:43.619 align:start position:0%
allowed to get off and get on at
 
01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
different points in time and we need to
 
01:01:48.349 --> 01:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
make sure that what we don't do is limit
 
01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:50.220 align:start position:0%
that down we need to make sure that
 
01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
history is told through multiple
 
01:01:54.349 --> 01:01:54.359 align:start position:0%
narratives in every possible way we need
 
01:01:55.849 --> 01:01:55.859 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we are instilling in
 
01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
our students and in our future Granite
 
01:02:00.289 --> 01:02:00.299 align:start position:0%
Staters their ability to amass their own
 
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:02.700 align:start position:0%
critical thinking to allow them and
 
01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
challenge them in ways that I believe
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
the bill that this will repeal has
 
01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:09.660 align:start position:0%
limited them we need to allow and Trust
 
01:02:11.930 --> 01:02:11.940 align:start position:0%
in our Educators that they know what
 
01:02:14.329 --> 01:02:14.339 align:start position:0%
they're doing better than as someone who
 
01:02:16.609 --> 01:02:16.619 align:start position:0%
writes policy sometimes better than we
 
01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
write policy we need to make sure that
 
01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
we are growing our community we make
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
sure that we are growing together as a
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
state we're in a critical time here in
 
01:02:28.849 --> 01:02:28.859 align:start position:0%
the United States and in our country as
 
01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
many speakers have told and as I have
 
01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:34.140 align:start position:0%
experienced as myself racism is real in
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
our state it doesn't look it's an
 
01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:37.140 align:start position:0%
unfortunate reality
 
01:02:39.049 --> 01:02:39.059 align:start position:0%
and we have to make sure that we do not
 
01:02:42.289 --> 01:02:42.299 align:start position:0%
allow vagueness we do not allow these
 
01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
whether right ring or incels groups
 
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.130 align:start position:0%
whether right ring or incels groups
to

01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:46.140 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:02:48.770 --> 01:02:48.780 align:start position:0%
to stop who we really are
 
01:02:50.930 --> 01:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
we need to promote inclusivity we need
 
01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
to promote these tough conversations and
 
01:02:54.589 --> 01:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
as a business owner I do that we have
 
01:02:56.270 --> 01:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
Open Door policies where we talk about
 
01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
race gender social economic issues and
 
01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
these are all things that I believe are
 
01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
targeted in the bill that needs to be
 
01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
repealed so I yell thank you thank you
 
01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
very much other questions
 
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:25.609 --> 01:03:25.619 align:start position:0%
I didn't know if there's an O at the end
 
01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:28.140 align:start position:0%
of the your your last name I hope I got
 
01:03:32.569 --> 01:03:32.579 align:start position:0%
it right no it's fine Grand Dental okay
 
01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
um I Rise Against The against this bill
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
and I Rise Against this bill for three
 
01:03:40.849 --> 01:03:40.859 align:start position:0%
reasons one uh it's poorly written in
 
01:03:40.859 --> 01:03:42.010 align:start position:0%
reasons one uh it's poorly written in
nebulous

01:03:42.010 --> 01:03:42.020 align:start position:0%
nebulous
 
01:03:44.569 --> 01:03:44.579 align:start position:0%
as described in the analysis the
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
analysis of the bill is what has me
 
01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
really concerned uh especially the part
 
01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
about our current experiences of any
 
01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:53.329 align:start position:0%
about our current experiences of any
group

01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:53.339 align:start position:0%
group
 
01:03:56.809 --> 01:03:56.819 align:start position:0%
that is protected in the discrimination
 
01:03:59.270 --> 01:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
the second part I Rise Against is how
 
01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:01.160 align:start position:0%
many teachers or businesses have been
 
01:04:03.650 --> 01:04:03.660 align:start position:0%
prosecuted who's been prosecuted have
 
01:04:05.809 --> 01:04:05.819 align:start position:0%
business people been prosecuted have
 
01:04:07.549 --> 01:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
teachers been prosecuted by the
 
01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:09.780 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice or the Department
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
of Education I don't believe so
 
01:04:16.609 --> 01:04:16.619 align:start position:0%
um businesses have unions teachers have
 
01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
unions have ways to be protected but the
 
01:04:21.770 --> 01:04:21.780 align:start position:0%
only way to protect the parents is the
 
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
legislature that's your job we have no
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
um this bill will not stop uh hurt
 
01:04:33.289 --> 01:04:33.299 align:start position:0%
feelings for being hurt
 
01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
it won't create safer spaces
 
01:04:40.069 --> 01:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
or it even won't stop identity crisis
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
the only one proven way to do that was
 
01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
Dr King and he told us it was character
 
01:04:47.089 --> 01:04:47.099 align:start position:0%
over color
 
01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
I hate to say this but we need to go
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
back to the future that's where we all
 
01:04:52.490 --> 01:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
and lastly we're not going to unite
 
01:04:56.569 --> 01:04:56.579 align:start position:0%
anybody by calling or referring to
 
01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
people as doc forces who may be against
 
01:05:03.289 --> 01:05:03.299 align:start position:0%
this bill it doesn't help build Unity
 
01:05:05.089 --> 01:05:05.099 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
01:05:08.089 --> 01:05:08.099 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:19.789 --> 01:05:19.799 align:start position:0%
well that's an S excuse me
 
01:05:24.049 --> 01:05:24.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:26.099 align:start position:0%
but this is one of the nicest curse of
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
writing I've seen
 
01:05:32.450 --> 01:05:32.460 align:start position:0%
so and you'll love this I 90 seconds
 
01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:36.049 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:05:36.049 --> 01:05:36.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:38.809 --> 01:05:38.819 align:start position:0%
I'm presenting testimony in favor of
 
01:05:38.819 --> 01:05:40.970 align:start position:0%
I'm presenting testimony in favor of
hb61

01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:40.980 align:start position:0%
hb61
 
01:05:43.549 --> 01:05:43.559 align:start position:0%
this past fall while waiting for service
 
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
at a garage a male customer and I struck
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
up a conversation
 
01:05:51.049 --> 01:05:51.059 align:start position:0%
I learned that he'd been a public school
 
01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
teacher in the Concord area for many
 
01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:54.829 align:start position:0%
teacher in the Concord area for many
years

01:05:54.829 --> 01:05:54.839 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:05:57.289 --> 01:05:57.299 align:start position:0%
he was just over five years away from
 
01:05:59.630 --> 01:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
retirement and was was looking forward
 
01:06:01.309 --> 01:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
to it
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
he went on to tell me about the changes
 
01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
not for the better that he'd seen over
 
01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
the past few years and said that sadly
 
01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
he wasn't enjoying the job as much as he
 
01:06:14.690 --> 01:06:14.700 align:start position:0%
used to
 
01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
he talked about the negative
 
01:06:19.970 --> 01:06:19.980 align:start position:0%
psychological impact on kids of both the
 
01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic and social media
 
01:06:25.069 --> 01:06:25.079 align:start position:0%
and how this is made teaching more
 
01:06:25.079 --> 01:06:26.630 align:start position:0%
and how this is made teaching more
challenging

01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
challenging
 
01:06:29.329 --> 01:06:29.339 align:start position:0%
he told me about experiencing a lack of
 
01:06:32.809 --> 01:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
respect Often by kids but also some
 
01:06:32.819 --> 01:06:34.430 align:start position:0%
respect Often by kids but also some
parents

01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:06:37.609 --> 01:06:37.619 align:start position:0%
I got this sense he was a good committed
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
teacher who had indeed once loved his
 
01:06:40.559 --> 01:06:42.650 align:start position:0%
teacher who had indeed once loved his
job

01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
job
 
01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
I think we all know that today's
 
01:06:48.410 --> 01:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
teachers are up against it in numerous
 
01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:49.789 align:start position:0%
teachers are up against it in numerous
ways

01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:49.799 align:start position:0%
ways
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
if New Hampshire wants to attract and
 
01:06:55.069 --> 01:06:55.079 align:start position:0%
retain good ones teachers need to be
 
01:06:57.289 --> 01:06:57.299 align:start position:0%
able to work in an environment that is
 
01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
supportive not distrustful and punitive
 
01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
if you agree I urge you to vote to
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
support HB 61 and I happen to be a
 
01:07:10.849 --> 01:07:10.859 align:start position:0%
clinical social worker good to say that
 
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%

01:07:27.349 --> 01:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
she here there welcome hi thank you
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
I'm here as a former High School career
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
educator as a former vice president of
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
secondary education from my local
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
as a former vice president with aft
 
01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and as a sitting School
 
01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
Board member with caresage regional
 
01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:47.180 align:start position:0%
district though I'm representing myself
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
and I am here in complete support of
 
01:07:52.370 --> 01:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
house bill 61.
 
01:07:55.490 --> 01:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
the divisive Concepts law sensors
 
01:07:57.529 --> 01:07:57.539 align:start position:0%
learning by prohibiting facts of history
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
and social realities from being
 
01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
discussed discussed in schools in doing
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
so this law creates a narrow and perhaps
 
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
an accurate understanding of past and
 
01:08:11.569 --> 01:08:11.579 align:start position:0%
present social and Civic realities that
 
01:08:15.049 --> 01:08:15.059 align:start position:0%
are at odds with 21st Century Learning
 
01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:17.940 align:start position:0%
where the divisive Concepts law applies
 
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
it Narrows or eliminates students
 
01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
connections between content and their
 
01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
personal experiences and or the real
 
01:08:28.249 --> 01:08:28.259 align:start position:0%
life world
 
01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
it eliminates research and intellectual
 
01:08:33.530 --> 01:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
exploration of topics that would produce
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
facts that could fall under the device
 
01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
of Concepts law and it Narrows higher
 
01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
order thinking and the application of
 
01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
Bloom's taxonomy and that students are
 
01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
not able to explore synthesize and apply
 
01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:50.219 align:start position:0%
critical thinking skills on topics that
 
01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
could perhaps fall under the law but are
 
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
nonetheless extremely relevant and
 
01:08:58.249 --> 01:08:58.259 align:start position:0%
Academia and in real life
 
01:09:02.209 --> 01:09:02.219 align:start position:0%
and passing House Bill 61 New Hampshire
 
01:09:04.130 --> 01:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
students and teachers will be able to
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
engage with school board approved
 
01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
curricula and safe learning environments
 
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
when students and teachers feel safe
 
01:09:13.729 --> 01:09:13.739 align:start position:0%
they feel comfortable taking academic
 
01:09:16.849 --> 01:09:16.859 align:start position:0%
risks that promote and expand learning
 
01:09:19.309 --> 01:09:19.319 align:start position:0%
moreover teachers will be able to
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
develop lessons designed for inclusion
 
01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
so that each student may find in his or
 
01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
her learning experience personal
 
01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
connections to truth both past and
 
01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:32.090 align:start position:0%
connections to truth both past and
present

01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
present
 
01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
it's through access to Accurate unbiased
 
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
uncensored age and developmentally
 
01:09:41.150 --> 01:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate content and with purposeful
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
scaffolding of that content through the
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
grade levels that students learn to
 
01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
lastly in repealing the divisive
 
01:09:56.330 --> 01:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
Concepts law you will be ensuring that
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
our students have access to the same
 
01:10:01.790 --> 01:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
educational skills Concepts and
 
01:10:04.130 --> 01:10:04.140 align:start position:0%
experiences that make them competitive
 
01:10:07.130 --> 01:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
and educationally on par with their peer
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
groups around the country
 
01:10:11.930 --> 01:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
with unabridged access to appropriate
 
01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
and factual educational content and
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
experiences our students will have the
 
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
requisite Knowledge and Skills to
 
01:10:22.370 --> 01:10:22.380 align:start position:0%
succeed in colleges in the trades and
 
01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
our job markets and in society and I
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
implore you to pass House Bill 61
 
01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:32.460 align:start position:0%
because our students Futures depend upon
 
01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:34.010 align:start position:0%
because our students Futures depend upon
it

01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:34.020 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
exactly three minutes good job
 
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:43.490 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:45.649 --> 01:10:45.659 align:start position:0%
it's a new iPhone I have up here the
 
01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
other one had 3G and it wouldn't work
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
down here so now I had to get the 5G and
 
01:10:52.270 --> 01:10:52.280 align:start position:0%
spend another 700 something dollars
 
01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to go ahead and invite Sean
 
01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:57.709 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to go ahead and invite Sean

and music today I'm speaking on my own
 
01:11:28.370 --> 01:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
behalf in strong support of house bill
 
01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
61. this bill would repeal language that
 
01:11:33.410 --> 01:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
currently prevents our students in New
 
01:11:34.970 --> 01:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from having a full opportunity
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
to learn a complete picture of history
 
01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:40.140 align:start position:0%
in its ramifications and how exactly
 
01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
does this language hurt our students in
 
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
this way and this may help to address
 
01:11:47.209 --> 01:11:47.219 align:start position:0%
representative lekkas's concerns with
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
vague and conflicting language it
 
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
confuses what teaching is allowable is
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
allowable under the law passages such as
 
01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
those that ban teaching about inherently
 
01:11:58.610 --> 01:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
oppressive Behavior quote whether
 
01:12:01.370 --> 01:12:01.380 align:start position:0%
consciously or unconsciously is
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
confusing despite the guidance that the
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Education released to
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
interpret these confusing passages
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
teachers remain hesitant and even afraid
 
01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:13.340 align:start position:0%
to discuss Concepts such as racism
 
01:12:16.669 --> 01:12:16.679 align:start position:0%
reparation sexism and implicit bias and
 
01:12:19.010 --> 01:12:19.020 align:start position:0%
understandably so for the 2021 law
 
01:12:20.689 --> 01:12:20.699 align:start position:0%
allows anyone who claims to feel
 
01:12:22.850 --> 01:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
aggrieved by such teaching to initiate a
 
01:12:25.070 --> 01:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
civil action against the school
 
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
this threat limits the history that
 
01:12:28.370 --> 01:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
instructors feel comfortable teaching
 
01:12:30.530 --> 01:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
and it's so stressed our teachers that
 
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
they fear that teaching anything that
 
01:12:34.130 --> 01:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
could be interpreted as polarizing or
 
01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
divisive could end their careers
 
01:12:39.169 --> 01:12:39.179 align:start position:0%
teachers deserve the freedom to explore
 
01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
controversial topics in class as they
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
help our children to learn the
 
01:12:43.850 --> 01:12:43.860 align:start position:0%
importance of basing their
 
01:12:46.189 --> 01:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
interpretations on rigorous research to
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
learn how thinking critically and
 
01:12:49.010 --> 01:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
evaluating The credibility of their
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
sources is crucial to understanding not
 
01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
only history but the Maelstrom of
 
01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
current events as well
 
01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
troublingly because of its punitive
 
01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
suggestions the 2021 language has also
 
01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
interrupted the important work of
 
01:13:04.370 --> 01:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
training our public employees
 
01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:05.709 align:start position:0%
training our public employees
um

01:13:05.709 --> 01:13:05.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:09.310 --> 01:13:09.320 align:start position:0%
to have a to excuse me to understand
 
01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
implicit or unconscious bias this
 
01:13:13.729 --> 01:13:13.739 align:start position:0%
training is desperately necessary
 
01:13:15.530 --> 01:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
because unfortunately studies and
 
01:13:17.570 --> 01:13:17.580 align:start position:0%
current events have proven that real
 
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
world discrimination continues and is
 
01:13:22.010 --> 01:13:22.020 align:start position:0%
widespread and awareness and
 
01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
understanding of implicit bias is a
 
01:13:26.209 --> 01:13:26.219 align:start position:0%
first step in overcoming the tendency to
 
01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:28.860 align:start position:0%
discriminate for implicit biases our
 
01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
brain's tendency to look for patterns
 
01:13:33.770 --> 01:13:33.780 align:start position:0%
and make generalizations leading
 
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
stereotype confirming thoughts to pass
 
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
spontaneously through our minds and even
 
01:13:40.370 --> 01:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
though it's really not fun to think that
 
01:13:43.010 --> 01:13:43.020 align:start position:0%
we might not be behaving nicely we need
 
01:13:45.169 --> 01:13:45.179 align:start position:0%
to reckon with this discomfort and learn
 
01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
and do better we all could benefit from
 
01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
implicit bias training and we all would
 
01:13:51.530 --> 01:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
benefit from learning history that
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't avoid the tough controversial
 
01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:54.530 align:start position:0%
doesn't avoid the tough controversial
topics

01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
topics
 
01:13:56.209 --> 01:13:56.219 align:start position:0%
but teachers don't feel comfortable
 
01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
doing that when their livelihood and
 
01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:01.380 align:start position:0%
integrity are threatened that's why hb61
 
01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
must be passed we need to restore trust
 
01:14:06.169 --> 01:14:06.179 align:start position:0%
we need to trust our teachers as
 
01:14:08.270 --> 01:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
professionals and we need to trust our
 
01:14:10.490 --> 01:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
educational system our schools have
 
01:14:12.169 --> 01:14:12.179 align:start position:0%
teachers and leaders who are charged
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
with providing our children a high
 
01:14:15.770 --> 01:14:15.780 align:start position:0%
quality learning experience their work
 
01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
is based on research on best practices
 
01:14:19.850 --> 01:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
and we must allow our teachers the
 
01:14:21.770 --> 01:14:21.780 align:start position:0%
freedom to really teach anything else is
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
a disservice to our students please pass
 
01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
HP 61 thank you thank you very much are
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%

so Reverend here representing Concord
 
01:14:43.679 --> 01:14:52.430 align:start position:0%
so Reverend here representing Concord
Lutheran

01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:54.649 --> 01:14:54.659 align:start position:0%
good morning good to see everybody thank
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
you for allowing me to speak this
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
morning I'm a Pastor Jonathan Hopkins
 
01:15:00.290 --> 01:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
I'm the pastor of Concordia Lutheran
 
01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
Church here in Concord also a member of
 
01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
our church as a member of the Granite
 
01:15:09.290 --> 01:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:10.970 --> 01:15:10.980 align:start position:0%
uh I know there's going to be a lot of
 
01:15:12.050 --> 01:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
people that are going to come up and
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
they're going to tell you why this is a
 
01:15:16.130 --> 01:15:16.140 align:start position:0%
that this bill is a good idea
 
01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
because of their teacher they're an
 
01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
educator and those people know more
 
01:15:22.490 --> 01:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
about such things than I do so I will
 
01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
let them speak for themselves my field
 
01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
is spirituality and I want to tell you
 
01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
this morning why I think this is a bad
 
01:15:31.970 --> 01:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
Bill spiritually
 
01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
for a long time it's been said in our
 
01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:35.340 align:start position:0%
society that you shouldn't talk about
 
01:15:37.370 --> 01:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
politics or religion
 
01:15:39.770 --> 01:15:39.780 align:start position:0%
you can imagine for me especially the
 
01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
religion part is rather difficult
 
01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
since that's my job but I think even the
 
01:15:47.149 --> 01:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
politics part is difficult we have done
 
01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
ourselves a disservice it's been a
 
01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:52.140 align:start position:0%
detriment to society that we avoid these
 
01:15:54.169 --> 01:15:54.179 align:start position:0%
topics and other uncomfortable topics
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
because we have not learned and not
 
01:15:58.970 --> 01:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
taught our children how to talk about
 
01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
difficult subjects with people we
 
01:16:03.410 --> 01:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
disagree with on a fundamental level
 
01:16:05.090 --> 01:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
who believe that hurts us spiritually
 
01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:07.739 align:start position:0%
part of a good spiritual practice is
 
01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
learning how to have difficult
 
01:16:11.330 --> 01:16:11.340 align:start position:0%
conversations with people you disagree
 
01:16:13.970 --> 01:16:13.980 align:start position:0%
agree with good spiritual practice leads
 
01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
us to speaking with thoughtfulness and
 
01:16:19.610 --> 01:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
kindness good spiritual practice leads
 
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
us ultimately to the truth
 
01:16:26.090 --> 01:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
and we cannot have truth without good
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
vigorous debate
 
01:16:30.649 --> 01:16:30.659 align:start position:0%
the other spiritual problem is that we
 
01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
will never be able to fix any problems
 
01:16:35.689 --> 01:16:35.699 align:start position:0%
we face without confession no human
 
01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
endeavor and human history has been
 
01:16:40.850 --> 01:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
perfect all nationalities all political
 
01:16:43.010 --> 01:16:43.020 align:start position:0%
political beliefs all religious beliefs
 
01:16:46.189 --> 01:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
are tainted with human imperfection
 
01:16:49.010 --> 01:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
and this includes our country there's
 
01:16:50.930 --> 01:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
never been a perfect president Congress
 
01:16:53.450 --> 01:16:53.460 align:start position:0%
or Supreme Court we've never lived up to
 
01:16:54.830 --> 01:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
the highest ideals of our national
 
01:16:58.189 --> 01:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
creeds and we can only begin to fix the
 
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
problems of our country by first
 
01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
realizing where we have gone wrong
 
01:17:05.090 --> 01:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
confession is good for the soul and it
 
01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
leads to the truth of who we are and who
 
01:17:09.770 --> 01:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
we want to be I would argue that by
 
01:17:11.630 --> 01:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
trying to deny
 
01:17:13.850 --> 01:17:13.860 align:start position:0%
our past sins we are doomed to repeat
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
them in the future
 
01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:16.860 align:start position:0%
and for the purpose
 
01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
of confession and forgiveness does not
 
01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:22.860 align:start position:0%
lead us to shame but rather frees us so
 
01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
that we can move forward I ask you vote
 
01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on hb61 so that we can
 
01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
talk to one another about the past so
 
01:17:32.570 --> 01:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
that we can hear different different
 
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
views we can see our past mistakes and
 
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
working together to make a more perfect
 
01:17:39.290 --> 01:17:39.300 align:start position:0%
union thank you for your time thank you
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
very much Reverend are there questions
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious read the law that is
 
01:17:56.689 --> 01:17:56.699 align:start position:0%
being talked about repealing I said it
 
01:17:58.669 --> 01:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
again I'm sorry
 
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me I didn't hear your question oh
 
01:18:05.450 --> 01:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
have you read the piece of law that they
 
01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:07.860 align:start position:0%
are talking about repealing
 
01:18:10.729 --> 01:18:10.739 align:start position:0%
have I read the law yes
 
01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
you have yes
 
01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:15.370 align:start position:0%
you have yes
and

01:18:15.370 --> 01:18:15.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
you need a question right here what you
 
01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
need a question
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
I I heard you say and that's two
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
questions sorry can I ask the next
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
question very quick one
 
01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
very quickly you you're talking about
 
01:18:33.290 --> 01:18:33.300 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech you know to talk and
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
repent and whatever and I'm just
 
01:18:37.790 --> 01:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
wondering what since you have read that
 
01:18:40.490 --> 01:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
bit of law what in it would stop
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%

01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:57.050 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:20:57.050 --> 01:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
upon coming here today this week when I
 
01:21:01.370 --> 01:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
was talking with my superintendent my
 
01:21:03.709 --> 01:21:03.719 align:start position:0%
supervisor telling them that I was going
 
01:21:05.810 --> 01:21:05.820 align:start position:0%
to be here giving testimony and support
 
01:21:09.649 --> 01:21:09.659 align:start position:0%
of hb61 my superintendent said
 
01:21:12.290 --> 01:21:12.300 align:start position:0%
well of course that's your job
 
01:21:14.689 --> 01:21:14.699 align:start position:0%
and I I think it's important to mention
 
01:21:18.350 --> 01:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
that because I'm honored to represent
 
01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
one out of the four public school
 
01:21:23.930 --> 01:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
districts in this state that are
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
actively putting Ford funds resources in
 
01:21:29.649 --> 01:21:29.659 align:start position:0%
a position
 
01:21:34.910 --> 01:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
dedicated to dij work in the state
 
01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
um but I think what sets me apart in
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
this position comparatively to my
 
01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
colleagues is that I work in a small
 
01:21:46.570 --> 01:21:46.580 align:start position:0%
school district predominantly white
 
01:21:49.729 --> 01:21:49.739 align:start position:0%
pretty well resourced upon an assortment
 
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
of other dominant identities and yet
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
they also still found it necessary to
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
have a position like mine in a very
 
01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
homogeneous School District to create
 
01:22:04.010 --> 01:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
Equitable experiences for all students
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
and so thinking about the current hb2
 
01:22:09.410 --> 01:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
bill and where it stands this not only
 
01:22:12.050 --> 01:22:12.060 align:start position:0%
hurts our teachers our students but also
 
01:22:14.090 --> 01:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
the state at Large
 
01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
we should want our teachers not to live
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
in fear by doing their jobs and doing
 
01:22:21.410 --> 01:22:21.420 align:start position:0%
their jobs effectively and correctly
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
um especially given light of a teacher
 
01:22:26.090 --> 01:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
shortage right we don't want to lose our
 
01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:27.169 align:start position:0%
shortage right we don't want to lose our
teachers

01:22:27.169 --> 01:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
01:22:29.090 --> 01:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
thinking about we should want our
 
01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
students of color our lgbtqa plus
 
01:22:33.410 --> 01:22:33.420 align:start position:0%
students our students with disabilities
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
our Refugee students our low-income
 
01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:36.830 align:start position:0%
our Refugee students our low-income
students

01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:22:39.169 --> 01:22:39.179 align:start position:0%
you should want them to see themselves
 
01:22:41.450 --> 01:22:41.460 align:start position:0%
in their curriculum
 
01:22:43.729 --> 01:22:43.739 align:start position:0%
we should want to provide a holistic
 
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
education to all our students to become
 
01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
better and more informed citizens of the
 
01:22:49.970 --> 01:22:49.980 align:start position:0%
world so that they can come here and
 
01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
give informed opinions we need to really
 
01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
address this bill
 
01:22:58.490 --> 01:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
we don't want to go into the discussion
 
01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
we had with the with the teacher
 
01:23:02.330 --> 01:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
shortage committee that's a different
 
01:23:05.450 --> 01:23:05.460 align:start position:0%
area on Arena so let's stick to this
 
01:23:08.270 --> 01:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
bill and try to wrap it up quickly yes
 
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
and so I'm bringing that up because I
 
01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
would say that hp2 stands in directly to
 
01:23:17.330 --> 01:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
put our teachers in fear and potentially
 
01:23:20.689 --> 01:23:20.699 align:start position:0%
lose their jobs from teaching a holistic
 
01:23:23.450 --> 01:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
and comprehensive education into create
 
01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
Equitable experiences in the classroom
 
01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
for our most marginalized students if
 
01:23:32.090 --> 01:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
not all are students and so that is why
 
01:23:34.330 --> 01:23:34.340 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to speak in support of
 
01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
hv61 because this is going to help our
 
01:23:39.950 --> 01:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
teachers provide more comprehensive
 
01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
education to our student students not
 
01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
just all marginalized students but all
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
our students to become better and more
 
01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
informed citizens of the world
 
01:23:52.910 --> 01:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
so our teachers need hb61 our students
 
01:23:55.970 --> 01:23:55.980 align:start position:0%
need hb61 and so does the State of New
 
01:24:02.689 --> 01:24:02.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:05.149 --> 01:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
hello everyone my name is Andres Mejia
 
01:24:07.310 --> 01:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
my pronouns are he him his and I serve
 
01:24:08.930 --> 01:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
as the Director of diversity Equity
 
01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
inclusion and justice for sau16 I have
 
01:24:15.169 --> 01:24:15.179 align:start position:0%
been a resident of New Hampshire for the
 
01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
13 years I've been working in higher ed
 
01:24:19.810 --> 01:24:19.820 align:start position:0%
and K-12 in the state
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm hearing support for HB 61.
 
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
you know and and
 
01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
hb61 is to support teachers to teach
 
01:24:31.370 --> 01:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
what they want to teach
 
01:24:34.610 --> 01:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
um which I agree with uh since hb2 was
 
01:24:36.649 --> 01:24:36.659 align:start position:0%
put into law I have seen more and more
 
01:24:38.930 --> 01:24:38.940 align:start position:0%
students getting discriminated against
 
01:24:41.030 --> 01:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
students being called the n-word and not
 
01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
being handled appropriately because
 
01:24:45.590 --> 01:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
Educators do not know if by telling the
 
01:24:47.450 --> 01:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
student they're calling a black student
 
01:24:49.610 --> 01:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
to Edward is racist
 
01:24:51.410 --> 01:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
students from LGBT communities being
 
01:24:53.689 --> 01:24:53.699 align:start position:0%
called the f word and being told I bet I
 
01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
can turn you straight
 
01:24:58.490 --> 01:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
books that represent black people people
 
01:25:00.169 --> 01:25:00.179 align:start position:0%
of color people from the LG plus
 
01:25:01.970 --> 01:25:01.980 align:start position:0%
Community Muslims and other historically
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
marginalized identities taken out of the
 
01:25:06.770 --> 01:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
classroom because we don't know as
 
01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
Educators if teaching these perspectives
 
01:25:10.910 --> 01:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
goes against hb2
 
01:25:13.490 --> 01:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
because of how it came out and it's fair
 
01:25:14.990 --> 01:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
the teachers that they can't teach what
 
01:25:16.729 --> 01:25:16.739 align:start position:0%
they want to teach
 
01:25:19.790 --> 01:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
um even so far as I I was asked to look
 
01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
at a book from a classroom about a
 
01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:23.940 align:start position:0%
Mexican mother teaching her grandchild
 
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
how to make empanadas and if we can
 
01:25:29.810 --> 01:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
teach that in our classrooms
 
01:25:31.610 --> 01:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
is important that we provide our
 
01:25:32.990 --> 01:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
students with an education that
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
represent their identities and
 
01:25:36.290 --> 01:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
experiences it is important to let
 
01:25:38.090 --> 01:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
students from historically marginal
 
01:25:40.610 --> 01:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
identities know that they matter and
 
01:25:43.370 --> 01:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
that they belong in our education in our
 
01:25:45.970 --> 01:25:45.980 align:start position:0%
schools and in our state and I believe
 
01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
hb661 will allow teachers to do that
 
01:25:52.850 --> 01:25:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Tina filovont I am the
 
01:25:58.189 --> 01:25:58.199 align:start position:0%

through Elementary School one of maybe a
 
01:26:47.209 --> 01:26:47.219 align:start position:0%

understood my experience

K through 18 actually because I did
 
01:27:00.110 --> 01:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
College here as well
 
01:27:03.530 --> 01:27:03.540 align:start position:0%
um when I had my daughter years later I
 
01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:04.980 align:start position:0%
realized the importance of public
 
01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:06.669 align:start position:0%
realized the importance of public
education

01:27:06.669 --> 01:27:06.679 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:27:09.890 --> 01:27:09.900 align:start position:0%
and one of my mentors at Plymouth State
 
01:27:13.070 --> 01:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
College back in the day university now
 
01:27:15.649 --> 01:27:15.659 align:start position:0%
had asked me to stay in New Hampshire to
 
01:27:20.570 --> 01:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
educate kids and so I did I did I did
 
01:27:23.530 --> 01:27:23.540 align:start position:0%
um I stayed here to be
 
01:27:34.610 --> 01:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:43.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:45.410 --> 01:27:45.420 align:start position:0%
and in the hopes my daughter
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
would have an educator who would go to
 
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
bat for her the way I was about to for
 
01:27:51.649 --> 01:27:51.659 align:start position:0%
my students
 
01:27:54.169 --> 01:27:54.179 align:start position:0%
she did not by the way she did not have
 
01:27:56.330 --> 01:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
a single educator of color
 
01:27:58.189 --> 01:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
during my time as a public school
 
01:28:01.010 --> 01:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
teacher I was the only educator of color
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
not only in my school but in my whole
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
school district of almost 500 Educators
 
01:28:09.709 --> 01:28:09.719 align:start position:0%
When Rachel is talking about the fear of
 
01:28:12.110 --> 01:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
being a teacher under this law that is
 
01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:12.890 align:start position:0%
being a teacher under this law that is
real

01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:12.900 align:start position:0%
real
 
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
and imagine what it feels like for the
 
01:28:17.209 --> 01:28:17.219 align:start position:0%
single teacher of color in a whole
 
01:28:20.330 --> 01:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:23.209 --> 01:28:23.219 align:start position:0%
my daughter went to school here
 
01:28:23.219 --> 01:28:25.750 align:start position:0%
my daughter went to school here
K-12

01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
K-12
 
01:28:28.010 --> 01:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
when this
 
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
hb2 wasn't its
 
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
Genesis as HB 544 and I know words
 
01:28:37.970 --> 01:28:37.980 align:start position:0%
change but the spirit of that law
 
01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:39.290 align:start position:0%
change but the spirit of that law
remains

01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:39.300 align:start position:0%
remains
 
01:28:43.370 --> 01:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
my daughter came to uh an event like
 
01:28:46.010 --> 01:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
this it was during the pandemic
 
01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:46.669 align:start position:0%
this it was during the pandemic
um

01:28:46.669 --> 01:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:49.970 --> 01:28:49.980 align:start position:0%
and gave testimony at the time she was a
 
01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
senior in high school she just just
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
turned 18 and she wanted to share her
 
01:28:56.090 --> 01:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
experience that she didn't feel like she
 
01:28:58.669 --> 01:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
belonged this whole time
 
01:29:00.169 --> 01:29:00.179 align:start position:0%
that she didn't feel like teachers
 
01:29:01.970 --> 01:29:01.980 align:start position:0%
understood her experience that she
 
01:29:04.010 --> 01:29:04.020 align:start position:0%
didn't feel seen in the curriculum the
 
01:29:05.629 --> 01:29:05.639 align:start position:0%
way her peers felt seen in the
 
01:29:05.639 --> 01:29:07.010 align:start position:0%
way her peers felt seen in the
curriculum

01:29:07.010 --> 01:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
01:29:08.689 --> 01:29:08.699 align:start position:0%
she was sometimes afraid to go to school
 
01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
because kids would call her a and
 
01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:15.290 align:start position:0%
because kids would call her a and
a

01:29:15.290 --> 01:29:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
she gave testimony that day and actually
 
01:29:20.689 --> 01:29:20.699 align:start position:0%
folks like you said Thank you to the
 
01:29:22.970 --> 01:29:22.980 align:start position:0%
student who came here who cared enough
 
01:29:25.729 --> 01:29:25.739 align:start position:0%
to do this work she got it was during
 
01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
the pandemic so in the chat people
 
01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
thanked her
 
01:29:31.550 --> 01:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
um she logged off of Zoom
 
01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
and immediately A New Hampshire resident
 
01:29:39.290 --> 01:29:39.300 align:start position:0%
who is watching the testimony
 
01:29:41.930 --> 01:29:41.940 align:start position:0%
retweeted one of her posts
 
01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
said that this kid just gave testimony
 
01:29:48.770 --> 01:29:48.780 align:start position:0%
against HB 544 this student at Concord
 
01:29:53.090 --> 01:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
High School they named her school
 
01:29:56.570 --> 01:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
gave testimony against this
 
01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
called her a few names an adult
 
01:30:01.790 --> 01:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
within seconds she started receiving
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:18.169 --> 01:30:18.179 align:start position:0%
from throughout the state
 
01:30:20.209 --> 01:30:20.219 align:start position:0%
from throughout the country
 
01:30:22.189 --> 01:30:22.199 align:start position:0%
the most visceral one that stands out
 
01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:36.050 --> 01:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
was I'd like to see an exit wound leave
 
01:30:46.189 --> 01:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
the message was very clearly that as a
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
student and as a kid of color
 
01:30:54.290 --> 01:30:54.300 align:start position:0%
your voice we don't want to hear it
 
01:30:56.570 --> 01:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
we're here to shut you up we're going to
 
01:30:58.729 --> 01:30:58.739 align:start position:0%
threaten you with violence if you show
 
01:31:04.129 --> 01:31:04.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:06.530 --> 01:31:06.540 align:start position:0%
what happened to my daughter
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
the fear that she had that if HB 544
 
01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
came to life
 
01:31:16.490 --> 01:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
that silencing that Chill on speech
 
01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:18.719 align:start position:0%
what she feared then
 
01:31:21.770 --> 01:31:21.780 align:start position:0%
now we're living it
 
01:31:23.629 --> 01:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
in that silence
 
01:31:27.229 --> 01:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
is real what Andres what Rachel had just
 
01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
shared with many people in this room it
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
is real the message is
 
01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
students especially our students of
 
01:31:37.970 --> 01:31:37.980 align:start position:0%
color you don't have a voice
 
01:31:40.430 --> 01:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
you don't belong
 
01:31:43.010 --> 01:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
what's sad to me is that growing up here
 
01:31:45.410 --> 01:31:45.420 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire 80s 90s
 
01:31:49.310 --> 01:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
I was made to feel invisible
 
01:31:52.030 --> 01:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
and that is exactly what
 
01:31:55.010 --> 01:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
hb2 is doing to our kids and our
 
01:31:57.290 --> 01:31:57.300 align:start position:0%
Educators today
 
01:31:59.090 --> 01:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
you don't belong here
 
01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
whatever your intentions were in
 
01:32:06.290 --> 01:32:06.300 align:start position:0%
creating this bill the net results is
 
01:32:09.250 --> 01:32:09.260 align:start position:0%
that hb2
 
01:32:09.260 --> 01:32:11.090 align:start position:0%
that hb2

what just happened to my daughter
 
01:32:15.649 --> 01:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
it is inciting
 
01:32:19.970 --> 01:32:19.980 align:start position:0%
silence that we're here to help stop
 
01:32:23.149 --> 01:32:23.159 align:start position:0%

01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
example of when discrimination
 
01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:16.970 align:start position:0%
example of when discrimination
specifically

01:33:16.970 --> 01:33:16.980 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:33:16.980 --> 01:33:17.629 align:start position:0%
specifically
um

01:33:17.629 --> 01:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:21.290 --> 01:33:21.300 align:start position:0%
is occurring in the schools with what
 
01:33:24.110 --> 01:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
the teachers can teach
 
01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:28.550 align:start position:0%
the teachers can teach
and

01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:31.669 --> 01:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
when you look at this as we're somehow
 
01:33:33.770 --> 01:33:33.780 align:start position:0%
calling the law the current law the
 
01:33:35.709 --> 01:33:35.719 align:start position:0%
divisive current
 
01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
Concepts law I'm not quite sure why it's
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
called that when
 
01:33:43.970 --> 01:33:43.980 align:start position:0%
um the only things that the teachers are
 
01:33:46.970 --> 01:33:46.980 align:start position:0%
prohibited from teaching with this law
 
01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
is what they call CRT I can tell you it
 
01:33:53.450 --> 01:33:53.460 align:start position:0%
is still being taught because I have all
 
01:33:55.850 --> 01:33:55.860 align:start position:0%
of the curriculum information from Dover
 
01:33:55.860 --> 01:33:57.770 align:start position:0%

01:34:09.649 --> 01:34:09.659 align:start position:0%
Etc uh terminology that is prohibited
 
01:34:13.129 --> 01:34:13.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:16.430 --> 01:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
in this new proposed bill
 
01:34:20.270 --> 01:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
providing diverse educational approaches
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
which is what it proposes to do
 
01:34:27.530 --> 01:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
does not specifically address a concern
 
01:34:31.310 --> 01:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
of discrimination if that is the intent
 
01:34:34.129 --> 01:34:34.139 align:start position:0%
rather it opens a wide door for
 
01:34:37.610 --> 01:34:37.620 align:start position:0%
implementation of any type of ideology
 
01:34:40.129 --> 01:34:40.139 align:start position:0%
which is what we are seeing now in the
 
01:34:41.470 --> 01:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
01:34:44.689 --> 01:34:44.699 align:start position:0%
disguised as facts
 
01:34:47.330 --> 01:34:47.340 align:start position:0%
I could name some of the topics from
 
01:34:50.450 --> 01:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
Dover which I have all the data on so
 
01:34:53.330 --> 01:34:53.340 align:start position:0%
it's not an imagined idea
 
01:34:56.570 --> 01:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
allowing for the broad concept of in
 
01:34:59.530 --> 01:34:59.540 align:start position:0%
quotes in the new proposed proposed law
 
01:35:02.709 --> 01:35:02.719 align:start position:0%
engaging in any form of instruction
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
concerning historical or current
 
01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
experiences of any protected group
 
01:35:12.169 --> 01:35:12.179 align:start position:0%
that that to me does not inter that
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
introduces one person's view of an
 
01:35:18.530 --> 01:35:18.540 align:start position:0%
experience as appropriate
 
01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
to be applied to all students so if
 
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
someone decides that their view is
 
01:35:24.239 --> 01:35:25.910 align:start position:0%
someone decides that their view is
whatever

01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:35:28.850 --> 01:35:28.860 align:start position:0%
that's to be introduced to students as a
 
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
factual piece of information for
 
01:35:34.930 --> 01:35:34.940 align:start position:0%
classroom knowledge
 
01:35:38.570 --> 01:35:38.580 align:start position:0%
I'd love to know
 
01:35:41.090 --> 01:35:41.100 align:start position:0%
some examples of real teachers who have
 
01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
been prosecuted persecuted or prosecuted
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
for teaching any historical information
 
01:35:51.410 --> 01:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
as someone else already asked we haven't
 
01:35:53.290 --> 01:35:53.300 align:start position:0%
heard of any
 
01:35:55.970 --> 01:35:55.980 align:start position:0%
protections against discrimination are
 
01:35:59.450 --> 01:35:59.460 align:start position:0%
not joined to how historical or current
 
01:36:03.709 --> 01:36:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
this bill does not add any new
 
01:36:09.290 --> 01:36:09.300 align:start position:0%
protection against discrimination when
 
01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
you compare it to current law and
 
01:36:16.370 --> 01:36:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:18.649 --> 01:36:18.659 align:start position:0%
further this bill would only introduce
 
01:36:22.729 --> 01:36:22.739 align:start position:0%
an unnecessary and intentional level of
 
01:36:26.530 --> 01:36:26.540 align:start position:0%
confusion to a perfectly clear and
 
01:36:30.410 --> 01:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
all-inclusive law who is being excluded
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
from the law as it is currently written
 
01:36:37.189 --> 01:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
CRT is being taught
 
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
in schools
 
01:36:41.930 --> 01:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
and the divisiveness of that is what we
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
really ought to be focused on
 
01:36:47.149 --> 01:36:47.159 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
yes represent woodcock
 
01:36:54.169 --> 01:36:54.179 align:start position:0%
I think he was the chairman thank you
 
01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question if I understood
 
01:37:00.590 --> 01:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
part of your uh early speaking uh you
 
01:37:03.110 --> 01:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
indicated that CRT curriculum is being
 
01:37:04.490 --> 01:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
taught in the school and you have a copy
 
01:37:06.110 --> 01:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
of that curriculum
 
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
I got the first part of your question
 
01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
the last part I couldn't hear the the
 
01:37:12.590 --> 01:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
question was you said in your unclear
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
you said in your presentation as CRT is
 
01:37:16.910 --> 01:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
being taught you have a copy of the
 
01:37:19.370 --> 01:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
curriculum yes I would ask that you
 
01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
forward a copy that curriculum to the
 
01:37:22.910 --> 01:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
education committee please I have the
 
01:37:24.890 --> 01:37:24.900 align:start position:0%
teacher training curriculum the teacher
 
01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:26.750 align:start position:0%
teacher training curriculum the teacher
training

01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:28.189 align:start position:0%
training
information

01:37:28.189 --> 01:37:28.199 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
from the vendors who who were hired to
 
01:37:33.530 --> 01:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
train the teachers in it yes okay we
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
have probably that curriculum through
 
01:37:37.010 --> 01:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
four no on me but I do have it and I
 
01:37:38.570 --> 01:37:38.580 align:start position:0%
will certainly be happy to share it
 
01:37:40.189 --> 01:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you Mr chairman
 
01:37:40.199 --> 01:37:41.090 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you Mr chairman
yes

01:37:41.090 --> 01:37:41.100 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:37:43.490 --> 01:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions thank you
 
01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
very much
 
01:37:50.450 --> 01:37:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:53.689 --> 01:37:53.699 align:start position:0%
Russell I guess wheeler Russell gotta
 
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
get back to work right yeah I know my
 
01:37:57.169 --> 01:37:57.179 align:start position:0%
last name is everyone trouble okay thank
 
01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
you so much so um Hello thank you very
 
01:38:01.490 --> 01:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
much for hearing me today um and thank
 
01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
you much for all the work that you do my
 
01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
name is Jessica wheeler Russell I am a
 
01:38:08.450 --> 01:38:08.460 align:start position:0%
lifetime resident of New Hampshire I was
 
01:38:10.490 --> 01:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
born and raised in the Upper Valley I
 
01:38:12.110 --> 01:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
graduated from Lebanon High School in
 
01:38:15.110 --> 01:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
2005. I currently live in Penacook where
 
01:38:16.850 --> 01:38:16.860 align:start position:0%
I serve on the Merrimack Valley School
 
01:38:20.750 --> 01:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
Board while I am here under my own power
 
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
and all the views I am about to say I do
 
01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
not represent the views of the board as
 
01:38:26.570 --> 01:38:26.580 align:start position:0%
a whole
 
01:38:31.370 --> 01:38:31.380 align:start position:0%
um I am here in support of hb61 now I
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
have already sent the committee
 
01:38:35.149 --> 01:38:35.159 align:start position:0%
um some citations for the claims I'm
 
01:38:37.250 --> 01:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
going to make I can just summarize and
 
01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
saying that when we
 
01:38:42.290 --> 01:38:42.300 align:start position:0%
um allow our teachers to facilitate open
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
and honest discussions in all aspects of
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
Education Studies have shown that it
 
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
allows students to foster a desire for
 
01:38:56.510 --> 01:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
civic engagement it improves creativity
 
01:38:59.450 --> 01:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
and innovation in life and in the
 
01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:00.790 align:start position:0%
and innovation in life and in the
workforce

01:39:00.790 --> 01:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
and it also provides a safer space for
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
students of all backgrounds
 
01:39:12.229 --> 01:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:14.810 --> 01:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
now if you can't tell I spend a lot of
 
01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
time thinking about education if it's
 
01:39:17.629 --> 01:39:17.639 align:start position:0%
something that's very near and dear and
 
01:39:18.770 --> 01:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
important to me
 
01:39:22.750 --> 01:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
so when HB 55
 
01:39:26.270 --> 01:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
or the device of Concepts was passed
 
01:39:28.669 --> 01:39:28.679 align:start position:0%
I have a number of connections to
 
01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
Educators across the state
 
01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
and we have heard a lot today about
 
01:39:35.870 --> 01:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
folks who have been teaching social
 
01:39:38.450 --> 01:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
studies but one of the other aspects of
 
01:39:40.610 --> 01:39:40.620 align:start position:0%
this is it's it's affecting other areas
 
01:39:42.110 --> 01:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
of Education too
 
01:39:44.570 --> 01:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
I have music teachers who cannot teach
 
01:39:46.910 --> 01:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
music theory in certain areas because
 
01:39:49.070 --> 01:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
they're afraid of what might come down
 
01:39:51.110 --> 01:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
the pipeline they cannot teach musical
 
01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
history they cannot teach certain genres
 
01:39:54.950 --> 01:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
of music
 
01:39:57.290 --> 01:39:57.300 align:start position:0%
there are computer science teachers who
 
01:39:58.970 --> 01:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
can have open and honest discussions
 
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
about the effects of artificial
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
intelligence a field that is rapidly
 
01:40:06.770 --> 01:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
growing and a great field to work in I'm
 
01:40:08.689 --> 01:40:08.699 align:start position:0%
a computer scientist myself
 
01:40:11.090 --> 01:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
because they are afraid of what might
 
01:40:14.209 --> 01:40:14.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:16.729 --> 01:40:16.739 align:start position:0%
but not only that there are some of my
 
01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
peers who left the state
 
01:40:22.910 --> 01:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
who are married and having children and
 
01:40:25.010 --> 01:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
have flat out told me we were not coming
 
01:40:27.169 --> 01:40:27.179 align:start position:0%
back because we cannot trust
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
what is going on and how our children
 
01:40:35.209 --> 01:40:35.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:37.370 --> 01:40:37.380 align:start position:0%
what I like best about this repealing of
 
01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
this law of HB 544 is that it is
 
01:40:43.250 --> 01:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
incredibly vague and while the intention
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
on paper might not be to gag teachers
 
01:40:48.169 --> 01:40:48.179 align:start position:0%
that is the effect that it's having
 
01:40:51.590 --> 01:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
so um thank you very much and um I
 
01:40:54.410 --> 01:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time today
 
01:40:56.030 --> 01:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
from the committee yes representative
 
01:41:02.570 --> 01:41:02.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:41:04.129 --> 01:41:04.139 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:41:06.350 --> 01:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
um you've opened up a new area
 
01:41:08.270 --> 01:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
um besides just social studies and
 
01:41:09.890 --> 01:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
Civics and things
 
01:41:12.950 --> 01:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
um could you flesh out for me maybe what
 
01:41:14.990 --> 01:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
fear a science person would have let's
 
01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
talk about artificial intelligence yeah
 
01:41:18.830 --> 01:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
so um artificial intelligence like I
 
01:41:21.770 --> 01:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
said is a rapidly growing area but with
 
01:41:21.780 --> 01:41:22.610 align:start position:0%
said is a rapidly growing area but with
that

01:41:22.610 --> 01:41:22.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:41:24.610 --> 01:41:24.620 align:start position:0%
um I guess the example I would use is
 
01:41:27.290 --> 01:41:27.300 align:start position:0%
image learning right so you feed images
 
01:41:29.930 --> 01:41:29.940 align:start position:0%
into an AI and it you might say
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
something like
 
01:41:33.709 --> 01:41:33.719 align:start position:0%
um we're going to teach what a bride
 
01:41:35.870 --> 01:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
looks like right but if what you're
 
01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
feeding into that is only what we might
 
01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
see in an American you know traditional
 
01:41:43.790 --> 01:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
white dress beautiful big Cathedral kind
 
01:41:45.890 --> 01:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
of situation what you're lacking and
 
01:41:48.770 --> 01:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
teaching that Ai and what
 
01:41:51.530 --> 01:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
um what it might look like for
 
01:41:55.729 --> 01:41:55.739 align:start position:0%
a bride from certain areas of India or
 
01:41:58.250 --> 01:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
Japan or anything like that and we can't
 
01:42:00.530 --> 01:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
have the the teachers that are telling
 
01:42:02.810 --> 01:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
you this say that we can't open this up
 
01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
because we don't know if saying by the
 
01:42:07.310 --> 01:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
way you need to be careful about your
 
01:42:09.709 --> 01:42:09.719 align:start position:0%
ethics in computer science might open
 
01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
them up to you know you're
 
01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
discriminating against XYZ person
 
01:42:16.189 --> 01:42:16.199 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you we're not going to have
 
01:42:19.189 --> 01:42:19.199 align:start position:0%
follow-up questions
 
01:42:22.129 --> 01:42:22.139 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much
 
01:42:28.030 --> 01:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
uh David Scannell skin scanelle yes
 
01:42:30.410 --> 01:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:42:32.450 --> 01:42:32.460 align:start position:0%
committee my name is David scanl I'm a
 
01:42:34.370 --> 01:42:34.380 align:start position:0%
Bedford resident I teach English
 
01:42:36.290 --> 01:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
currently at Milford High School I think
 
01:42:39.189 --> 01:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
I'm the first actual bona fide teacher
 
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
who's here today former School Board
 
01:42:43.970 --> 01:42:43.980 align:start position:0%
member in Manchester a former member of
 
01:42:46.490 --> 01:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
this house so my opinion about today's
 
01:42:48.530 --> 01:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
topic is the product of varied
 
01:42:50.930 --> 01:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
experiences in the classroom in the
 
01:42:52.970 --> 01:42:52.980 align:start position:0%
community and because I sat where you
 
01:42:55.729 --> 01:42:55.739 align:start position:0%
sit I appreciate the seriousness with
 
01:42:57.830 --> 01:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
which you approach this subject
 
01:43:00.530 --> 01:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
I took a personal day to be here today
 
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
because I fear the timing of this
 
01:43:04.189 --> 01:43:04.199 align:start position:0%
hearing and that's the nature of the
 
01:43:06.709 --> 01:43:06.719 align:start position:0%
legislative process prevents teachers
 
01:43:09.290 --> 01:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
the people you really need to hear from
 
01:43:11.810 --> 01:43:11.820 align:start position:0%
um from being here today I thought it
 
01:43:13.609 --> 01:43:13.619 align:start position:0%
important to have some skin in the game
 
01:43:16.129 --> 01:43:16.139 align:start position:0%
and also I believe it's critical that
 
01:43:18.770 --> 01:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
the record contains specific examples to
 
01:43:20.990 --> 01:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
the point that the representative is
 
01:43:23.930 --> 01:43:23.940 align:start position:0%
making of the impact this ill-conceived
 
01:43:27.530 --> 01:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
law has in the classroom I'm a strong
 
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
supporter of hb61 because the statute it
 
01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
seeks to repeal has sown the seeds of
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
confusion in the classroom as a result
 
01:43:38.330 --> 01:43:38.340 align:start position:0%
of its vague and imprecise wording and
 
01:43:41.149 --> 01:43:41.159 align:start position:0%
Clarity is a critical component of an
 
01:43:43.070 --> 01:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
effective learning environment
 
01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
let me share just two examples about the
 
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
manner in which this poorly worded
 
01:43:51.649 --> 01:43:51.659 align:start position:0%
statute has impacted my students
 
01:43:53.810 --> 01:43:53.820 align:start position:0%
last year one student was interested in
 
01:43:56.149 --> 01:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
writing his required persuasive research
 
01:43:59.629 --> 01:43:59.639 align:start position:0%
paper in favor of affirmative action
 
01:44:01.689 --> 01:44:01.699 align:start position:0%
the language of the statute however
 
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
explicitly prohibits teaching that an
 
01:44:06.649 --> 01:44:06.659 align:start position:0%
individual should be discriminated
 
01:44:08.950 --> 01:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
against or receive adverse treatment
 
01:44:12.290 --> 01:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
solely or partly because of age gender
 
01:44:15.050 --> 01:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
identity sexual orientation
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
now as we know affirmative action no
 
01:44:19.609 --> 01:44:19.619 align:start position:0%
matter what one's opinion of the concept
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
is a constitutionally protected program
 
01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
of granting historically discriminated
 
01:44:28.189 --> 01:44:28.199 align:start position:0%
groups advantages others might not be
 
01:44:30.530 --> 01:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
provided because its members had not
 
01:44:33.050 --> 01:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
been discriminated against in the past
 
01:44:35.689 --> 01:44:35.699 align:start position:0%
are we really not allowed to explore
 
01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
topics the Supreme Court has
 
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
consistently endorsed for 60 years
 
01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
while I ultimately approve the topic I
 
01:44:45.890 --> 01:44:45.900 align:start position:0%
knew doing so might expose me to certain
 
01:44:48.410 --> 01:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
risks given the highly partisan and
 
01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%
political nature of the current New
 
01:44:52.729 --> 01:44:52.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Education
 
01:44:55.129 --> 01:44:55.139 align:start position:0%
similarly another student in another
 
01:44:58.250 --> 01:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
context expressed a desire to research
 
01:45:00.709 --> 01:45:00.719 align:start position:0%
the theory of American exceptionalism
 
01:45:03.649 --> 01:45:03.659 align:start position:0%
which posits its America's place in the
 
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
world is a byproduct of the unique
 
01:45:08.810 --> 01:45:08.820 align:start position:0%
traits of its pioneering and persevering
 
01:45:08.820 --> 01:45:09.830 align:start position:0%
traits of its pioneering and persevering
people

01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:45:12.709 --> 01:45:12.719 align:start position:0%
under the divisive Concepts law is a
 
01:45:15.470 --> 01:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
teacher grading such a paper required to
 
01:45:17.570 --> 01:45:17.580 align:start position:0%
fail the student if he determines
 
01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
there's any Merit to American
 
01:45:22.189 --> 01:45:22.199 align:start position:0%
exceptionalism the statute seems to
 
01:45:24.290 --> 01:45:24.300 align:start position:0%
suggest no alternative
 
01:45:27.169 --> 01:45:27.179 align:start position:0%
and those are just two examples of the
 
01:45:30.050 --> 01:45:30.060 align:start position:0%
ability I'm sorry two examples
 
01:45:32.209 --> 01:45:32.219 align:start position:0%
um of the ability of the law as
 
01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:34.860 align:start position:0%
currently constituted to stifle inquiry
 
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
and exploration
 
01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
and finally I want to personally attest
 
01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
to witnessing countless examples of the
 
01:45:43.850 --> 01:45:43.860 align:start position:0%
Law's chilling effect I have lost count
 
01:45:45.709 --> 01:45:45.719 align:start position:0%
of the number of conversations I have
 
01:45:48.169 --> 01:45:48.179 align:start position:0%
participated in with fellow teachers who
 
01:45:49.970 --> 01:45:49.980 align:start position:0%
have told me they're avoiding important
 
01:45:52.669 --> 01:45:52.679 align:start position:0%
lessons or discussions for fear of what
 
01:45:54.890 --> 01:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
might happen to them thank you very much
 
01:45:58.270 --> 01:45:58.280 align:start position:0%
for listening I urge you to rate
 
01:46:01.070 --> 01:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
hb61 as ought to pass thank you very
 
01:46:03.410 --> 01:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
much questions from the committee not
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
seeing thank you
 
01:46:08.570 --> 01:46:08.580 align:start position:0%
uh like to invite Sarah Smith up we have
 
01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:09.890 align:start position:0%
uh like to invite Sarah Smith up we have
about

01:46:09.890 --> 01:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:46:13.370 --> 01:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
30 to 28 to 30 cards left three minutes
 
01:46:14.629 --> 01:46:14.639 align:start position:0%
a piece so you can see we're going to go
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
at least to one o'clock so uh if we can
 
01:46:19.310 --> 01:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
try to slice this down a little bit I
 
01:46:21.169 --> 01:46:21.179 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
01:46:22.370 --> 01:46:22.380 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:46:25.070 --> 01:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Sarah Smith
 
01:46:28.669 --> 01:46:28.679 align:start position:0%
um and I was a an elementary middle
 
01:46:31.189 --> 01:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
school a special education for over 25
 
01:46:31.199 --> 01:46:33.290 align:start position:0%
school a special education for over 25
years

01:46:33.290 --> 01:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:46:36.530 --> 01:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
um under this vaguely worded law I could
 
01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
not truthfully answer questions from
 
01:46:41.990 --> 01:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
students about their reading material in
 
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
elementary school we teach about Martin
 
01:46:46.910 --> 01:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
Luther King the Holocaust for older
 
01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
elementary schools students the
 
01:46:51.709 --> 01:46:51.719 align:start position:0%
Underground Railroad and similar issues
 
01:46:54.770 --> 01:46:54.780 align:start position:0%
it is totally unclear to me how I would
 
01:46:57.169 --> 01:46:57.179 align:start position:0%
answer these questions honestly under
 
01:46:58.550 --> 01:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
this law
 
01:47:02.270 --> 01:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
how do you explain slavery Jim Crow laws
 
01:47:06.350 --> 01:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
why Martin Luther King was shot without
 
01:47:09.649 --> 01:47:09.659 align:start position:0%
talking about the reasons for these laws
 
01:47:11.890 --> 01:47:11.900 align:start position:0%
anyone who has actually taught children
 
01:47:15.169 --> 01:47:15.179 align:start position:0%
knows they will ask questions
 
01:47:18.229 --> 01:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
I have been asked why have why did they
 
01:47:20.090 --> 01:47:20.100 align:start position:0%
have separate fountains
 
01:47:24.290 --> 01:47:24.300 align:start position:0%
why did they kill Martin Luther King Jr
 
01:47:26.570 --> 01:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
there are many conversations we need to
 
01:47:30.189 --> 01:47:30.199 align:start position:0%
have in today's world they need to be
 
01:47:32.750 --> 01:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
honest and open
 
01:47:36.709 --> 01:47:36.719 align:start position:0%
this is why I support this bill
 
01:47:39.109 --> 01:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
frankly the current law
 
01:47:41.750 --> 01:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
is a law in search of a problem
 
01:47:44.750 --> 01:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
I urge you to have this law come to the
 
01:47:47.330 --> 01:47:47.340 align:start position:0%
floor I would like to see the votes of
 
01:47:49.250 --> 01:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
all my Representatives
 
01:47:52.490 --> 01:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
not passed under a budget bill so that
 
01:47:54.530 --> 01:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
we don't know exactly how people feel
 
01:47:57.530 --> 01:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
this needs to be out in the open for all
 
01:48:00.410 --> 01:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
the people here in New Hampshire do not
 
01:48:02.750 --> 01:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
sweep it under the rug again
 
01:48:07.729 --> 01:48:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:20.570 --> 01:48:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:23.629 --> 01:48:23.639 align:start position:0%
hello my nerves are going to ask I read
 
01:48:25.790 --> 01:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
directly instead of trying to summarize
 
01:48:27.590 --> 01:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
I hope that's okay
 
01:48:29.810 --> 01:48:29.820 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair and the committee
 
01:48:31.910 --> 01:48:31.920 align:start position:0%

01:48:56.390 --> 01:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
District School Board but my comments
 
01:48:58.310 --> 01:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
here today do not speak on behalf of the
 
01:49:00.649 --> 01:49:00.659 align:start position:0%
Concord School District by now we're all
 
01:49:03.229 --> 01:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
aware of the effect uh the band Concepts
 
01:49:04.729 --> 01:49:04.739 align:start position:0%
law has had on our Public School
 
01:49:06.709 --> 01:49:06.719 align:start position:0%
classrooms what I want to speak about
 
01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
today is the effect this is having on my
 
01:49:10.669 --> 01:49:10.679 align:start position:0%
own children and their future as members
 
01:49:12.410 --> 01:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
of a local and ultimately Global
 
01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:13.430 align:start position:0%
of a local and ultimately Global
community

01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:49:15.229 --> 01:49:15.239 align:start position:0%
my daughters attend a school that my
 
01:49:17.450 --> 01:49:17.460 align:start position:0%
family is very proud of my husband and I
 
01:49:18.950 --> 01:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
have strong relationships with our
 
01:49:20.510 --> 01:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
daughter's teachers and our girls are
 
01:49:22.490 --> 01:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
excited to go to school and are valued
 
01:49:24.890 --> 01:49:24.900 align:start position:0%
in their classrooms the Dark Cloud that
 
01:49:27.109 --> 01:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
the band Concepts law has cast over our
 
01:49:28.910 --> 01:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
Public School classrooms will not Escape
 
01:49:31.310 --> 01:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
our experience despite our strong
 
01:49:33.950 --> 01:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
involvement in our children's education
 
01:49:35.810 --> 01:49:35.820 align:start position:0%
will a degree from a New Hampshire
 
01:49:38.209 --> 01:49:38.219 align:start position:0%
Public School mean the same thing as it
 
01:49:40.490 --> 01:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
does in other states I know my children
 
01:49:42.290 --> 01:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
will be prepared for interacting with a
 
01:49:43.790 --> 01:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
wide range of individuals as they
 
01:49:45.470 --> 01:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
continue to grow in their individual
 
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
paths but what about their peers
 
01:49:50.270 --> 01:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps that was the intent of the
 
01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
original Bill to drive a wedge between
 
01:49:55.010 --> 01:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
parents and schools to cheapen the
 
01:49:57.890 --> 01:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
experience for public school students to
 
01:49:59.750 --> 01:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
continue the effort to degrade the value
 
01:50:01.790 --> 01:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
of that education to the point that
 
01:50:04.310 --> 01:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
families Flee for other options
 
01:50:06.290 --> 01:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
in a recent study from The Brookings
 
01:50:08.990 --> 01:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
Institute on economic connectedness
 
01:50:10.689 --> 01:50:10.699 align:start position:0%
which is when people from different
 
01:50:12.470 --> 01:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic realities build
 
01:50:14.990 --> 01:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
relationships that is the number one
 
01:50:17.450 --> 01:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
factor in upward Mobility for families
 
01:50:19.910 --> 01:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
one of the few places in our society
 
01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
where the possibility for excuse me
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
economic connectedness exists is within
 
01:50:27.590 --> 01:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
the communities built by public
 
01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:30.300 align:start position:0%
education the continued Sheltering of
 
01:50:32.810 --> 01:50:32.820 align:start position:0%
the banned Concepts law is a telling act
 
01:50:35.450 --> 01:50:35.460 align:start position:0%
it lays bare the truth of how little we
 
01:50:37.550 --> 01:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
honor the people conversations and
 
01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
relationships that take place there
 
01:50:42.709 --> 01:50:42.719 align:start position:0%
recommending hb61 is ought to pass is
 
01:50:44.629 --> 01:50:44.639 align:start position:0%
one step in the direction of repairing
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
the long-standing harm many and I would
 
01:50:49.250 --> 01:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
argue all of our students have been
 
01:50:51.590 --> 01:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
subjected to for decades our children's
 
01:50:53.390 --> 01:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
Futures depend on a well-rounded
 
01:50:54.830 --> 01:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
education that is inclusive
 
01:50:56.930 --> 01:50:56.940 align:start position:0%
compassionate rigorous but most
 
01:50:59.330 --> 01:50:59.340 align:start position:0%
importantly honest at this present
 
01:51:01.310 --> 01:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
moment that option is not on the table
 
01:51:03.470 --> 01:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
our children deserve the freedom to
 
01:51:05.149 --> 01:51:05.159 align:start position:0%
learn from the mistakes of the past in
 
01:51:06.910 --> 01:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
order to build a better future together
 
01:51:10.310 --> 01:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
only those opposed to that goal and
 
01:51:12.530 --> 01:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
afraid of what honest conversations may
 
01:51:14.750 --> 01:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
lead to would want to deny our children
 
01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
the knowledge and Community they need to
 
01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
learn and grow as thoughtful connected
 
01:51:21.890 --> 01:51:21.900 align:start position:0%
members of our community please
 
01:51:25.010 --> 01:51:25.020 align:start position:0%
recommend hb61 to the full legislature
 
01:51:26.750 --> 01:51:26.760 align:start position:0%

schools in New Hampshire we live in New

schools in New Hampshire we live in New
Boston

01:52:29.090 --> 01:52:29.100 align:start position:0%
Boston
 
01:52:31.310 --> 01:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
first I really just have to take a
 
01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
minute even though I don't have any
 
01:52:35.330 --> 01:52:35.340 align:start position:0%
extra to respond to the rep at the
 
01:52:38.090 --> 01:52:38.100 align:start position:0%
beginning from my town who said that you
 
01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
know teachers you know aren't qualified
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
to teach anything outside of their
 
01:52:45.109 --> 01:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
um you know very specific content that
 
01:52:47.090 --> 01:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
they're going to teach and that doesn't
 
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
happen I just wanted to tell kind of a
 
01:52:51.290 --> 01:52:51.300 align:start position:0%
funny story about that my very first day
 
01:52:54.050 --> 01:52:54.060 align:start position:0%
of teaching 22 years ago
 
01:52:57.350 --> 01:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
my very first class was I found out I
 
01:52:58.729 --> 01:52:58.739 align:start position:0%
was going to be teaching computers and
 
01:53:01.310 --> 01:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
I'm a social studies trained teacher and
 
01:53:03.310 --> 01:53:03.320 align:start position:0%
they have Mac computers in New Hampshire
 
01:53:06.109 --> 01:53:06.119 align:start position:0%
we had PCS where I came from in Vermont
 
01:53:08.689 --> 01:53:08.699 align:start position:0%
and I it looked like a spaceship to me I
 
01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
had no idea what it was I didn't know
 
01:53:12.410 --> 01:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
how to turn it on I had to ask the
 
01:53:13.669 --> 01:53:13.679 align:start position:0%
students hey do you know how to turn
 
01:53:15.530 --> 01:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
that on I didn't know what the platform
 
01:53:17.570 --> 01:53:17.580 align:start position:0%
looked like so anyway
 
01:53:19.490 --> 01:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
um just my point being we are faced with
 
01:53:22.250 --> 01:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
things outside of our you know training
 
01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
and content all the time and it's it's
 
01:53:29.149 --> 01:53:29.159 align:start position:0%
just what happens and you know teachers
 
01:53:31.310 --> 01:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
also we frequently handle mandates and
 
01:53:33.530 --> 01:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
trainings based on you know what we can
 
01:53:36.410 --> 01:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
do and what we really need to learn to
 
01:53:38.090 --> 01:53:38.100 align:start position:0%
provide a safe and learning you know
 
01:53:40.370 --> 01:53:40.380 align:start position:0%
environment for our students and no
 
01:53:42.770 --> 01:53:42.780 align:start position:0%
matter how complex and difficult we
 
01:53:44.750 --> 01:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
always somehow work together and we
 
01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
manage and we face those challenges but
 
01:53:49.310 --> 01:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
however with the band Concepts
 
01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:51.229 align:start position:0%
however with the band Concepts
legislation

01:53:51.229 --> 01:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:53:53.629 --> 01:53:53.639 align:start position:0%
um it's been really fuzzy right how
 
01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to to put this into
 
01:53:58.490 --> 01:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
education practice and you know unless
 
01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's asking us to ignore the lived
 
01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
experience of people with our own
 
01:54:04.609 --> 01:54:04.619 align:start position:0%
communities if we're going to keep our
 
01:54:07.070 --> 01:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
jobs and I've just gotten to a point in
 
01:54:08.450 --> 01:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
my career where I really prefer to
 
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
listen and and to learn
 
01:54:13.250 --> 01:54:13.260 align:start position:0%
and you know how are we going to be
 
01:54:15.290 --> 01:54:15.300 align:start position:0%
doing our best as professionals you know
 
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
I've been faced with very odd situations
 
01:54:21.109 --> 01:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
in my career before but it just seems
 
01:54:23.390 --> 01:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
like a whole new level if in the middle
 
01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
of a conversation I have to like get my
 
01:54:27.709 --> 01:54:27.719 align:start position:0%
lawyers on the phone and be like
 
01:54:29.810 --> 01:54:29.820 align:start position:0%
is this a situation of inherent racism
 
01:54:32.030 --> 01:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
you know are they racist because they
 
01:54:33.709 --> 01:54:33.719 align:start position:0%
watched a movie I don't know it's just
 
01:54:36.290 --> 01:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
something that we just would dismiss if
 
01:54:38.330 --> 01:54:38.340 align:start position:0%
it's happening in our communities and
 
01:54:42.169 --> 01:54:42.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:42.179 --> 01:54:44.149 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:54:44.149 --> 01:54:44.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:46.430 --> 01:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
we were hopeful for some kind of clarity
 
01:54:47.810 --> 01:54:47.820 align:start position:0%
especially within the social studies
 
01:54:49.850 --> 01:54:49.860 align:start position:0%
department when the guidance came out
 
01:54:53.870 --> 01:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
for hb2 and it just didn't happen when
 
01:54:55.550 --> 01:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
that came out it was really just saying
 
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
the same language again
 
01:54:59.209 --> 01:54:59.219 align:start position:0%
um just kind of in a different way and
 
01:55:02.450 --> 01:55:02.460 align:start position:0%
we didn't get one example in that
 
01:55:04.330 --> 01:55:04.340 align:start position:0%
document really helping us to understand
 
01:55:08.770 --> 01:55:08.780 align:start position:0%
how to move forward and the urgency
 
01:55:11.209 --> 01:55:11.219 align:start position:0%
wasn't there from the state that this
 
01:55:13.609 --> 01:55:13.619 align:start position:0%
was cutting off oxygen to the teaching
 
01:55:15.530 --> 01:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
of important aspects of history that
 
01:55:16.970 --> 01:55:16.980 align:start position:0%
could destroy countless initiatives
 
01:55:19.189 --> 01:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
before they even came out of somebody's
 
01:55:21.530 --> 01:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
mind due to the fear of misguided
 
01:55:24.169 --> 01:55:24.179 align:start position:0%
attacks that we have had and of course
 
01:55:26.930 --> 01:55:26.940 align:start position:0%

01:55:28.189 --> 01:55:28.199 align:start position:0%

denomination in the state of New
Hampshire

01:56:24.830 --> 01:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:56:27.410 --> 01:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
um I've been a public school counselor a
 
01:56:28.910 --> 01:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
local school board member and School
 
01:56:31.729 --> 01:56:31.739 align:start position:0%
Board chair and a supervisory Union
 
01:56:35.330 --> 01:56:35.340 align:start position:0%
School Board chair and now I'm a pastor
 
01:56:38.450 --> 01:56:38.460 align:start position:0%
um just one thing the original bill that
 
01:56:40.910 --> 01:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
was tucked into the budget Bill and now
 
01:56:43.669 --> 01:56:43.679 align:start position:0%
cries out for repeal did not Bubble Up
 
01:56:45.530 --> 01:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
locally it was part of a national
 
01:56:48.229 --> 01:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
movement to undermine teachers and
 
01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
public schools and to foment Fierce
 
01:56:54.050 --> 01:56:54.060 align:start position:0%
anger towards teachers and schools
 
01:56:56.270 --> 01:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
particularly in regard to the teaching
 
01:56:58.850 --> 01:56:58.860 align:start position:0%
about race and gender
 
01:57:03.709 --> 01:57:03.719 align:start position:0%
and it it was based on this national
 
01:57:08.209 --> 01:57:08.219 align:start position:0%
movement was a based on wild stories
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
about Abominations that occurred in the
 
01:57:13.370 --> 01:57:13.380 align:start position:0%
classroom again particularly in regards
 
01:57:15.050 --> 01:57:15.060 align:start position:0%
to the teaching about race and gender
 
01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
and so in New Hampshire when this first
 
01:57:19.729 --> 01:57:19.739 align:start position:0%
came up there were thousands of people
 
01:57:22.850 --> 01:57:22.860 align:start position:0%
of Faith who were horrified on by by
 
01:57:25.550 --> 01:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
this bill which now cries out for repeal
 
01:57:29.629 --> 01:57:29.639 align:start position:0%
on but at the same time and sadly so
 
01:57:31.250 --> 01:57:31.260 align:start position:0%
um most people
 
01:57:32.810 --> 01:57:32.820 align:start position:0%
um believed that the original bill would
 
01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
go nowhere
 
01:57:35.770 --> 01:57:35.780 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:57:38.870 --> 01:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
because it was grounded not in reality
 
01:57:40.910 --> 01:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
not in truth not in what was really
 
01:57:43.010 --> 01:57:43.020 align:start position:0%
happening in the classroom but grounded
 
01:57:46.930 --> 01:57:46.940 align:start position:0%
on fear grounded on exaggerations on
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
and it likely if it had not been slipped
 
01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
into the budget into House Bill 2 it
 
01:57:55.850 --> 01:57:55.860 align:start position:0%
would not have kind of become law so the
 
01:58:00.410 --> 01:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
argument for repeal is the reality of
 
01:58:03.229 --> 01:58:03.239 align:start position:0%
the impact of this law not a word here
 
01:58:04.850 --> 01:58:04.860 align:start position:0%
or there that's in the legislation but
 
01:58:06.770 --> 01:58:06.780 align:start position:0%
what it is doing in the state of New
 
01:58:10.129 --> 01:58:10.139 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the fact is that this bill
 
01:58:12.410 --> 01:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
foments fear in the classroom and the
 
01:58:14.270 --> 01:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
part of teachers and that was part of
 
01:58:15.950 --> 01:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
its point that was part of the national
 
01:58:17.870 --> 01:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
movement's Point
 
01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
um and the fact that this bill
 
01:58:23.450 --> 01:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
um actually encouraged supporters of the
 
01:58:27.410 --> 01:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
bill to put on a bounty or a reward for
 
01:58:29.270 --> 01:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
turning in teachers who purportedly
 
01:58:31.609 --> 01:58:31.619 align:start position:0%
violate this law that should be of
 
01:58:34.790 --> 01:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
concern to this legislature a law that
 
01:58:37.189 --> 01:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
enables that kind of bounty hunting is
 
01:58:39.350 --> 01:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
not a good law and does not deserve to
 
01:58:41.149 --> 01:58:41.159 align:start position:0%
be in the statutes of the State of New
 
01:58:43.490 --> 01:58:43.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when I was a a young person
 
01:58:45.589 --> 01:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
when I was in high school one of the
 
01:58:47.330 --> 01:58:47.340 align:start position:0%
most popular social studies class this
 
01:58:49.250 --> 01:58:49.260 align:start position:0%
was a social studies class for primarily
 
01:58:51.970 --> 01:58:51.980 align:start position:0%
for seniors called problems of democracy
 
01:58:51.980 --> 01:58:53.530 align:start position:0%
for seniors called problems of democracy
and

01:58:53.530 --> 01:58:53.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:58:58.250 --> 01:58:58.260 align:start position:0%
this law discourages Stu teachers and
 
01:59:00.169 --> 01:59:00.179 align:start position:0%
schools from talking about the problems
 
01:59:01.669 --> 01:59:01.679 align:start position:0%
of democracy
 
01:59:03.470 --> 01:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
um the oppressions and the division that
 
01:59:05.510 --> 01:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
existed both in our past and our present
 
01:59:08.209 --> 01:59:08.219 align:start position:0%
that we can correct if we know about
 
01:59:09.890 --> 01:59:09.900 align:start position:0%
them if we understand that we learn them
 
01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
problems of democracy made me a better
 
01:59:15.350 --> 01:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
student a better person and a better
 
01:59:18.649 --> 01:59:18.659 align:start position:0%
citizen by learning about that so the
 
01:59:21.229 --> 01:59:21.239 align:start position:0%
prayer of many many thousands of people
 
01:59:22.609 --> 01:59:22.619 align:start position:0%
of faith in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:59:27.950 --> 01:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
is that house bill 61 must be passed and

02:00:03.350 --> 02:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
of what might be appropriate for
 
02:00:06.109 --> 02:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
children in school especially my own
 
02:00:09.290 --> 02:00:09.300 align:start position:0%

themes books and directives my

professional opinion on critical race
 
02:00:16.010 --> 02:00:16.020 align:start position:0%
theory is one of concern I found many
 
02:00:19.010 --> 02:00:19.020 align:start position:0%
outright outright lies and some
 
02:00:21.830 --> 02:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
seriously dangerous instructions let me
 
02:00:23.629 --> 02:00:23.639 align:start position:0%
quote a few lines from the award-winning
 
02:00:26.570 --> 02:00:26.580 align:start position:0%
CRT book this book is anti-racist by
 
02:00:28.310 --> 02:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
Tiffany Jewell
 
02:00:31.070 --> 02:00:31.080 align:start position:0%
this book teaches the main tenets of CRT
 
02:00:34.129 --> 02:00:34.139 align:start position:0%
this book was published in 2020 it's
 
02:00:37.070 --> 02:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
currently advertised to my boys on the
 
02:00:40.010 --> 02:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
as award-winning reading on their Sora
 
02:00:41.990 --> 02:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
student Library app it's currently
 
02:00:44.270 --> 02:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
advertised on the wall at the physical
 
02:00:46.729 --> 02:00:46.739 align:start position:0%
library with an arrow pointing to it
 
02:00:49.729 --> 02:00:49.739 align:start position:0%
saying High interest so these books are
 
02:00:51.649 --> 02:00:51.659 align:start position:0%
in our schools
 
02:00:54.649 --> 02:00:54.659 align:start position:0%
I kept a picture of that of that book on
 
02:00:56.330 --> 02:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
the wall in the library in case anyone
 
02:00:57.770 --> 02:00:57.780 align:start position:0%
actually wants to see it because it's
 
02:00:59.390 --> 02:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
there right now
 
02:01:01.729 --> 02:01:01.739 align:start position:0%
it's presented to my children repeatedly
 
02:01:03.950 --> 02:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
despite the current law that protects
 
02:01:05.629 --> 02:01:05.639 align:start position:0%
them from being taught this unwanted
 
02:01:07.790 --> 02:01:07.800 align:start position:0%
curriculum so let me read some lines
 
02:01:11.089 --> 02:01:11.099 align:start position:0%
that bothered me quote don't be afraid
 
02:01:13.910 --> 02:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
to disrupt agitate the system and be
 
02:01:17.450 --> 02:01:17.460 align:start position:0%
abrupt quote get angry stand up to
 
02:01:19.850 --> 02:01:19.860 align:start position:0%
police brutality attend local protests
 
02:01:21.770 --> 02:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
and rallies when black and brown folks
 
02:01:24.109 --> 02:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
are harmed by people the police bring
 
02:01:25.970 --> 02:01:25.980 align:start position:0%
your family friends teachers and
 
02:01:25.980 --> 02:01:27.470 align:start position:0%
your family friends teachers and
classmates

02:01:27.470 --> 02:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
classmates
 
02:01:29.870 --> 02:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
I find this to be dangerous advice for
 
02:01:32.450 --> 02:01:32.460 align:start position:0%
an inexperienced child I don't bring my
 
02:01:34.310 --> 02:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
kids to protests
 
02:01:37.250 --> 02:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
protests often have violence even though
 
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
it may be unattended listen to the next
 
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
lie quote it's our schools being more
 
02:01:45.589 --> 02:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
segregated today than they were during
 
02:01:50.089 --> 02:01:50.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:52.910 --> 02:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
that quote isn't true and it agitates
 
02:01:55.189 --> 02:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
the problem in my opinion
 
02:01:57.950 --> 02:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
the redistribution of resources is a
 
02:02:00.350 --> 02:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
theme throughout this book these methods
 
02:02:03.050 --> 02:02:03.060 align:start position:0%
are based on reparations the ideas are
 
02:02:04.910 --> 02:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
all presented as truth when they are
 
02:02:07.550 --> 02:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
opinions not everyone agrees with these
 
02:02:10.070 --> 02:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
Solutions if kids learn these lies as
 
02:02:12.470 --> 02:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
truth they will go forward angry and
 
02:02:14.510 --> 02:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
ready to agitate the system based on
 
02:02:15.830 --> 02:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
those lies
 
02:02:17.810 --> 02:02:17.820 align:start position:0%
parents are likely to give their kids
 
02:02:19.609 --> 02:02:19.619 align:start position:0%
different advice
 
02:02:23.149 --> 02:02:23.159 align:start position:0%
around combating racism let parents
 
02:02:25.129 --> 02:02:25.139 align:start position:0%
decide allowing these curriculum's
 
02:02:27.589 --> 02:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
unwanted and dangerous do not repeal the
 
02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
bill protecting students from unwanted
 
02:02:31.490 --> 02:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
curriculum including critical race
 
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
Theory I do not support house bill 61.

next person is
 
02:03:00.649 --> 02:03:00.659 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:03:14.030 --> 02:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
students do not exist within a vacuum
 
02:03:15.709 --> 02:03:15.719 align:start position:0%
they observe the realities that many
 
02:03:17.390 --> 02:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
attempt to Shield them from that many
 
02:03:19.669 --> 02:03:19.679 align:start position:0%
assume they do not and cannot handle or
 
02:03:21.709 --> 02:03:21.719 align:start position:0%
comprehend and in many cases they want
 
02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
to learn when we deny ignore evade or
 
02:03:26.689 --> 02:03:26.699 align:start position:0%
exclude mentions of the realities that
 
02:03:28.729 --> 02:03:28.739 align:start position:0%
they experience it does not instill
 
02:03:31.010 --> 02:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
their trust or attention and to continue
 
02:03:32.930 --> 02:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
to enact a watchdog program against
 
02:03:35.330 --> 02:03:35.340 align:start position:0%
teachers does not offer them their very
 
02:03:37.550 --> 02:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
well deserved deserved support or
 
02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:38.930 align:start position:0%
well deserved deserved support or
loyalty

02:03:38.930 --> 02:03:38.940 align:start position:0%
loyalty
 
02:03:40.669 --> 02:03:40.679 align:start position:0%
there is a narrative that around
 
02:03:43.070 --> 02:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
Prejudice and oppression suggesting that
 
02:03:44.570 --> 02:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
if we do not talk about these issues
 
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
they cease to be issues but this
 
02:03:48.290 --> 02:03:48.300 align:start position:0%
thinking exposes its own bias because it
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
relies on the exclusion of the voices
 
02:03:53.030 --> 02:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
warning us otherwise a colorblind and
 
02:03:55.550 --> 02:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
gender-blind world is not a possibility
 
02:03:58.189 --> 02:03:58.199 align:start position:0%
today nor do I think or believe it is
 
02:03:59.510 --> 02:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
characteristic of what we should be
 
02:04:00.830 --> 02:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
striving for
 
02:04:02.870 --> 02:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
is not until we listen to those affected
 
02:04:04.669 --> 02:04:04.679 align:start position:0%
and learn about the curtain incantations
 
02:04:06.530 --> 02:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
of oppressive violence that we can put
 
02:04:08.870 --> 02:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
it to an end having conversations around
 
02:04:10.910 --> 02:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
racism sexism and other forms of
 
02:04:12.649 --> 02:04:12.659 align:start position:0%
Oppression that are proactive and
 
02:04:14.810 --> 02:04:14.820 align:start position:0%
relevant has become very difficult under
 
02:04:17.510 --> 02:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
this bill like we have heard it is also
 
02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
emboldened Bad actors adult and student
 
02:04:21.290 --> 02:04:21.300 align:start position:0%
alike to take the opportunity to
 
02:04:22.750 --> 02:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
discriminate against minorities
 
02:04:24.890 --> 02:04:24.900 align:start position:0%
acknowledging the existence of racism
 
02:04:26.629 --> 02:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
and teaching our students on historical
 
02:04:29.330 --> 02:04:29.340 align:start position:0%
and current day racism is not itself a
 
02:04:31.729 --> 02:04:31.739 align:start position:0%
form of racism it is a form of Education
 
02:04:33.410 --> 02:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
in this imperative piece of full
 
02:04:35.570 --> 02:04:35.580 align:start position:0%
education that our students have a right
 
02:04:37.970 --> 02:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
to receive and with that considered I
 
02:04:40.490 --> 02:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
urge you to support the passing of hb61
 
02:04:42.830 --> 02:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:44.530 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
questions

02:04:44.530 --> 02:04:44.540 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:04:47.209 --> 02:04:47.219 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:04:49.370 --> 02:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
if there are any Representatives if you
 
02:04:50.810 --> 02:04:50.820 align:start position:0%
usually you should put in the bottom of
 
02:04:53.510 --> 02:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
your your form here representing and you
 
02:04:55.250 --> 02:04:55.260 align:start position:0%

02:04:57.169 --> 02:04:57.179 align:start position:0%
number down if you don't do it we don't
 
02:05:01.250 --> 02:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
recognize it so it's okay I apologize
 
02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:14.209 --> 02:05:14.219 align:start position:0%

afternoon now
 
02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
um my name is ABIA Kincaid and I am a
 
02:05:20.570 --> 02:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
senior at Bedford High School in the
 
02:05:22.669 --> 02:05:22.679 align:start position:0%
town of Bedford I actually am skipping
 
02:05:24.410 --> 02:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
school today to be here to testify in
 
02:05:27.169 --> 02:05:27.179 align:start position:0%
support of house bill 61. barring
 
02:05:28.609 --> 02:05:28.619 align:start position:0%
Educators from allowing the space to
 
02:05:30.109 --> 02:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
discuss essential topics such as race
 
02:05:31.609 --> 02:05:31.619 align:start position:0%
gender and sexuality is a grave
 
02:05:33.290 --> 02:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
disservice and failure to New Hampshire
 
02:05:33.300 --> 02:05:35.209 align:start position:0%
disservice and failure to New Hampshire
students

02:05:35.209 --> 02:05:35.219 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:05:36.709 --> 02:05:36.719 align:start position:0%
these efforts do not protect students as
 
02:05:38.750 --> 02:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
proponents of these policies claim
 
02:05:40.430 --> 02:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
they instead endanger them to the risk
 
02:05:42.109 --> 02:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
of ignorance and intolerance the
 
02:05:43.729 --> 02:05:43.739 align:start position:0%
classroom must remain a space that
 
02:05:45.290 --> 02:05:45.300 align:start position:0%
Fosters challenging conversations and
 
02:05:47.089 --> 02:05:47.099 align:start position:0%
personal growth through the expansion of
 
02:05:48.830 --> 02:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
our understanding of the world House
 
02:05:50.750 --> 02:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
Bill 61 protects diversity equity and
 
02:05:52.149 --> 02:05:52.159 align:start position:0%
inclusion conversations from State
 
02:05:54.589 --> 02:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
censorship which is something very near
 
02:05:56.149 --> 02:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
and dear to my heart
 
02:05:59.149 --> 02:05:59.159 align:start position:0%
in 2020-2021 I served on the diversity
 
02:06:00.290 --> 02:06:00.300 align:start position:0%
committee at Bedford High School as one
 
02:06:02.570 --> 02:06:02.580 align:start position:0%
of the student Representatives
 
02:06:04.250 --> 02:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
we created a presentation of real
 
02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
stories from students at Bedford to
 
02:06:08.149 --> 02:06:08.159 align:start position:0%
present to our community
 
02:06:09.530 --> 02:06:09.540 align:start position:0%
that have experienced racism and
 
02:06:09.540 --> 02:06:11.750 align:start position:0%
that have experienced racism and
homophobia

02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
homophobia
 
02:06:14.270 --> 02:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
that that presentation was followed by a
 
02:06:17.330 --> 02:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
conversation about what to do about it
 
02:06:19.250 --> 02:06:19.260 align:start position:0%
and how people felt
 
02:06:20.750 --> 02:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
people have to be okay being
 
02:06:22.850 --> 02:06:22.860 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable these conversations are
 
02:06:22.860 --> 02:06:24.169 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable these conversations are
uncomfortable

02:06:24.169 --> 02:06:24.179 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable
 
02:06:26.629 --> 02:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
and that is something that without that
 
02:06:29.390 --> 02:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
we do we cannot grow and change
 
02:06:30.890 --> 02:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
the work of this committee was creating
 
02:06:32.810 --> 02:06:32.820 align:start position:0%
real change at Bedford unfortunately
 
02:06:34.910 --> 02:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
though we were curbed by the passing of
 
02:06:38.990 --> 02:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
HB 544 or the device of conscious ban
 
02:06:40.970 --> 02:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
in addition to that committee I am the
 
02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
President of the diversity equity and
 
02:06:45.050 --> 02:06:45.060 align:start position:0%
inclusion Club at Bedford High School
 
02:06:46.550 --> 02:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
the goal of our club is to create a
 
02:06:47.689 --> 02:06:47.699 align:start position:0%
space for students to have discussions
 
02:06:49.669 --> 02:06:49.679 align:start position:0%
about hard topics and work to create a
 
02:06:50.810 --> 02:06:50.820 align:start position:0%
school that centers diversity through
 
02:06:52.970 --> 02:06:52.980 align:start position:0%
education being president of this club
 
02:06:54.169 --> 02:06:54.179 align:start position:0%
in a time where these conversations
 
02:06:56.030 --> 02:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
cannot be had in the classroom
 
02:06:58.430 --> 02:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
has been very eye-opening students have
 
02:07:00.890 --> 02:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
come to me to express grave confusion on
 
02:07:02.689 --> 02:07:02.699 align:start position:0%
why their story that they relate to in
 
02:07:05.570 --> 02:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
history is being brushed over so quickly
 
02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
or why their identity is seemingly being
 
02:07:09.530 --> 02:07:09.540 align:start position:0%
erased from conversations this is not
 
02:07:11.149 --> 02:07:11.159 align:start position:0%
about political parties it's about
 
02:07:12.410 --> 02:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
building community and keeping the
 
02:07:12.420 --> 02:07:13.310 align:start position:0%
building community and keeping the
school

02:07:13.310 --> 02:07:13.320 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:07:15.229 --> 02:07:15.239 align:start position:0%
a safe place where students feel seen
 
02:07:16.189 --> 02:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
and heard
 
02:07:18.530 --> 02:07:18.540 align:start position:0%
I also canvassed this summer in my
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
community against the device of
 
02:07:21.530 --> 02:07:21.540 align:start position:0%
conscious ban and the outrage was clear
 
02:07:23.390 --> 02:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
people were shocked that New Hampshire
 
02:07:25.189 --> 02:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
would create a ban like the divisive
 
02:07:27.350 --> 02:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
conscious ban in our schools history
 
02:07:29.330 --> 02:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
matters because it repeats itself and if
 
02:07:30.530 --> 02:07:30.540 align:start position:0%
we're not having the uncomfortable
 
02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
conversations about race gender
 
02:07:34.189 --> 02:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
sexuality religion how can we honestly
 
02:07:36.229 --> 02:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
say we won't repeat history again
 
02:07:37.850 --> 02:07:37.860 align:start position:0%
how can we sit here in contempt of the
 
02:07:39.169 --> 02:07:39.179 align:start position:0%
cries from students and Educators to
 
02:07:41.089 --> 02:07:41.099 align:start position:0%
change things in our schools this is not
 
02:07:43.129 --> 02:07:43.139 align:start position:0%
about winning or losing it's about doing
 
02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
right by the Youth of New Hampshire and
 
02:07:46.609 --> 02:07:46.619 align:start position:0%
that is why I urge the committee to vote
 
02:07:48.830 --> 02:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on hb61 thank you for your
 
02:07:50.870 --> 02:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
time and I'll take any questions
 
02:07:53.330 --> 02:07:53.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there and it's
 
02:07:55.609 --> 02:07:55.619 align:start position:0%
always encouraging to see students
 
02:07:58.010 --> 02:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
coming down and and participating in the
 
02:07:59.930 --> 02:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
in the process that we have here I
 
02:08:02.030 --> 02:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate that any questions from the
 
02:08:06.290 --> 02:08:06.300 align:start position:0%

into law
 
02:08:17.870 --> 02:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
yes I have read um HB 544 and hb61 both
 
02:08:19.970 --> 02:08:19.980 align:start position:0%
very thoroughly and multiple times but
 
02:08:22.970 --> 02:08:22.980 align:start position:0%
HP 544 wasn't what into I'm talking
 
02:08:25.189 --> 02:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
about what actually went into law what
 
02:08:29.870 --> 02:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
was in sb2 yes yes okay good
 
02:08:34.330 --> 02:08:34.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:36.830 --> 02:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
good question
 
02:08:36.840 --> 02:08:37.609 align:start position:0%
good question
um

02:08:37.609 --> 02:08:37.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:40.010 --> 02:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
since you
 
02:08:42.410 --> 02:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
have read that I'm hoping you can
 
02:08:45.470 --> 02:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
explain to me how what the words in that
 
02:08:47.870 --> 02:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
law say
 
02:08:49.609 --> 02:08:49.619 align:start position:0%
um keep you from doing the awesome
 
02:08:52.129 --> 02:08:52.139 align:start position:0%
things that you've been doing
 
02:08:52.139 --> 02:08:53.330 align:start position:0%
things that you've been doing
so

02:08:53.330 --> 02:08:53.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:08:54.830 --> 02:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
I think everyone has answered your
 
02:08:55.970 --> 02:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
question already has said it very
 
02:08:57.649 --> 02:08:57.659 align:start position:0%
adequately but I will add that from my
 
02:08:59.930 --> 02:08:59.940 align:start position:0%
own personal experience as a student who
 
02:09:02.030 --> 02:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
is very Humanity centered um meaning I
 
02:09:03.709 --> 02:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
take classes like for example U.S
 
02:09:06.470 --> 02:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
government world history two I'm taking
 
02:09:08.390 --> 02:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
environmental science this year I know
 
02:09:10.669 --> 02:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
that like from the years that I was in
 
02:09:12.530 --> 02:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
high school before this Bill had passed
 
02:09:14.330 --> 02:09:14.340 align:start position:0%
those conversations were happening up
 
02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
like oh let's talk about
 
02:09:18.770 --> 02:09:18.780 align:start position:0%
um the messaging behind this book or
 
02:09:20.149 --> 02:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
like for example right now we're talking
 
02:09:20.159 --> 02:09:21.229 align:start position:0%
like for example right now we're talking
about

02:09:21.229 --> 02:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:09:22.609 --> 02:09:22.619 align:start position:0%
um the Red Scare and like why did the
 
02:09:24.530 --> 02:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
Red Scare happen and conversations like
 
02:09:26.510 --> 02:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
that are happening but now for example
 
02:09:28.790 --> 02:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
in my AP Gov class if a student comes up
 
02:09:31.729 --> 02:09:31.739 align:start position:0%
and says oh well can we talk about
 
02:09:33.950 --> 02:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
why I think this problem this Paul this
 
02:09:35.629 --> 02:09:35.639 align:start position:0%
certain policy for example is
 
02:09:38.810 --> 02:09:38.820 align:start position:0%
problematic the teacher has to say I'm
 
02:09:40.189 --> 02:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
sorry but we actually can't talk about
 
02:09:41.570 --> 02:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
that we can't have that discussion
 
02:09:43.550 --> 02:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
because that discussion
 
02:09:46.910 --> 02:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
is divisive and that's what that's what
 
02:09:49.250 --> 02:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
that bill does is it doesn't want us to
 
02:09:50.689 --> 02:09:50.699 align:start position:0%
talk about things are that are divisive
 
02:09:52.850 --> 02:09:52.860 align:start position:0%
so I think the vagueness of the bill is
 
02:09:54.709 --> 02:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
what creates this like fear-mongering
 
02:09:56.270 --> 02:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
02:09:56.280 --> 02:09:56.870 align:start position:0%
and I think
um

02:09:56.870 --> 02:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:58.490 --> 02:09:58.500 align:start position:0%
part of the reason why you're I feel
 
02:10:00.410 --> 02:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
like having such a hard time
 
02:10:03.109 --> 02:10:03.119 align:start position:0%
um understanding why it's happening is
 
02:10:05.870 --> 02:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
because teachers don't even know why
 
02:10:07.209 --> 02:10:07.219 align:start position:0%
because teachers are sitting here
 
02:10:09.350 --> 02:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
confused because the bill isn't clear
 
02:10:11.870 --> 02:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
and that's why we need to repeal it and
 
02:10:15.950 --> 02:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
support HP 61. thank you very much
 
02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
further questions thank you uh Aubry
 
02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:24.709 align:start position:0%
further questions thank you uh Aubry

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:37.189 align:start position:0%
submit a a summary of my bullet points
here

02:10:37.189 --> 02:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:10:41.450 --> 02:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
um I speak in opposition to HB 61.
 
02:10:43.270 --> 02:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
um the current law
 
02:10:46.609 --> 02:10:46.619 align:start position:0%
it protects students from teachers who
 
02:10:50.030 --> 02:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
push their Politics on their students so
 
02:10:52.270 --> 02:10:52.280 align:start position:0%
I think it's reasonable
 
02:10:54.830 --> 02:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
the law the way it is that you leave
 
02:10:57.830 --> 02:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
your politics out of the classroom and
 
02:11:01.370 --> 02:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
just teach the subjects period and the
 
02:11:02.930 --> 02:11:02.940 align:start position:0%
only problem with the current law was it
 
02:11:06.169 --> 02:11:06.179 align:start position:0%
was watered down if a teacher is
 
02:11:09.350 --> 02:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
promoting and advocating racism or
 
02:11:12.410 --> 02:11:12.420 align:start position:0%
sexism they should be fired period
 
02:11:14.330 --> 02:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
and so that's the only problem with the
 
02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
law is a little bit uh the parents have
 
02:11:19.669 --> 02:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
to find recourse now a lot has been
 
02:11:21.129 --> 02:11:21.139 align:start position:0%
discussed about
 
02:11:24.050 --> 02:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
uh freedom of expression here
 
02:11:28.189 --> 02:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
intellectual Freedom uh every employer
 
02:11:30.649 --> 02:11:30.659 align:start position:0%
has the right to have certain rules uh
 
02:11:34.430 --> 02:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
for your employees to have to follow and
 
02:11:36.350 --> 02:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's unreasonable that
 
02:11:39.410 --> 02:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
teachers cannot bring their politics
 
02:11:41.810 --> 02:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
into the classroom okay now the big
 
02:11:43.370 --> 02:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
issue here that was discussed a lot
 
02:11:43.380 --> 02:11:44.390 align:start position:0%
issue here that was discussed a lot
today

02:11:44.390 --> 02:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:45.709 align:start position:0%
today
is

02:11:45.709 --> 02:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:11:48.229 --> 02:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
every the teachers are afraid to discuss
 
02:11:52.070 --> 02:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
here's from the current law section two
 
02:11:56.930 --> 02:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
RSA 19340 quote nothing in this section
 
02:12:00.609 --> 02:12:00.619 align:start position:0%
shall be construed construed to prohibit
 
02:12:03.830 --> 02:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
discussing discussing as part of a
 
02:12:05.689 --> 02:12:05.699 align:start position:0%
larger course of academic instruction
 
02:12:08.689 --> 02:12:08.699 align:start position:0%
the historical existence of ideas and
 
02:12:11.330 --> 02:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
subject identified in this section again
 
02:12:15.410 --> 02:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
it's discussion you can discuss uh
 
02:12:20.270 --> 02:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
pass that slavery or KKK or redlining or
 
02:12:23.629 --> 02:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
reparations or 1619 projects you can
 
02:12:25.970 --> 02:12:25.980 align:start position:0%
discuss it there should be no reason
 
02:12:27.890 --> 02:12:27.900 align:start position:0%
that teachers should be afraid to
 
02:12:31.850 --> 02:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
discuss it you just cannot Advocate or
 
02:12:34.850 --> 02:12:34.860 align:start position:0%
indoctrinate I think it's pretty clear
 
02:12:38.270 --> 02:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
so if teachers are not doing anything
 
02:12:38.280 --> 02:12:39.669 align:start position:0%
so if teachers are not doing anything
wrong

02:12:39.669 --> 02:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
02:12:42.050 --> 02:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
there should be nothing again just
 
02:12:44.149 --> 02:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
discussing and I'd say rather than
 
02:12:46.850 --> 02:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
pushing victimhood and bringing personal
 
02:12:49.189 --> 02:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
politics into the classroom they should
 
02:12:50.990 --> 02:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
be concentrating on the basic things
 
02:12:54.649 --> 02:12:54.659 align:start position:0%
like reading arithmetic and writing and
 
02:12:56.689 --> 02:12:56.699 align:start position:0%
get back to the core stuff and not
 
02:12:59.030 --> 02:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
worrying about victimhood and stuff like
 
02:13:01.010 --> 02:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
that if you look at the proficiency
 
02:13:03.709 --> 02:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
scores they're unbelievable they're 40s
 
02:13:06.709 --> 02:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
30s even 20 percent ranges so that
 
02:13:10.850 --> 02:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
really should be the focus and lastly I
 
02:13:12.649 --> 02:13:12.659 align:start position:0%
say if teachers are that worried about
 
02:13:14.950 --> 02:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
it actually we should have cameras
 
02:13:17.709 --> 02:13:17.719 align:start position:0%
recording in every government classroom
 
02:13:21.109 --> 02:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
pointing at the teachers so that parents
 
02:13:22.669 --> 02:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
know what's being taught since they
 
02:13:23.990 --> 02:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
don't really allow parents in the
 
02:13:25.970 --> 02:13:25.980 align:start position:0%
classrooms that much anymore and then
 
02:13:28.850 --> 02:13:28.860 align:start position:0%
also teachers could feel protected too
 
02:13:30.770 --> 02:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
that they didn't do anything or say
 
02:13:32.750 --> 02:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
anything that was their personal
 
02:13:35.569 --> 02:13:35.579 align:start position:0%
politics and that's it thank you thank
 
02:13:37.069 --> 02:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
you very much are there questions from
 
02:13:38.750 --> 02:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:13:42.290 --> 02:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
yes representative Woodcock thank you Mr
 
02:13:44.149 --> 02:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
chairman uh good afternoon and thank you
 
02:13:46.069 --> 02:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
for taking my question would you think
 
02:13:48.649 --> 02:13:48.659 align:start position:0%
it would be fair then for or allowable
 
02:13:51.410 --> 02:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
under your interpretation for a teacher
 
02:13:54.709 --> 02:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
to create a debate on the existence or
 
02:13:56.569 --> 02:13:56.579 align:start position:0%
non-existence of racism in the classroom
 
02:13:59.629 --> 02:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
let that go back and forth oh see that a
 
02:14:03.589 --> 02:14:03.599 align:start position:0%
debate would be fine a debate is good
 
02:14:05.810 --> 02:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
actually it would be that the students
 
02:14:08.330 --> 02:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
that are debating uh the teachers they
 
02:14:10.550 --> 02:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
would just be mediating the discussion
 
02:14:12.830 --> 02:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
so that would be perfectly good that's
 
02:14:16.250 --> 02:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
encouraged and that should be totally
 
02:14:18.830 --> 02:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
allowable under the current law debate
 
02:14:21.709 --> 02:14:21.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:25.129 --> 02:14:25.139 align:start position:0%
well mediated you know they're just you
 
02:14:27.169 --> 02:14:27.179 align:start position:0%
know a debate is mediated
 
02:14:29.629 --> 02:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:14:32.689 --> 02:14:32.699 align:start position:0%
no no further questions thank you uh I'd
 
02:14:45.290 --> 02:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:47.450 --> 02:14:47.460 align:start position:0%
hi thank you for the opportunity to
 
02:14:49.790 --> 02:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
speak to you today my name is Kate West
 
02:14:52.970 --> 02:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
I have a 10 year old in the Concord
 
02:14:55.490 --> 02:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
School District
 
02:14:57.649 --> 02:14:57.659 align:start position:0%
um and one of the things that I keep
 
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
hearing is how does this law prevent
 
02:15:04.910 --> 02:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
honest discourse in the classroom uh to
 
02:15:07.250 --> 02:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
me this seems very clearly like a we can
 
02:15:10.850 --> 02:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
talk about the cause but not the effect
 
02:15:15.830 --> 02:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
so I think that when you say in this law
 
02:15:19.189 --> 02:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
you can't teach that somebody is
 
02:15:22.609 --> 02:15:22.619 align:start position:0%
inherently Superior based on their
 
02:15:22.619 --> 02:15:24.350 align:start position:0%
inherently Superior based on their
identity

02:15:24.350 --> 02:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
identity
 
02:15:28.550 --> 02:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
um it's more so a way to deny the
 
02:15:31.550 --> 02:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
reality of the structures in our society
 
02:15:35.450 --> 02:15:35.460 align:start position:0%
and how they do uphold superiority right
 
02:15:40.189 --> 02:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
if you say women and men are equal
 
02:15:43.370 --> 02:15:43.380 align:start position:0%
that's wonderful we would love that but
 
02:15:46.550 --> 02:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
there is a wage Gap and not addressing
 
02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:47.930 align:start position:0%
there is a wage Gap and not addressing
that

02:15:47.930 --> 02:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:15:50.629 --> 02:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
is only beneficial
 
02:15:55.129 --> 02:15:55.139 align:start position:0%
to one group of people and so it seems
 
02:15:57.530 --> 02:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
to me that the purpose of this law and
 
02:15:59.950 --> 02:15:59.960 align:start position:0%
we've heard that the impact of this law
 
02:16:04.189 --> 02:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
is to wish away the inequities in our
 
02:16:06.410 --> 02:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
society by teaching children that they
 
02:16:09.109 --> 02:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
don't exist
 
02:16:11.270 --> 02:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
um which is ineffective
 
02:16:13.910 --> 02:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
there's work to be done to create a
 
02:16:16.550 --> 02:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
society where you are not discriminated
 
02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
against based on your ability your
 
02:16:21.109 --> 02:16:21.119 align:start position:0%
gender your race your religion
 
02:16:23.709 --> 02:16:23.719 align:start position:0%
Etc this law
 
02:16:26.629 --> 02:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
completely ignores that work that needs
 
02:16:28.970 --> 02:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
to be done and teaches children that
 
02:16:30.589 --> 02:16:30.599 align:start position:0%
it's over
 
02:16:30.599 --> 02:16:31.790 align:start position:0%
it's over
uh

02:16:31.790 --> 02:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:16:36.830 --> 02:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
I think honestly one other aspect that I
 
02:16:39.530 --> 02:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
would point out is to say
 
02:16:44.030 --> 02:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
when it comes to discussions of race
 
02:16:47.629 --> 02:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
I have found as someone that
 
02:16:51.709 --> 02:16:51.719 align:start position:0%
wants to work to be anti-racist
 
02:16:55.250 --> 02:16:55.260 align:start position:0%
that two very big indicators that
 
02:16:59.089 --> 02:16:59.099 align:start position:0%
something is racist is one when people
 
02:17:02.089 --> 02:17:02.099 align:start position:0%
that are black or indigenous Hispanic
 
02:17:05.690 --> 02:17:05.700 align:start position:0%
Asian American Etc come to a body like
 
02:17:08.089 --> 02:17:08.099 align:start position:0%
this and tell you it's racist
 
02:17:11.089 --> 02:17:11.099 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty easy indicator that it
 
02:17:14.570 --> 02:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
is secondly when self-identified white
 
02:17:17.450 --> 02:17:17.460 align:start position:0%
supremacist groups support and advocate
 
02:17:19.310 --> 02:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
for something again
 
02:17:21.349 --> 02:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty clear indicator that
 
02:17:23.870 --> 02:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
it's upholding racism
 
02:17:26.209 --> 02:17:26.219 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
02:17:28.009 --> 02:17:28.019 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:17:29.330 --> 02:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:17:31.089 --> 02:17:31.099 align:start position:0%
I just had several
 
02:17:33.349 --> 02:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
Representatives show up I'll let them
 
02:17:35.209 --> 02:17:35.219 align:start position:0%
know that I'm going to have the folks
 
02:17:37.849 --> 02:17:37.859 align:start position:0%
have been sitting here testify first
 
02:17:40.730 --> 02:17:40.740 align:start position:0%
they will get those reps later
 
02:17:44.570 --> 02:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
at the end of it next person is Ruby
 
02:17:44.580 --> 02:17:52.190 align:start position:0%
at the end of it next person is Ruby
Carr

02:17:52.190 --> 02:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:55.310 --> 02:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Ruby Carr I
 
02:17:56.870 --> 02:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
use they them pronouns and I'm
 
02:17:59.870 --> 02:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
testifying in support of hb61
 
02:18:01.910 --> 02:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
I've lived in New Hampshire for my
 
02:18:04.610 --> 02:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
entire life I went to co-brown for high
 
02:18:06.290 --> 02:18:06.300 align:start position:0%
school and I'm currently a student at
 
02:18:09.530 --> 02:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
UNH and a very important part of my life
 
02:18:12.889 --> 02:18:12.899 align:start position:0%
is my LGBT identity I've noticed not a
 
02:18:14.150 --> 02:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
lot of people have spoken about that
 
02:18:17.089 --> 02:18:17.099 align:start position:0%
aspect of this bill today but I was
 
02:18:18.469 --> 02:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
incredibly lucky to have a very
 
02:18:20.089 --> 02:18:20.099 align:start position:0%
supportive environment in which to
 
02:18:22.129 --> 02:18:22.139 align:start position:0%
discover who I am in high school and
 
02:18:24.349 --> 02:18:24.359 align:start position:0%
then again in college
 
02:18:25.549 --> 02:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
um and I would not have been able to
 
02:18:27.589 --> 02:18:27.599 align:start position:0%
figure out my gender and sexuality or to
 
02:18:29.450 --> 02:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
accept either if it weren't for groups
 
02:18:31.669 --> 02:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
like my high school is GSA and also very
 
02:18:33.230 --> 02:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
supportive teachers
 
02:18:35.570 --> 02:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
uh particularly those who identified in
 
02:18:37.129 --> 02:18:37.139 align:start position:0%
the same way as me who I got to see
 
02:18:39.589 --> 02:18:39.599 align:start position:0%
living their lives openly
 
02:18:41.690 --> 02:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
um additionally I want to be a teacher
 
02:18:43.790 --> 02:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
myself someday but the divisive concept
 
02:18:46.690 --> 02:18:46.700 align:start position:0%
span that's currently in place uh
 
02:18:49.370 --> 02:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
jeopardizes all of this how can teachers
 
02:18:50.929 --> 02:18:50.939 align:start position:0%
be supportive and open about their
 
02:18:53.030 --> 02:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
identities if they're constantly in fear
 
02:18:55.250 --> 02:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
of the potential repercussions just for
 
02:18:55.260 --> 02:18:56.349 align:start position:0%
of the potential repercussions just for
existing

02:18:56.349 --> 02:18:56.359 align:start position:0%
existing
 
02:18:59.089 --> 02:18:59.099 align:start position:0%
as part of a class last year I got to
 
02:19:00.589 --> 02:19:00.599 align:start position:0%
Shadow a middle school teacher in
 
02:19:02.450 --> 02:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
Stratham for a semester and when
 
02:19:04.310 --> 02:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
introducing myself to the students I was
 
02:19:06.230 --> 02:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
afraid to go by my correct pronouns
 
02:19:09.169 --> 02:19:09.179 align:start position:0%
which is just who I am and for fear that
 
02:19:10.730 --> 02:19:10.740 align:start position:0%
I would get the school or the teacher I
 
02:19:12.830 --> 02:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
was shadowing in trouble kids need to
 
02:19:14.450 --> 02:19:14.460 align:start position:0%
see representation of people living
 
02:19:17.030 --> 02:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
openly and happily with their shared
 
02:19:18.650 --> 02:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
identities in order to accept themselves
 
02:19:20.750 --> 02:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
and their their best way to learn this
 
02:19:23.990 --> 02:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:25.669 --> 02:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
um I wish I had seen representation
 
02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:27.599 align:start position:0%
earlier in my life so that I would have
 
02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
been able to explore my identity and
 
02:19:31.129 --> 02:19:31.139 align:start position:0%
live openly sooner
 
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
um so this bill would allow teachers and
 
02:19:34.849 --> 02:19:34.859 align:start position:0%
students both to feel safe and to be
 
02:19:36.709 --> 02:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
open again in school and thank you and
 
02:19:39.410 --> 02:19:39.420 align:start position:0%
please vote in support of hb61 thank you
 
02:19:40.310 --> 02:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
very much
 
02:19:43.490 --> 02:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
I have questions from the committee
 
02:19:45.889 --> 02:19:45.899 align:start position:0%
not seeing any hands thank you
 
02:19:59.150 --> 02:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:01.849 --> 02:20:01.859 align:start position:0%
hello and thank you for having this
 
02:20:04.310 --> 02:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
important hearing my name is Lynn Clues
 
02:20:06.410 --> 02:20:06.420 align:start position:0%
I live in Warner New Hampshire
 
02:20:09.710 --> 02:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
I'm in favor of house bill 61.
 
02:20:12.889 --> 02:20:12.899 align:start position:0%
I believe we become better when we learn
 
02:20:15.889 --> 02:20:15.899 align:start position:0%
honest history the race relations of
 
02:20:18.230 --> 02:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
this country today are hugely influenced
 
02:20:22.130 --> 02:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
by the histories of race relations in
 
02:20:24.110 --> 02:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
this country when we learn about the
 
02:20:26.710 --> 02:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
past in honest detail we can devise
 
02:20:30.770 --> 02:20:30.780 align:start position:0%
excuse me A Better Way Forward today
 
02:20:33.410 --> 02:20:33.420 align:start position:0%
I studied history in college I learned
 
02:20:35.630 --> 02:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
so much that opened my eyes
 
02:20:37.910 --> 02:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
then I became a high school
 
02:20:41.690 --> 02:20:41.700 align:start position:0%
history teacher in New Hampshire and a
 
02:20:41.700 --> 02:20:43.309 align:start position:0%
history teacher in New Hampshire and a
trainer

02:20:43.309 --> 02:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
trainer
 
02:20:45.410 --> 02:20:45.420 align:start position:0%
I always like to ask people to think
 
02:20:47.870 --> 02:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
about what they're reading or hearing is
 
02:20:49.309 --> 02:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
it rhetoric
 
02:20:52.790 --> 02:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
is it reality what's the balance
 
02:20:54.710 --> 02:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
I enjoy helping people open their eyes
 
02:20:57.010 --> 02:20:57.020 align:start position:0%
to facts in hopes of the increasingly
 
02:20:59.929 --> 02:20:59.939 align:start position:0%
informed and thoughtful residents of New
 
02:21:02.210 --> 02:21:02.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire building authentic race
 
02:21:04.730 --> 02:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
relations and solutions to the many
 
02:21:08.330 --> 02:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
problems of today's society
 
02:21:10.010 --> 02:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
there was a time when many people said
 
02:21:12.650 --> 02:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
there was no climate change today cities
 
02:21:14.690 --> 02:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
and countries worldwide are working to
 
02:21:16.790 --> 02:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
build protections against rising sea
 
02:21:18.590 --> 02:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
levels and other problems due to the
 
02:21:21.590 --> 02:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
reality of climate change
 
02:21:24.170 --> 02:21:24.180 align:start position:0%
planning how to reduce carbon Footprints
 
02:21:26.210 --> 02:21:26.220 align:start position:0%
this couldn't happen if leaders were
 
02:21:28.550 --> 02:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
still denying the existence of climate
 
02:21:31.250 --> 02:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
change like climate change in race
 
02:21:34.250 --> 02:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
relations acknowledgment is crucial our
 
02:21:36.230 --> 02:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
nation's promise of fairness and
 
02:21:39.050 --> 02:21:39.060 align:start position:0%
opportunity for all people cannot be met
 
02:21:41.210 --> 02:21:41.220 align:start position:0%
without first acknowledging there has
 
02:21:44.469 --> 02:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
been and continues to be undeserved
 
02:21:47.450 --> 02:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
discrimination against black native and
 
02:21:50.750 --> 02:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
other community members of color
 
02:21:53.570 --> 02:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
what if we teach the unfairnesses and a
 
02:21:55.309 --> 02:21:55.319 align:start position:0%
child feels guilty
 
02:21:57.889 --> 02:21:57.899 align:start position:0%
if someone feels guilty
 
02:22:00.590 --> 02:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
they may move forward themselves or with
 
02:22:02.510 --> 02:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
the help of the people around them their
 
02:22:06.170 --> 02:22:06.180 align:start position:0%
parents and Educators with more learning
 
02:22:09.770 --> 02:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
about how to be part of the solutions to
 
02:22:13.190 --> 02:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
build fairness and opportunity
 
02:22:15.290 --> 02:22:15.300 align:start position:0%
suppressing training and denial about
 
02:22:18.110 --> 02:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
difficult topics only breeds more denial
 
02:22:20.750 --> 02:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
let us move forward refuse to deny
 
02:22:23.809 --> 02:22:23.819 align:start position:0%
oppressive historic periods encourage
 
02:22:25.849 --> 02:22:25.859 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment of difficult race
 
02:22:28.910 --> 02:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
relations so that this all may serve to
 
02:22:31.849 --> 02:22:31.859 align:start position:0%
move our society toward racial fairness
 
02:22:35.510 --> 02:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
and authentic cross-race relations HP 61
 
02:22:37.010 --> 02:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
is a big step in the right direction
 
02:22:39.530 --> 02:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there any
 
02:22:42.530 --> 02:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
questions for the presenter
 
02:22:44.330 --> 02:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
is that written testimony right there
 
02:22:46.670 --> 02:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
02:22:59.230 --> 02:22:59.240 align:start position:0%

finally

02:23:00.790 --> 02:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
finally
 
02:23:05.150 --> 02:23:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:08.150 --> 02:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
um as you can see
 
02:23:10.370 --> 02:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
um based on comments that have been said
 
02:23:14.090 --> 02:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
today and had to um kind of amend what I
 
02:23:16.429 --> 02:23:16.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to say and I am going to read
 
02:23:19.070 --> 02:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
from it so that hopefully I won't ramble
 
02:23:20.929 --> 02:23:20.939 align:start position:0%
around like people and say a lot of
 
02:23:20.939 --> 02:23:21.770 align:start position:0%
around like people and say a lot of
crazy

02:23:21.770 --> 02:23:21.780 align:start position:0%
crazy
 
02:23:25.670 --> 02:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
personal antidotes my background is yes
 
02:23:27.410 --> 02:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
my name is Ronnie Harding I live in
 
02:23:30.410 --> 02:23:30.420 align:start position:0%
Wolfeboro I'm a recently retired teacher
 
02:23:33.050 --> 02:23:33.060 align:start position:0%
I have a BS degree in curriculum and
 
02:23:34.730 --> 02:23:34.740 align:start position:0%
instruction a master's degree in
 
02:23:38.270 --> 02:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
education leadership and supervision I'm
 
02:23:40.910 --> 02:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
also a certified reading specialist and
 
02:23:44.929 --> 02:23:44.939 align:start position:0%
an ESL or Esau specialist I taught for
 
02:23:49.070 --> 02:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
36 years and my last 15 years most
 
02:23:51.070 --> 02:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
recently were in a title one
 
02:23:54.889 --> 02:23:54.899 align:start position:0%
Multicultural school it was 80 percent
 
02:23:57.290 --> 02:23:57.300 align:start position:0%
Black and Hispanic
 
02:24:00.190 --> 02:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
I am totally against
 
02:24:03.950 --> 02:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
hb61 which probably shocks you since I'm
 
02:24:04.969 --> 02:24:04.979 align:start position:0%
a teacher
 
02:24:07.190 --> 02:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
I feel like this is an attempt to
 
02:24:08.750 --> 02:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
promote the use of divisive
 
02:24:11.030 --> 02:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
discriminatory Concepts lessons in
 
02:24:14.570 --> 02:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
terminology in New Hampshire classrooms
 
02:24:17.630 --> 02:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
I believe that no child no student no
 
02:24:20.210 --> 02:24:20.220 align:start position:0%
human being should be instructed or
 
02:24:23.090 --> 02:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
treated as if they are superior inferior
 
02:24:26.030 --> 02:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
privileged or oppressed because of their
 
02:24:28.309 --> 02:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
race religion ethnicity or gender
 
02:24:31.070 --> 02:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
there's absolutely no benefit in doing
 
02:24:33.950 --> 02:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
this it's very much violation of the
 
02:24:36.410 --> 02:24:36.420 align:start position:0%
wise old admonition to not judge a book
 
02:24:39.050 --> 02:24:39.060 align:start position:0%
by its cover and there is no research
 
02:24:41.929 --> 02:24:41.939 align:start position:0%
that says the CRT type education is a
 
02:24:43.070 --> 02:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
best practice
 
02:24:45.530 --> 02:24:45.540 align:start position:0%
Educators in particular should be the
 
02:24:47.889 --> 02:24:47.899 align:start position:0%
ultimate role models for demonstrating
 
02:24:50.450 --> 02:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
positivity and acknowledging every
 
02:24:53.150 --> 02:24:53.160 align:start position:0%
student's uniqueness this requires not
 
02:24:55.550 --> 02:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
labeling students or making any
 
02:24:57.590 --> 02:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
judgments or assumptions in the
 
02:25:00.050 --> 02:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
classroom which are discriminatory a
 
02:25:01.610 --> 02:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
good teacher is able to treat every
 
02:25:04.190 --> 02:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
person as a unique individual their
 
02:25:06.710 --> 02:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
focus should be on learning and academic
 
02:25:06.720 --> 02:25:08.410 align:start position:0%
focus should be on learning and academic
success

02:25:08.410 --> 02:25:08.420 align:start position:0%
success
 
02:25:11.929 --> 02:25:11.939 align:start position:0%
RSA 193.40 which some of you are trying
 
02:25:14.510 --> 02:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
to repeal grants the assurance that
 
02:25:17.150 --> 02:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
every student can be treated as the
 
02:25:19.490 --> 02:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
special unique human that they are and
 
02:25:22.490 --> 02:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
not as a created identity group contrary
 
02:25:25.309 --> 02:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
to the misinformation claim today I
 
02:25:27.650 --> 02:25:27.660 align:start position:0%
could find nothing in this RSA that
 
02:25:29.510 --> 02:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
prohibited the teaching of any
 
02:25:32.090 --> 02:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
historical facts or events that may
 
02:25:33.950 --> 02:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
involve people of different races or
 
02:25:36.530 --> 02:25:36.540 align:start position:0%
cultures it does however prevent
 
02:25:38.870 --> 02:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
prohibit making unwarranted assumptions
 
02:25:41.150 --> 02:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
about students and using those
 
02:25:43.370 --> 02:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
assumptions to discriminate in a school
 
02:25:43.380 --> 02:25:45.290 align:start position:0%
assumptions to discriminate in a school
setting

02:25:45.290 --> 02:25:45.300 align:start position:0%
setting
 
02:25:46.969 --> 02:25:46.979 align:start position:0%
um this seems to bother some of the
 
02:25:50.030 --> 02:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
teachers here and I find that very sad
 
02:25:52.969 --> 02:25:52.979 align:start position:0%
I feel that the bill is not confusing in
 
02:25:55.010 --> 02:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
fact it's quite specific
 
02:25:57.410 --> 02:25:57.420 align:start position:0%
I feel that Educators should be similar
 
02:26:01.370 --> 02:26:01.380 align:start position:0%
to doctors Do no harm dividing labeling
 
02:26:03.830 --> 02:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
and making assumptions about students is
 
02:26:05.389 --> 02:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
inherently harmful
 
02:26:08.090 --> 02:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
and for those of you that are really
 
02:26:11.510 --> 02:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
intent upon dwelling in the past one of
 
02:26:13.429 --> 02:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
my favorite quotes is that there's a
 
02:26:15.770 --> 02:26:15.780 align:start position:0%
reason our windshield before us is so
 
02:26:18.110 --> 02:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
large and the rearview mirror is so
 
02:26:22.969 --> 02:26:22.979 align:start position:0%
small I ask that you not pass hb61 and I
 
02:26:24.770 --> 02:26:24.780 align:start position:0%
feel that it's based upon nothing but
 
02:26:28.190 --> 02:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
false allegations thank you
 
02:26:30.830 --> 02:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions of the
 
02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:32.389 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions of the

thank you so much for having me thank
 
02:27:01.190 --> 02:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
you for your time I will try to be
 
02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:03.230 align:start position:0%
you for your time I will try to be
concise

02:27:03.230 --> 02:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
concise
 
02:27:05.150 --> 02:27:05.160 align:start position:0%
it's not my strong point so I ask for
 
02:27:07.790 --> 02:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
your forgiveness ahead
 
02:27:10.670 --> 02:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
um yes my name is Journey Lafond I am a
 
02:27:14.210 --> 02:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
therapist I am a resident of Concord New
 
02:27:16.910 --> 02:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh for several years I've had
 
02:27:18.730 --> 02:27:18.740 align:start position:0%
the pleasure of serving this community
 
02:27:21.170 --> 02:27:21.180 align:start position:0%
especially as family and its youth both
 
02:27:22.309 --> 02:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
through the community mental health
 
02:27:25.790 --> 02:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:29.510 --> 02:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
um to get into it there appears to be
 
02:27:33.530 --> 02:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
fear among New Hampshire residents and
 
02:27:35.330 --> 02:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
Americans in general
 
02:27:38.270 --> 02:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
that so-called divisive Concepts such as
 
02:27:41.389 --> 02:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
critical race Theory or the discussion
 
02:27:44.030 --> 02:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
of oppressive symptoms are merely
 
02:27:47.530 --> 02:27:47.540 align:start position:0%
attempts to either admonish or divide
 
02:27:50.929 --> 02:27:50.939 align:start position:0%
based on race or their own status as
 
02:27:53.290 --> 02:27:53.300 align:start position:0%
patriotic Americans
 
02:27:56.270 --> 02:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
the issue that we appear to be having is
 
02:27:56.280 --> 02:27:57.950 align:start position:0%
the issue that we appear to be having is
that

02:27:57.950 --> 02:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:28:00.830 --> 02:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
some Americans are unable to separate
 
02:28:02.929 --> 02:28:02.939 align:start position:0%
themselves their identities as
 
02:28:06.950 --> 02:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
individuals from that of American social
 
02:28:06.960 --> 02:28:08.929 align:start position:0%
individuals from that of American social
institutions

02:28:08.929 --> 02:28:08.939 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
02:28:11.750 --> 02:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
this group believes themselves to be the
 
02:28:13.490 --> 02:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
system and are therefore perpetuating
 
02:28:15.469 --> 02:28:15.479 align:start position:0%
the very issues which are so worth
 
02:28:19.070 --> 02:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
discussing especially in the classroom
 
02:28:20.929 --> 02:28:20.939 align:start position:0%
there are others who believe that
 
02:28:23.389 --> 02:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
America is now an equitable democracy
 
02:28:25.610 --> 02:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
when in fact it remains exceedingly
 
02:28:28.490 --> 02:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
unfair and unequitable to many
 
02:28:30.950 --> 02:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
this fact then becomes normative without
 
02:28:33.770 --> 02:28:33.780 align:start position:0%
the discussion to the point I fear of
 
02:28:36.110 --> 02:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
going completely unrecognized
 
02:28:39.950 --> 02:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
to be frank CRT does not suggest that
 
02:28:42.170 --> 02:28:42.180 align:start position:0%
white people today are directly
 
02:28:44.090 --> 02:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
responsible for America's problematic
 
02:28:47.210 --> 02:28:47.220 align:start position:0%
past however it does highlight a moral
 
02:28:50.870 --> 02:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility to confront racism and to
 
02:28:53.929 --> 02:28:53.939 align:start position:0%
that end sexism queer phobia ableism and
 
02:28:55.969 --> 02:28:55.979 align:start position:0%
discrimination in general
 
02:28:59.030 --> 02:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
any Apollo any policy attempting to
 
02:29:01.010 --> 02:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
suffocate these conversations stands in
 
02:29:02.990 --> 02:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
the way of an equitable democracy for us
 
02:29:04.849 --> 02:29:04.859 align:start position:0%
and for our children
 
02:29:07.190 --> 02:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
and to address the question that has
 
02:29:09.650 --> 02:29:09.660 align:start position:0%
continued to come up today
 
02:29:12.110 --> 02:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
laws can be read one way and interpreted
 
02:29:15.770 --> 02:29:15.780 align:start position:0%
another way and it's the ambiguity I
 
02:29:18.770 --> 02:29:18.780 align:start position:0%
fear that presents the danger so to be
 
02:29:21.770 --> 02:29:21.780 align:start position:0%
extremely clear I am in support of hb61
 
02:29:23.630 --> 02:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for your time
 
02:29:25.130 --> 02:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
02:29:27.170 --> 02:29:27.180 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:29:31.010 --> 02:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:46.070 --> 02:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:46.080 --> 02:29:51.130 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

02:29:51.130 --> 02:29:51.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:54.050 --> 02:29:54.060 align:start position:0%
hello okay here we go I was gonna say
 
02:29:56.270 --> 02:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
I'm loud not that loud
 
02:29:58.490 --> 02:29:58.500 align:start position:0%
um I am here as a state representative
 
02:30:01.429 --> 02:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
but also as a mom a mom who homeschooled
 
02:30:02.990 --> 02:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
my two boys for a year in elementary
 
02:30:05.330 --> 02:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
school and if my curriculum was
 
02:30:07.370 --> 02:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
scrutinized I'm not really sure how
 
02:30:09.590 --> 02:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
everyone would feel about it
 
02:30:11.330 --> 02:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
um but I believe that teaching my
 
02:30:13.910 --> 02:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
children the truth an accurate account
 
02:30:16.130 --> 02:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
of our country's Origins starting with
 
02:30:17.750 --> 02:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
the indigenous people whose land was
 
02:30:19.670 --> 02:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
ravaged and whose culture was destroyed
 
02:30:21.469 --> 02:30:21.479 align:start position:0%
so that's what I did
 
02:30:23.450 --> 02:30:23.460 align:start position:0%
my ancestors
 
02:30:25.550 --> 02:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
Mayflower people
 
02:30:27.710 --> 02:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
took part in this
 
02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
while stating that does not evoke a
 
02:30:32.030 --> 02:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
sense of Pride it certainly doesn't make
 
02:30:35.510 --> 02:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
me feel ashamed
 
02:30:37.250 --> 02:30:37.260 align:start position:0%
with limited time I'm just going to
 
02:30:39.170 --> 02:30:39.180 align:start position:0%
shorten it up I'm going to respond to
 
02:30:40.730 --> 02:30:40.740 align:start position:0%
the question I've heard reported I've
 
02:30:42.530 --> 02:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
heard repeated here today
 
02:30:44.770 --> 02:30:44.780 align:start position:0%
I keep hearing essentially that this
 
02:30:47.870 --> 02:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
bill's language is innocuous that there
 
02:30:50.510 --> 02:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
is no harm and that it seeks to create a
 
02:30:52.070 --> 02:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
colorblind Society
 
02:30:55.190 --> 02:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
it is indeed an unnecessary Bill and it
 
02:30:57.349 --> 02:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
would seem an unpopular one as evidenced
 
02:30:59.330 --> 02:30:59.340 align:start position:0%
by the fact that it was added into the
 
02:31:01.730 --> 02:31:01.740 align:start position:0%
budget rather than standing on its own
 
02:31:01.740 --> 02:31:02.750 align:start position:0%
budget rather than standing on its own
Merit

02:31:02.750 --> 02:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
Merit
 
02:31:04.910 --> 02:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
the real question is what was the point
 
02:31:06.469 --> 02:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
of it
 
02:31:08.090 --> 02:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
what was the point of passing an
 
02:31:11.090 --> 02:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and unpopular bill and we
 
02:31:13.670 --> 02:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
can see that in its impact
 
02:31:16.190 --> 02:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
fortunately we have not seen cases yet
 
02:31:18.050 --> 02:31:18.060 align:start position:0%
and to be fair we really wouldn't
 
02:31:19.790 --> 02:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
because there wasn't a problem with this
 
02:31:21.650 --> 02:31:21.660 align:start position:0%
in the first place
 
02:31:24.650 --> 02:31:24.660 align:start position:0%
but we have seen extreme scrutiny and
 
02:31:26.389 --> 02:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
unrest in school board meetings around
 
02:31:28.550 --> 02:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
curriculum attacks on our teachers
 
02:31:30.469 --> 02:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
school board members and public servants
 
02:31:32.690 --> 02:31:32.700 align:start position:0%
in the name of so-called divisive
 
02:31:35.510 --> 02:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
Concepts we have seen the chill the
 
02:31:37.370 --> 02:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
removal of books that many in my
 
02:31:39.290 --> 02:31:39.300 align:start position:0%
generation hold dear
 
02:31:41.809 --> 02:31:41.819 align:start position:0%
we've heard teachers Express deep
 
02:31:43.910 --> 02:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
concern in fear in approaching topics
 
02:31:46.070 --> 02:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
which are essential to a child's
 
02:31:47.630 --> 02:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
comprehensive understanding of our
 
02:31:50.990 --> 02:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
history and of human nature
 
02:31:53.270 --> 02:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
in my district I see the manifestation
 
02:31:56.750 --> 02:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
of unrestrained hate in our schools
 
02:31:59.210 --> 02:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
our children have been through a lot in
 
02:32:00.770 --> 02:32:00.780 align:start position:0%
their manifestation
 
02:32:02.330 --> 02:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
is coming out
 
02:32:07.130 --> 02:32:07.140 align:start position:0%
ignorance of racism and of homophobia
 
02:32:09.770 --> 02:32:09.780 align:start position:0%
in the name of reducing division
 
02:32:13.010 --> 02:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
that this bill purports of relieving
 
02:32:15.889 --> 02:32:15.899 align:start position:0%
guilt of creating a colorblind Utopia
 
02:32:19.030 --> 02:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
this bill in fact invites contention
 
02:32:22.010 --> 02:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
Erasure and Division
 
02:32:24.710 --> 02:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
I urge you to support hb61 thank you
 
02:32:26.389 --> 02:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
02:32:28.070 --> 02:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:32:30.650 --> 02:32:30.660 align:start position:0%
I'll see you thank you
 
02:32:32.929 --> 02:32:32.939 align:start position:0%
next person is
 
02:32:35.510 --> 02:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative I didn't realize that
 
02:32:36.830 --> 02:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
you're in this bundle here represent
 
02:32:40.849 --> 02:32:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:43.309 --> 02:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
from Keen
 
02:32:45.469 --> 02:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you to
 
02:32:47.389 --> 02:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh special
 
02:32:49.190 --> 02:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
thanks to members of the public who are
 
02:32:52.610 --> 02:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
here to testify today and also to uh the
 
02:32:54.830 --> 02:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
scores of teachers who are working hard
 
02:32:57.110 --> 02:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
with our children in classrooms right
 
02:32:59.570 --> 02:32:59.580 align:start position:0%
now who I know filled out uh online
 
02:33:01.370 --> 02:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
testimony that the committee will have
 
02:33:04.849 --> 02:33:04.859 align:start position:0%
the opportunity uh to see I am a
 
02:33:07.190 --> 02:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative from Keene I am also a
 
02:33:09.170 --> 02:33:09.180 align:start position:0%
professional historian an academic
 
02:33:11.570 --> 02:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
historian and I want to address uh
 
02:33:13.370 --> 02:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
specifically the question that some of
 
02:33:14.809 --> 02:33:14.819 align:start position:0%
the community members have raised about
 
02:33:17.450 --> 02:33:17.460 align:start position:0%
what it is about the current law that
 
02:33:19.969 --> 02:33:19.979 align:start position:0%
inhibits or prohibits teachers from
 
02:33:22.910 --> 02:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
being able to do their jobs
 
02:33:25.790 --> 02:33:25.800 align:start position:0%
much of the drama around how U.S history
 
02:33:27.950 --> 02:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
is taught results from a
 
02:33:30.130 --> 02:33:30.140 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding about the nature of
 
02:33:33.530 --> 02:33:33.540 align:start position:0%
systemic racism and what that term
 
02:33:35.990 --> 02:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
systemic racism means
 
02:33:38.330 --> 02:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
we know for example that the origins of
 
02:33:41.630 --> 02:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
policing in the American South grew out
 
02:33:44.750 --> 02:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
in slave Patrols in the 19th century we
 
02:33:47.330 --> 02:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
know that the organization the creation
 
02:33:50.690 --> 02:33:50.700 align:start position:0%
and organization of police forces in
 
02:33:52.730 --> 02:33:52.740 align:start position:0%
Northern cities in the United States was
 
02:33:55.309 --> 02:33:55.319 align:start position:0%
a direct response to the great migration
 
02:33:57.230 --> 02:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
of black Americans out of the South
 
02:34:00.650 --> 02:34:00.660 align:start position:0%
fleeing lynching in the 1920s and the
 
02:34:04.670 --> 02:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
1930s we also know that after World War
 
02:34:04.680 --> 02:34:05.870 align:start position:0%
1930s we also know that after World War
II

02:34:05.870 --> 02:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
II
 
02:34:09.469 --> 02:34:09.479 align:start position:0%
uh the Veterans Administration engaged
 
02:34:12.230 --> 02:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
in inequitable distribution of resources
 
02:34:15.170 --> 02:34:15.180 align:start position:0%
around home loans for veterans which
 
02:34:17.570 --> 02:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
meant that black veterans did not
 
02:34:19.250 --> 02:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
receive the resources that white
 
02:34:21.650 --> 02:34:21.660 align:start position:0%
veterans did that leads over generations
 
02:34:25.550 --> 02:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
to a major difference in terms of the
 
02:34:27.230 --> 02:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
accumulation of wealth between the
 
02:34:29.210 --> 02:34:29.220 align:start position:0%
families of those white veterans and
 
02:34:31.490 --> 02:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
black veterans all of whom violently
 
02:34:33.530 --> 02:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
served our country
 
02:34:36.170 --> 02:34:36.180 align:start position:0%
we also know that the penal system in
 
02:34:37.389 --> 02:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
the south
 
02:34:39.889 --> 02:34:39.899 align:start position:0%
which was then exported to much the rest
 
02:34:43.730 --> 02:34:43.740 align:start position:0%
of the country uh was a large part of an
 
02:34:46.070 --> 02:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
effort to effectively re-enslaved free
 
02:34:49.849 --> 02:34:49.859 align:start position:0%
people through the mass incarceration of
 
02:34:53.929 --> 02:34:53.939 align:start position:0%
blacks on farms where they were forced
 
02:34:58.370 --> 02:34:58.380 align:start position:0%
into labor to to benefit uh the states
 
02:35:00.710 --> 02:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
and private employers
 
02:35:02.630 --> 02:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
we know that redlining which was
 
02:35:04.250 --> 02:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
referred to earlier was a common
 
02:35:06.950 --> 02:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
practice which again prevented uh black
 
02:35:08.630 --> 02:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
families in the United States from
 
02:35:10.550 --> 02:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
buying homes and accumulating the wealth
 
02:35:12.889 --> 02:35:12.899 align:start position:0%
uh that whites were able to uh
 
02:35:14.809 --> 02:35:14.819 align:start position:0%
accumulate and we all know of course
 
02:35:18.290 --> 02:35:18.300 align:start position:0%
that all of our homes rest on land that
 
02:35:20.809 --> 02:35:20.819 align:start position:0%
was stolen from native peoples our
 
02:35:23.809 --> 02:35:23.819 align:start position:0%
financial security as homeowners in this
 
02:35:26.990 --> 02:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
state rests on the fact this land was
 
02:35:28.550 --> 02:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
taken from the people who rightfully
 
02:35:30.889 --> 02:35:30.899 align:start position:0%
owned it in the first place now to say
 
02:35:34.070 --> 02:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
that we all as white Americans benefit
 
02:35:36.889 --> 02:35:36.899 align:start position:0%
from those systems that were designed to
 
02:35:40.010 --> 02:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
perpetuate racial inequality is not the
 
02:35:42.110 --> 02:35:42.120 align:start position:0%
same as saying that white people are
 
02:35:44.450 --> 02:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
inherently racist but there were those
 
02:35:46.849 --> 02:35:46.859 align:start position:0%
who will argue based upon the vague
 
02:35:49.370 --> 02:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
language of this law that that's exactly
 
02:35:52.190 --> 02:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
what it does if a student goes home to a
 
02:35:54.950 --> 02:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
parent or a parent feels that teaching
 
02:35:57.290 --> 02:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
about these systemic inequalities in our
 
02:35:59.630 --> 02:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
system is effectively saying that white
 
02:36:01.730 --> 02:36:01.740 align:start position:0%
people are guilty and it opens teachers
 
02:36:03.770 --> 02:36:03.780 align:start position:0%
up to this response representative thank
 
02:36:05.330 --> 02:36:05.340 align:start position:0%
you I just went very quickly I'm a
 
02:36:07.610 --> 02:36:07.620 align:start position:0%
German historian and I cannot imagine
 
02:36:09.650 --> 02:36:09.660 align:start position:0%
for the life of me that a bill like this
 
02:36:11.510 --> 02:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
would ever be introduced in Germany
 
02:36:13.370 --> 02:36:13.380 align:start position:0%
today thank you very much for your
 
02:36:13.380 --> 02:36:15.590 align:start position:0%
today thank you very much for your
testimony

02:36:15.590 --> 02:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:36:18.530 --> 02:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
um we have about 45 minutes left of
 
02:36:20.450 --> 02:36:20.460 align:start position:0%
bills here so some of those that are on
 
02:36:22.130 --> 02:36:22.140 align:start position:0%
the committee here we have another bill
 
02:36:25.610 --> 02:36:25.620 align:start position:0%
starting up in about that time too so we
 
02:36:27.889 --> 02:36:27.899 align:start position:0%
we ought to take some turns here and
 
02:36:29.870 --> 02:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
going out and getting some lunch and
 
02:36:31.910 --> 02:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
taking a break so as we've done
 
02:36:35.270 --> 02:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
previously those that would like to you
 
02:36:37.490 --> 02:36:37.500 align:start position:0%
know get up and go have something before
 
02:36:40.670 --> 02:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
we start up at one o'clock again and I
 
02:36:43.070 --> 02:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
also have Megan Tuttle come up next here
 
02:36:45.590 --> 02:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
because you may be also testifying at
 
02:36:47.690 --> 02:36:47.700 align:start position:0%
one o'clock so why don't you come
 
02:36:52.910 --> 02:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
forward and we'll we'll keep moving on
 
02:36:55.250 --> 02:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
so don't be bashful if you want to go
 
02:37:02.929 --> 02:37:02.939 align:start position:0%

all students are ready to succeed I'm
 
02:37:46.429 --> 02:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
here today to testify strongly in favor
 
02:37:48.710 --> 02:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 61 a bill that would
 
02:37:50.750 --> 02:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
repeal the ban Concepts law passed in
 
02:37:52.849 --> 02:37:52.859 align:start position:0%
2021 replace it with language that
 
02:37:54.410 --> 02:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
protects our students freedom to learn
 
02:37:56.750 --> 02:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
and Educators ability to give them an
 
02:37:58.730 --> 02:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
education that helps prepare them to
 
02:38:01.190 --> 02:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
succeed since the proposal and Inception
 
02:38:02.750 --> 02:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
of the ban Concepts law that was
 
02:38:05.030 --> 02:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
inserted into house bill 2. and Yea New
 
02:38:06.170 --> 02:38:06.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is held that the Law's
 
02:38:07.429 --> 02:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
vagueness would have a chilling effect
 
02:38:09.889 --> 02:38:09.899 align:start position:0%
on Educators throughout the state after
 
02:38:11.270 --> 02:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
seeing the law in action over the past
 
02:38:13.130 --> 02:38:13.140 align:start position:0%
year and a half our members our students
 
02:38:19.790 --> 02:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:21.290 --> 02:38:21.300 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that's Crossing
 
02:38:22.730 --> 02:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
teachers want to provide our children
 
02:38:24.710 --> 02:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
with the best education they can but the
 
02:38:26.270 --> 02:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
band concept Act is created an
 
02:38:28.070 --> 02:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
environment that limits the context in
 
02:38:30.050 --> 02:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
which kids can learn about history and
 
02:38:31.910 --> 02:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
what books they can read we need to be
 
02:38:34.010 --> 02:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
trusting Educators to ensure that our
 
02:38:36.530 --> 02:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
kids get the best education possible I'm
 
02:38:38.090 --> 02:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
just going to stop for a minute and Echo
 
02:38:39.830 --> 02:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
what has been said previously by
 
02:38:42.710 --> 02:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
teachers by public by parents Etc that
 
02:38:45.170 --> 02:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
are in support of House Bill 61 and not
 
02:38:47.270 --> 02:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
go over the same thing teachers are
 
02:38:48.889 --> 02:38:48.899 align:start position:0%
trained inexperienced in education
 
02:38:50.270 --> 02:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
that's what they go to school for their
 
02:38:51.710 --> 02:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
professionals their professional
 
02:38:54.290 --> 02:38:54.300 align:start position:0%
Educators and they have a duty to set up
 
02:38:55.490 --> 02:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
their students to be successful
 
02:38:57.710 --> 02:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
contributors to society Educators should
 
02:38:59.150 --> 02:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
have the freedom to teach honest
 
02:39:01.670 --> 02:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
complete facts about history and events
 
02:39:03.170 --> 02:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
like slavery and civil rights without
 
02:39:05.030 --> 02:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
being censored and having their licenses
 
02:39:06.770 --> 02:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
and their livelihoods put at risk by
 
02:39:08.870 --> 02:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
vague law the chilling effect that keeps
 
02:39:10.670 --> 02:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
being talked about here today is that
 
02:39:12.650 --> 02:39:12.660 align:start position:0%
educators are fearful that they will
 
02:39:14.690 --> 02:39:14.700 align:start position:0%
have their license taken away because of
 
02:39:17.090 --> 02:39:17.100 align:start position:0%
an interpretation that could be made by
 
02:39:19.429 --> 02:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
somebody in their class House Bill 61
 
02:39:21.110 --> 02:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
restores the ability to provide diverse
 
02:39:22.550 --> 02:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
educational approaches to instruction
 
02:39:24.889 --> 02:39:24.899 align:start position:0%
and curriculum tailored to meet students
 
02:39:26.870 --> 02:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
needs our students deserve the freedom
 
02:39:28.610 --> 02:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
to learn they deserve to be part of an
 
02:39:30.110 --> 02:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
education that helps them learn from the
 
02:39:31.910 --> 02:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
mistakes of the past so they're better
 
02:39:34.790 --> 02:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
prepared to succeed in the future
 
02:39:36.590 --> 02:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
to inhibit New Hampshire's Educators
 
02:39:37.910 --> 02:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
from engaging in the kinds of
 
02:39:39.230 --> 02:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
discussions that help teach and
 
02:39:41.090 --> 02:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
challenge students to use this knowledge
 
02:39:43.250 --> 02:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
to form their own opinions is a
 
02:39:44.929 --> 02:39:44.939 align:start position:0%
disservice to them to the state of New
 
02:39:47.210 --> 02:39:47.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and to our country I'm past
 
02:39:49.250 --> 02:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
behalf of Nea New Hampshire and its
 
02:39:50.809 --> 02:39:50.819 align:start position:0%
membership I respectfully ask that you
 
02:39:53.510 --> 02:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
find House Bill 61 otipass thank you
 
02:39:55.250 --> 02:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
02:39:58.309 --> 02:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
questions for Miss Tuttle yes rappers
 
02:40:01.250 --> 02:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:04.730 --> 02:40:04.740 align:start position:0%
call this the band Concepts law so I'm
 
02:40:06.410 --> 02:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could
 
02:40:08.030 --> 02:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
enlighten me as to what the band
 
02:40:10.730 --> 02:40:10.740 align:start position:0%
concepts are there's we call it band
 
02:40:12.530 --> 02:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
Concepts divisive Concepts House Bill
 
02:40:14.330 --> 02:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
too there's many different names that's
 
02:40:17.210 --> 02:40:17.220 align:start position:0%
one that we took last year from things
 
02:40:19.190 --> 02:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
we were hearing from others but it's the
 
02:40:21.530 --> 02:40:21.540 align:start position:0%
it's the there's nothing in the law so
 
02:40:23.150 --> 02:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
specifically cannot teach something
 
02:40:25.309 --> 02:40:25.319 align:start position:0%
right we've that's been discussed but
 
02:40:26.990 --> 02:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
it's the effect of what could be
 
02:40:29.330 --> 02:40:29.340 align:start position:0%
happening to an educator and that's been
 
02:40:31.849 --> 02:40:31.859 align:start position:0%
provided I mean the woman sitting next
 
02:40:33.770 --> 02:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
to me had an amazing answer to the
 
02:40:35.510 --> 02:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
question so I don't want to say it any
 
02:40:37.849 --> 02:40:37.859 align:start position:0%
different but it's that effect that your
 
02:40:39.770 --> 02:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
license could be taken away because of
 
02:40:41.450 --> 02:40:41.460 align:start position:0%
an interpretation or something that
 
02:40:43.429 --> 02:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
could be happening that that's a very
 
02:40:46.490 --> 02:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
real threat and a very real feeling to
 
02:40:48.170 --> 02:40:48.180 align:start position:0%
the Educators have some have said
 
02:40:50.210 --> 02:40:50.220 align:start position:0%
earlier earlier today in this room and
 
02:40:51.590 --> 02:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
what I've been hearing from my members
 
02:40:53.929 --> 02:40:53.939 align:start position:0%
for the past year thank you
 
02:40:56.210 --> 02:40:56.220 align:start position:0%

02:40:58.849 --> 02:40:58.859 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much I'd like
 
02:41:07.389 --> 02:41:07.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:11.270 --> 02:41:11.280 align:start position:0%

I am a managing partner for a Consulting

practice called organizational ignition
 
02:41:47.750 --> 02:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's one of my hats I also serve as the

the NAACP
 
02:41:54.469 --> 02:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
it's in my personal capacity that I'm
 
02:41:56.270 --> 02:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
here today though
 
02:42:00.469 --> 02:42:00.479 align:start position:0%
uh and would like to just speak to a few
 
02:42:04.190 --> 02:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
points about this bill I rise in support
 
02:42:07.550 --> 02:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
of hb61
 
02:42:13.130 --> 02:42:13.140 align:start position:0%
and I agree with the general approach of
 
02:42:15.050 --> 02:42:15.060 align:start position:0%
the right to freedom from Discrimination
 
02:42:15.060 --> 02:42:17.090 align:start position:0%
the right to freedom from Discrimination
Act

02:42:17.090 --> 02:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
Act
 
02:42:19.550 --> 02:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
children should be taught about the true
 
02:42:19.560 --> 02:42:20.750 align:start position:0%
children should be taught about the true
history

02:42:20.750 --> 02:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
history
 
02:42:25.010 --> 02:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
and nature of the protected classes
 
02:42:27.110 --> 02:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
that are mentioned in
 
02:42:29.870 --> 02:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
that act
 
02:42:32.450 --> 02:42:32.460 align:start position:0%
and that act does allow for and
 
02:42:36.889 --> 02:42:36.899 align:start position:0%
encourage teaching of that true history
 
02:42:36.899 --> 02:42:38.389 align:start position:0%
encourage teaching of that true history
however

02:42:38.389 --> 02:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:42:41.990 --> 02:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
that act fails to consider
 
02:42:43.910 --> 02:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
that racism
 
02:42:47.210 --> 02:42:47.220 align:start position:0%
sexism ageism
 
02:42:50.750 --> 02:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
are actually inherent in our legislation
 
02:42:53.630 --> 02:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
and in our society
 
02:42:55.490 --> 02:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
as evidenced by the systemic
 
02:42:55.500 --> 02:42:57.770 align:start position:0%
as evidenced by the systemic
discrimination

02:42:57.770 --> 02:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
02:43:01.130 --> 02:43:01.140 align:start position:0%
built into our institutions
 
02:43:04.010 --> 02:43:04.020 align:start position:0%
and systems
 
02:43:07.490 --> 02:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
because of our personal biases
 
02:43:09.830 --> 02:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
and the biases that are baked into
 
02:43:12.050 --> 02:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures of our
 
02:43:12.060 --> 02:43:15.710 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures of our
institutions

02:43:15.710 --> 02:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:18.469 --> 02:43:18.479 align:start position:0%
reading from the act itself
 
02:43:23.210 --> 02:43:23.220 align:start position:0%
section 354 a31 Section 3
 
02:43:25.849 --> 02:43:25.859 align:start position:0%
will allow white males to say that
 
02:43:28.429 --> 02:43:28.439 align:start position:0%
they've been adversely cheated
 
02:43:31.610 --> 02:43:31.620 align:start position:0%
if someone from a protected class gets a
 
02:43:34.550 --> 02:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
job over them
 
02:43:39.050 --> 02:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
or gets into a school over them
 
02:43:44.150 --> 02:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:46.070 --> 02:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
section four
 
02:43:48.650 --> 02:43:48.660 align:start position:0%
ignores the fact that there are
 
02:43:51.590 --> 02:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
inequalities in the status of different
 
02:43:51.600 --> 02:43:53.030 align:start position:0%
inequalities in the status of different
groups

02:43:53.030 --> 02:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
groups
 
02:43:56.389 --> 02:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
such that they create a society
 
02:44:00.230 --> 02:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
where people have equal opportunity
 
02:44:03.110 --> 02:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
they must be treated equitably and
 
02:44:04.429 --> 02:44:04.439 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between equal
 
02:44:06.469 --> 02:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
treatment and Equitable treatment it's a
 
02:44:06.479 --> 02:44:07.550 align:start position:0%
treatment and Equitable treatment it's a
nuanced

02:44:07.550 --> 02:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
nuanced
 
02:44:10.010 --> 02:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
difference but equal treatment is where
 
02:44:12.290 --> 02:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
we give everybody the same thing as if
 
02:44:14.870 --> 02:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
they have the same needs
 
02:44:16.849 --> 02:44:16.859 align:start position:0%
Equitable treatment is where we give
 
02:44:19.010 --> 02:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
people what they need because we
 
02:44:23.450 --> 02:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:25.910 --> 02:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
the impact and the impact has been
 
02:44:29.570 --> 02:44:29.580 align:start position:0%
spoken about by many people
 
02:44:31.730 --> 02:44:31.740 align:start position:0%
and the impact of from a teacher's
 
02:44:33.410 --> 02:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
perspective has been spoken about by
 
02:44:34.849 --> 02:44:34.859 align:start position:0%
many people
 
02:44:37.370 --> 02:44:37.380 align:start position:0%
I wonder though if you have heard the
 
02:44:41.090 --> 02:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
impact from an individual high school
 
02:44:41.100 --> 02:44:42.290 align:start position:0%
impact from an individual high school
student

02:44:42.290 --> 02:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
student
 
02:44:45.710 --> 02:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
who had a death threat written on a
 
02:44:48.170 --> 02:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
school wall in a school in New Hampshire
 
02:44:51.410 --> 02:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:54.830 --> 02:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:54.840 --> 02:44:56.450 align:start position:0%
 
froze

02:44:56.450 --> 02:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
froze
 
02:44:58.250 --> 02:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
they did not take action and they're
 
02:45:00.230 --> 02:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
still struggling to figure out what
 
02:45:02.210 --> 02:45:02.220 align:start position:0%
action they can take
 
02:45:06.410 --> 02:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:08.590 --> 02:45:08.600 align:start position:0%
can you please wrap it up quickly
 
02:45:11.690 --> 02:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
absolutely three minutes so
 
02:45:16.070 --> 02:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
with that example of the of the impact
 
02:45:20.929 --> 02:45:20.939 align:start position:0%
of this law I urge you to support HP 61.
 
02:45:23.030 --> 02:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions from the
 
02:45:23.040 --> 02:45:23.990 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions from the
committee

02:45:23.990 --> 02:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:45:28.130 --> 02:45:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:30.290 --> 02:45:30.300 align:start position:0%
next person is uh
 
02:45:34.670 --> 02:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:40.010 --> 02:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:51.670 --> 02:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:54.230 --> 02:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
Bonilla okay thank you yeah you're

02:45:57.240 --> 02:45:59.030 align:start position:0%
welcome uh so uh good afternoon
everybody

02:45:59.030 --> 02:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
02:46:01.910 --> 02:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
all right so here we go so I am a proud
 
02:46:04.429 --> 02:46:04.439 align:start position:0%
Salvadorian and I come from a family of
 
02:46:04.439 --> 02:46:05.630 align:start position:0%
Salvadorian and I come from a family of
immigrants

02:46:05.630 --> 02:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
immigrants
 
02:46:08.090 --> 02:46:08.100 align:start position:0%
um who came to this country by foot and
 
02:46:09.469 --> 02:46:09.479 align:start position:0%
I'm also a school board member in
 
02:46:12.110 --> 02:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire
 
02:46:14.150 --> 02:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
so see I've never been to these chambers
 
02:46:17.210 --> 02:46:17.220 align:start position:0%
before and I look at this committee and
 
02:46:19.370 --> 02:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
it's wild that none of y'all look like
 
02:46:19.380 --> 02:46:20.929 align:start position:0%
it's wild that none of y'all look like
me

02:46:20.929 --> 02:46:20.939 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:46:22.730 --> 02:46:22.740 align:start position:0%
people say that don't bring your
 
02:46:24.469 --> 02:46:24.479 align:start position:0%
politics into the classroom but at the
 
02:46:26.150 --> 02:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
end of the day my own my very own
 
02:46:29.590 --> 02:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:32.210 --> 02:46:32.220 align:start position:0%
this testimony is in favor of House Bill
 
02:46:35.330 --> 02:46:35.340 align:start position:0%
61 and I'm here representing myself
 
02:46:37.429 --> 02:46:37.439 align:start position:0%
I look at the divisive kinds of spell
 
02:46:39.290 --> 02:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
and it's as though the creation of the
 
02:46:43.250 --> 02:46:43.260 align:start position:0%
bill centers white guilt our students or
 
02:46:45.050 --> 02:46:45.060 align:start position:0%
Future Leaders deserve the right to know
 
02:46:47.270 --> 02:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
the real history
 
02:46:49.070 --> 02:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
why are we running away from having
 
02:46:51.710 --> 02:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
critical conversations on Race gender
 
02:46:56.450 --> 02:46:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:58.670 --> 02:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
like why are we moving backwards the
 
02:47:00.469 --> 02:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
demographics in New Hampshire as we all
 
02:47:03.349 --> 02:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
see are slowly changing
 
02:47:05.630 --> 02:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
and it's critical for us to have these
 
02:47:07.550 --> 02:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
conversations as a community and as a
 
02:47:07.560 --> 02:47:08.809 align:start position:0%
conversations as a community and as a
family

02:47:08.809 --> 02:47:08.819 align:start position:0%
family
 
02:47:11.090 --> 02:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
over the past couple years the divisive
 
02:47:13.190 --> 02:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
concept bill has disproportionately
 
02:47:15.410 --> 02:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
impacted are you from the bipod
 
02:47:15.420 --> 02:47:16.790 align:start position:0%
impacted are you from the bipod
community

02:47:16.790 --> 02:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:47:18.770 --> 02:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
it's as though we are telling them that
 
02:47:20.510 --> 02:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
their voices don't matter like Tina
 
02:47:20.520 --> 02:47:22.190 align:start position:0%
their voices don't matter like Tina
mentioned

02:47:22.190 --> 02:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
02:47:24.230 --> 02:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
I heard someone saying that legislator
 
02:47:26.270 --> 02:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
that the legislator is here to protect
 
02:47:28.370 --> 02:47:28.380 align:start position:0%
us but I'm going to be real with y'all
 
02:47:31.130 --> 02:47:31.140 align:start position:0%
it's very hard for me to see that when I
 
02:47:33.290 --> 02:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
when they're barely individuals that
 
02:47:35.929 --> 02:47:35.939 align:start position:0%
look like me being represented
 
02:47:38.389 --> 02:47:38.399 align:start position:0%
we should not be censoring our schools
 
02:47:40.490 --> 02:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
or teachers from having conversations on
 
02:47:40.500 --> 02:47:41.389 align:start position:0%
or teachers from having conversations on
race

02:47:41.389 --> 02:47:41.399 align:start position:0%
race
 
02:47:44.990 --> 02:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
gender and sexual orientation
 
02:47:48.830 --> 02:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
like what are we doing this is 2023 and
 
02:47:50.990 --> 02:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
students deserve the representation of
 
02:47:54.830 --> 02:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:56.330 --> 02:47:56.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
02:47:56.340 --> 02:47:58.070 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
questions

02:47:58.070 --> 02:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:48:00.110 --> 02:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming today
 
02:48:02.750 --> 02:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have come forward Deborah
 
02:48:02.760 --> 02:48:11.830 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have come forward Deborah
Howes

02:48:11.830 --> 02:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:13.849 --> 02:48:13.859 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
02:48:16.190 --> 02:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
good afternoon yes thank you is it good
 
02:48:18.230 --> 02:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
afternoon already
 
02:48:20.210 --> 02:48:20.220 align:start position:0%
um I could pull out my phone and check
 
02:48:21.349 --> 02:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
the time but I believe it is just
 
02:48:23.389 --> 02:48:23.399 align:start position:0%
afternoon okay thank you to your live
 
02:48:25.010 --> 02:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
and members of the education committee I
 
02:48:26.450 --> 02:48:26.460 align:start position:0%
appreciate the chance to address you
 
02:48:28.849 --> 02:48:28.859 align:start position:0%
today my name is Deborah house I am
 
02:48:30.530 --> 02:48:30.540 align:start position:0%
president of the American Federation of
 
02:48:32.750 --> 02:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
teachers New Hampshire we have 4 000
 
02:48:35.990 --> 02:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
members mostly in K-12 public education
 
02:48:38.450 --> 02:48:38.460 align:start position:0%
also University faculty and public
 
02:48:41.809 --> 02:48:41.819 align:start position:0%
employees and I am here today to speak
 
02:48:46.070 --> 02:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly in favor of HB 61
 
02:48:47.809 --> 02:48:47.819 align:start position:0%
repealing these so-called divisive
 
02:48:50.210 --> 02:48:50.220 align:start position:0%
Concepts band
 
02:48:53.510 --> 02:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
um the divisive Concepts law is uh it's
 
02:48:56.270 --> 02:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
a bad law it's unfair to students who
 
02:48:58.670 --> 02:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
deserve to be learning honest history
 
02:49:02.150 --> 02:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
and not censored history they deserve a
 
02:49:05.330 --> 02:49:05.340 align:start position:0%
full and robust public education
 
02:49:07.849 --> 02:49:07.859 align:start position:0%
um they deserve to be reading a wide
 
02:49:10.370 --> 02:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
variety of literature and they don't
 
02:49:13.030 --> 02:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
deserve to have that censored
 
02:49:16.190 --> 02:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
it is intimidated imperative teachers
 
02:49:18.710 --> 02:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
who have an obligation to teach honestly
 
02:49:21.469 --> 02:49:21.479 align:start position:0%
and and fully and without reservation
 
02:49:23.030 --> 02:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
looking over their shoulder all the time
 
02:49:26.389 --> 02:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
it should never have been passed and it
 
02:49:29.210 --> 02:49:29.220 align:start position:0%
should be repealed and I'm not going to
 
02:49:30.889 --> 02:49:30.899 align:start position:0%
read all of my testimony but I'm going
 
02:49:33.410 --> 02:49:33.420 align:start position:0%
to try and illustrate some of the impact
 
02:49:34.610 --> 02:49:34.620 align:start position:0%
of this law because I've heard the
 
02:49:36.469 --> 02:49:36.479 align:start position:0%
question asked again and again you know
 
02:49:38.990 --> 02:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
how does the law that was passed have
 
02:49:41.170 --> 02:49:41.180 align:start position:0%
this impact that you're talking about
 
02:49:44.870 --> 02:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
well the law that was passed
 
02:49:44.880 --> 02:49:46.250 align:start position:0%
well the law that was passed
gave

02:49:46.250 --> 02:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
gave
 
02:49:48.770 --> 02:49:48.780 align:start position:0%
many the impression
 
02:49:52.610 --> 02:49:52.620 align:start position:0%
that it is now illegal
 
02:49:56.050 --> 02:49:56.060 align:start position:0%
to talk about racism sexism
 
02:49:59.150 --> 02:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
and discrimination in Public School
 
02:50:01.849 --> 02:50:01.859 align:start position:0%
classrooms in New Hampshire and even
 
02:50:04.610 --> 02:50:04.620 align:start position:0%
though we will hear arguments that
 
02:50:06.170 --> 02:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
that's nowhere in the text of the law
 
02:50:08.389 --> 02:50:08.399 align:start position:0%
that is the impression out there and
 
02:50:10.849 --> 02:50:10.859 align:start position:0%
some feel emboldened
 
02:50:12.730 --> 02:50:12.740 align:start position:0%
to demand
 
02:50:16.010 --> 02:50:16.020 align:start position:0%
investigations and punishments of
 
02:50:16.020 --> 02:50:17.389 align:start position:0%
investigations and punishments of
teachers

02:50:17.389 --> 02:50:17.399 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
02:50:19.730 --> 02:50:19.740 align:start position:0%
who try and have
 
02:50:22.370 --> 02:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
discussions that should rightfully be
 
02:50:23.990 --> 02:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
part of their curriculums because they
 
02:50:26.030 --> 02:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
are part of this standards that we're
 
02:50:28.070 --> 02:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to teach
 
02:50:30.230 --> 02:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
in their classrooms I'm going to give
 
02:50:32.870 --> 02:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
you a few examples since the passage of
 
02:50:35.150 --> 02:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
the song called divisive Concepts law
 
02:50:37.570 --> 02:50:37.580 align:start position:0%
some Middle School teachers are now
 
02:50:40.490 --> 02:50:40.500 align:start position:0%
questioning whether they can teach To
 
02:50:41.929 --> 02:50:41.939 align:start position:0%
Kill a Mockingbird
 
02:50:45.830 --> 02:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
that is a classic of American literature
 
02:50:48.170 --> 02:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
but it's got some very obvious scene
 
02:50:50.330 --> 02:50:50.340 align:start position:0%
themes of racism in it
 
02:50:52.610 --> 02:50:52.620 align:start position:0%
now you
 
02:50:54.410 --> 02:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
clearly going to be okay teaching the
 
02:50:57.950 --> 02:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:59.750 --> 02:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
has a problem with the discussion around
 
02:51:01.550 --> 02:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
it or what if a student goes home and
 
02:51:04.490 --> 02:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
reports something to a parent and that
 
02:51:08.929 --> 02:51:08.939 align:start position:0%
report gets Tangled Up third hand and
 
02:51:11.210 --> 02:51:11.220 align:start position:0%
third hand reports are enough to start
 
02:51:14.870 --> 02:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:18.710 --> 02:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
a dedicated middle school art teacher
 
02:51:21.530 --> 02:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
works every semester to build a
 
02:51:23.210 --> 02:51:23.220 align:start position:0%
community in her classroom
 
02:51:25.070 --> 02:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
to get to know her students part of what
 
02:51:26.450 --> 02:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
she does is
 
02:51:29.990 --> 02:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
ask them what should I call you
 
02:51:31.849 --> 02:51:31.859 align:start position:0%
someone took offense of that and thought
 
02:51:35.090 --> 02:51:35.100 align:start position:0%
that was an impermissible breach of this
 
02:51:38.270 --> 02:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
device of Concepts law
 
02:51:40.010 --> 02:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
that that was bringing her politics into
 
02:51:41.210 --> 02:51:41.220 align:start position:0%
the classroom
 
02:51:43.550 --> 02:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
by trying to show respect to students
 
02:51:46.010 --> 02:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
and asking what they want to be called
 
02:51:48.650 --> 02:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
demanded an investigation
 
02:51:51.170 --> 02:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
including putting pressure on the Local
 
02:51:52.910 --> 02:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
District by going directly to the
 
02:51:56.630 --> 02:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:59.570 --> 02:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
that teacher was not found I'm sorry
 
02:52:01.309 --> 02:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
that teacher was not found in any breach
 
02:52:03.769 --> 02:52:03.779 align:start position:0%
of the law but because of the pressure
 
02:52:05.630 --> 02:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
in The Witch Hunt atmosphere that
 
02:52:08.750 --> 02:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
teacher has left public education and my
 
02:52:12.469 --> 02:52:12.479 align:start position:0%
third example AP History teacher
 
02:52:14.570 --> 02:52:14.580 align:start position:0%
in her final review with her students
 
02:52:16.849 --> 02:52:16.859 align:start position:0%
before the AP test last spring got that
 
02:52:18.469 --> 02:52:18.479 align:start position:0%
call from the office
 
02:52:21.290 --> 02:52:21.300 align:start position:0%
someone heard you were teaching
 
02:52:22.730 --> 02:52:22.740 align:start position:0%
something that was in violation of this
 
02:52:22.740 --> 02:52:23.450 align:start position:0%
something that was in violation of this
law

02:52:23.450 --> 02:52:23.460 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:52:25.370 --> 02:52:25.380 align:start position:0%
so her review with her students before
 
02:52:28.610 --> 02:52:28.620 align:start position:0%
the AP test this is important for high
 
02:52:30.710 --> 02:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
school students
 
02:52:32.990 --> 02:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
was interrupted
 
02:52:36.410 --> 02:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
to answer an allegation that she taught
 
02:52:38.030 --> 02:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
something that was improvisible she's
 
02:52:40.190 --> 02:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
teaching the approved curriculum meeting
 
02:52:43.730 --> 02:52:43.740 align:start position:0%
the the estate standards for AP History
 
02:52:46.130 --> 02:52:46.140 align:start position:0%
but apparently we can't do that because
 
02:52:49.150 --> 02:52:49.160 align:start position:0%
of the perception that we cannot address
 
02:52:51.650 --> 02:52:51.660 align:start position:0%
reconstruction other things that deal
 
02:52:55.150 --> 02:52:55.160 align:start position:0%
with racism yes so in conclusion
 
02:52:59.090 --> 02:52:59.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students need and New
 
02:53:01.030 --> 02:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire parents want us to teach
 
02:53:03.650 --> 02:53:03.660 align:start position:0%
honestly they want us to do our jobs
 
02:53:05.929 --> 02:53:05.939 align:start position:0%
thoroughly they want a robust public
 
02:53:09.530 --> 02:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
education I urge you to repeal the
 
02:53:11.809 --> 02:53:11.819 align:start position:0%
so-called divisive Concepts law and pass
 
02:53:15.590 --> 02:53:15.600 align:start position:0%

currently serving as the superintendent

Valley region

all combined these three districts
 
02:54:19.309 --> 02:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
represent approximately 1 000 students
 
02:54:21.769 --> 02:54:21.779 align:start position:0%
and their families in New Hampshire
 
02:54:24.469 --> 02:54:24.479 align:start position:0%
I'm addressing you today as the chair of
 
02:54:26.389 --> 02:54:26.399 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire school administrators
 
02:54:28.610 --> 02:54:28.620 align:start position:0%
Association Equity committee

as an educator and instructional leader
 
02:54:33.110 --> 02:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you to support the passage of
 
02:54:36.769 --> 02:54:36.779 align:start position:0%
hb61 to repeal the divisive Concepts law
 
02:54:39.650 --> 02:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
this law is contrary to what we want our
 
02:54:43.250 --> 02:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
schools communities and our state to be
 
02:54:45.590 --> 02:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
one purpose of school is to prepare
 
02:54:48.170 --> 02:54:48.180 align:start position:0%
students for college and work as New
 
02:54:49.910 --> 02:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire seeks to attract businesses
 
02:54:52.010 --> 02:54:52.020 align:start position:0%
it's crucial that the state presents
 
02:54:55.070 --> 02:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
itself as a place open to diversity a
 
02:54:56.750 --> 02:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
place where businesses and the families
 
02:54:59.030 --> 02:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
connected to them feel they belong and
 
02:55:00.530 --> 02:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
that they're included
 
02:55:02.690 --> 02:55:02.700 align:start position:0%
repealing the divisive Concepts law
 
02:55:05.150 --> 02:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
sends a clear message that New Hampshire
 
02:55:07.550 --> 02:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
is a good place to be and that when
 
02:55:10.070 --> 02:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
businesses move here workers will feel
 
02:55:12.170 --> 02:55:12.180 align:start position:0%
at home and their families can send
 
02:55:14.030 --> 02:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
their kids to schools where everyone
 
02:55:14.040 --> 02:55:15.650 align:start position:0%
their kids to schools where everyone
belongs

02:55:15.650 --> 02:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
belongs
 
02:55:18.349 --> 02:55:18.359 align:start position:0%
another purpose of school an essential
 
02:55:21.349 --> 02:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
one is modeling our democracy
 
02:55:24.110 --> 02:55:24.120 align:start position:0%
one of the nhsaa resolutions States the
 
02:55:24.120 --> 02:55:25.030 align:start position:0%
one of the nhsaa resolutions States the
following

02:55:25.030 --> 02:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
following
 
02:55:27.469 --> 02:55:27.479 align:start position:0%
nhsaa opposes legislation that would
 
02:55:29.750 --> 02:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
restrict freedom of intellectual inquiry
 
02:55:32.750 --> 02:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
in the classroom and hsaa believes that
 
02:55:35.570 --> 02:55:35.580 align:start position:0%
patriotism Freedom sound traditional
 
02:55:38.090 --> 02:55:38.100 align:start position:0%
family values and individual ethics are
 
02:55:40.790 --> 02:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
strengthened not weakened through
 
02:55:45.050 --> 02:55:45.060 align:start position:0%
rigorous analysis and thoughtful inquiry
 
02:55:47.630 --> 02:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
our schools offer a safe space where
 
02:55:49.849 --> 02:55:49.859 align:start position:0%
students will learn to have respectful
 
02:55:52.130 --> 02:55:52.140 align:start position:0%
open and thoughtful conversations about
 
02:55:53.570 --> 02:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
important issues
 
02:55:56.030 --> 02:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
ideally this carries through to their
 
02:55:58.730 --> 02:55:58.740 align:start position:0%
adult lives the divisive Concepts law
 
02:56:01.309 --> 02:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
makes teachers feel unclear about
 
02:56:03.830 --> 02:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
facilitating these conversations and
 
02:56:06.050 --> 02:56:06.060 align:start position:0%
many teachers now feel afraid to do this
 
02:56:07.910 --> 02:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
deep and meaningful work within their
 
02:56:09.950 --> 02:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
classrooms this is the chilling effect
 
02:56:12.710 --> 02:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
you've already heard about today and all
 
02:56:15.110 --> 02:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
that this will accomplish the only real
 
02:56:17.450 --> 02:56:17.460 align:start position:0%
effect is diminishing our students
 
02:56:20.030 --> 02:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
future and our Stu our citizens future
 
02:56:22.969 --> 02:56:22.979 align:start position:0%
of their ability to think reason Express
 
02:56:24.849 --> 02:56:24.859 align:start position:0%
themselves and work collaboratively
 
02:56:27.410 --> 02:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with others
 
02:56:31.550 --> 02:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
I work in small rural schools and I have
 
02:56:33.590 --> 02:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
seen firsthand the way that communities
 
02:56:36.230 --> 02:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
can disagree with great thought and
 
02:56:38.389 --> 02:56:38.399 align:start position:0%
respect for one another and still move
 
02:56:40.429 --> 02:56:40.439 align:start position:0%
forward with decisions the way it's
 
02:56:41.570 --> 02:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
supposed to be
 
02:56:44.450 --> 02:56:44.460 align:start position:0%
our schools lay the groundwork for all
 
02:56:46.070 --> 02:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
of that
 
02:56:49.150 --> 02:56:49.160 align:start position:0%
teachers love it when students think
 
02:56:52.429 --> 02:56:52.439 align:start position:0%
especially for themselves and when they
 
02:56:54.410 --> 02:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
can back those thoughts up with data and
 
02:56:57.170 --> 02:56:57.180 align:start position:0%
clear expression throughout my 25 years
 
02:56:59.750 --> 02:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
of experience in public schools I have
 
02:57:01.969 --> 02:57:01.979 align:start position:0%
yet to see any teacher use the classroom
 
02:57:04.670 --> 02:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
to make students think in a particular
 
02:57:06.429 --> 02:57:06.439 align:start position:0%
certain way
 
02:57:08.990 --> 02:57:09.000 align:start position:0%

02:57:11.690 --> 02:57:11.700 align:start position:0%

here in 2003 I'm from Ivory Coast and uh
 
02:59:05.090 --> 02:59:05.100 align:start position:0%
while uh my first my um
 
02:59:09.230 --> 02:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
when I I was in sixth grade I remember a
 
02:59:12.530 --> 02:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
peculiar experience where I was at Rite
 
02:59:12.540 --> 02:59:13.610 align:start position:0%
peculiar experience where I was at Rite
Aid

02:59:13.610 --> 02:59:13.620 align:start position:0%
Aid
 
02:59:17.870 --> 02:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
um run this runlit on on my way
 
02:59:20.469 --> 02:59:20.479 align:start position:0%
um to write it when I was at Rite Aid
 
02:59:25.610 --> 02:59:25.620 align:start position:0%
the I went in the store and the cashier
 
02:59:29.510 --> 02:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
started following me around and
 
02:59:32.870 --> 02:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
and supposing that perhaps I was up to
 
02:59:36.230 --> 02:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
no good and that I was gonna maybe grab
 
02:59:38.570 --> 02:59:38.580 align:start position:0%
a drink or a candy and put it in my
 
02:59:42.469 --> 02:59:42.479 align:start position:0%
pocket and walk out but uh unbeknowing
 
02:59:46.190 --> 02:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
to that cashier there was a another a
 
02:59:49.150 --> 02:59:49.160 align:start position:0%
young gentleman in in the store
 
02:59:52.429 --> 02:59:52.439 align:start position:0%
after she had walked by him
 
02:59:54.830 --> 02:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh him and I were in the same aisle then
 
02:59:58.190 --> 02:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
he stashed a couple of gums and some
 
03:00:00.469 --> 03:00:00.479 align:start position:0%
candy in his pants and walked out and I
 
03:00:05.150 --> 03:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
went and paid for my um for my sweets
 
03:00:07.250 --> 03:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:00:10.849 --> 03:00:10.859 align:start position:0%
I I had no one in in
 
03:00:10.859 --> 03:00:11.570 align:start position:0%
I I had no one in in
um

03:00:11.570 --> 03:00:11.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:15.349 --> 03:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
in in my sixth grade classroom to talk
 
03:00:17.450 --> 03:00:17.460 align:start position:0%
about that experience with and the only
 
03:00:19.429 --> 03:00:19.439 align:start position:0%
person that I felt comfortable enough
 
03:00:22.730 --> 03:00:22.740 align:start position:0%
was my fifth grade teacher
 
03:00:24.710 --> 03:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
um Mr G
 
03:00:26.690 --> 03:00:26.700 align:start position:0%
and at the time
 
03:00:29.750 --> 03:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
um him and I I would constantly go over
 
03:00:33.349 --> 03:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
um from runland across to Conan which I
 
03:00:36.650 --> 03:00:36.660 align:start position:0%
I believe now is um either Abbott
 
03:00:36.660 --> 03:00:38.269 align:start position:0%
I believe now is um either Abbott
Downing

03:00:38.269 --> 03:00:38.279 align:start position:0%
Downing
 
03:00:40.190 --> 03:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
um I would go over and we would talk
 
03:00:40.200 --> 03:00:41.510 align:start position:0%
um I would go over and we would talk
about

03:00:41.510 --> 03:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:00:41.520 --> 03:00:42.050 align:start position:0%
about
um

03:00:42.050 --> 03:00:42.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:42.060 --> 03:00:43.670 align:start position:0%
um
what

03:00:43.670 --> 03:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:00:48.050 --> 03:00:48.060 align:start position:0%
it is like living in in Two Worlds or
 
03:00:50.929 --> 03:00:50.939 align:start position:0%
what it's like experiencing a racism
 
03:00:53.150 --> 03:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
because as a young man I didn't know
 
03:00:54.889 --> 03:00:54.899 align:start position:0%
what it was and
 
03:00:57.370 --> 03:00:57.380 align:start position:0%
um and quite frankly I was blind to it
 
03:01:00.290 --> 03:01:00.300 align:start position:0%
until we started having these
 
03:01:00.300 --> 03:01:02.630 align:start position:0%
until we started having these
conversations

03:01:02.630 --> 03:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
03:01:02.640 --> 03:01:04.250 align:start position:0%
conversations
um

03:01:04.250 --> 03:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:07.730 --> 03:01:07.740 align:start position:0%
now that you know I'm out of college and
 
03:01:11.210 --> 03:01:11.220 align:start position:0%
I've experienced life a little more
 
03:01:14.269 --> 03:01:14.279 align:start position:0%
um I still keep in contact with my fifth
 
03:01:15.710 --> 03:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
grade teacher
 
03:01:15.720 --> 03:01:16.730 align:start position:0%
grade teacher
um

03:01:16.730 --> 03:01:16.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:19.969 --> 03:01:19.979 align:start position:0%
artifact we talked constantly and also
 
03:01:23.690 --> 03:01:23.700 align:start position:0%
my second grade teacher and as well as
 
03:01:23.700 --> 03:01:24.230 align:start position:0%
my second grade teacher and as well as
um

03:01:24.230 --> 03:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:24.240 --> 03:01:26.210 align:start position:0%
um
uh

03:01:26.210 --> 03:01:26.220 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:01:28.849 --> 03:01:28.859 align:start position:0%
the crtc
 
03:01:30.170 --> 03:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
um uh uh
 
03:01:33.650 --> 03:01:33.660 align:start position:0%
um vice president who I consider my
 
03:01:33.660 --> 03:01:34.990 align:start position:0%
um vice president who I consider my
mentor

03:01:34.990 --> 03:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
mentor
 
03:01:37.190 --> 03:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
we talk about
 
03:01:39.950 --> 03:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
the struggles that our teachers are
 
03:01:42.550 --> 03:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
going through right now concerning
 
03:01:45.070 --> 03:01:45.080 align:start position:0%
this specific bill
 
03:01:49.490 --> 03:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
which is the bill that unlimits folks
 
03:01:51.110 --> 03:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
from having conversation in the
 
03:01:53.870 --> 03:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
classroom about the hard things that
 
03:01:55.790 --> 03:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
they might not be able to talk about
 
03:01:57.889 --> 03:01:57.899 align:start position:0%
outside of the classroom because maybe
 
03:02:00.110 --> 03:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
Mom and Dad might not be experienced
 
03:02:03.230 --> 03:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
around the co uh the conversation as
 
03:02:05.030 --> 03:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
whereas in the classroom setting there's
 
03:02:07.130 --> 03:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
that structure where they are able to
 
03:02:10.429 --> 03:02:10.439 align:start position:0%
have those conversations I recently can
 
03:02:12.410 --> 03:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
I try to wrap it up I'll wrap it up
 
03:02:15.530 --> 03:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
right now I recently heard
 
03:02:15.540 --> 03:02:17.050 align:start position:0%
right now I recently heard
um

03:02:17.050 --> 03:02:17.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:21.650 --> 03:02:21.660 align:start position:0%
uh that teachers are afraid to even uh
 
03:02:23.929 --> 03:02:23.939 align:start position:0%
talk about Martin Luther King's day
 
03:02:27.010 --> 03:02:27.020 align:start position:0%
which is a holiday here in New Hampshire
 
03:02:32.090 --> 03:02:32.100 align:start position:0%
and if that's if that is what this uh
 
03:02:33.889 --> 03:02:33.899 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
03:02:39.230 --> 03:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
is you know perpetuating then you know
 
03:02:41.389 --> 03:02:41.399 align:start position:0%
it has to be scrapped and so that's why
 
03:02:43.429 --> 03:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to testify and share my
 
03:02:45.490 --> 03:02:45.500 align:start position:0%
story with you that I'm in support of
 
03:02:48.050 --> 03:02:48.060 align:start position:0%

Frank

03:03:02.110 --> 03:03:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:11.330 --> 03:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:13.130 --> 03:03:13.140 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee
 
03:03:14.269 --> 03:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the opportunity to
 
03:03:16.370 --> 03:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
testify my name is Frankie Knack I'm the
 
03:03:18.230 --> 03:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
policy director with the ACLU of New
 
03:03:20.150 --> 03:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we are here in strong
 
03:03:23.389 --> 03:03:23.399 align:start position:0%
support of HB 61. you've already heard
 
03:03:25.550 --> 03:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
from multiple people about how the real
 
03:03:26.929 --> 03:03:26.939 align:start position:0%
world implications of how the current
 
03:03:29.269 --> 03:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
law impacts and restricts the ability of
 
03:03:30.650 --> 03:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
teachers to give our students a full
 
03:03:32.330 --> 03:03:32.340 align:start position:0%
picture of American History both the
 
03:03:34.550 --> 03:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
good and the bad I want to really focus
 
03:03:36.889 --> 03:03:36.899 align:start position:0%
on hopefully clarifying some of the
 
03:03:38.090 --> 03:03:38.100 align:start position:0%
questions that have been raised about
 
03:03:39.769 --> 03:03:39.779 align:start position:0%
you know what is in this current
 
03:03:42.530 --> 03:03:42.540 align:start position:0%
language that's so problematic and it's
 
03:03:44.090 --> 03:03:44.100 align:start position:0%
really you know this has been somewhat
 
03:03:45.650 --> 03:03:45.660 align:start position:0%
touch to bond but I want to drill into
 
03:03:47.330 --> 03:03:47.340 align:start position:0%
it a little bit and it's really two
 
03:03:49.429 --> 03:03:49.439 align:start position:0%
aspects it's the vagueness and it's the
 
03:03:49.439 --> 03:03:51.050 align:start position:0%
aspects it's the vagueness and it's the
penalties

03:03:51.050 --> 03:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
03:03:52.910 --> 03:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
right now there's
 
03:03:55.130 --> 03:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
um it's very unclear in terms of what
 
03:03:57.710 --> 03:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
what uh the divisive con with the what
 
03:03:59.929 --> 03:03:59.939 align:start position:0%
the law actually uh says in terms of how
 
03:04:02.210 --> 03:04:02.220 align:start position:0%
it impacts and multiple courts haven't
 
03:04:04.550 --> 03:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
joined similarly worded statutes both in
 
03:04:06.590 --> 03:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
federal court and the state court on
 
03:04:08.929 --> 03:04:08.939 align:start position:0%
Magnus grounds in addition there have
 
03:04:11.389 --> 03:04:11.399 align:start position:0%
been efforts to get the state to clarify
 
03:04:14.750 --> 03:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
what specific texts are are and or are
 
03:04:16.969 --> 03:04:16.979 align:start position:0%
problematic and the state has refused to
 
03:04:19.550 --> 03:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
do so and so the effect of that is it
 
03:04:21.469 --> 03:04:21.479 align:start position:0%
invites arbitrary and discriminatory
 
03:04:24.050 --> 03:04:24.060 align:start position:0%
enforcement and that enforcement is
 
03:04:26.090 --> 03:04:26.100 align:start position:0%
quite severe and includes loss of
 
03:04:28.190 --> 03:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
teacher licensure which is a death
 
03:04:31.190 --> 03:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
penalty for teachers in our state and it
 
03:04:32.830 --> 03:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
also creates an entirely new right
 
03:04:35.570 --> 03:04:35.580 align:start position:0%
private right of action for individuals
 
03:04:38.630 --> 03:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
to actually school districts when they
 
03:04:41.389 --> 03:04:41.399 align:start position:0%
feel that they have been aggrieved
 
03:04:44.090 --> 03:04:44.100 align:start position:0%
there's also been talk about how the
 
03:04:46.490 --> 03:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
guidance documents both the AG opinion
 
03:04:49.010 --> 03:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Education guidance
 
03:04:52.429 --> 03:04:52.439 align:start position:0%
documents are provide clarity
 
03:04:54.349 --> 03:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
and I think it's important first of all
 
03:04:56.450 --> 03:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
to note that the guidance documents are
 
03:04:59.210 --> 03:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
not authoritative because under the law
 
03:05:01.250 --> 03:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
the courts have independent are
 
03:05:03.230 --> 03:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
independently charged with enforcing the
 
03:05:05.450 --> 03:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
law and so the guidance documents don't
 
03:05:07.610 --> 03:05:07.620 align:start position:0%
bind the court to do any specific thing
 
03:05:10.370 --> 03:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
in fact there's a 35 year old New
 
03:05:11.750 --> 03:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court opinion
 
03:05:13.670 --> 03:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
specifically on this issue that
 
03:05:16.150 --> 03:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
clarifies that
 
03:05:18.469 --> 03:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
let me just make sure I get the specific
 
03:05:20.170 --> 03:05:20.180 align:start position:0%
language to y'all
 
03:05:24.590 --> 03:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire law can't be read to
 
03:05:27.110 --> 03:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
have attorney general opinions
 
03:05:30.170 --> 03:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
um substitute the uh the way that the
 
03:05:33.469 --> 03:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
Judiciary will interpret a statute
 
03:05:34.550 --> 03:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
um in addition
 
03:05:37.190 --> 03:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
there's been both federal case law
 
03:05:39.710 --> 03:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
um on the fact that when you have to
 
03:05:42.650 --> 03:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
have administrative agencies providing
 
03:05:45.889 --> 03:05:45.899 align:start position:0%
FAQ documents to clarify that that is in
 
03:05:48.410 --> 03:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
fact quite good evidence of the
 
03:05:50.030 --> 03:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
arbitrariness of the law that you're
 
03:05:51.410 --> 03:05:51.420 align:start position:0%
having to have this administrative
 
03:05:53.570 --> 03:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
agency trying to jump through all these
 
03:05:56.210 --> 03:05:56.220 align:start position:0%
hoops to clarify I'm happy to answer any
 
03:05:57.590 --> 03:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
questions I don't want to repeat
 
03:05:59.030 --> 03:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
everything else that's or even said
 
03:06:00.349 --> 03:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
that's in my testimony thank you very
 
03:06:03.170 --> 03:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
much any questions yes go ahead
 
03:06:04.730 --> 03:06:04.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:06:07.130 --> 03:06:07.140 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:06:09.769 --> 03:06:09.779 align:start position:0%
is there a way to amend this at all to
 
03:06:11.510 --> 03:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
fill in all those gaps that you brought
 
03:06:11.520 --> 03:06:13.010 align:start position:0%
fill in all those gaps that you brought
up

03:06:13.010 --> 03:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:06:15.349 --> 03:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
um I we think the The Proposal on the
 
03:06:18.110 --> 03:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
table hb61 is the right solution we need
 
03:06:20.030 --> 03:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
to repeal this there is no way to amend
 
03:06:22.130 --> 03:06:22.140 align:start position:0%
it is a vague law that is completely
 
03:06:24.469 --> 03:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
arbitrary arbitrarily enforced and
 
03:06:25.910 --> 03:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
people don't understand what it actually
 
03:06:27.830 --> 03:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
says or means or how it actually impacts
 
03:06:29.870 --> 03:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
the classroom and the result as you've
 
03:06:32.269 --> 03:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
heard is that teachers are afraid to
 
03:06:32.279 --> 03:06:34.550 align:start position:0%
heard is that teachers are afraid to
teach

03:06:34.550 --> 03:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:36.590 --> 03:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:06:39.290 --> 03:06:39.300 align:start position:0%

03:06:57.650 --> 03:06:57.660 align:start position:0%

longtime Manchester resident I've lived
 
03:07:25.070 --> 03:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
in the granite state my entire life I
 
03:07:28.010 --> 03:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
grew up here I was born in Congo in
 
03:07:30.050 --> 03:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
Africa I came to the United States when
 
03:07:33.110 --> 03:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
I was a toddler in addition to that I'm
 
03:07:36.110 --> 03:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
also a property owner in a house that
 
03:07:37.790 --> 03:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
was redlined I'm the first black
 
03:07:40.670 --> 03:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
property owner of a house that was in a
 
03:07:42.170 --> 03:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
historically Red Line Community
 
03:07:45.290 --> 03:07:45.300 align:start position:0%
neighborhood in Manchester and I'm also
 
03:07:48.710 --> 03:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
this year's MLK Martin Luther King award
 
03:07:51.170 --> 03:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
recipient and so I'm proud to be here to
 
03:07:54.650 --> 03:07:54.660 align:start position:0%
be able to speak in support of hb61 and
 
03:07:56.750 --> 03:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
to share a little bit of both about the
 
03:07:59.210 --> 03:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
unintended hacks I know a lot of our
 
03:08:00.290 --> 03:08:00.300 align:start position:0%
colleagues here have talked about the
 
03:08:02.750 --> 03:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
impact on Educators I'm also here to
 
03:08:04.429 --> 03:08:04.439 align:start position:0%
share a little bit about the impact that
 
03:08:08.090 --> 03:08:08.100 align:start position:0%
it has had on families of color with in
 
03:08:10.070 --> 03:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
particular African immigrant families
 
03:08:11.929 --> 03:08:11.939 align:start position:0%
with students in the public education
 
03:08:14.090 --> 03:08:14.100 align:start position:0%
system who have been forced to make a
 
03:08:16.370 --> 03:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
really difficult Choice knowing as
 
03:08:19.670 --> 03:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
watching the state pass this law this
 
03:08:21.290 --> 03:08:21.300 align:start position:0%
censorship law that has made it ever
 
03:08:24.050 --> 03:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
more difficult for our children and our
 
03:08:25.910 --> 03:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
communities to feel that they have a
 
03:08:27.950 --> 03:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
safe place in our public education
 
03:08:30.230 --> 03:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
system and that impact has included
 
03:08:32.570 --> 03:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
families making the very painful and
 
03:08:34.190 --> 03:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
difficult choice of whether or not to
 
03:08:36.889 --> 03:08:36.899 align:start position:0%
send their children to expensive private
 
03:08:40.250 --> 03:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
or religious schools in order to receive
 
03:08:43.010 --> 03:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
the the to be able to get an education
 
03:08:44.469 --> 03:08:44.479 align:start position:0%
that they would be able to understand
 
03:08:47.990 --> 03:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
both of the full history of the country
 
03:08:50.090 --> 03:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
as well as making the hard choice of
 
03:08:51.170 --> 03:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
whether or not to send their children
 
03:08:53.450 --> 03:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
out of state or out of the country in
 
03:08:55.429 --> 03:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
order to be educated so that's some of
 
03:08:58.010 --> 03:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
the unintended impacts of this bill
 
03:09:01.429 --> 03:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
and so I want to have a few remarks and
 
03:09:03.769 --> 03:09:03.779 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure to say that this
 
03:09:05.510 --> 03:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
censorship bill as you've heard that for
 
03:09:07.969 --> 03:09:07.979 align:start position:0%
others say has empowered hate groups and
 
03:09:10.490 --> 03:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
hateful individuals who do believe and
 
03:09:12.230 --> 03:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
operate from the belief that they are
 
03:09:14.750 --> 03:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
inherently Superior due to their race
 
03:09:17.150 --> 03:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
their gender or their sexual orientation
 
03:09:19.670 --> 03:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
and act accordingly to threaten and harm
 
03:09:21.530 --> 03:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
historically marginalized communities
 
03:09:24.170 --> 03:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
and members of those communities I think
 
03:09:25.730 --> 03:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
it is really important as we're talking
 
03:09:28.610 --> 03:09:28.620 align:start position:0%
to understand CRT one of the other hats
 
03:09:30.410 --> 03:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
that I wear is it is a university
 
03:09:33.050 --> 03:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
student even at the grand old age of 35
 
03:09:35.210 --> 03:09:35.220 align:start position:0%
I'm still working on my bachelor's
 
03:09:38.450 --> 03:09:38.460 align:start position:0%
degree due to systemic injustices due to
 
03:09:40.250 --> 03:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
being locked out of the education system
 
03:09:42.650 --> 03:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
not because of my own Merit but because
 
03:09:45.769 --> 03:09:45.779 align:start position:0%
of immigration status status and as well
 
03:09:48.349 --> 03:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
as those are systemic inequities that
 
03:09:50.330 --> 03:09:50.340 align:start position:0%
must be understood that must be
 
03:09:52.070 --> 03:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
addressed in order for us to move
 
03:09:54.769 --> 03:09:54.779 align:start position:0%
forward as a society and as a culture
 
03:09:57.230 --> 03:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
and so in order to understand it one of
 
03:10:00.110 --> 03:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
the things that my professors prompted
 
03:10:02.750 --> 03:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
us and because CRT is taught most often
 
03:10:05.210 --> 03:10:05.220 align:start position:0%
than not in the University level and it
 
03:10:07.610 --> 03:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
is a framework to understand the ways
 
03:10:09.889 --> 03:10:09.899 align:start position:0%
that our world is structured and so one
 
03:10:11.870 --> 03:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
way to understand that is to think of
 
03:10:13.670 --> 03:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
when your own life and your own self
 
03:10:16.190 --> 03:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
when you fill out documents what
 
03:10:18.889 --> 03:10:18.899 align:start position:0%
checkbox do you fill out why do you fill
 
03:10:20.690 --> 03:10:20.700 align:start position:0%
it out when they ask you your
 
03:10:23.750 --> 03:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
demographic your race what do you check
 
03:10:25.969 --> 03:10:25.979 align:start position:0%
and why and if you can answer those
 
03:10:27.530 --> 03:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
questions and you can understand that
 
03:10:29.990 --> 03:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
that is CRT and so I know I hear the
 
03:10:31.790 --> 03:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
buzzer and so I will conclude to say
 
03:10:36.469 --> 03:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
that systemic racism sexism inequity is
 
03:10:39.050 --> 03:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
devices is divisive because of the harms
 
03:10:41.389 --> 03:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
that they cause not because they are
 
03:10:43.370 --> 03:10:43.380 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable to learn about our
 
03:10:45.469 --> 03:10:45.479 align:start position:0%
willingness to examine and discuss our
 
03:10:46.790 --> 03:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
history in institutional
 
03:10:49.429 --> 03:10:49.439 align:start position:0%
responsibilities enables us to fully
 
03:10:51.530 --> 03:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
live into our values as a Granite State
 
03:10:53.929 --> 03:10:53.939 align:start position:0%
and to realize the promises of the
 
03:10:55.550 --> 03:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
Beloved Community that Dr King
 
03:10:58.250 --> 03:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
envisioned and dreamed for us one one
 
03:11:00.290 --> 03:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
that is United because we are willing to
 
03:11:02.690 --> 03:11:02.700 align:start position:0%
courageously confront courageously
 
03:11:05.750 --> 03:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
discuss courageously understand the
 
03:11:08.330 --> 03:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
inequities and injustices no matter how
 
03:11:10.730 --> 03:11:10.740 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable it is so please do the
 
03:11:13.010 --> 03:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
right thing and vote ought to pass on
 
03:11:15.769 --> 03:11:15.779 align:start position:0%

03:12:34.670 --> 03:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
non-profits and we have a duty to
 
03:12:36.410 --> 03:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
improve our existing law so we can

03:12:47.210 --> 03:12:47.220 align:start position:0%
tremendous value in non-profit

and um the current law the de facto
 
03:12:59.389 --> 03:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
impact is that it is uh it is providing
 
03:13:01.790 --> 03:13:01.800 align:start position:0%

never seen or heard of any groups

and teaching that some groups are
 
03:15:00.889 --> 03:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
inherently Superior to others and very
 
03:15:02.570 --> 03:15:02.580 align:start position:0%
few people had even heard of critical

race Theory before these bills began a
 
03:15:06.830 --> 03:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
few years ago and it is certainly not
 
03:15:08.630 --> 03:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
taught in education settings and
 
03:15:10.190 --> 03:15:10.200 align:start position:0%
workplace trainings
 
03:15:12.110 --> 03:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
additionally we have learned the last
 
03:15:14.269 --> 03:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
few years of the importance of believing
 
03:15:17.150 --> 03:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
the experiences of people with

03:15:29.150 --> 03:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
heard all morning much and oftentimes
 
03:15:31.730 --> 03:15:31.740 align:start position:0%
moving testimony of the current real and
 
03:15:34.550 --> 03:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
damaging impacts resulting from the
 
03:15:37.610 --> 03:15:37.620 align:start position:0%
passing of hb2 regardless of the words
 
03:15:39.830 --> 03:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
that are ensconced in the written
 
03:15:42.469 --> 03:15:42.479 align:start position:0%
language of the law we saw that business
 
03:15:44.450 --> 03:15:44.460 align:start position:0%
employers understood the potential for
 
03:15:46.309 --> 03:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
this when they turned out against the
 
03:15:48.590 --> 03:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
language in the original HB 544 bill
 
03:15:51.110 --> 03:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
because they understand that the
 
03:15:52.610 --> 03:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
economic Vitality of New Hampshire
 
03:15:55.610 --> 03:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
depends on embracing the current growing
 
03:15:57.469 --> 03:15:57.479 align:start position:0%
diversity of the workforce and assuring
 
03:16:00.349 --> 03:16:00.359 align:start position:0%
that everyone feels welcome and that
 
03:16:03.290 --> 03:16:03.300 align:start position:0%
they belong additionally a democratic
 
03:16:05.990 --> 03:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
citizenry must be informed and be able
 
03:16:08.690 --> 03:16:08.700 align:start position:0%
to think critically learning history and
 
03:16:10.670 --> 03:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
engaging with challenging Concepts is
 
03:16:13.190 --> 03:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
not damaging rather as we've heard from
 
03:16:15.650 --> 03:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
some of our wonderful Educators students
 
03:16:17.690 --> 03:16:17.700 align:start position:0%
Thrive and are better prepared to be
 
03:16:19.730 --> 03:16:19.740 align:start position:0%
successful adults and civically engaged
 
03:16:22.250 --> 03:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
citizens especially in the increasingly
 
03:16:25.490 --> 03:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
global economy and world I teach quality
 
03:16:27.769 --> 03:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
improvement and the fundamental precept
 
03:16:29.750 --> 03:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
is that we can't improve something if we
 
03:16:31.309 --> 03:16:31.319 align:start position:0%
do not know where we're starting from
 
03:16:33.349 --> 03:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
and where we are now is completely
 
03:16:35.510 --> 03:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
informed and a result of what has
 
03:16:37.389 --> 03:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
happened before in our country's history
 
03:16:40.070 --> 03:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
I do not understand why we would choose
 
03:16:42.290 --> 03:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
to prioritize ignorance which is not
 
03:16:44.389 --> 03:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
knowing rather than seeking to
 
03:16:46.309 --> 03:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
understand so we can constructively move
 
03:16:48.950 --> 03:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
ahead as a society the significant
 
03:16:52.010 --> 03:16:52.020 align:start position:0%
Health both mental and physical impacts
 
03:16:53.990 --> 03:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
of stress and hostile workplace

environments and Community climates
 
03:16:59.090 --> 03:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
cannot be emphasized enough every major
 
03:17:01.190 --> 03:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
health health professional Public Health
 
03:17:03.769 --> 03:17:03.779 align:start position:0%

03:17:07.849 --> 03:17:07.859 align:start position:0%
Health Association understand that
 
03:17:10.010 --> 03:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
racism is a Public Health crisis because
 
03:17:11.990 --> 03:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
because of the profound differential
 
03:17:14.269 --> 03:17:14.279 align:start position:0%
impacts of how racism is baked into our
 
03:17:16.490 --> 03:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
systems and structures leaving groups of
 
03:17:18.590 --> 03:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
people consistently suffering from worse
 
03:17:21.290 --> 03:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
health and health outcomes in addition
 
03:17:23.090 --> 03:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
to the direct impacts we're seeing in
 
03:17:24.889 --> 03:17:24.899 align:start position:0%
people especially students and teachers
 
03:17:27.230 --> 03:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
if we've heard earlier today these
 
03:17:28.730 --> 03:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
problems cannot be appropriately
 
03:17:30.769 --> 03:17:30.779 align:start position:0%
addressed by public employees who work
 
03:17:33.130 --> 03:17:33.140 align:start position:0%
in public health and other health
 
03:17:36.290 --> 03:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
sectors if they are Concepts that they
 
03:17:38.269 --> 03:17:38.279 align:start position:0%
cannot fully engage with or be trained
 
03:17:40.670 --> 03:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
in this is a disservice to our dedicated
 
03:17:42.590 --> 03:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
public employees and the people of our
 
03:17:44.690 --> 03:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
state so let's be clear the original
 
03:17:47.389 --> 03:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
Bill were a solution to a problem that
 
03:17:49.969 --> 03:17:49.979 align:start position:0%
did not exist however the very real
 
03:17:52.370 --> 03:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
impacts of the law have created
 
03:17:55.130 --> 03:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
unwelcome and hostile climates have had
 
03:17:57.349 --> 03:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
chilling effects on Educators and public
 
03:18:00.170 --> 03:18:00.180 align:start position:0%
employees and emboldened true racist and
 
03:18:02.510 --> 03:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
discriminatory behavior from individuals
 
03:18:05.269 --> 03:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
who want to silence and erase people of
 
03:18:07.790 --> 03:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
color immigrants and other identities as
 
03:18:09.230 --> 03:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
well as important learning and
 
03:18:11.690 --> 03:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
conversations that are necessary to
 
03:18:13.370 --> 03:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
ensure the New Hampshire Advantage for
 
03:18:16.130 --> 03:18:16.140 align:start position:0%

testimony here today it has become
 
03:18:47.150 --> 03:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
apparent that some of the members of the
 
03:18:49.070 --> 03:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
committee do not understand how the
 
03:18:51.889 --> 03:18:51.899 align:start position:0%
current RSA prohibits teachers from
 
03:18:54.469 --> 03:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
engaging in classroom discussions of
 
03:18:57.650 --> 03:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
social justice issues such as racial
 
03:19:00.889 --> 03:19:00.899 align:start position:0%
race or gender but the truth is you
 
03:19:02.809 --> 03:19:02.819 align:start position:0%
don't have to understand it you just
 
03:19:04.429 --> 03:19:04.439 align:start position:0%
need to listen
 
03:19:07.790 --> 03:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
I urge you to listen to all those who
 
03:19:09.769 --> 03:19:09.779 align:start position:0%
are working under this law currently
 
03:19:12.469 --> 03:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
listen to the overwhelming majority of
 
03:19:14.330 --> 03:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
teachers social workers School
 
03:19:16.550 --> 03:19:16.560 align:start position:0%

legislators who have testified here
 
03:19:22.730 --> 03:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
today in support of hb61 we are telling
 
03:19:25.550 --> 03:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
you the language and the current law is
 
03:19:25.560 --> 03:19:27.349 align:start position:0%
you the language and the current law is
vague

03:19:27.349 --> 03:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
vague
 
03:19:30.110 --> 03:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
which opens the door for any student or
 
03:19:32.269 --> 03:19:32.279 align:start position:0%
parent to Lodge a complaint that may
 
03:19:34.490 --> 03:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
lead to an investigation
 
03:19:37.790 --> 03:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
and a loss of a teacher's job that
 
03:19:39.710 --> 03:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
threat is real
 
03:19:42.469 --> 03:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
because of this teachers feel stifled
 
03:19:46.429 --> 03:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
they feel discouraged the current RSA is
 
03:19:49.550 --> 03:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
a teacher morale Destroyer
 
03:19:52.070 --> 03:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
as I know you are well aware teachers
 
03:19:53.990 --> 03:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
are leaving the profession at a rapid
 
03:19:58.130 --> 03:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
rate I personally know personally no
 
03:20:01.070 --> 03:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
three teachers who have left the
 
03:20:04.990 --> 03:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
profession due to this law
 
03:20:08.090 --> 03:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
hb61 is a step in the right direction in
 
03:20:10.210 --> 03:20:10.220 align:start position:0%
improving the schoolwork environment
 
03:20:13.190 --> 03:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
please trust our teachers please
 
03:20:16.610 --> 03:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
recommend hb61 as ought to pass
 
03:20:18.370 --> 03:20:18.380 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:20:21.290 --> 03:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
and the last card right here you won the
 
03:20:25.130 --> 03:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
lottery uh Ani Malaki who is the
 
03:20:27.110 --> 03:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
executive director for the Human Rights
 
03:20:34.849 --> 03:20:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:38.750 --> 03:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
I might add that she wanted to be the
 
03:20:38.760 --> 03:20:40.490 align:start position:0%
I might add that she wanted to be the
last

03:20:40.490 --> 03:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
last
 
03:20:42.610 --> 03:20:42.620 align:start position:0%
you got it
 
03:20:45.769 --> 03:20:45.779 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone for the record
 
03:20:48.590 --> 03:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
my name is Ani Malachi I'm the executive
 
03:20:51.050 --> 03:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
director for the Human Rights Commission
 
03:20:53.690 --> 03:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
excuse me getting over whatever is going
 
03:20:55.490 --> 03:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
around in the air
 
03:20:57.889 --> 03:20:57.899 align:start position:0%
I'm really here more for informational
 
03:21:01.849 --> 03:21:01.859 align:start position:0%
purposes than anything else so there are
 
03:21:03.170 --> 03:21:03.180 align:start position:0%
a couple of points that I'd like to make
 
03:21:06.170 --> 03:21:06.180 align:start position:0%
one of the major ones is process I think
 
03:21:08.150 --> 03:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
there's been some misunderstanding on
 
03:21:09.849 --> 03:21:09.859 align:start position:0%
the process of how
 
03:21:12.710 --> 03:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
if there is a charge of discrimination
 
03:21:15.349 --> 03:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
how that works so I'd like to certainly
 
03:21:18.590 --> 03:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
give information on that there is a
 
03:21:22.370 --> 03:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
packet that I gave earlier and it has
 
03:21:24.790 --> 03:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
handouts so that's what I'm going to be
 
03:21:28.250 --> 03:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
providing my information from and I
 
03:21:29.630 --> 03:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
think it was already brought down I
 
03:21:31.610 --> 03:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
don't know if you all have that that
 
03:21:35.650 --> 03:21:35.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:40.550 --> 03:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
okay so I'll just go is it possible for
 
03:21:43.370 --> 03:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
them to yeah take a few minutes to you
 
03:21:45.230 --> 03:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
know just and then take us through it a
 
03:21:45.240 --> 03:21:46.250 align:start position:0%
know just and then take us through it a
little bit

03:21:46.250 --> 03:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
03:21:48.650 --> 03:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
I can't hear you I'm sorry go ahead and
 
03:21:50.990 --> 03:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
and just take several minutes to you
 
03:21:54.050 --> 03:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
know give us the hype okay very good
 
03:21:56.870 --> 03:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
um so as an initial Point
 
03:21:59.090 --> 03:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
um the Human Rights Commission has the
 
03:22:01.910 --> 03:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
authority of RSA 354a which are New
 
03:22:03.410 --> 03:22:03.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's laws against discrimination
 
03:22:07.130 --> 03:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
our jurisdictional area is public
 
03:22:09.889 --> 03:22:09.899 align:start position:0%
education in general which was added in
 
03:22:12.110 --> 03:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
2019 which I think is an important point
 
03:22:14.990 --> 03:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
to make we also have jurisdiction over
 
03:22:17.809 --> 03:22:17.819 align:start position:0%
employment public accommodation and
 
03:22:20.030 --> 03:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
housing the commission was established
 
03:22:24.170 --> 03:22:24.180 align:start position:0%
in 1965 and as you are all aware lost
 
03:22:26.630 --> 03:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
change and things have been added to our
 
03:22:29.630 --> 03:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
statute over time
 
03:22:32.210 --> 03:22:32.220 align:start position:0%
um the commission is made up of a staff
 
03:22:34.190 --> 03:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
of there's only eight of us at this
 
03:22:35.750 --> 03:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
point so there are five investigators
 
03:22:38.870 --> 03:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
that cover the entire State and all five
 
03:22:40.849 --> 03:22:40.859 align:start position:0%
investigators work in all of our areas
 
03:22:44.030 --> 03:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
of jurisdiction we have seven volunteer
 
03:22:47.769 --> 03:22:47.779 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that help to adjudicate
 
03:22:50.870 --> 03:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
our investigations once they are
 
03:22:50.880 --> 03:22:51.769 align:start position:0%
our investigations once they are
finished

03:22:51.769 --> 03:22:51.779 align:start position:0%
finished
 
03:22:51.779 --> 03:22:53.210 align:start position:0%
finished
and

03:22:53.210 --> 03:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:22:56.450 --> 03:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
there is also a hearing panel so if
 
03:22:58.309 --> 03:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
there's a case where there's a probable
 
03:23:02.630 --> 03:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
cause finding then that that charge will
 
03:23:04.309 --> 03:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
then move towards a public hearing
 
03:23:07.490 --> 03:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
people can remove and go to court but if
 
03:23:10.429 --> 03:23:10.439 align:start position:0%
they stay with the commission then then
 
03:23:12.710 --> 03:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
there's a public hearing with three of
 
03:23:14.290 --> 03:23:14.300 align:start position:0%
these seven
 
03:23:16.550 --> 03:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and these would be three
 
03:23:18.710 --> 03:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that have had no dealings
 
03:23:22.010 --> 03:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
with the case at all so it is as the
 
03:23:24.950 --> 03:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
lawyers would say de novo meaning the
 
03:23:27.349 --> 03:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
Commissioners have not participated in
 
03:23:30.349 --> 03:23:30.359 align:start position:0%
the investigation and it's brand new for
 
03:23:32.809 --> 03:23:32.819 align:start position:0%
them so that the the both parties are
 
03:23:34.910 --> 03:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
getting a fresh hearing on what's taking
 
03:23:39.290 --> 03:23:39.300 align:start position:0%
place the initial cheat that is in that
 
03:23:41.630 --> 03:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
packet on the top and you'll be able to
 
03:23:43.309 --> 03:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
read through it later it's a white paper
 
03:23:45.950 --> 03:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
very short and it goes through what our
 
03:23:50.210 --> 03:23:50.220 align:start position:0%
process is so excuse me a charge comes
 
03:23:50.220 --> 03:23:51.110 align:start position:0%
process is so excuse me a charge comes
in

03:23:51.110 --> 03:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:23:54.050 --> 03:23:54.060 align:start position:0%
where a person makes an allegation and
 
03:23:57.710 --> 03:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
we have the uh the uh
 
03:24:00.170 --> 03:24:00.180 align:start position:0%
availability to either take that charge
 
03:24:02.750 --> 03:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
in or pass on it and there's a legal
 
03:24:04.670 --> 03:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
standard that has to be met first and
 
03:24:08.030 --> 03:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
foremost now relative to
 
03:24:12.050 --> 03:24:12.060 align:start position:0%
um the section in our statute and I
 
03:24:14.510 --> 03:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
guess I should start or I should also
 
03:24:17.090 --> 03:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
state that it's been referred to as the
 
03:24:20.150 --> 03:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
divisive Concepts law the actual name of
 
03:24:22.429 --> 03:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
the area in our statute is the right to
 
03:24:24.469 --> 03:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
freedom from discrimination in public
 
03:24:27.590 --> 03:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
workplaces and education and so that is
 
03:24:31.490 --> 03:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
in our statute and RSA 354a section 29
 
03:24:35.210 --> 03:24:35.220 align:start position:0%
through 34. so even though that is a new
 
03:24:38.210 --> 03:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
area in our statute we use the exact
 
03:24:41.690 --> 03:24:41.700 align:start position:0%
same process that we have always used to
 
03:24:44.450 --> 03:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
move through and to receive a charge or
 
03:24:47.269 --> 03:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
to pass on a charge once that charge is
 
03:24:50.570 --> 03:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
taken in on Prima fascia meaning it
 
03:24:52.670 --> 03:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
meets the legal standard then both
 
03:24:55.190 --> 03:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
parties are notified well the charging
 
03:24:57.410 --> 03:24:57.420 align:start position:0%
party obviously knows but the party that
 
03:24:59.510 --> 03:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
would be the respondent is then notified
 
03:25:01.130 --> 03:25:01.140 align:start position:0%
that there has been a charge of
 
03:25:04.030 --> 03:25:04.040 align:start position:0%
discrimination based on these factors
 
03:25:06.769 --> 03:25:06.779 align:start position:0%
once the party the responding party is
 
03:25:09.050 --> 03:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
notified they have an opportunity to
 
03:25:11.570 --> 03:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
respond to us it's a very administrative
 
03:25:14.769 --> 03:25:14.779 align:start position:0%
process not unlike a court would be so
 
03:25:18.050 --> 03:25:18.060 align:start position:0%
there it's not a someone has an issue
 
03:25:21.250 --> 03:25:21.260 align:start position:0%
they come file a charge two days later
 
03:25:24.410 --> 03:25:24.420 align:start position:0%
you're found you know there's an end to
 
03:25:26.330 --> 03:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
that whether it's probable cause or no
 
03:25:28.910 --> 03:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
probable cause and then something moves
 
03:25:31.429 --> 03:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
forward in terms of for this situation a
 
03:25:34.269 --> 03:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
teacher teacher's credentials
 
03:25:36.729 --> 03:25:36.739 align:start position:0%
they have to go through our process
 
03:25:40.490 --> 03:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire process so once
 
03:25:42.410 --> 03:25:42.420 align:start position:0%
the file once the charge is filed the
 
03:25:43.809 --> 03:25:43.819 align:start position:0%
parties are notified
 
03:25:48.309 --> 03:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
excuse me the respondent
 
03:25:52.790 --> 03:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
excuse me uh not contagious just a lot
 
03:25:54.110 --> 03:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
of things happening in my lungs right
 
03:25:56.389 --> 03:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
now and trying to talk is is an
 
03:25:58.370 --> 03:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
interesting exercise so that means I
 
03:25:59.929 --> 03:25:59.939 align:start position:0%
need to hurry up
 
03:25:59.939 --> 03:26:00.769 align:start position:0%
need to hurry up
um

03:26:00.769 --> 03:26:00.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:02.809 --> 03:26:02.819 align:start position:0%
so the respondent is notified they have
 
03:26:05.210 --> 03:26:05.220 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to respond to the charge
 
03:26:07.849 --> 03:26:07.859 align:start position:0%
and at that point if there is a
 
03:26:10.550 --> 03:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory reason why whatever
 
03:26:13.490 --> 03:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
is being alleged happened we could be
 
03:26:15.590 --> 03:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
done at that point
 
03:26:19.130 --> 03:26:19.140 align:start position:0%
finished done
 
03:26:22.010 --> 03:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
um once if that's not the case and we
 
03:26:24.590 --> 03:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
move on to an investigation then the
 
03:26:26.929 --> 03:26:26.939 align:start position:0%
parties are there's information gathered
 
03:26:29.690 --> 03:26:29.700 align:start position:0%
from both parties an investigator is
 
03:26:32.630 --> 03:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
going to ask questions have witnesses
 
03:26:35.510 --> 03:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
and there could be uh sworn affidavits
 
03:26:38.389 --> 03:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
that are part of the investigation then
 
03:26:40.250 --> 03:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
there's a determination made a probable
 
03:26:42.710 --> 03:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
cause no probable cause no probable
 
03:26:45.290 --> 03:26:45.300 align:start position:0%
cause means we're done the investigation
 
03:26:47.830 --> 03:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
is finished and
 
03:26:50.210 --> 03:26:50.220 align:start position:0%
there could be a non-discriminatory
 
03:26:52.550 --> 03:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
reason why something that the individual
 
03:26:56.330 --> 03:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
is alleging took place and that is their
 
03:26:59.389 --> 03:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
that is their reasonable defense for
 
03:27:02.570 --> 03:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
what happened the person who's filed the
 
03:27:05.090 --> 03:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
charge if they do not agree with our
 
03:27:07.429 --> 03:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
finding of no probable cause they may
 
03:27:09.769 --> 03:27:09.779 align:start position:0%
take that to court and appeal
 
03:27:12.469 --> 03:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
if there's a probable cause finding then
 
03:27:14.450 --> 03:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
what we do is both parties are notified
 
03:27:16.729 --> 03:27:16.739 align:start position:0%
and then we move forward with scheduling
 
03:27:18.170 --> 03:27:18.180 align:start position:0%
a hearing
 
03:27:21.769 --> 03:27:21.779 align:start position:0%
um in in our in our offices
 
03:27:24.469 --> 03:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
with our commissioners now the
 
03:27:26.630 --> 03:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
respondent at that point can remove and
 
03:27:29.330 --> 03:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
go to court yes sir we we do have a a
 
03:27:31.490 --> 03:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
hearing starting up in about five
 
03:27:35.990 --> 03:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
minutes okay so but go ahead alrighty so
 
03:27:38.389 --> 03:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
um I mean I guess in a nutshell it's
 
03:27:40.849 --> 03:27:40.859 align:start position:0%
very important I think for you all to
 
03:27:43.849 --> 03:27:43.859 align:start position:0%
understand that the process for
 
03:27:48.830 --> 03:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
adjudicating any charge under the um the
 
03:27:51.050 --> 03:27:51.060 align:start position:0%
right to freedom from discrimination in
 
03:27:54.050 --> 03:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
public workplaces and education follows
 
03:27:56.570 --> 03:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
the exact same pathway as any other
 
03:27:58.250 --> 03:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
charge that would come to our office
 
03:28:00.530 --> 03:28:00.540 align:start position:0%
There's an opportunity for appeal
 
03:28:02.030 --> 03:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
There's an opportunity for mediation
 
03:28:04.370 --> 03:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
There's an opportunity for conciliation
 
03:28:07.070 --> 03:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
which is just mediation after a probable
 
03:28:09.950 --> 03:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
cause finding and one of the other
 
03:28:12.710 --> 03:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
important elements is that the
 
03:28:14.630 --> 03:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is devoid from
 
03:28:17.870 --> 03:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
our entire process so in order for them
 
03:28:19.610 --> 03:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
to even be involved there would have to
 
03:28:21.710 --> 03:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
be a probable cause finding and then
 
03:28:24.469 --> 03:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
then we would at that point if there
 
03:28:27.410 --> 03:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
ever is one we would figure out what
 
03:28:29.650 --> 03:28:29.660 align:start position:0%
that looks like and what that process is
 
03:28:32.450 --> 03:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
so the Attorney General's office early
 
03:28:35.809 --> 03:28:35.819 align:start position:0%
on provided an FAQ which is in the
 
03:28:38.450 --> 03:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
packet that I provided to you which goes
 
03:28:41.150 --> 03:28:41.160 align:start position:0%
through what is and isn't a foul of the
 
03:28:44.870 --> 03:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
law and then subsequent to that I made a
 
03:28:46.910 --> 03:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
request and the chair of the commission
 
03:28:49.309 --> 03:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
made a request for the Attorney General
 
03:28:52.490 --> 03:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
to give further clarification in case
 
03:28:55.070 --> 03:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
people well people were still not clear
 
03:28:58.010 --> 03:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
so there's additional information in a
 
03:29:00.290 --> 03:29:00.300 align:start position:0%
much longer letter which is an opinion
 
03:29:02.269 --> 03:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
and it was specifically requested
 
03:29:04.250 --> 03:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
because an attorney general's opinion
 
03:29:06.410 --> 03:29:06.420 align:start position:0%
which happens rarely in the state of New
 
03:29:08.150 --> 03:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but that opinion would be
 
03:29:10.450 --> 03:29:10.460 align:start position:0%
public and so that information
 
03:29:13.070 --> 03:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
connected with the FAQ that was put out
 
03:29:15.830 --> 03:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
would hopefully answer questions that
 
03:29:17.750 --> 03:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
teachers or parents or Educators might
 
03:29:19.790 --> 03:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
have ultimately
 
03:29:22.610 --> 03:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
regardless of how you decide on this or
 
03:29:25.550 --> 03:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
not I'm not advocating either way my job
 
03:29:27.950 --> 03:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
is to advocate for the law so whatever
 
03:29:29.929 --> 03:29:29.939 align:start position:0%
you decide is what I will do and my
 
03:29:32.389 --> 03:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
staff will do ultimately there's a long
 
03:29:34.849 --> 03:29:34.859 align:start position:0%
process that needs to be completed there
 
03:29:36.530 --> 03:29:36.540 align:start position:0%
are opportunities for mediation and
 
03:29:39.889 --> 03:29:39.899 align:start position:0%
conversation and and we continue with
 
03:29:42.889 --> 03:29:42.899 align:start position:0%
Outreach and training and other efforts
 
03:29:44.410 --> 03:29:44.420 align:start position:0%
to make sure that people understand
 
03:29:47.150 --> 03:29:47.160 align:start position:0%
we're always available to answer any
 
03:29:49.910 --> 03:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
questions so I'm sure I've forgotten 20
 
03:29:52.130 --> 03:29:52.140 align:start position:0%
things but I think I've hit the high
 
03:29:55.070 --> 03:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
points the packet does have all of this
 
03:29:57.370 --> 03:29:57.380 align:start position:0%
information that I've reviewed within it
 
03:29:59.690 --> 03:29:59.700 align:start position:0%
and I'm certainly available to answer
 
03:30:02.150 --> 03:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
any questions but also if you would like
 
03:30:04.729 --> 03:30:04.739 align:start position:0%
to reach out to me outside of this venue
 
03:30:07.550 --> 03:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
and have a more detailed conversation or
 
03:30:09.229 --> 03:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
I would be more than happy to have the
 
03:30:11.630 --> 03:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
group of you come over or me to meet you
 
03:30:14.150 --> 03:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
somewhere to do a more detailed training
 
03:30:16.729 --> 03:30:16.739 align:start position:0%
whether it's on our process specifically
 
03:30:20.269 --> 03:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
or what we do relative to education so
 
03:30:22.490 --> 03:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
that this Clarity and understanding how
 
03:30:23.929 --> 03:30:23.939 align:start position:0%
these things are adjudicated because
 
03:30:26.870 --> 03:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's not just file put a put down a
 
03:30:28.370 --> 03:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
piece of paper and then Bing bam boom
 
03:30:30.889 --> 03:30:30.899 align:start position:0%
it's all over so thank you for your
 
03:30:33.050 --> 03:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
patience and your Indulgence and I'm
 
03:30:34.429 --> 03:30:34.439 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions you might
 
03:30:36.110 --> 03:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
have thank you are there any questions
 
03:30:38.269 --> 03:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
03:30:40.370 --> 03:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
thank you director for the information
 
03:30:42.830 --> 03:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
in the technical support
 
03:30:44.990 --> 03:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
and understanding thank you very much
 
03:30:48.429 --> 03:30:48.439 align:start position:0%
and this does close down our hearing on
 
03:30:55.370 --> 03:30:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:57.469 --> 03:30:57.479 align:start position:0%
I can't give you that right now I do
 
03:30:59.750 --> 03:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
know we had about 50 people testifying
 
03:31:02.210 --> 03:31:02.220 align:start position:0%
and I would say close to 95 percent were
 
03:31:03.710 --> 03:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
one way and five percent were the other
 
03:31:03.720 --> 03:31:05.210 align:start position:0%
one way and five percent were the other
way

03:31:05.210 --> 03:31:05.220 align:start position:0%
way
 
03:31:07.370 --> 03:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
so I don't have that in front of me
 
03:31:08.690 --> 03:31:08.700 align:start position:0%
right now I also don't have the blue
 
03:31:10.130 --> 03:31:10.140 align:start position:0%
sheets in front of me they're all out
 
03:31:13.670 --> 03:31:13.680 align:start position:0%

last terms HB 321 which is now law that
 
04:10:27.170 --> 04:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
bill simply asks that school districts
 
04:10:29.689 --> 04:10:29.699 align:start position:0%

Department of Education early
 
04:10:38.389 --> 04:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
indications are that the gifted measure

is getting very good response as school
 
04:10:41.990 --> 04:10:42.000 align:start position:0%

requirement a real success story
 
04:10:56.689 --> 04:10:56.699 align:start position:0%
this bill originally came to this
 
04:10:58.130 --> 04:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
committee last year where it was
 
04:11:00.530 --> 04:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
referred for interim study a study
 
04:11:02.389 --> 04:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
committee held two lengthy sessions on
 
04:11:04.189 --> 04:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
the measure and ultimately volunteered
 
04:11:06.830 --> 04:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
to recommend OTP this full committee
 
04:11:09.769 --> 04:11:09.779 align:start position:0%
subsequently also voted to OT to support
 
04:11:12.290 --> 04:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
OTP when we met this past fall that's
 
04:11:14.150 --> 04:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
referring to the other Bill not the
 
04:11:18.889 --> 04:11:18.899 align:start position:0%
current one okay hb-131 similarly simply
 
04:11:20.570 --> 04:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
asked school districts to share their
 
04:11:22.790 --> 04:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
classroom observation policies as well
 
04:11:25.429 --> 04:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
as audio video streaming and recording
 
04:11:27.290 --> 04:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Education for
 
04:11:29.870 --> 04:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
another best practices folder or virtual
 
04:11:32.990 --> 04:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
folder doe Representatives indicated
 
04:11:34.370 --> 04:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
that the department could support
 
04:11:36.469 --> 04:11:36.479 align:start position:0%
implementation by using the template
 
04:11:39.769 --> 04:11:39.779 align:start position:0%
currently in place for HB 321 the gifted
 
04:11:41.090 --> 04:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
student law
 
04:11:43.429 --> 04:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
attention to this area became important
 
04:11:45.830 --> 04:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
during the covid pandemic when so many
 
04:11:47.750 --> 04:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
schools went to hybrid in-class and
 
04:11:50.090 --> 04:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
remote instruction some schools went
 
04:11:52.070 --> 04:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
totally remote Nashua for example
 
04:11:54.349 --> 04:11:54.359 align:start position:0%
closeded School doors over for over a
 
04:11:54.359 --> 04:11:56.030 align:start position:0%
closeded School doors over for over a
year

04:11:56.030 --> 04:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:11:58.309 --> 04:11:58.319 align:start position:0%
remote learning raised new questions in
 
04:12:00.170 --> 04:12:00.180 align:start position:0%
numerous areas to include technology
 
04:12:03.050 --> 04:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
issues cost issues access issues privacy
 
04:12:06.229 --> 04:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
issues and legal issues what about homes
 
04:12:08.210 --> 04:12:08.220 align:start position:0%
that do not have internet access or
 
04:12:10.670 --> 04:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
families that don't have computers then
 
04:12:12.530 --> 04:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
there's the issue of recording if a
 
04:12:14.929 --> 04:12:14.939 align:start position:0%
student misses an online session what
 
04:12:17.929 --> 04:12:17.939 align:start position:0%
are the ramifications if he or she of he
 
04:12:20.090 --> 04:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
or she viewing a recorded version later
 
04:12:23.030 --> 04:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
on are schools making Provisions for
 
04:12:26.290 --> 04:12:26.300 align:start position:0%
recording and saving such sessions
 
04:12:28.670 --> 04:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
I would point out that our committee
 
04:12:30.769 --> 04:12:30.779 align:start position:0%
hearings are all being recorded and
 
04:12:32.870 --> 04:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
saved on YouTube presumably in
 
04:12:35.510 --> 04:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
perpetuity but these hearings differ
 
04:12:37.429 --> 04:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
from classroom settings
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
many high school and college students
 
04:12:41.750 --> 04:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
record or seek to record lectures for
 
04:12:43.809 --> 04:12:43.819 align:start position:0%
future study and review purposes
 
04:12:46.130 --> 04:12:46.140 align:start position:0%
teachers and professors typically
 
04:12:48.650 --> 04:12:48.660 align:start position:0%
include recording protocols in their
 
04:12:51.530 --> 04:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
syllabi but Educators who don't mind
 
04:12:53.689 --> 04:12:53.699 align:start position:0%
their lectures being recorded sometimes
 
04:12:56.030 --> 04:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
have issues with ubiquitous cell phones
 
04:12:58.550 --> 04:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
so taping policies conflict with
 
04:13:01.130 --> 04:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
recording policies
 
04:13:03.349 --> 04:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
there are many pieces to our new world
 
04:13:05.030 --> 04:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
of distance learning and hybrid
 
04:13:07.370 --> 04:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
instruction that is why a best practice
 
04:13:09.650 --> 04:13:09.660 align:start position:0%
is Folger in this area could be very
 
04:13:11.750 --> 04:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
useful in the same way as the best
 
04:13:14.090 --> 04:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
practices folder regarding gifted
 
04:13:16.250 --> 04:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
students is developing into a wonderful
 
04:13:16.260 --> 04:13:17.990 align:start position:0%
students is developing into a wonderful
resource

04:13:17.990 --> 04:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
resource
 
04:13:19.969 --> 04:13:19.979 align:start position:0%
then there's the classroom Observer
 
04:13:22.490 --> 04:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
piece which ties into the media piece as
 
04:13:24.530 --> 04:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
hybrid online or Zoom types of
 
04:13:27.110 --> 04:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
instruction were observable by parents
 
04:13:29.870 --> 04:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
and others when I was a classroom
 
04:13:32.330 --> 04:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
teacher I'd get a occasional requests
 
04:13:34.429 --> 04:13:34.439 align:start position:0%
from parents to sit in which was fine
 
04:13:37.189 --> 04:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
but classrooms can only accommodate so
 
04:13:39.050 --> 04:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
many visitors how do various school
 
04:13:41.570 --> 04:13:41.580 align:start position:0%
districts deal with this issue
 
04:13:43.790 --> 04:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
but when I taught no one had ever heard
 
04:13:46.250 --> 04:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
of the internet for remote classes who
 
04:13:48.889 --> 04:13:48.899 align:start position:0%
can tune in just students what if a
 
04:13:50.809 --> 04:13:50.819 align:start position:0%
parent wants to watch what if the link
 
04:13:52.490 --> 04:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
is shared widely
 
04:13:54.469 --> 04:13:54.479 align:start position:0%
I don't have the answers only questions
 
04:13:56.809 --> 04:13:56.819 align:start position:0%
this bill would help provide answers
 
04:13:59.090 --> 04:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
Alternatives options and eventually
 
04:14:01.849 --> 04:14:01.859 align:start position:0%
shareable best practices
 
04:14:04.610 --> 04:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
again this measure includes no spending
 
04:14:07.490 --> 04:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
requirements or policy mandates it
 
04:14:09.830 --> 04:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
simply asks District to share existing
 
04:14:12.290 --> 04:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
policies to create a best practices
 
04:14:15.170 --> 04:14:15.180 align:start position:0%
folder if there are holes in existing
 
04:14:17.269 --> 04:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
policies this measure provides the
 
04:14:19.990 --> 04:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
impetus for them to be addressed locally
 
04:14:23.689 --> 04:14:23.699 align:start position:0%
yes this could possibly be accomplished
 
04:14:26.689 --> 04:14:26.699 align:start position:0%
via doe rules but the imprimatur of
 
04:14:29.750 --> 04:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
State Statute matters greatly
 
04:14:32.450 --> 04:14:32.460 align:start position:0%
Deb Hobson and I met with four doe
 
04:14:34.189 --> 04:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
members including the commissioner on
 
04:14:36.830 --> 04:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
this and they were all very supportive
 
04:14:39.410 --> 04:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
this requirement could simply be easily
 
04:14:41.389 --> 04:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
satisfied in a heartbeat with an email
 
04:14:43.309 --> 04:14:43.319 align:start position:0%
and an attachment or link regarding
 
04:14:45.170 --> 04:14:45.180 align:start position:0%
existing policies
 
04:14:47.809 --> 04:14:47.819 align:start position:0%
if no policies exist regarding recording
 
04:14:50.630 --> 04:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
or transparency issues then this measure
 
04:14:52.969 --> 04:14:52.979 align:start position:0%
will provide a useful impetus to
 
04:14:55.790 --> 04:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
districts to have overdue discussions to
 
04:14:58.070 --> 04:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
eventually get some definition in this
 
04:15:01.630 --> 04:15:01.640 align:start position:0%
new area of importance in 2023
 
04:15:04.490 --> 04:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
again there is no policy mandate or
 
04:15:07.010 --> 04:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
spending requirement between the Bill's
 
04:15:08.809 --> 04:15:08.819 align:start position:0%
original hearing and then the two
 
04:15:10.849 --> 04:15:10.859 align:start position:0%
interim study sessions and then another
 
04:15:13.070 --> 04:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
discussion in ought to pass vote last
 
04:15:15.110 --> 04:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
fall the issues associated with this
 
04:15:16.490 --> 04:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
measure have already been addressed and
 
04:15:18.950 --> 04:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
readdressed of course this committee
 
04:15:22.070 --> 04:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
does feature some new faces
 
04:15:23.290 --> 04:15:23.300 align:start position:0%
quite a few
 
04:15:25.910 --> 04:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
I have already emailed a copy of these
 
04:15:28.070 --> 04:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
remarks to the committee I want to
 
04:15:30.290 --> 04:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
respond to questions if there are any I
 
04:15:32.330 --> 04:15:32.340 align:start position:0%
do have to point out that I need to
 
04:15:34.309 --> 04:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
introduce another worthy measure in
 
04:15:36.950 --> 04:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
another committee at 1 30 PM but
 
04:15:39.769 --> 04:15:39.779 align:start position:0%
fortunately co-sponsor Alicia leckis is
 
04:15:41.809 --> 04:15:41.819 align:start position:0%
in the house and I'm sure she could help
 
04:15:44.330 --> 04:15:44.340 align:start position:0%
address any questions as well thank you
 
04:15:46.929 --> 04:15:46.939 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to take any questions
 
04:15:49.969 --> 04:15:49.979 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh represent
 
04:15:52.670 --> 04:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you Mr chairman uh thank
 
04:15:54.830 --> 04:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
you for uh presenting uh representative
 
04:15:57.290 --> 04:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
moffett's testimony
 
04:15:59.570 --> 04:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
um I was just curious because we've
 
04:16:02.689 --> 04:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
passed a number of statutes
 
04:16:04.849 --> 04:16:04.859 align:start position:0%
um related to the requirement for
 
04:16:08.330 --> 04:16:08.340 align:start position:0%
different policies uh to be passed by
 
04:16:11.750 --> 04:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
local school districts this goes a step
 
04:16:14.389 --> 04:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
further in requiring them to be sent to
 
04:16:16.309 --> 04:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
the department for
 
04:16:18.410 --> 04:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
um and I think the phrase was the
 
04:16:22.490 --> 04:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
shareable best practices folder possibly
 
04:16:25.729 --> 04:16:25.739 align:start position:0%
um but couldn't the same be said for
 
04:16:30.110 --> 04:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
every policy that a school board has
 
04:16:30.120 --> 04:16:32.510 align:start position:0%
every policy that a school board has
probably

04:16:32.510 --> 04:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
probably
 
04:16:36.110 --> 04:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:36.120 --> 04:16:37.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:16:37.370 --> 04:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:40.250 --> 04:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
I think the idea is that this is a new
 
04:16:43.189 --> 04:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
area and there may be school districts
 
04:16:45.590 --> 04:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
that have not yet come up with policies
 
04:16:48.769 --> 04:16:48.779 align:start position:0%
and just by asking them to please send
 
04:16:51.110 --> 04:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
in the policy
 
04:16:53.210 --> 04:16:53.220 align:start position:0%
um that may get them to realize that oh
 
04:16:55.429 --> 04:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
you know we haven't gotten around to
 
04:16:58.670 --> 04:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
that yet maybe we should it's because
 
04:17:01.130 --> 04:17:01.140 align:start position:0%
it's a new and important area that that
 
04:17:02.450 --> 04:17:02.460 align:start position:0%
it's being done
 
04:17:04.910 --> 04:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
I I have a question also and then maybe
 
04:17:06.830 --> 04:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
others do as well
 
04:17:09.290 --> 04:17:09.300 align:start position:0%
um we've had students absent from
 
04:17:09.300 --> 04:17:10.309 align:start position:0%
um we've had students absent from
schools

04:17:10.309 --> 04:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
schools
 
04:17:12.530 --> 04:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
ever since I was school and before I was
 
04:17:15.410 --> 04:17:15.420 align:start position:0%
born for various reasons and there's
 
04:17:18.650 --> 04:17:18.660 align:start position:0%
always been a process for trying to make
 
04:17:23.510 --> 04:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
that work up or to find out what went on
 
04:17:26.450 --> 04:17:26.460 align:start position:0%
why is that not going to suffice now
 
04:17:28.670 --> 04:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about some situations
 
04:17:31.010 --> 04:17:31.020 align:start position:0%
like a grade school where there's a
 
04:17:33.290 --> 04:17:33.300 align:start position:0%
whole lot of different directions going
 
04:17:35.170 --> 04:17:35.180 align:start position:0%
on simultaneously
 
04:17:36.950 --> 04:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
I don't think they're going to get it
 
04:17:38.929 --> 04:17:38.939 align:start position:0%
from streaming so how is streaming going
 
04:17:41.469 --> 04:17:41.479 align:start position:0%
to benefit the absence student
 
04:17:43.790 --> 04:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
especially the elementary and the middle
 
04:17:46.070 --> 04:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
school kid well I guess that's what
 
04:17:48.950 --> 04:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
we'll find out okay because I mean this
 
04:17:51.469 --> 04:17:51.479 align:start position:0%
isn't saying how to do anything all this
 
04:17:53.630 --> 04:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
is saying is what are you doing
 
04:17:57.950 --> 04:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
right and so that would be if a school
 
04:18:00.469 --> 04:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
put in a policy whatever it was that was
 
04:18:03.229 --> 04:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
very effective that could go in the
 
04:18:04.969 --> 04:18:04.979 align:start position:0%
report we this is what we do and it's
 
04:18:07.189 --> 04:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
very effective and then we would know
 
04:18:08.809 --> 04:18:08.819 align:start position:0%
that other schools would know that and
 
04:18:10.969 --> 04:18:10.979 align:start position:0%
might want to consider it yeah I had one
 
04:18:13.010 --> 04:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
follow-up question not on that too do
 
04:18:15.950 --> 04:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
did your group your sponsor which is
 
04:18:18.710 --> 04:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
representative Moffett or yourself work
 
04:18:20.929 --> 04:18:20.939 align:start position:0%
with the school boards Association to
 
04:18:22.929 --> 04:18:22.939 align:start position:0%
determine if there's already boilerplate
 
04:18:25.490 --> 04:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
uh policies out there which are
 
04:18:28.250 --> 04:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
addressing this very issue
 
04:18:32.030 --> 04:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
thank you I wasn't on that subcommittee
 
04:18:33.710 --> 04:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
I know there were a lot of discussions
 
04:18:35.630 --> 04:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
on it because this bill you know was
 
04:18:38.210 --> 04:18:38.220 align:start position:0%
introduced last year
 
04:18:41.150 --> 04:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
um and there may well be but the
 
04:18:43.010 --> 04:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
question is has the school adopted them
 
04:18:44.929 --> 04:18:44.939 align:start position:0%
you know just because there's something
 
04:18:46.729 --> 04:18:46.739 align:start position:0%
available doesn't mean the school has
 
04:18:49.010 --> 04:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
looked at it and adopted it so we want
 
04:18:51.830 --> 04:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
to know you know have you adopted
 
04:18:53.450 --> 04:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
something have you thought about this do
 
04:18:56.290 --> 04:18:56.300 align:start position:0%
you have a policy that's that's okay
 
04:18:59.150 --> 04:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
whatever that policy is and my next
 
04:19:04.450 --> 04:19:04.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:06.210 --> 04:19:06.220 align:start position:0%
oh your blood pressure
 
04:19:06.220 --> 04:19:08.750 align:start position:0%
oh your blood pressure
[Laughter]

04:19:08.750 --> 04:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:19:10.849 --> 04:19:10.859 align:start position:0%
yeah my pressure's high too right about
 
04:19:10.859 --> 04:19:12.889 align:start position:0%
yeah my pressure's high too right about
me

04:19:12.889 --> 04:19:12.899 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:19:15.410 --> 04:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions perhaps in
 
04:19:17.929 --> 04:19:17.939 align:start position:0%
a Luna thank you Mr chair
 
04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
um thanks for taking my question uh you
 
04:19:21.349 --> 04:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
know I think especially after the the
 
04:19:24.290 --> 04:19:24.300 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 61
 
04:19:27.290 --> 04:19:27.300 align:start position:0%
um I'm uh I'm interested in obviously
 
04:19:29.689 --> 04:19:29.699 align:start position:0%
interested in this bill and interested
 
04:19:32.330 --> 04:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
um who would have access to this um
 
04:19:35.630 --> 04:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
collection of policies regarding
 
04:19:37.550 --> 04:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
um classroom recordings and and
 
04:19:40.849 --> 04:19:40.859 align:start position:0%
particularly in classroom Observers I
 
04:19:40.859 --> 04:19:41.769 align:start position:0%
particularly in classroom Observers I
think

04:19:41.769 --> 04:19:41.779 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:19:44.929 --> 04:19:44.939 align:start position:0%
that would be up to the doe it's not
 
04:19:44.939 --> 04:19:47.570 align:start position:0%
that would be up to the doe it's not
specified

04:19:47.570 --> 04:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:49.550 --> 04:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
I mean they would have to come up with
 
04:19:51.469 --> 04:19:51.479 align:start position:0%
the item and I'm not sure what they did
 
04:19:53.750 --> 04:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
with the gifted bill but they would have
 
04:19:56.210 --> 04:19:56.220 align:start position:0%
to come up with rules regarding that I
 
04:19:57.950 --> 04:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
don't think we're asking for anything
 
04:19:57.960 --> 04:19:59.870 align:start position:0%
don't think we're asking for anything
that's

04:19:59.870 --> 04:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:20:03.469 --> 04:20:03.479 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't be possible to be public
 
04:20:05.689 --> 04:20:05.699 align:start position:0%
you know we're not asking how do you
 
04:20:08.269 --> 04:20:08.279 align:start position:0%
observe people in the hallways and keep
 
04:20:10.729 --> 04:20:10.739 align:start position:0%
track of that kind of thing we're asking
 
04:20:13.130 --> 04:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
for their policies for in classroom
 
04:20:17.030 --> 04:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
videoing and for visitation and so
 
04:20:20.030 --> 04:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
that's not going to be
 
04:20:25.370 --> 04:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:27.889 --> 04:20:27.899 align:start position:0%
further follow-up thanks thanks very
 
04:20:31.370 --> 04:20:31.380 align:start position:0%
much and I I I I I have my notes from
 
04:20:33.170 --> 04:20:33.180 align:start position:0%
last year's Bill and there were
 
04:20:35.090 --> 04:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
certainly concerns that had to do uh
 
04:20:37.729 --> 04:20:37.739 align:start position:0%
with safety from from Public Safety
 
04:20:40.849 --> 04:20:40.859 align:start position:0%
professionals and um and school building
 
04:20:43.670 --> 04:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
safety professionals so so I don't feel
 
04:20:45.650 --> 04:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
that what you just said is really an
 
04:20:48.170 --> 04:20:48.180 align:start position:0%
expert opinion but where did you where
 
04:20:50.150 --> 04:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
did you where does that opinion come
 
04:20:50.160 --> 04:20:51.229 align:start position:0%
did you where does that opinion come
from

04:20:51.229 --> 04:20:51.239 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:20:53.030 --> 04:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
where it doesn't have anything to do
 
04:20:59.349 --> 04:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:03.769 --> 04:21:03.779 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about like
 
04:21:06.710 --> 04:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
I agreed with you last time right when
 
04:21:09.170 --> 04:21:09.180 align:start position:0%
it came to the whole what all are we
 
04:21:11.929 --> 04:21:11.939 align:start position:0%
videoing and that kind of stuff are we
 
04:21:13.790 --> 04:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
watching people in the hallways all of
 
04:21:15.530 --> 04:21:15.540 align:start position:0%
that which is not what the this is
 
04:21:20.630 --> 04:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:23.210 --> 04:21:23.220 align:start position:0%
currently are we doing I mean in
 
04:21:25.189 --> 04:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
classroom recording is different than
 
04:21:28.729 --> 04:21:28.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:28.739 --> 04:21:31.330 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:21:31.330 --> 04:21:31.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:34.309 --> 04:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
supervision and that kind of stuff and
 
04:21:36.830 --> 04:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
so follow-up okay sure given the fact
 
04:21:39.530 --> 04:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
that any random person can carry a
 
04:21:41.269 --> 04:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
loaded weapon into a public school
 
04:21:44.210 --> 04:21:44.220 align:start position:0%
building uh do you find any pause when
 
04:21:46.610 --> 04:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
it comes to Public Safety about having
 
04:21:49.250 --> 04:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
any one person being able to have access
 
04:21:52.189 --> 04:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
to a collection of policies with respect
 
04:21:54.889 --> 04:21:54.899 align:start position:0%
to what I can do in terms of entering a
 
04:21:56.689 --> 04:21:56.699 align:start position:0%
school building and sitting in the back
 
04:21:59.389 --> 04:21:59.399 align:start position:0%
of the classroom and observing
 
04:21:59.399 --> 04:22:03.710 align:start position:0%
of the classroom and observing
um

04:22:03.710 --> 04:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:08.809 --> 04:22:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:11.090 --> 04:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
if it has to do with what any random
 
04:22:13.309 --> 04:22:13.319 align:start position:0%
person can do I mean
 
04:22:16.250 --> 04:22:16.260 align:start position:0%
I would hope
 
04:22:18.530 --> 04:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
I can see if the school's policy was
 
04:22:20.570 --> 04:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
anybody who wants to can walk in and sit
 
04:22:22.010 --> 04:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
in the back of the classroom that they
 
04:22:24.349 --> 04:22:24.359 align:start position:0%
might not want that to be public I doubt
 
04:22:28.250 --> 04:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
that any schools have that but yes so I
 
04:22:31.370 --> 04:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
I see your concerns
 
04:22:32.990 --> 04:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
04:22:35.870 --> 04:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you how does this bill
 
04:22:37.610 --> 04:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
accommodate schools who may not be able
 
04:22:39.469 --> 04:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
to provide a policy because it's at the
 
04:22:41.150 --> 04:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
teacher's discretion so it might vary
 
04:22:42.830 --> 04:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
from teacher to teacher from school to
 
04:22:44.510 --> 04:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
school within the district then that
 
04:22:47.030 --> 04:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
would be the policy okay thank you it's
 
04:22:49.969 --> 04:22:49.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:53.570 --> 04:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
I I doubt that a superintendent would we
 
04:22:55.849 --> 04:22:55.859 align:start position:0%
put a report out and maybe that's
 
04:22:58.729 --> 04:22:58.739 align:start position:0%
because I have confidence in them that
 
04:23:01.189 --> 04:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't put a report out that was
 
04:23:04.010 --> 04:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
such detail that it explains exactly how
 
04:23:06.290 --> 04:23:06.300 align:start position:0%
they do videoing and everything but just
 
04:23:08.990 --> 04:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
a policy saying this is public this is
 
04:23:11.210 --> 04:23:11.220 align:start position:0%
not public students can see it students
 
04:23:13.429 --> 04:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
cannot see it you know students can tape
 
04:23:15.229 --> 04:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
it students cannot tape it I mean we're
 
04:23:18.170 --> 04:23:18.180 align:start position:0%
not talking about all the little details
 
04:23:19.849 --> 04:23:19.859 align:start position:0%
we're just talking about a general
 
04:23:22.969 --> 04:23:22.979 align:start position:0%
overview and for most schools who have
 
04:23:26.450 --> 04:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
policies like that it's already
 
04:23:28.729 --> 04:23:28.739 align:start position:0%
um if they have the policy it's probably
 
04:23:31.250 --> 04:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
already in the student handbook and
 
04:23:34.550 --> 04:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing so at any rate but
 
04:23:36.830 --> 04:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
yes I see your your and if and if you
 
04:23:38.389 --> 04:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
have a way of addressing that I would
 
04:23:40.729 --> 04:23:40.739 align:start position:0%
love to hear it maybe we can amend this
 
04:23:42.769 --> 04:23:42.779 align:start position:0%
I I've got a question which I'd like to
 
04:23:44.630 --> 04:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
ask you and follow up to where we are
 
04:23:46.790 --> 04:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
right now on policy is there a
 
04:23:49.729 --> 04:23:49.739 align:start position:0%
definition of policy here now policy
 
04:23:51.830 --> 04:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
where I've always been an administrator
 
04:23:55.370 --> 04:23:55.380 align:start position:0%
has been made by this school board there
 
04:23:57.830 --> 04:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
are certain rules or regulations
 
04:24:00.290 --> 04:24:00.300 align:start position:0%
handbooks developed locally within a
 
04:24:03.590 --> 04:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
school regarding Sports participation
 
04:24:05.510 --> 04:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
um what we do in a disciplinary
 
04:24:07.790 --> 04:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
situation that you know Echoes and
 
04:24:10.130 --> 04:24:10.140 align:start position:0%
oftentimes adjusts with the board policy
 
04:24:14.030 --> 04:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
on it as well so is there what exactly
 
04:24:16.070 --> 04:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
are you looking for are you looking for
 
04:24:20.030 --> 04:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
board policy on these issues or are you
 
04:24:22.429 --> 04:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
looking at procedures developed within a
 
04:24:22.439 --> 04:24:23.450 align:start position:0%
looking at procedures developed within a
school

04:24:23.450 --> 04:24:23.460 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:24:25.849 --> 04:24:25.859 align:start position:0%
or both
 
04:24:27.650 --> 04:24:27.660 align:start position:0%
um it may be that the school just
 
04:24:29.990 --> 04:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
follows the board policy if the school
 
04:24:32.090 --> 04:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
has particular ones from one school to
 
04:24:34.189 --> 04:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
another and they haven't passed it
 
04:24:35.870 --> 04:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
through the board like you said the
 
04:24:39.229 --> 04:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
board usually develops policies then it
 
04:24:43.429 --> 04:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:45.469 --> 04:24:45.479 align:start position:0%
are those board policies and I have a
 
04:24:46.550 --> 04:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
superintendent sitting at the table
 
04:24:49.250 --> 04:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
right now when you pass a board policy
 
04:24:52.130 --> 04:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
it's a public thing exactly so it's
 
04:24:53.570 --> 04:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
already known well that's what I'm
 
04:24:56.150 --> 04:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
saying what we're expecting is a public
 
04:24:58.490 --> 04:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
policy but who knows it they're public
 
04:25:02.809 --> 04:25:02.819 align:start position:0%
not the rest and apparently it's if they
 
04:25:04.969 --> 04:25:04.979 align:start position:0%
haven't adopted a policy this is to get
 
04:25:06.530 --> 04:25:06.540 align:start position:0%
them to think about it I mean really
 
04:25:06.540 --> 04:25:07.490 align:start position:0%
them to think about it I mean really
that

04:25:07.490 --> 04:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:25:10.910 --> 04:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
for me now I don't know about for the
 
04:25:13.490 --> 04:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
bill sponsor but for me as the
 
04:25:16.070 --> 04:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor for me it was just schools
 
04:25:18.290 --> 04:25:18.300 align:start position:0%
should have policies on this because
 
04:25:21.170 --> 04:25:21.180 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of complicated issues and
 
04:25:22.490 --> 04:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
do they
 
04:25:25.550 --> 04:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
and so by saying you need to report your
 
04:25:27.229 --> 04:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
pilot you know you need to send in your
 
04:25:29.389 --> 04:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
policy it's just a way of getting this
 
04:25:31.849 --> 04:25:31.859 align:start position:0%
school or the district or whatever to
 
04:25:33.050 --> 04:25:33.060 align:start position:0%
say huh
 
04:25:35.510 --> 04:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
we don't actually have a policy on this
 
04:25:37.550 --> 04:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
maybe we should this is my last question
 
04:25:40.490 --> 04:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the follow-up to that
 
04:25:43.370 --> 04:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
is it the responsibility the legislature
 
04:25:45.889 --> 04:25:45.899 align:start position:0%
who writes laws
 
04:25:50.210 --> 04:25:50.220 align:start position:0%
to be the party that is now saying you
 
04:25:52.130 --> 04:25:52.140 align:start position:0%
got to do this this and this other words
 
04:25:53.630 --> 04:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
we're sort of closing in on the
 
04:25:56.149 --> 04:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
executive responsibilities when we're
 
04:25:58.450 --> 04:25:58.460 align:start position:0%
telling them you know
 
04:26:01.070 --> 04:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
we know that they have a policy but now
 
04:26:02.269 --> 04:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
we're telling them what they've got to
 
04:26:04.370 --> 04:26:04.380 align:start position:0%
do with these policies
 
04:26:06.469 --> 04:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
um is that our domain or is that more
 
04:26:07.849 --> 04:26:07.859 align:start position:0%
the domain for example of the
 
04:26:09.950 --> 04:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education well do we
 
04:26:12.769 --> 04:26:12.779 align:start position:0%
have a bill that says that they have to
 
04:26:14.750 --> 04:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
have this policy
 
04:26:14.760 --> 04:26:17.149 align:start position:0%
have this policy
okay

04:26:17.149 --> 04:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:26:19.610 --> 04:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
what was that absolutely he's right on
 
04:26:21.950 --> 04:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
that recordings we absolutely do have
 
04:26:23.570 --> 04:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
policy which we pass in fact
 
04:26:25.490 --> 04:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli be glad to tell
 
04:26:27.469 --> 04:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
you that episode
 
04:26:30.290 --> 04:26:30.300 align:start position:0%
um which was a really trying time we
 
04:26:33.290 --> 04:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
took us a couple years to get it right
 
04:26:36.110 --> 04:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
um so uh
 
04:26:37.500 --> 04:26:37.510 align:start position:0%
thanks for bringing that up
 
04:26:37.510 --> 04:26:40.450 align:start position:0%
thanks for bringing that up
[Laughter]

04:26:40.450 --> 04:26:40.460 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:26:44.750 --> 04:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
yeah you got it right my question is is
 
04:26:46.729 --> 04:26:46.739 align:start position:0%
probably a naive question because I
 
04:26:49.250 --> 04:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's applicable in K-12
 
04:26:52.670 --> 04:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
but in universities it's entirely common
 
04:26:55.670 --> 04:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
when visiting speakers come if they
 
04:26:58.010 --> 04:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
require no reports as part of their
 
04:27:00.469 --> 04:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
contract because that's their business
 
04:27:02.809 --> 04:27:02.819 align:start position:0%
they didn't want anybody selling it on
 
04:27:05.689 --> 04:27:05.699 align:start position:0%
site obviously but you know poets and
 
04:27:07.849 --> 04:27:07.859 align:start position:0%
writers and people like that will make
 
04:27:11.090 --> 04:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
these presentations but no recording
 
04:27:13.189 --> 04:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
permitted I don't know who's the
 
04:27:15.110 --> 04:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
authority under which that is said at
 
04:27:17.809 --> 04:27:17.819 align:start position:0%
the institution though so
 
04:27:20.030 --> 04:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
I throw that out for what it sounds like
 
04:27:23.809 --> 04:27:23.819 align:start position:0%
a policy to me well but I mean you don't
 
04:27:26.090 --> 04:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
have Outsiders writing your policies I
 
04:27:28.490 --> 04:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
mean this is the visiting speaker but
 
04:27:30.590 --> 04:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
that that's his part of the contract but
 
04:27:33.349 --> 04:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
somebody has to ratify that and say okay
 
04:27:36.469 --> 04:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
no no and tell everybody else no
 
04:27:36.479 --> 04:27:37.550 align:start position:0%
no no and tell everybody else no
recording

04:27:37.550 --> 04:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
recording
 
04:27:39.950 --> 04:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
I I think at this point forward you know
 
04:27:42.469 --> 04:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
we're starting to get into the decision
 
04:27:46.550 --> 04:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
so questions so if you guys have any
 
04:27:48.950 --> 04:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
great amendments for this that that's be
 
04:27:51.229 --> 04:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
great how to keep it safety issues out
 
04:27:53.450 --> 04:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
of it all of that kind of stuff
 
04:27:55.570 --> 04:27:55.580 align:start position:0%
please thank you very much
 
04:27:57.889 --> 04:27:57.899 align:start position:0%
representative yes
 
04:27:59.269 --> 04:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
thank you just a quick question
 
04:28:00.889 --> 04:28:00.899 align:start position:0%
wondering if the bill sponsor or
 
04:28:03.110 --> 04:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
yourself have already investigated what
 
04:28:05.149 --> 04:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
the best practices are and how they are
 
04:28:06.710 --> 04:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
shared amongst the professional
 
04:28:09.410 --> 04:28:09.420 align:start position:0%
education Community but as I said the
 
04:28:11.630 --> 04:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
these Prime sponsors I read his thing
 
04:28:14.210 --> 04:28:14.220 align:start position:0%
said that he doesn't have answers yet
 
04:28:16.309 --> 04:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
and I myself have talked to lots of
 
04:28:18.410 --> 04:28:18.420 align:start position:0%
people trying to come up with what best
 
04:28:20.389 --> 04:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
practices are and there's all kinds of
 
04:28:22.610 --> 04:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
well it'd be really great if we had the
 
04:28:25.429 --> 04:28:25.439 align:start position:0%
teacher recorded but on the other hand
 
04:28:27.229 --> 04:28:27.239 align:start position:0%
then you could inadvertently get
 
04:28:29.990 --> 04:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
students and that violates privacy and
 
04:28:32.210 --> 04:28:32.220 align:start position:0%
put students out and Etc et cetera so
 
04:28:34.550 --> 04:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
it's a very complicated issue which I
 
04:28:36.229 --> 04:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
think was part of the Prime sponsor's
 
04:28:39.110 --> 04:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
ideas it's a very complicated issue and
 
04:28:40.969 --> 04:28:40.979 align:start position:0%
maybe if somebody has some brilliant
 
04:28:43.370 --> 04:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
ideas it would be a chance for others to
 
04:28:45.110 --> 04:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
see them
 
04:28:47.269 --> 04:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions of
 
04:28:48.889 --> 04:28:48.899 align:start position:0%

the organization has all these
 
04:29:09.170 --> 04:29:09.180 align:start position:0%

uh good afternoon Becky Wilson of the
 
04:29:27.830 --> 04:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire school boards Association
 
04:29:30.710 --> 04:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak on
 
04:29:33.110 --> 04:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
this bill today we are not going to take
 
04:29:35.990 --> 04:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
a position specifically on this bill as
 
04:29:38.269 --> 04:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
last year when a very similar bill came
 
04:29:40.849 --> 04:29:40.859 align:start position:0%
to this committee we simply offered
 
04:29:42.769 --> 04:29:42.779 align:start position:0%
information as to what is already
 
04:29:45.410 --> 04:29:45.420 align:start position:0%
available to this committee and to the
 
04:29:46.910 --> 04:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
general public in terms of school
 
04:29:50.689 --> 04:29:50.699 align:start position:0%
district policies around video audio
 
04:29:53.750 --> 04:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
classroom observations visitor policies
 
04:29:55.969 --> 04:29:55.979 align:start position:0%
Etc so that's what I've brought with me
 
04:29:55.979 --> 04:29:57.130 align:start position:0%
Etc so that's what I've brought with me
today

04:29:57.130 --> 04:29:57.140 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:29:59.750 --> 04:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
there were several questions raised last
 
04:30:02.570 --> 04:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
year in terms of what is available with
 
04:30:05.570 --> 04:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
sample policies Etc current practices of
 
04:30:08.450 --> 04:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
school boards and I think to the
 
04:30:11.030 --> 04:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
sponsors Point earlier originally I
 
04:30:13.070 --> 04:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
think this bill came forward as a result
 
04:30:15.769 --> 04:30:15.779 align:start position:0%
of some concerns that came to light in
 
04:30:17.570 --> 04:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
the middle of the covid pandemic and
 
04:30:19.490 --> 04:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
some of the changes and practices at
 
04:30:22.910 --> 04:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
that time we did advise our members not
 
04:30:25.189 --> 04:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
specific to create policies that were
 
04:30:28.130 --> 04:30:28.140 align:start position:0%
driven from a pandemic lens our belief
 
04:30:29.809 --> 04:30:29.819 align:start position:0%
is that policies are meant to withstand
 
04:30:33.410 --> 04:30:33.420 align:start position:0%
a pretty extensive amount of time in a
 
04:30:35.290 --> 04:30:35.300 align:start position:0%
number of different circumstances not
 
04:30:37.990 --> 04:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
specifically to one kind of situation
 
04:30:40.910 --> 04:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
that is not in our opinion the intention
 
04:30:44.030 --> 04:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
of policies there were a lot of daily
 
04:30:46.010 --> 04:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
practices in schools over the last few
 
04:30:48.349 --> 04:30:48.359 align:start position:0%
years that did change in response to the
 
04:30:50.750 --> 04:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
covet pandemic and they were different
 
04:30:52.550 --> 04:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
in every community and they were in
 
04:30:54.349 --> 04:30:54.359 align:start position:0%
response to that community's needs at a
 
04:30:55.510 --> 04:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
given time
 
04:30:58.969 --> 04:30:58.979 align:start position:0%
based on the communities
 
04:31:01.550 --> 04:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
decision and the community's input onto
 
04:31:04.990 --> 04:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
what kinds of practices and day-to-day
 
04:31:06.889 --> 04:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
procedures would be happening at the
 
04:31:10.210 --> 04:31:10.220 align:start position:0%
school in light of CDC health concerns
 
04:31:12.530 --> 04:31:12.540 align:start position:0%
availability of internet in different
 
04:31:15.050 --> 04:31:15.060 align:start position:0%
parts of the state Etc so we would
 
04:31:16.849 --> 04:31:16.859 align:start position:0%
continue to sort of go down that road
 
04:31:19.070 --> 04:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
and support the fact that policy should
 
04:31:22.130 --> 04:31:22.140 align:start position:0%
not be written specific to the covid
 
04:31:25.729 --> 04:31:25.739 align:start position:0%
pandemic in isolation there are a number
 
04:31:28.010 --> 04:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
of policies that we have given out as
 
04:31:30.950 --> 04:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
sample policies that address all of
 
04:31:32.510 --> 04:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
these kinds of concerns in terms of
 
04:31:34.790 --> 04:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
audio and video surveillance the
 
04:31:37.370 --> 04:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
difference between that and teachers
 
04:31:40.550 --> 04:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
recording a classroom or an experiment
 
04:31:43.189 --> 04:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
for example for an assessment purpose or
 
04:31:45.290 --> 04:31:45.300 align:start position:0%
for teachers observation reflecting
 
04:31:47.450 --> 04:31:47.460 align:start position:0%
Reflections as part of their evaluation
 
04:31:49.910 --> 04:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
process the difference between
 
04:31:52.750 --> 04:31:52.760 align:start position:0%
surveillance audio and video
 
04:31:56.750 --> 04:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
and video for some other purpose
 
04:31:59.149 --> 04:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
schools have to have a policy and an
 
04:32:00.889 --> 04:32:00.899 align:start position:0%
ability for parents to consent to audio
 
04:32:02.510 --> 04:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
and video and circumst certain
 
04:32:04.790 --> 04:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
circumstances outside of things like
 
04:32:08.570 --> 04:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
busing Etc all of those policies are
 
04:32:10.610 --> 04:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
sample policies that we provide to our
 
04:32:12.410 --> 04:32:12.420 align:start position:0%
members and the intention of those
 
04:32:14.389 --> 04:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
sample policies is for districts to take
 
04:32:16.790 --> 04:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
them and tailor them to their specific
 
04:32:19.130 --> 04:32:19.140 align:start position:0%
needs to the questions that had come up
 
04:32:21.110 --> 04:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
earlier we have three types of sample
 
04:32:23.570 --> 04:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
policies policies that are required by
 
04:32:25.450 --> 04:32:25.460 align:start position:0%
law that school boards must have
 
04:32:27.830 --> 04:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
policies that are recommended in light
 
04:32:30.410 --> 04:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
of current laws and policies that are
 
04:32:33.649 --> 04:32:33.659 align:start position:0%
optional that schools can or cannot take
 
04:32:36.349 --> 04:32:36.359 align:start position:0%
up we would also say that the majority
 
04:32:38.510 --> 04:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
if not all of our school districts that
 
04:32:40.670 --> 04:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
our members have all of their policies
 
04:32:42.710 --> 04:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
posted publicly online on their website
 
04:32:44.689 --> 04:32:44.699 align:start position:0%
so if there's a question that somebody
 
04:32:46.189 --> 04:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
wants to go in and see what a certain
 
04:32:48.410 --> 04:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
District requires as part of their
 
04:32:51.830 --> 04:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
policies we would say that most of those
 
04:32:54.610 --> 04:32:54.620 align:start position:0%
are available go ahead and look at those
 
04:32:58.130 --> 04:32:58.140 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that collecting all of the
 
04:33:00.290 --> 04:33:00.300 align:start position:0%
policies at the department would serve
 
04:33:01.910 --> 04:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
any different purpose than what people
 
04:33:03.429 --> 04:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
could already access
 
04:33:05.990 --> 04:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
and superintendents are not the ones
 
04:33:08.510 --> 04:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
that would be responsible so to speak
 
04:33:10.490 --> 04:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
for creating the policies that is a
 
04:33:11.929 --> 04:33:11.939 align:start position:0%
school board
 
04:33:14.390 --> 04:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
um responsibility so
 
04:33:16.609 --> 04:33:16.619 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions in
 
04:33:18.730 --> 04:33:18.740 align:start position:0%
regards to these things but
 
04:33:21.109 --> 04:33:21.119 align:start position:0%
also requiring that any changes to the
 
04:33:22.429 --> 04:33:22.439 align:start position:0%
policies then be sent to the department
 
04:33:24.709 --> 04:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
annually well I realize that doesn't
 
04:33:27.051 --> 04:33:27.061 align:start position:0%
seem like a very big task in some of our
 
04:33:29.390 --> 04:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
districts it's just one more report that
 
04:33:30.890 --> 04:33:30.900 align:start position:0%
the superintendent's office is going to
 
04:33:32.990 --> 04:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
have to try to keep track of from the
 
04:33:34.910 --> 04:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
previous November What policies might
 
04:33:36.830 --> 04:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
have been adjusted that would
 
04:33:38.949 --> 04:33:38.959 align:start position:0%
potentially contain anything to do with
 
04:33:41.510 --> 04:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
observations visitors to schools audio
 
04:33:45.590 --> 04:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
video surveillance Etc it just seems
 
04:33:47.990 --> 04:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
like maybe it's not
 
04:33:49.849 --> 04:33:49.859 align:start position:0%
going to serve the purpose that the
 
04:33:49.859 --> 04:33:50.650 align:start position:0%
going to serve the purpose that the
original

04:33:50.650 --> 04:33:50.660 align:start position:0%
original
 
04:33:54.109 --> 04:33:54.119 align:start position:0%
Bill's intent was meant to cover
 
04:33:54.119 --> 04:33:55.429 align:start position:0%
Bill's intent was meant to cover
um

04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:59.090 --> 04:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
any questions I'm happy to take them
 
04:34:00.709 --> 04:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
rips and Ellison
 
04:34:02.390 --> 04:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair Becky thank you
 
04:34:04.189 --> 04:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
for being here get your clarification
 
04:34:06.709 --> 04:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
you just said that most school districts
 
04:34:08.869 --> 04:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
have most of their policies
 
04:34:12.490 --> 04:34:12.500 align:start position:0%
publicly posted uh if a school district
 
04:34:16.910 --> 04:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
has a policy on classroom recordings you
 
04:34:18.890 --> 04:34:18.900 align:start position:0%
assume that's that's part of the package
 
04:34:20.390 --> 04:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
you're talking about
 
04:34:22.789 --> 04:34:22.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yeah yes I
 
04:34:24.349 --> 04:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
would I mean
 
04:34:26.631 --> 04:34:26.641 align:start position:0%
school boards post their policies
 
04:34:28.369 --> 04:34:28.379 align:start position:0%
publicly they talk about them publicly
 
04:34:30.650 --> 04:34:30.660 align:start position:0%
in board meetings they have multiple
 
04:34:32.269 --> 04:34:32.279 align:start position:0%
readings of those policies at school
 
04:34:34.131 --> 04:34:34.141 align:start position:0%
board meetings which are all public so
 
04:34:35.929 --> 04:34:35.939 align:start position:0%
anything that's contained within that
 
04:34:37.910 --> 04:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
policy and that policy itself once it's
 
04:34:40.490 --> 04:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
approved in our experience would be
 
04:34:42.289 --> 04:34:42.299 align:start position:0%
posted with all of the other policies
 
04:34:44.090 --> 04:34:44.100 align:start position:0%
that are approved there is a difference
 
04:34:44.100 --> 04:34:45.250 align:start position:0%
that are approved there is a difference
between

04:34:45.250 --> 04:34:45.260 align:start position:0%
between
 
04:34:47.869 --> 04:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
policy School Board policy and daily
 
04:34:49.609 --> 04:34:49.619 align:start position:0%
practice and procedures at the school
 
04:34:52.010 --> 04:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
level and I think that's speaking to
 
04:34:53.269 --> 04:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
what some people on the committee have
 
04:34:55.010 --> 04:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
were mentioning earlier
 
04:34:56.750 --> 04:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
um you know the day-to-day practice the
 
04:34:58.429 --> 04:34:58.439 align:start position:0%
procedure of what happens when kids get
 
04:35:00.890 --> 04:35:00.900 align:start position:0%
off the bus at the building level is not
 
04:35:03.890 --> 04:35:03.900 align:start position:0%
necessarily a policy that is a daily
 
04:35:05.390 --> 04:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
practice that might be different from
 
04:35:07.609 --> 04:35:07.619 align:start position:0%
building to building or maybe in some
 
04:35:09.170 --> 04:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
cases from teacher to teacher depending
 
04:35:12.170 --> 04:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
on what the administration allows for
 
04:35:14.269 --> 04:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
that but again it's going to meet the
 
04:35:15.949 --> 04:35:15.959 align:start position:0%
policy that the board has passed
 
04:35:18.590 --> 04:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
whatever those daily practices are
 
04:35:18.600 --> 04:35:19.910 align:start position:0%
whatever those daily practices are
Rick

04:35:19.910 --> 04:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
Rick
 
04:35:23.349 --> 04:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
oh a quick follow-up Vicky then
 
04:35:27.349 --> 04:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
just done theoretically uh of 80 of the
 
04:35:29.330 --> 04:35:29.340 align:start position:0%
school districts in the state have
 
04:35:31.551 --> 04:35:31.561 align:start position:0%
public policies on classroom recordings
 
04:35:33.529 --> 04:35:33.539 align:start position:0%
and they're now public
 
04:35:35.390 --> 04:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
seems to me we pretty much have our
 
04:35:37.689 --> 04:35:37.699 align:start position:0%
folder of best practices right there
 
04:35:44.090 --> 04:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:46.189 --> 04:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
I got a question for you short Friends
 
04:35:49.429 --> 04:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
of the board for the board uh we we've
 
04:35:51.650 --> 04:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
gone and done a similar thing with the
 
04:35:51.660 --> 04:35:52.789 align:start position:0%
gone and done a similar thing with the
gifted

04:35:52.789 --> 04:35:52.799 align:start position:0%
gifted
 
04:35:55.609 --> 04:35:55.619 align:start position:0%
a passes for that you have send them to
 
04:35:58.670 --> 04:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
doe do you know what doe maybe we have
 
04:36:01.131 --> 04:36:01.141 align:start position:0%
doe present now in the room do you know
 
04:36:04.070 --> 04:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
if doe has made these available or are
 
04:36:05.750 --> 04:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
they just sitting on somebody's desk at
 
04:36:09.590 --> 04:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
doe and not serving any kind of a a
 
04:36:11.631 --> 04:36:11.641 align:start position:0%
purpose thank you for the question but I
 
04:36:12.890 --> 04:36:12.900 align:start position:0%
really can't answer that that would be
 
04:36:15.230 --> 04:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
better directed to the Department
 
04:36:16.910 --> 04:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
okay then the follow-up question for you
 
04:36:19.010 --> 04:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
are the policies which you have which
 
04:36:22.189 --> 04:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
are boilerplate that you passed out here
 
04:36:24.890 --> 04:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
um are they available to all districts
 
04:36:27.590 --> 04:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
via the web do you have them available
 
04:36:30.650 --> 04:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
so you I could if I'm a superintendent I
 
04:36:33.170 --> 04:36:33.180 align:start position:0%
just punch it up and there it is thank
 
04:36:35.090 --> 04:36:35.100 align:start position:0%
you for the question yes all of our
 
04:36:37.070 --> 04:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
members are just our board member
 
04:36:37.080 --> 04:36:38.449 align:start position:0%
members are just our board member
districts

04:36:38.449 --> 04:36:38.459 align:start position:0%
districts
 
04:36:40.849 --> 04:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
um have a password protected access to a
 
04:36:42.230 --> 04:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
file that contains all of our sample
 
04:36:44.209 --> 04:36:44.219 align:start position:0%
policies and the majority of
 
04:36:47.090 --> 04:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
superintendent Sports have allowed their
 
04:36:48.769 --> 04:36:48.779 align:start position:0%
superintendents to also have access to
 
04:36:52.070 --> 04:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
that yes thank you welcome
 
04:36:54.529 --> 04:36:54.539 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:36:58.369 --> 04:36:58.379 align:start position:0%
not seeing thank you very much thank you
 
04:37:01.670 --> 04:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
is there any other testimony on the bill
 
04:37:01.680 --> 04:37:03.949 align:start position:0%
is there any other testimony on the bill
131

04:37:03.949 --> 04:37:03.959 align:start position:0%
131
 
04:37:06.109 --> 04:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
not seeing any we're going to close this
 
04:37:10.070 --> 04:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
hearing oh we won Diane oh come on up
 
04:37:10.080 --> 04:37:12.170 align:start position:0%
hearing oh we won Diane oh come on up

04:37:15.709 --> 04:37:15.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:21.730 --> 04:37:21.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:24.349 --> 04:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
good afternoon for the record my name is
 
04:37:26.090 --> 04:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
Diana Fenton I'm an attorney with the
 
04:37:28.070 --> 04:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Education I did not fill
 
04:37:30.051 --> 04:37:30.061 align:start position:0%
out a pink card so I'm in violation of
 
04:37:32.269 --> 04:37:32.279 align:start position:0%
some sort of Regulation I'm sure but I'm
 
04:37:33.769 --> 04:37:33.779 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions as it
 
04:37:34.970 --> 04:37:34.980 align:start position:0%
pertains to the bill before this
 
04:37:36.890 --> 04:37:36.900 align:start position:0%
committee we don't have regulations we
 
04:37:40.010 --> 04:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
have rules perfect even better
 
04:37:43.490 --> 04:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
okay the question I had that when we
 
04:37:45.349 --> 04:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
passed the gifted Bill trying to get
 
04:37:47.810 --> 04:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
these policies in from schools and the
 
04:37:50.631 --> 04:37:50.641 align:start position:0%
concept was that there'd be all those
 
04:37:52.609 --> 04:37:52.619 align:start position:0%
would all be available to various school
 
04:37:54.590 --> 04:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
districts and looking at maybe best
 
04:37:54.600 --> 04:37:56.209 align:start position:0%
districts and looking at maybe best
practices

04:37:56.209 --> 04:37:56.219 align:start position:0%
practices
 
04:37:58.490 --> 04:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
what's the process that the department
 
04:38:00.289 --> 04:38:00.299 align:start position:0%
has right now you've received them
 
04:38:02.990 --> 04:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
what's being done with them thank you
 
04:38:04.490 --> 04:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
for the question it's a great question
 
04:38:07.010 --> 04:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
if you remember the Department's
 
04:38:09.890 --> 04:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
testimony when the gifted bill was being
 
04:38:12.650 --> 04:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
brought forward which came forward in a
 
04:38:14.029 --> 04:38:14.039 align:start position:0%
couple of sessions I think it went
 
04:38:15.709 --> 04:38:15.719 align:start position:0%
forward once it was studied and that
 
04:38:17.631 --> 04:38:17.641 align:start position:0%
came forward again so there's a long
 
04:38:19.551 --> 04:38:19.561 align:start position:0%
history to that bill but the
 
04:38:22.490 --> 04:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
Department's testimony was in part a
 
04:38:25.310 --> 04:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
concern as to what does this committee
 
04:38:27.590 --> 04:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
want the department to do with this bill
 
04:38:30.349 --> 04:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
with this information there is a long
 
04:38:33.650 --> 04:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
history of bills being passed where the
 
04:38:34.670 --> 04:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
department will collect information
 
04:38:37.490 --> 04:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
gather information but there's no uh
 
04:38:39.410 --> 04:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
direction as to what the department does
 
04:38:42.230 --> 04:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
with this and so the department for some
 
04:38:44.090 --> 04:38:44.100 align:start position:0%
time went into a habit of collecting
 
04:38:46.670 --> 04:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
paper and putting it in folders and
 
04:38:48.289 --> 04:38:48.299 align:start position:0%
certainly representative Ellison used to
 
04:38:49.849 --> 04:38:49.859 align:start position:0%
work in the department can can speak to
 
04:38:51.949 --> 04:38:51.959 align:start position:0%
that as well as I and so the
 
04:38:53.869 --> 04:38:53.879 align:start position:0%
Department's testimony in particular
 
04:38:55.849 --> 04:38:55.859 align:start position:0%
with the gifted and talented bill was
 
04:38:57.949 --> 04:38:57.959 align:start position:0%
what is the role of the department what
 
04:39:01.551 --> 04:39:01.561 align:start position:0%
is the expectation and initially it was
 
04:39:03.709 --> 04:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
supposed to be paper copies
 
04:39:06.289 --> 04:39:06.299 align:start position:0%
um now it's electronic and my
 
04:39:08.029 --> 04:39:08.039 align:start position:0%
understanding is that it is on our
 
04:39:11.689 --> 04:39:11.699 align:start position:0%
website it is available uh there are no
 
04:39:13.730 --> 04:39:13.740 align:start position:0%
reports being put into folders that are
 
04:39:16.189 --> 04:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
being put in someone's desk it is on our
 
04:39:17.689 --> 04:39:17.699 align:start position:0%
website available
 
04:39:20.150 --> 04:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
um for people to to utilize and that was
 
04:39:23.209 --> 04:39:23.219 align:start position:0%
done for a purpose it was it was done as
 
04:39:24.769 --> 04:39:24.779 align:start position:0%
part of discussion with this committee
 
04:39:27.109 --> 04:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
as I testified over the summer when this
 
04:39:29.449 --> 04:39:29.459 align:start position:0%
bill was in interim study
 
04:39:31.970 --> 04:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
um again the department would request
 
04:39:34.189 --> 04:39:34.199 align:start position:0%
guidance from this legislative body as
 
04:39:35.810 --> 04:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
to what role the department is to play
 
04:39:38.510 --> 04:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
but I think the idea would be we would
 
04:39:41.090 --> 04:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
create a similar format for these
 
04:39:43.250 --> 04:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
reports as we did for gifted and
 
04:39:43.260 --> 04:39:45.550 align:start position:0%
reports as we did for gifted and
talented

04:39:45.550 --> 04:39:45.560 align:start position:0%
talented
 
04:39:48.948 --> 04:39:48.958 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:39:51.708 --> 04:39:51.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question so earlier we talked
 
04:39:53.448 --> 04:39:53.458 align:start position:0%
I think maybe before you came into the
 
04:39:56.270 --> 04:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
room sure the issue about security
 
04:39:57.948 --> 04:39:57.958 align:start position:0%
as it relates to these particular
 
04:40:01.550 --> 04:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
policies uh and if the department were
 
04:40:05.090 --> 04:40:05.100 align:start position:0%
to collect these and post them on their
 
04:40:08.810 --> 04:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
uh website do you see any concern about
 
04:40:11.208 --> 04:40:11.218 align:start position:0%
potential breach of the security around
 
04:40:11.218 --> 04:40:13.670 align:start position:0%
potential breach of the security around
this

04:40:13.670 --> 04:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:15.890 --> 04:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the bill is that
 
04:40:17.390 --> 04:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
these would all be policies that are
 
04:40:19.970 --> 04:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
public information anyway
 
04:40:22.490 --> 04:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
so certainly the hope would be that
 
04:40:23.990 --> 04:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
there would not be any breach because
 
04:40:26.170 --> 04:40:26.180 align:start position:0%
these are public documents that would
 
04:40:28.730 --> 04:40:28.740 align:start position:0%
remain public
 
04:40:28.740 --> 04:40:29.390 align:start position:0%
remain public
um

04:40:29.390 --> 04:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:30.410 --> 04:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
you know if there is anything
 
04:40:33.970 --> 04:40:33.980 align:start position:0%
confidential and I I'm thinking of the
 
04:40:37.490 --> 04:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
school safety reports and
 
04:40:37.500 --> 04:40:38.330 align:start position:0%
school safety reports and
um

04:40:38.330 --> 04:40:38.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:40.368 --> 04:40:40.378 align:start position:0%
School emergency plans forgive me the
 
04:40:42.430 --> 04:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
school emergency plans
 
04:40:44.868 --> 04:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
my understanding of that law is the
 
04:40:47.030 --> 04:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
department does not collect those we're
 
04:40:49.190 --> 04:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
not a first responder obviously and so
 
04:40:50.930 --> 04:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
we took Great Lengths in that particular
 
04:40:54.470 --> 04:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
Bill to exclude having those documents
 
04:40:57.050 --> 04:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
those blueprints of school buildings
 
04:40:58.850 --> 04:40:58.860 align:start position:0%
anything that could be related to safety
 
04:41:00.830 --> 04:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
so I think if we were to follow the
 
04:41:02.330 --> 04:41:02.340 align:start position:0%
model that we follow for gifted and
 
04:41:04.368 --> 04:41:04.378 align:start position:0%
talented they would have to already be
 
04:41:06.350 --> 04:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
public documents
 
04:41:11.510 --> 04:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:13.190 --> 04:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
of San Luna
 
04:41:16.250 --> 04:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
thanks very much and um and a follow-on
 
04:41:18.830 --> 04:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
to representative myler's question
 
04:41:18.840 --> 04:41:19.990 align:start position:0%
to representative myler's question
um

04:41:19.990 --> 04:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:23.868 --> 04:41:23.878 align:start position:0%
do you do you have any concerns with
 
04:41:28.030 --> 04:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
respect to General Public Access not to
 
04:41:31.430 --> 04:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
individual public documents but to a
 
04:41:34.128 --> 04:41:34.138 align:start position:0%
Statewide collection of public documents
 
04:41:38.330 --> 04:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
so that a one person could make one you
 
04:41:42.010 --> 04:41:42.020 align:start position:0%
know dip into a website get a Statewide
 
04:41:46.788 --> 04:41:46.798 align:start position:0%
portfolio of schools that permit in
 
04:41:49.310 --> 04:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
classroom observers and then doing
 
04:41:59.628 --> 04:41:59.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:01.910 --> 04:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the question I'm not
 
04:42:05.990 --> 04:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
entirely sure how to answer it I I know
 
04:42:07.310 --> 04:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
where you're going with that question
 
04:42:09.948 --> 04:42:09.958 align:start position:0%
the idea being it's a culmination of
 
04:42:12.770 --> 04:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
documents and how can that be used and
 
04:42:14.448 --> 04:42:14.458 align:start position:0%
the answer is I
 
04:42:16.970 --> 04:42:16.980 align:start position:0%
I'm not able to speculate as to how that
 
04:42:19.430 --> 04:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
could be used for for a bad purpose I
 
04:42:21.110 --> 04:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
understand the intent of the bill is to
 
04:42:22.730 --> 04:42:22.740 align:start position:0%
just make it readily available for
 
04:42:24.230 --> 04:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
people to get best practices and
 
04:42:24.240 --> 04:42:25.788 align:start position:0%
people to get best practices and
policies

04:42:25.788 --> 04:42:25.798 align:start position:0%
policies
 
04:42:28.490 --> 04:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
um could it be used for bad purpose I
 
04:42:30.350 --> 04:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
suppose it could you're asking a former
 
04:42:32.930 --> 04:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
criminal prosecutor so I I'm always
 
04:42:35.270 --> 04:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
going to have that view of the world but
 
04:42:36.708 --> 04:42:36.718 align:start position:0%
I certainly understand the intent of the
 
04:42:38.330 --> 04:42:38.340 align:start position:0%
bill and it's been discussed at length
 
04:42:40.670 --> 04:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
especially over the summer and I think
 
04:42:42.770 --> 04:42:42.780 align:start position:0%
the idea was a best practice folder
 
04:42:48.010 --> 04:42:48.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:51.288 --> 04:42:51.298 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks again
 
04:42:53.510 --> 04:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
Diana sure um I'm sorry I didn't thank
 
04:42:55.070 --> 04:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
you last time for uh for taking
 
04:42:57.890 --> 04:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
questions it was inferred so so if we if
 
04:43:01.368 --> 04:43:01.378 align:start position:0%
we can sort of reflect back then on the
 
04:43:03.948 --> 04:43:03.958 align:start position:0%
um the the gifted and talented
 
04:43:06.110 --> 04:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
um uh information
 
04:43:10.850 --> 04:43:10.860 align:start position:0%
um who has access to that right now and
 
04:43:13.550 --> 04:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
um and how much access has there been so
 
04:43:16.670 --> 04:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
far to that collection of data I will
 
04:43:18.470 --> 04:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
answer your second question first I'm
 
04:43:20.810 --> 04:43:20.820 align:start position:0%
not sure how much access
 
04:43:20.820 --> 04:43:21.470 align:start position:0%
not sure how much access
um

04:43:21.470 --> 04:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:22.850 --> 04:43:22.860 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how many people have
 
04:43:25.490 --> 04:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
utilized it I know that it took a while
 
04:43:27.410 --> 04:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
for the Department to
 
04:43:30.050 --> 04:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
um get the website up and running simply
 
04:43:31.430 --> 04:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
because the bill had a pretty long
 
04:43:32.810 --> 04:43:32.820 align:start position:0%
effective date
 
04:43:34.430 --> 04:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
and so I think when we were talking
 
04:43:37.430 --> 04:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
about the gifted and talented bill being
 
04:43:40.010 --> 04:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
up and running we weren't quite there
 
04:43:42.050 --> 04:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
yet so we were working towards it but
 
04:43:43.670 --> 04:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
there was an effective date that that we
 
04:43:45.948 --> 04:43:45.958 align:start position:0%
were guiding our work by
 
04:43:47.750 --> 04:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
um so I have reason to believe that it
 
04:43:49.550 --> 04:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
is up and running I can't tell you how
 
04:43:51.650 --> 04:43:51.660 align:start position:0%
many people have accessed it but like
 
04:43:53.570 --> 04:43:53.580 align:start position:0%
all resources on our website people
 
04:43:56.208 --> 04:43:56.218 align:start position:0%
utilize them when they need them and
 
04:43:58.250 --> 04:43:58.260 align:start position:0%
then we go from there but I can look to
 
04:44:00.650 --> 04:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
see if we have a number but I certainly
 
04:44:02.288 --> 04:44:02.298 align:start position:0%
don't have that information right here
 
04:44:04.190 --> 04:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
you're very welcome
 
04:44:05.868 --> 04:44:05.878 align:start position:0%
are there further questions represent
 
04:44:08.208 --> 04:44:08.218 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you Mr chairman good
 
04:44:10.010 --> 04:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
afternoon Teresa and just a quick
 
04:44:12.830 --> 04:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
question John the people who access doe
 
04:44:15.830 --> 04:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
websites albeit the one that regards the
 
04:44:18.410 --> 04:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
give them talented or you know to the
 
04:44:21.650 --> 04:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
doe track who does that who actually who
 
04:44:24.470 --> 04:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
actually access to that website not to
 
04:44:27.830 --> 04:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
the best of my knowledge and I I'm
 
04:44:29.510 --> 04:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's fine I was probably going to show
 
04:44:32.270 --> 04:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
how computer illiterate I am I I don't
 
04:44:34.490 --> 04:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
know how we would do that
 
04:44:35.990 --> 04:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
um I I don't think we have the ability
 
04:44:38.270 --> 04:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
to do that and to the best of my
 
04:44:40.670 --> 04:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
knowledge we we don't we don't do that I
 
04:44:43.150 --> 04:44:43.160 align:start position:0%
mean our website is a public State
 
04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
website thank you

thank you are there any other further
 
04:44:50.868 --> 04:44:50.878 align:start position:0%
questions for the Department

04:45:00.070 --> 04:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
that will close our hearing for 131
 
04:45:03.170 --> 04:45:03.180 align:start position:0%
and we have one other bill this
 
04:45:07.010 --> 04:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
afternoon that's HB 35

and hb35 is a bill I meant a bill on the
 
04:45:13.260 --> 04:45:16.970 align:start position:0%
and hb35 is a bill I meant a bill on the
C

04:45:23.090 --> 04:45:23.100 align:start position:0%
I know it deals with eating disorders
 
04:45:27.110 --> 04:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:30.350 --> 04:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm missing a sheet here
 
04:45:32.750 --> 04:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
okay the the bill title is requiring
 
04:45:34.788 --> 04:45:34.798 align:start position:0%
student identification cards to include
 
04:45:37.670 --> 04:45:37.680 align:start position:0%

04:46:22.070 --> 04:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:26.090 --> 04:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:28.430 --> 04:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much ah there we go thank
 
04:46:30.288 --> 04:46:30.298 align:start position:0%
you very much for allowing me to
 
04:46:34.910 --> 04:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
introduce HB 35. this bill came to my
 
04:46:37.128 --> 04:46:37.138 align:start position:0%
attention in late August when a
 
04:46:39.948 --> 04:46:39.958 align:start position:0%
constituent of mine Matthew Brown who is
 
04:46:41.990 --> 04:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
currently a freshman at Merrimack High
 
04:46:45.110 --> 04:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
School asked if I would file it and it
 
04:46:47.930 --> 04:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
is to add the helpline for the national
 
04:46:51.350 --> 04:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
Eating Disorders Association to all
 
04:46:55.070 --> 04:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
student identification cards and at that
 
04:46:55.080 --> 04:46:56.030 align:start position:0%
student identification cards and at that
time

04:46:56.030 --> 04:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:46:58.128 --> 04:46:58.138 align:start position:0%
um you know I think those of us
 
04:46:59.690 --> 04:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
especially have been in the house for a
 
04:47:02.150 --> 04:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
while the last thing we want to do is
 
04:47:04.788 --> 04:47:04.798 align:start position:0%
file a bill that solves a problem that
 
04:47:08.448 --> 04:47:08.458 align:start position:0%
we don't have so I asked Matthew to
 
04:47:10.730 --> 04:47:10.740 align:start position:0%
submit a problem statement for me to
 
04:47:12.650 --> 04:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
explain why the spill is needed and what
 
04:47:15.230 --> 04:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
the outcome would be and two things came
 
04:47:18.110 --> 04:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
to mind as soon as I read that uh once
 
04:47:20.570 --> 04:47:20.580 align:start position:0%
he returned it to me as one is he would
 
04:47:22.970 --> 04:47:22.980 align:start position:0%
make a great committee researcher for
 
04:47:24.470 --> 04:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire house so we need to
 
04:47:26.810 --> 04:47:26.820 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind in a few years and
 
04:47:29.770 --> 04:47:29.780 align:start position:0%
second of all this is a profound problem
 
04:47:33.650 --> 04:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
I was not aware of how extensive and how
 
04:47:35.990 --> 04:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
serious and how deadly Eating Disorders
 
04:47:36.000 --> 04:47:36.850 align:start position:0%
serious and how deadly Eating Disorders
are

04:47:36.850 --> 04:47:36.860 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:47:40.970 --> 04:47:40.980 align:start position:0%
in fact there's
 
04:47:40.980 --> 04:47:41.690 align:start position:0%
in fact there's
um

04:47:41.690 --> 04:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:44.448 --> 04:47:44.458 align:start position:0%
you know just those that suffer from
 
04:47:44.458 --> 04:47:45.850 align:start position:0%
you know just those that suffer from
bulimia

04:47:45.850 --> 04:47:45.860 align:start position:0%
bulimia
 
04:47:48.708 --> 04:47:48.718 align:start position:0%
youth are eight to nine times more
 
04:47:51.288 --> 04:47:51.298 align:start position:0%
likely to die than from suicide than
 
04:47:54.770 --> 04:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
their peers in fact Eating Disorders is
 
04:47:59.150 --> 04:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
the second leading cause of suicide
 
04:48:01.850 --> 04:48:01.860 align:start position:0%
um and and especially death among these
 
04:48:05.030 --> 04:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
youth so I I realize the committee may
 
04:48:07.490 --> 04:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
have a concern well why should we add
 
04:48:11.510 --> 04:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
this helpline why is this uh you know
 
04:48:13.310 --> 04:48:13.320 align:start position:0%
what about all these other helplines
 
04:48:15.470 --> 04:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
that that could be added to student IDs
 
04:48:16.610 --> 04:48:16.620 align:start position:0%
you know are we opening up the
 
04:48:20.390 --> 04:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
floodgates but we recognize already how
 
04:48:22.430 --> 04:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
important it was to have the suicide
 
04:48:25.850 --> 04:48:25.860 align:start position:0%
helpline on student IDs and eating
 
04:48:28.270 --> 04:48:28.280 align:start position:0%
disorders feeds into that considerably
 
04:48:30.770 --> 04:48:30.780 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear data from Matthew
 
04:48:33.530 --> 04:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
about how extensive this is but if we
 
04:48:36.708 --> 04:48:36.718 align:start position:0%
can address Eating Disorders through the
 
04:48:38.628 --> 04:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable and largest population
 
04:48:42.970 --> 04:48:42.980 align:start position:0%
of victims we can actually really reduce
 
04:48:45.288 --> 04:48:45.298 align:start position:0%
the numbers of suicide that we
 
04:48:45.298 --> 04:48:47.510 align:start position:0%
the numbers of suicide that we
experience

04:48:47.510 --> 04:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
experience
 
04:48:53.930 --> 04:48:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:59.690 --> 04:48:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:02.208 --> 04:49:02.218 align:start position:0%
and this amendment
 
04:49:02.218 --> 04:49:02.930 align:start position:0%
and this amendment
um

04:49:02.930 --> 04:49:02.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:06.530 --> 04:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
is a result of conversations I've had
 
04:49:08.990 --> 04:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
with people at the national Eating
 
04:49:12.470 --> 04:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
Disorders association their concerns
 
04:49:15.288 --> 04:49:15.298 align:start position:0%
were they prefer the word helpline over
 
04:49:17.930 --> 04:49:17.940 align:start position:0%
hotline and they also were concerned by
 
04:49:19.730 --> 04:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
having a specific number there that it
 
04:49:22.910 --> 04:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
might be changed in the future so I I
 
04:49:25.730 --> 04:49:25.740 align:start position:0%
took that that information to heart and
 
04:49:27.708 --> 04:49:27.718 align:start position:0%
then also yesterday morning I had a
 
04:49:29.868 --> 04:49:29.878 align:start position:0%
conversation with the government Affairs
 
04:49:31.788 --> 04:49:31.798 align:start position:0%
director for the community colleges of
 
04:49:33.110 --> 04:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the Community College
 
04:49:35.208 --> 04:49:35.218 align:start position:0%
systems of New Hampshire Shannon Reed
 
04:49:37.730 --> 04:49:37.740 align:start position:0%
and she raised concerns to me too
 
04:49:39.948 --> 04:49:39.958 align:start position:0%
although she support they support the
 
04:49:42.708 --> 04:49:42.718 align:start position:0%
intent of the of the original bill they
 
04:49:44.990 --> 04:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
have concerns that
 
04:49:46.788 --> 04:49:46.798 align:start position:0%
um it would be very difficult to
 
04:49:49.010 --> 04:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
implement and I'm sure all of us have
 
04:49:51.170 --> 04:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
seen well-intentioned bills that pass
 
04:49:53.868 --> 04:49:53.878 align:start position:0%
but failures in implementing them
 
04:49:56.750 --> 04:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
effectively prevent us from seeking the
 
04:49:58.788 --> 04:49:58.798 align:start position:0%
positive outcomes that we had initially
 
04:50:02.270 --> 04:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
hoped for that bill so the student IDs
 
04:50:05.030 --> 04:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
at the second alert the secondary level
 
04:50:06.770 --> 04:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
are much different than those we see at
 
04:50:09.310 --> 04:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
middle and high school they include
 
04:50:13.788 --> 04:50:13.798 align:start position:0%
keyless entry software meal plan so much
 
04:50:15.830 --> 04:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
information and software on those ID
 
04:50:18.890 --> 04:50:18.900 align:start position:0%
cards and they're only issued once every
 
04:50:21.050 --> 04:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
two years or four years depending on the
 
04:50:25.430 --> 04:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
institution so it it didn't seem like it
 
04:50:27.430 --> 04:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
would be as effective including
 
04:50:30.170 --> 04:50:30.180 align:start position:0%
post-secondary schools in with this bill
 
04:50:34.070 --> 04:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
so I you will see that Amendment takes
 
04:50:36.070 --> 04:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
out any
 
04:50:38.948 --> 04:50:38.958 align:start position:0%
requirement of post-secondary Education
 
04:50:43.310 --> 04:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
institutions to include that helpline it
 
04:50:45.708 --> 04:50:45.718 align:start position:0%
includes the uh the change in the
 
04:50:48.948 --> 04:50:48.958 align:start position:0%
wording to helpline and it also takes
 
04:50:50.810 --> 04:50:50.820 align:start position:0%
out this specific phone number but just
 
04:50:52.850 --> 04:50:52.860 align:start position:0%
asks you know it just says please
 
04:50:54.650 --> 04:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
confirm the exact number when these
 
04:50:57.110 --> 04:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
cards are produced and then the last
 
04:50:59.390 --> 04:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
change I made to it is that I recognize
 
04:51:04.070 --> 04:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
that if this bill makes it way to the
 
04:51:06.948 --> 04:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
governor's desk it may not be it may not
 
04:51:09.708 --> 04:51:09.718 align:start position:0%
become effective until when school
 
04:51:11.448 --> 04:51:11.458 align:start position:0%
districts are already in their new
 
04:51:13.368 --> 04:51:13.378 align:start position:0%
fiscal year and they may have already
 
04:51:17.050 --> 04:51:17.060 align:start position:0%
ordered student cards to use to issue so
 
04:51:20.510 --> 04:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's made so that when new cards are
 
04:51:22.310 --> 04:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
ordered or produced that's when that
 
04:51:26.270 --> 04:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
number would have to be included so if
 
04:51:29.330 --> 04:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
let's say you know fingers crossed the
 
04:51:31.490 --> 04:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
bill passes I don't want to jinx it but
 
04:51:33.590 --> 04:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
let's say you know it passes in Late
 
04:51:35.270 --> 04:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
July when districts have already ordered
 
04:51:36.590 --> 04:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
their set of cards they wouldn't be
 
04:51:38.390 --> 04:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
required to replace those
 
04:51:38.400 --> 04:51:40.070 align:start position:0%
required to replace those
so

04:51:40.070 --> 04:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:51:43.670 --> 04:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
um that is the you know the the the
 
04:51:45.890 --> 04:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
um summary of the bill
 
04:51:48.948 --> 04:51:48.958 align:start position:0%
um the you know what the desired outcome
 
04:51:51.470 --> 04:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
is is to reduce the number of Youth
 
04:51:55.010 --> 04:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
suicides and not even get to the point
 
04:51:57.190 --> 04:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
where our youth has suicide ideation
 
04:51:59.750 --> 04:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
that if they're suffering from an eating
 
04:52:02.448 --> 04:52:02.458 align:start position:0%
disorder they have a very convenient
 
04:52:06.590 --> 04:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
accessible direct way to seek help one
 
04:52:09.948 --> 04:52:09.958 align:start position:0%
that protects their anonymity they don't
 
04:52:11.930 --> 04:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
have to share this information with you
 
04:52:13.310 --> 04:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
know their with their concerns with
 
04:52:15.350 --> 04:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
other people but they can they can get
 
04:52:17.150 --> 04:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
the help right away
 
04:52:20.390 --> 04:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
so I would be happy to answer any
 
04:52:22.670 --> 04:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
questions you have many of your
 
04:52:25.128 --> 04:52:25.138 align:start position:0%
questions may be better suited to have
 
04:52:26.990 --> 04:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
Matthew Brown
 
04:52:29.150 --> 04:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
um answer those so I don't know if he
 
04:52:30.650 --> 04:52:30.660 align:start position:0%
would be welcome to come up at this
 
04:52:32.690 --> 04:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
point Mr chair we're going to take the
 
04:52:35.750 --> 04:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
other Representatives first oh okay just
 
04:52:38.208 --> 04:52:38.218 align:start position:0%
the courtesy which we have
 
04:52:40.128 --> 04:52:40.138 align:start position:0%
um so are there any questions of
 
04:52:41.868 --> 04:52:41.878 align:start position:0%
represented wrong yes representative
 
04:52:43.850 --> 04:52:43.860 align:start position:0%
Cornell Thank you thank you for taking
 
04:52:46.550 --> 04:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
my question I and I may be wrong but I
 
04:52:49.550 --> 04:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
think the suicide and crisis Lifeline
 
04:52:53.570 --> 04:52:53.580 align:start position:0%
number the 911 has counselors that
 
04:52:56.090 --> 04:52:56.100 align:start position:0%
answer the phone and they deal not only
 
04:52:58.550 --> 04:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
with suicide but if it's any emotional
 
04:53:00.530 --> 04:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
crisis they'll make referrals to the
 
04:53:00.540 --> 04:53:03.490 align:start position:0%
crisis they'll make referrals to the
appropriate

04:53:03.490 --> 04:53:03.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:08.208 --> 04:53:08.218 align:start position:0%
Agency number or whatever and I and do
 
04:53:10.910 --> 04:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
you think that would not be as fast as
 
04:53:13.128 --> 04:53:13.138 align:start position:0%
getting another number
 
04:53:14.750 --> 04:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
um on the thing but just call it the
 
04:53:17.030 --> 04:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 and get the referral like I think
 
04:53:19.910 --> 04:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
to the appropriate because it's not just
 
04:53:21.890 --> 04:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
for suicide it's suicide and crisis
 
04:53:24.590 --> 04:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
Lifeline so they could make we you know
 
04:53:26.208 --> 04:53:26.218 align:start position:0%
call and tell them what the problem is
 
04:53:29.110 --> 04:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
and they'll refer you to the correct
 
04:53:32.270 --> 04:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
agency thank you representative Cornell
 
04:53:33.890 --> 04:53:33.900 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
04:53:37.208 --> 04:53:37.218 align:start position:0%
you know it presenting a bill like this
 
04:53:40.070 --> 04:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand who our key
 
04:53:42.708 --> 04:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
audience is and for an adult that would
 
04:53:45.590 --> 04:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
be very reasonable but for someone in
 
04:53:48.410 --> 04:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
adolescence they're not going they may
 
04:53:51.110 --> 04:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
not think that they're at risk for
 
04:53:53.208 --> 04:53:53.218 align:start position:0%
suicide they may not think they are even
 
04:53:55.610 --> 04:53:55.620 align:start position:0%
having a mental health issue but if they
 
04:53:58.070 --> 04:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
see the word eating disorder they're
 
04:54:01.670 --> 04:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
more likely to to make that call also
 
04:54:03.890 --> 04:54:03.900 align:start position:0%
when it's a call and it they're they're
 
04:54:06.050 --> 04:54:06.060 align:start position:0%
they don't have to wait on a referral
 
04:54:10.190 --> 04:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
they they there's an immediacy they may
 
04:54:12.530 --> 04:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
decide to call just on the spur of the
 
04:54:16.610 --> 04:54:16.620 align:start position:0%
moment it may be very spontaneous so for
 
04:54:18.948 --> 04:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
an adolescent who's suffering from an
 
04:54:21.708 --> 04:54:21.718 align:start position:0%
eating disorder that's spiraling
 
04:54:25.190 --> 04:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
um getting a quick easy number for what
 
04:54:27.050 --> 04:54:27.060 align:start position:0%
they recognize is only an eating
 
04:54:29.810 --> 04:54:29.820 align:start position:0%
disorder is probably going to have a
 
04:54:33.890 --> 04:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
higher rate of connection than if they
 
04:54:37.190 --> 04:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
said oh Suicide Hotline or Mental Health
 
04:54:39.948 --> 04:54:39.958 align:start position:0%
crisis line they may not even identify
 
04:54:41.570 --> 04:54:41.580 align:start position:0%
with that as they would in eating
 
04:54:44.628 --> 04:54:44.638 align:start position:0%
disorder and I think
 
04:54:46.368 --> 04:54:46.378 align:start position:0%
talking to students that's what I
 
04:54:48.350 --> 04:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
learned from them as well
 
04:54:51.110 --> 04:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question I have a
 
04:54:51.120 --> 04:54:53.090 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question I have a
question

04:54:53.090 --> 04:54:53.100 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:54:55.788 --> 04:54:55.798 align:start position:0%
um a young person take a middle school
 
04:54:59.270 --> 04:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
kid I'll take that age bracket
 
04:55:02.150 --> 04:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
they are already into maybe the anorexia
 
04:55:03.708 --> 04:55:03.718 align:start position:0%
and bulimia
 
04:55:05.868 --> 04:55:05.878 align:start position:0%
but they don't recognize that they don't
 
04:55:07.910 --> 04:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
recognize that they so how do we deal
 
04:55:09.350 --> 04:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
with this student that doesn't even
 
04:55:11.628 --> 04:55:11.638 align:start position:0%
recognize that they have this eating
 
04:55:11.638 --> 04:55:13.550 align:start position:0%
recognize that they have this eating
disorder

04:55:13.550 --> 04:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
disorder
 
04:55:16.190 --> 04:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
they're not going to call yeah thank you
 
04:55:18.770 --> 04:55:18.780 align:start position:0%
for the question representative Vlad I
 
04:55:22.190 --> 04:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
think I I I'm not an adolescent those
 
04:55:25.128 --> 04:55:25.138 align:start position:0%
days are long gone for me but I think
 
04:55:28.070 --> 04:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
some a an adolescent suffering from
 
04:55:31.730 --> 04:55:31.740 align:start position:0%
bulimia or anorexia is probably going to
 
04:55:33.830 --> 04:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
recognize that isn't it has to do with
 
04:55:36.110 --> 04:55:36.120 align:start position:0%
eating yeah you know like eating
 
04:55:39.590 --> 04:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
disorder they may see that as an
 
04:55:43.250 --> 04:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
obsession they have with food so I I
 
04:55:46.010 --> 04:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
would think that they would relate more
 
04:55:48.050 --> 04:55:48.060 align:start position:0%
to the word eating disorder even if they
 
04:55:50.750 --> 04:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
don't directly identify
 
04:55:52.970 --> 04:55:52.980 align:start position:0%
um that that is like a likely diagnosis
 
04:55:54.708 --> 04:55:54.718 align:start position:0%
they would have
 
04:55:56.750 --> 04:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
um and I I think that they would relate
 
04:55:59.628 --> 04:55:59.638 align:start position:0%
to that more than they would suicide or
 
04:56:02.208 --> 04:56:02.218 align:start position:0%
mental health or crisis
 
04:56:04.610 --> 04:56:04.620 align:start position:0%
I don't know I I think you know it would
 
04:56:06.650 --> 04:56:06.660 align:start position:0%
be interesting to talk just a little
 
04:56:08.030 --> 04:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
differently with the question and did
 
04:56:10.910 --> 04:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
you consult with medical Physicians or
 
04:56:13.670 --> 04:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
hospitals Etc that have
 
04:56:17.810 --> 04:56:17.820 align:start position:0%
uh support for this type of uh illness
 
04:56:21.230 --> 04:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
and ask the question what about these
 
04:56:23.868 --> 04:56:23.878 align:start position:0%
young people
 
04:56:26.448 --> 04:56:26.458 align:start position:0%
that my observation as a school
 
04:56:28.128 --> 04:56:28.138 align:start position:0%
administrator when I saw this happening
 
04:56:31.250 --> 04:56:31.260 align:start position:0%
is they they didn't see it at the kids
 
04:56:34.550 --> 04:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
yet didn't see that as an issue
 
04:56:38.090 --> 04:56:38.100 align:start position:0%
that it came later in their life uh when
 
04:56:40.128 --> 04:56:40.138 align:start position:0%
it was impairing so many of the other
 
04:56:41.990 --> 04:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
functions of the body
 
04:56:46.190 --> 04:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
so my concern is will the kids use this
 
04:56:46.200 --> 04:56:47.090 align:start position:0%
so my concern is will the kids use this
card

04:56:47.090 --> 04:56:47.100 align:start position:0%
card
 
04:56:49.910 --> 04:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
of a young age
 
04:56:53.150 --> 04:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
I I expect so and let me tell you the
 
04:56:56.030 --> 04:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
reason as I Was preparing this bill
 
04:56:57.708 --> 04:56:57.718 align:start position:0%
um I had a conversation with a friend of
 
04:56:59.750 --> 04:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
mine who is a pediatrician for a large
 
04:57:02.150 --> 04:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire practice
 
04:57:04.490 --> 04:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
and I said I want to you know get your
 
04:57:06.830 --> 04:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
feedback on eating disorders and she
 
04:57:09.230 --> 04:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
said it's very coincidental that you
 
04:57:11.270 --> 04:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
bring that up because we have seen a
 
04:57:14.570 --> 04:57:14.580 align:start position:0%
huge increase in the past three months
 
04:57:16.610 --> 04:57:16.620 align:start position:0%
um parents have called because they've
 
04:57:18.650 --> 04:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
noticed an extreme weight loss in their
 
04:57:23.288 --> 04:57:23.298 align:start position:0%
child or if she's having a a a
 
04:57:25.670 --> 04:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
appointment with with one of her
 
04:57:27.948 --> 04:57:27.958 align:start position:0%
patients and she may notice that you're
 
04:57:31.010 --> 04:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
losing weight and a conversation it's
 
04:57:32.930 --> 04:57:32.940 align:start position:0%
something they
 
04:57:35.750 --> 04:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
um may not recognize on their own but
 
04:57:37.970 --> 04:57:37.980 align:start position:0%
they may hear from their parents or
 
04:57:40.250 --> 04:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
their teachers about you know I think
 
04:57:41.810 --> 04:57:41.820 align:start position:0%
you have a I think there's an issue
 
04:57:43.310 --> 04:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
going on I think you may have an eating
 
04:57:45.230 --> 04:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
disorder and it may put something in
 
04:57:46.970 --> 04:57:46.980 align:start position:0%
their head that then they can relate to
 
04:57:49.970 --> 04:57:49.980 align:start position:0%
with the hotline I did review the online
 
04:57:52.010 --> 04:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill I don't know if
 
04:57:54.708 --> 04:57:54.718 align:start position:0%
any of you have but there was a written
 
04:57:56.628 --> 04:57:56.638 align:start position:0%
testimony submitted by a school teacher
 
04:57:59.090 --> 04:57:59.100 align:start position:0%
I don't really know where she was but
 
04:58:02.150 --> 04:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
she also supported this bill because she
 
04:58:04.368 --> 04:58:04.378 align:start position:0%
recognizes the issues with her students
 
04:58:07.368 --> 04:58:07.378 align:start position:0%
and she believes that this hotline will
 
04:58:10.368 --> 04:58:10.378 align:start position:0%
be helped will be a resource to them
 
04:58:14.150 --> 04:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yes representative
 
04:58:15.770 --> 04:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
04:58:19.128 --> 04:58:19.138 align:start position:0%
my question I want to um piggyback on
 
04:58:21.590 --> 04:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
what representative Cornell said um the
 
04:58:24.230 --> 04:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
988 hotline was a response to
 
04:58:26.150 --> 04:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
incorporate suicide and mental health
 
04:58:29.150 --> 04:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
and substance abuse disorders and in an
 
04:58:31.128 --> 04:58:31.138 align:start position:0%
effort to make it simpler for people to
 
04:58:33.350 --> 04:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
get to and I just wonder if adding
 
04:58:35.990 --> 04:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
another full number is kind of
 
04:58:37.850 --> 04:58:37.860 align:start position:0%
counterintuitive to the way that that
 
04:58:39.470 --> 04:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
that's trending
 
04:58:40.610 --> 04:58:40.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:58:43.368 --> 04:58:43.378 align:start position:0%
representative dry as I mentioned before
 
04:58:45.708 --> 04:58:45.718 align:start position:0%
I think how we might respond to seeing a
 
04:58:47.750 --> 04:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
number like that may be different than
 
04:58:50.690 --> 04:58:50.700 align:start position:0%
what an adolescent responds to they may
 
04:58:54.530 --> 04:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
see that that that General number or the
 
04:58:56.830 --> 04:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
the the uh
 
04:58:59.330 --> 04:58:59.340 align:start position:0%
Clearinghouse number as something that
 
04:59:00.890 --> 04:59:00.900 align:start position:0%
doesn't relate to them they're really
 
04:59:02.750 --> 04:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
just looking specifically at Eating
 
04:59:06.050 --> 04:59:06.060 align:start position:0%
Disorders they may have you know been in
 
04:59:07.970 --> 04:59:07.980 align:start position:0%
conversation with their parents or their
 
04:59:10.250 --> 04:59:10.260 align:start position:0%
teacher or their friend's parents who
 
04:59:11.570 --> 04:59:11.580 align:start position:0%
might have suspect they have an eating
 
04:59:15.170 --> 04:59:15.180 align:start position:0%
disorder I don't think that that
 
04:59:18.650 --> 04:59:18.660 align:start position:0%
realization that they need help would
 
04:59:21.770 --> 04:59:21.780 align:start position:0%
would connect with them to that a
 
04:59:23.208 --> 04:59:23.218 align:start position:0%
Clearinghouse where they could more
 
04:59:25.430 --> 04:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
easily collect something specific for
 
04:59:27.830 --> 04:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
eating disorders
 
04:59:30.230 --> 04:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
um and I do recognize that you know
 
04:59:32.510 --> 04:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of helplines out there
 
04:59:34.550 --> 04:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
but when you look at the numbers of
 
04:59:38.150 --> 04:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
eating disorders and how it in in fact
 
04:59:41.510 --> 04:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
more students of color and more students
 
04:59:44.628 --> 04:59:44.638 align:start position:0%
in the LBGTQ Community have a much
 
04:59:47.390 --> 04:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
higher rate of suffering from suicide or
 
04:59:49.190 --> 04:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
dying from suicide it's because they've
 
04:59:51.708 --> 04:59:51.718 align:start position:0%
suffered from eating disorders so it's
 
04:59:53.390 --> 04:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
almost as though we look at Eating
 
04:59:55.250 --> 04:59:55.260 align:start position:0%
Disorders as just a very specific
 
04:59:57.890 --> 04:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
helpline but it really can Encompass so
 
04:59:59.690 --> 04:59:59.700 align:start position:0%
many other
 
05:00:02.990 --> 05:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
um issues because that are manifested in
 
05:00:04.970 --> 05:00:04.980 align:start position:0%
eating disorders
 
05:00:06.830 --> 05:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
thank you as a further question
 
05:00:08.930 --> 05:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock thank you Mr
 
05:00:10.730 --> 05:00:10.740 align:start position:0%
chairman from the wrong good afternoon
 
05:00:12.708 --> 05:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you for taking my
 
05:00:14.270 --> 05:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
question of two of them to Chairman
 
05:00:19.128 --> 05:00:19.138 align:start position:0%
loudly uh in uh line uh one actually of
 
05:00:21.230 --> 05:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
your Amendment you you talked about
 
05:00:23.990 --> 05:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
grades six I was trying to figure out uh
 
05:00:27.350 --> 05:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
two things if school not that they would
 
05:00:28.850 --> 05:00:28.860 align:start position:0%
be applicable particularly at grades one
 
05:00:32.570 --> 05:00:32.580 align:start position:0%
to six but do school give out uh ID
 
05:00:34.730 --> 05:00:34.740 align:start position:0%
cards the youngsters of the students in
 
05:00:37.128 --> 05:00:37.138 align:start position:0%
grades one through five
 
05:00:40.610 --> 05:00:40.620 align:start position:0%
not to my knowledge in fact I'm pretty
 
05:00:42.530 --> 05:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
sure they don't because I've been
 
05:00:45.288 --> 05:00:45.298 align:start position:0%
serving as a substitute in those grades
 
05:00:49.250 --> 05:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
kindergarten through grade four and now
 
05:00:50.570 --> 05:00:50.580 align:start position:0%
this has only been in the Merrimack
 
05:00:53.150 --> 05:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
School District but I there I don't see
 
05:00:56.090 --> 05:00:56.100 align:start position:0%
any student IDs but I do know
 
05:00:58.550 --> 05:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
um the middle school does and the high
 
05:01:01.788 --> 05:01:01.798 align:start position:0%
school does I I praise that because I
 
05:01:03.470 --> 05:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
was thinking about what representative
 
05:01:06.650 --> 05:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
Ladd had if I think Matt what were other
 
05:01:08.810 --> 05:01:08.820 align:start position:0%
than that had indicated uh asking about
 
05:01:10.850 --> 05:01:10.860 align:start position:0%
if students knew or could identify if
 
05:01:12.470 --> 05:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
that was a disorder at their grade I'm
 
05:01:14.090 --> 05:01:14.100 align:start position:0%
assuming that in the Middle School
 
05:01:15.770 --> 05:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
curriculum for health officer they
 
05:01:17.810 --> 05:01:17.820 align:start position:0%
receive some initial dialogue understand
 
05:01:20.570 --> 05:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
discussion in that piece so I want to go
 
05:01:22.610 --> 05:01:22.620 align:start position:0%
about the parent
 
05:01:26.510 --> 05:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
who may um see a youngster student uh
 
05:01:29.270 --> 05:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
his ID and recognize that their child
 
05:01:31.788 --> 05:01:31.798 align:start position:0%
has the issue uh and also use that so
 
05:01:34.010 --> 05:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
this point why why if it would be more
 
05:01:36.530 --> 05:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
applicable to have student IDs period
 
05:01:40.250 --> 05:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
K-12 but when if whatever you wherever
 
05:01:42.530 --> 05:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
you agree the school system implements
 
05:01:44.208 --> 05:01:44.218 align:start position:0%
them that that would be on there versus
 
05:01:46.788 --> 05:01:46.798 align:start position:0%
starting at grade six so if in uh
 
05:01:49.270 --> 05:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
Margaret's school with grade five and
 
05:01:51.830 --> 05:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
grade seven but once the school district
 
05:01:53.810 --> 05:01:53.820 align:start position:0%
Implement period that that extended
 
05:01:55.850 --> 05:01:55.860 align:start position:0%
thing I'm saying yes I see six that's
 
05:01:57.470 --> 05:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
all that that was like that so I was
 
05:01:58.610 --> 05:01:58.620 align:start position:0%
wondering why you picked six in
 
05:01:58.620 --> 05:01:59.930 align:start position:0%
wondering why you picked six in
particular

05:01:59.930 --> 05:01:59.940 align:start position:0%
particular
 
05:02:02.390 --> 05:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
um I picked six because I believe that
 
05:02:04.250 --> 05:02:04.260 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the question
 
05:02:07.190 --> 05:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
um I I believe that was the grade for
 
05:02:09.590 --> 05:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
the suicide helpline that was in the
 
05:02:12.650 --> 05:02:12.660 align:start position:0%
previous last year's legislation
 
05:02:16.070 --> 05:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
um and just to my knowledge that's
 
05:02:18.288 --> 05:02:18.298 align:start position:0%
usually Indica indicative of Middle
 
05:02:20.570 --> 05:02:20.580 align:start position:0%
School Age and and I do know IDs are
 
05:02:22.910 --> 05:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
issued for I believe most middle schools
 
05:02:25.910 --> 05:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
now I mean there's nothing that prevents
 
05:02:28.070 --> 05:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
a school that may offer IDs at a younger
 
05:02:30.650 --> 05:02:30.660 align:start position:0%
age from putting it on it's just they
 
05:02:33.650 --> 05:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be compelled to by Statute I
 
05:02:35.628 --> 05:02:35.638 align:start position:0%
was thinking okay if an amendment would
 
05:02:37.910 --> 05:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
follow the ad hat that the school ID
 
05:02:40.910 --> 05:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
period is not great so it is there I was
 
05:02:42.650 --> 05:02:42.660 align:start position:0%
thinking more of the parent of a middle
 
05:02:44.208 --> 05:02:44.218 align:start position:0%
school young service homeless to see
 
05:02:46.368 --> 05:02:46.378 align:start position:0%
that in our grade five child can see
 
05:02:48.288 --> 05:02:48.298 align:start position:0%
this oh wow thank you that's all thank
 
05:02:50.330 --> 05:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:02:52.128 --> 05:02:52.138 align:start position:0%
uh representative Ford
 
05:02:54.590 --> 05:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:02:57.350 --> 05:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question is there a parallel
 
05:03:01.510 --> 05:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
yeah excuse me is there a parallel or
 
05:03:05.810 --> 05:03:05.820 align:start position:0%
tandem process by which parents are
 
05:03:08.770 --> 05:03:08.780 align:start position:0%
advised of this not maybe specifically
 
05:03:12.110 --> 05:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
their child but in the eighth grade we
 
05:03:14.868 --> 05:03:14.878 align:start position:0%
begin to notice sort of no thing that
 
05:03:17.208 --> 05:03:17.218 align:start position:0%
goes out to them that makes them aware
 
05:03:19.670 --> 05:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
of the same concerns not maybe
 
05:03:22.250 --> 05:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
specifically to their child but to
 
05:03:25.430 --> 05:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
children in that age group or that
 
05:03:29.810 --> 05:03:29.820 align:start position:0%
series of uh areas of age and grade
 
05:03:32.690 --> 05:03:32.700 align:start position:0%
level that you're concerned about do
 
05:03:37.010 --> 05:03:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:38.330 --> 05:03:38.340 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much for the question
 
05:03:40.610 --> 05:03:40.620 align:start position:0%
representative Ford
 
05:03:43.368 --> 05:03:43.378 align:start position:0%
um I don't unless they have a child that
 
05:03:46.368 --> 05:03:46.378 align:start position:0%
has an ID card that they may look at and
 
05:03:48.170 --> 05:03:48.180 align:start position:0%
notice that this this helpline is
 
05:03:50.690 --> 05:03:50.700 align:start position:0%
printed I'm not sure they would be aware
 
05:03:53.208 --> 05:03:53.218 align:start position:0%
of it unless they actively sought out
 
05:03:55.250 --> 05:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
maybe you know searched on the internet
 
05:03:58.310 --> 05:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
under Eating Disorders one thing I
 
05:04:01.490 --> 05:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
learned from my friend is that many
 
05:04:03.170 --> 05:04:03.180 align:start position:0%
people will call you know if they have a
 
05:04:04.788 --> 05:04:04.798 align:start position:0%
concern they may reach out to their
 
05:04:07.010 --> 05:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
physician and say I you know I'm
 
05:04:09.948 --> 05:04:09.958 align:start position:0%
concerned my son or daughter's friend
 
05:04:12.410 --> 05:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
seems to be losing weight is there
 
05:04:14.990 --> 05:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
anything I can do or is there you know
 
05:04:17.448 --> 05:04:17.458 align:start position:0%
may reach out if or give them some
 
05:04:19.070 --> 05:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
advice or information they might share
 
05:04:21.650 --> 05:04:21.660 align:start position:0%
with the parent or Guardian
 
05:04:23.628 --> 05:04:23.638 align:start position:0%
um but this really just pertains to the
 
05:04:25.128 --> 05:04:25.138 align:start position:0%
student IDs
 
05:04:29.208 --> 05:04:29.218 align:start position:0%
I understand uh that and thank you it
 
05:04:31.670 --> 05:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
just struck me that maybe there was a
 
05:04:34.368 --> 05:04:34.378 align:start position:0%
way to reach them through a side door as
 
05:04:35.690 --> 05:04:35.700 align:start position:0%
well yeah
 
05:04:39.830 --> 05:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
well also I mean I I am aware and this
 
05:04:41.270 --> 05:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
is after you know
 
05:04:42.948 --> 05:04:42.958 align:start position:0%
you know work on the bill is that you
 
05:04:45.730 --> 05:04:45.740 align:start position:0%
know schools and curricula do do
 
05:04:49.070 --> 05:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
communication and education on on eating
 
05:04:51.530 --> 05:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
disorders in general
 
05:04:55.550 --> 05:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
I think and and I hope after reading the
 
05:04:57.948 --> 05:04:57.958 align:start position:0%
the research that I've done and I I did
 
05:05:00.110 --> 05:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
email everyone a copy of some of the
 
05:05:01.850 --> 05:05:01.860 align:start position:0%
most prominent research academic
 
05:05:04.070 --> 05:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
research uh I emailed that out last
 
05:05:07.430 --> 05:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
night my source is for this data but um
 
05:05:09.050 --> 05:05:09.060 align:start position:0%
I anticipate there's going to be a lot
 
05:05:10.970 --> 05:05:10.980 align:start position:0%
more communication on this because it is
 
05:05:13.010 --> 05:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
a it's very extensive and serious
 
05:05:14.930 --> 05:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
problem I mean to be the number one
 
05:05:17.090 --> 05:05:17.100 align:start position:0%
cause of number one number two I forget
 
05:05:20.150 --> 05:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
if opioid addiction where that stands
 
05:05:24.530 --> 05:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
but eating disorders is a major
 
05:05:28.310 --> 05:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
um uh reason for suicide
 
05:05:30.110 --> 05:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
05:05:32.690 --> 05:05:32.700 align:start position:0%
I've represented wrong I'm seeing thank
 
05:05:34.550 --> 05:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you very much uh
 
05:05:36.110 --> 05:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner are you going to
 
05:05:40.970 --> 05:05:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:44.510 --> 05:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
okay someone is wrong thank you chairman
 
05:05:47.208 --> 05:05:47.218 align:start position:0%
lad uh for the record I'm representative
 
05:05:49.970 --> 05:05:49.980 align:start position:0%
Linda Tanner Sullivan number five
 
05:05:52.670 --> 05:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
the towns of Sunapee and Springfield
 
05:05:56.030 --> 05:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
and as a 35-year teacher of health and
 
05:05:58.190 --> 05:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
physical education and coaching many
 
05:06:00.708 --> 05:06:00.718 align:start position:0%
women's sports over the over the time
 
05:06:02.690 --> 05:06:02.700 align:start position:0%
that I was working
 
05:06:05.150 --> 05:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
um Eating Disorders were probably the
 
05:06:06.770 --> 05:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
most frustrating and difficult to deal
 
05:06:10.128 --> 05:06:10.138 align:start position:0%
with and I know that um representative
 
05:06:12.410 --> 05:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
Damon is up next to me
 
05:06:14.390 --> 05:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
um and she's a health professional who's
 
05:06:17.090 --> 05:06:17.100 align:start position:0%
dealt with eating disorders so I'm sure
 
05:06:19.250 --> 05:06:19.260 align:start position:0%
she can give you a lot of information
 
05:06:21.650 --> 05:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
I think my job here is just to tell you
 
05:06:24.070 --> 05:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
that it is a big problem
 
05:06:27.670 --> 05:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
body image is a huge problem with kids
 
05:06:30.350 --> 05:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
both boys and girls sometimes we think
 
05:06:32.330 --> 05:06:32.340 align:start position:0%
it's just a girl's problem but it's it
 
05:06:35.510 --> 05:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
relates to boys as well it often starts
 
05:06:37.730 --> 05:06:37.740 align:start position:0%
out with experimenting a little bit
 
05:06:37.740 --> 05:06:39.110 align:start position:0%
out with experimenting a little bit
about

05:06:39.110 --> 05:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:06:41.890 --> 05:06:41.900 align:start position:0%
um or worried about their your own body
 
05:06:45.650 --> 05:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
size and then it just it snowballs on
 
05:06:47.930 --> 05:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
them and oftentimes uh by the you know
 
05:06:50.050 --> 05:06:50.060 align:start position:0%
it changes their brain
 
05:06:52.670 --> 05:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
patterns it changes a lot of things in
 
05:06:56.030 --> 05:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
their life and the parents are usually
 
05:06:59.110 --> 05:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
um from from my experience as frustrated
 
05:07:01.970 --> 05:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
with it as anybody
 
05:07:04.730 --> 05:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
um because it's it's just a a super
 
05:07:07.128 --> 05:07:07.138 align:start position:0%
difficult thing to deal with
 
05:07:10.190 --> 05:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
um it's a very secretive problem kids as
 
05:07:12.890 --> 05:07:12.900 align:start position:0%
I said kids will start out kind of um
 
05:07:15.230 --> 05:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
experimenting with their food intake or
 
05:07:17.750 --> 05:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
throwing up bulimia
 
05:07:20.750 --> 05:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
um exercising was another thing
 
05:07:23.150 --> 05:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
um you know that I the some of the
 
05:07:25.970 --> 05:07:25.980 align:start position:0%
people that were really into Eating
 
05:07:28.368 --> 05:07:28.378 align:start position:0%
Disorders uh badly into it really wanted
 
05:07:31.730 --> 05:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
to exercise all the time and it's a very
 
05:07:31.740 --> 05:07:32.830 align:start position:0%
to exercise all the time and it's a very
lonely

05:07:32.830 --> 05:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
lonely
 
05:07:35.810 --> 05:07:35.820 align:start position:0%
disorder and so a lot of these kids are
 
05:07:37.368 --> 05:07:37.378 align:start position:0%
very isolated
 
05:07:37.378 --> 05:07:38.090 align:start position:0%
very isolated
um

05:07:38.090 --> 05:07:38.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:38.100 --> 05:07:40.190 align:start position:0%
um
their

05:07:40.190 --> 05:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:07:43.368 --> 05:07:43.378 align:start position:0%
their having difficulties on a lot of
 
05:07:45.590 --> 05:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
different levels and
 
05:07:49.128 --> 05:07:49.138 align:start position:0%
um they often won't ask for help and if
 
05:07:50.570 --> 05:07:50.580 align:start position:0%
someone mentions something about their
 
05:07:52.850 --> 05:07:52.860 align:start position:0%
body image it just makes things worse
 
05:07:55.368 --> 05:07:55.378 align:start position:0%
and they they guard against it
 
05:07:58.610 --> 05:07:58.620 align:start position:0%
um so I think a hotline like this was is
 
05:08:01.730 --> 05:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
a great idea when Rosemarie presented it
 
05:08:03.350 --> 05:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
I thought it was a great idea I think it
 
05:08:05.090 --> 05:08:05.100 align:start position:0%
would also be a great idea to have
 
05:08:07.730 --> 05:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
posters around and also in maybe the
 
05:08:09.708 --> 05:08:09.718 align:start position:0%
student parent handbook as
 
05:08:12.770 --> 05:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
representative Ford had because even
 
05:08:14.990 --> 05:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
though we have a suicide hotline and we
 
05:08:17.750 --> 05:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
have a general 9-1-1 emergency hotline
 
05:08:20.810 --> 05:08:20.820 align:start position:0%
and I really and I super super support
 
05:08:24.590 --> 05:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
those and realize what good they do
 
05:08:24.600 --> 05:08:25.250 align:start position:0%
those and realize what good they do
um

05:08:25.250 --> 05:08:25.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:28.788 --> 05:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
and I think even last year when we had
 
05:08:31.670 --> 05:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
the suicide hotline and and putting on
 
05:08:34.010 --> 05:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
the cards was a great idea
 
05:08:36.170 --> 05:08:36.180 align:start position:0%
um having something that's just eating
 
05:08:38.930 --> 05:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
disorders where immediately they don't
 
05:08:40.850 --> 05:08:40.860 align:start position:0%
go through two or three levels of people
 
05:08:43.190 --> 05:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
referring them to somebody else because
 
05:08:45.350 --> 05:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
it's a with kids it's a spur of the
 
05:08:47.990 --> 05:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
moment thing they they suddenly get to a
 
05:08:50.030 --> 05:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
crisis situation or something happens
 
05:08:52.670 --> 05:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
that keys with them that something's
 
05:08:55.070 --> 05:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
drastically wrong and it might even be a
 
05:08:57.410 --> 05:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
friend who is very concerned about
 
05:08:59.930 --> 05:08:59.940 align:start position:0%
another friend
 
05:09:02.030 --> 05:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
um at that point if they have something
 
05:09:03.708 --> 05:09:03.718 align:start position:0%
in their hand if they know something and
 
05:09:05.448 --> 05:09:05.458 align:start position:0%
it's right there and they can they can
 
05:09:07.910 --> 05:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
get to it and it's going to be
 
05:09:10.250 --> 05:09:10.260 align:start position:0%
um responsive right away I think it's
 
05:09:12.770 --> 05:09:12.780 align:start position:0%
it's really great and I would suggest as
 
05:09:16.910 --> 05:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
we did with suicide lines that um and I
 
05:09:19.910 --> 05:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
looked to the um add-on TV that says you
 
05:09:21.708 --> 05:09:21.718 align:start position:0%
know I'm trying not to be my parents but
 
05:09:22.910 --> 05:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
I think
 
05:09:27.050 --> 05:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
um texting and chat are really big on
 
05:09:29.510 --> 05:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
the on this level versus telephoning
 
05:09:32.510 --> 05:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
that's kind of old school now so I think
 
05:09:35.090 --> 05:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
if there's a text number or if there's a
 
05:09:37.550 --> 05:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
way for them to enter into a chat
 
05:09:39.530 --> 05:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
um then they get immediate response and
 
05:09:41.868 --> 05:09:41.878 align:start position:0%
it's with a professional who knows just
 
05:09:44.990 --> 05:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
about eating disorders so I guess my
 
05:09:47.330 --> 05:09:47.340 align:start position:0%
main thing is to just say yes it is a
 
05:09:50.810 --> 05:09:50.820 align:start position:0%
problem I dealt with it many many times
 
05:09:50.820 --> 05:09:51.410 align:start position:0%
problem I dealt with it many many times
um

05:09:51.410 --> 05:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:54.250 --> 05:09:54.260 align:start position:0%
it was frustrating uh
 
05:09:57.770 --> 05:09:57.780 align:start position:0%
oftentimes it um it didn't resolve in
 
05:10:00.650 --> 05:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
suicide but it was a lifelong problem
 
05:10:02.628 --> 05:10:02.638 align:start position:0%
I'm still in contact with one of the
 
05:10:04.868 --> 05:10:04.878 align:start position:0%
young ladies that was on a tennis team
 
05:10:07.910 --> 05:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
and she still struggles with it as an
 
05:10:10.010 --> 05:10:10.020 align:start position:0%
adult I mean she's got to be in her 50s
 
05:10:10.020 --> 05:10:11.150 align:start position:0%
adult I mean she's got to be in her 50s
now

05:10:11.150 --> 05:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:10:14.090 --> 05:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
um and so it it's a lifelong thing and
 
05:10:17.750 --> 05:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
it can affect in later life osteoporosis
 
05:10:20.270 --> 05:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
it becomes really a big major problem
 
05:10:23.390 --> 05:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
and all their organs have problems with
 
05:10:26.570 --> 05:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
it as well so I urge all of you to
 
05:10:28.788 --> 05:10:28.798 align:start position:0%
support this and I'm hoping through a
 
05:10:30.530 --> 05:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
couple of amendments we can even make it
 
05:10:32.868 --> 05:10:32.878 align:start position:0%
better thank you are there any questions
 
05:10:34.670 --> 05:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
for representative Tanner
 
05:10:36.830 --> 05:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
Griffin Woodcock thank you Mr chairman
 
05:10:38.570 --> 05:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
brother Terry it's a quick question in
 
05:10:41.030 --> 05:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
your career in the health domain not the
 
05:10:42.830 --> 05:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
physical education domain at what grade
 
05:10:44.868 --> 05:10:44.878 align:start position:0%
level did you start integrating uh
 
05:10:47.750 --> 05:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
Dialogue on uh Eating Disorders well the
 
05:10:49.910 --> 05:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
the problem is it starts very early I
 
05:10:52.550 --> 05:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
mean now we're finding or hearing about
 
05:10:55.190 --> 05:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh young people you know
 
05:10:55.200 --> 05:10:55.910 align:start position:0%
uh young people you know
um

05:10:55.910 --> 05:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:59.030 --> 05:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
second first second grade actually being
 
05:11:01.910 --> 05:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
cons or even before that watching TV and
 
05:11:03.650 --> 05:11:03.660 align:start position:0%
being concerned about their body image
 
05:11:05.750 --> 05:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
and and what all of a sudden what
 
05:11:08.030 --> 05:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
they're eating I mean usually in the old
 
05:11:10.430 --> 05:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
times it was trying to get them to you
 
05:11:13.070 --> 05:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
know it was uh or get them off junk food
 
05:11:15.590 --> 05:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
or something like that but now it's a
 
05:11:18.110 --> 05:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
problem and so you know they they see
 
05:11:19.970 --> 05:11:19.980 align:start position:0%
that they kind of think well you know
 
05:11:21.650 --> 05:11:21.660 align:start position:0%
they hear a little bit about it and then
 
05:11:23.868 --> 05:11:23.878 align:start position:0%
by the time they get to Middle School it
 
05:11:25.910 --> 05:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
can be so ingrained I mean it gets to a
 
05:11:28.250 --> 05:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
point where their brain chemistry
 
05:11:30.590 --> 05:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
changes so much from the eating disorder
 
05:11:33.230 --> 05:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
that they they can stand in front of a
 
05:11:35.690 --> 05:11:35.700 align:start position:0%
mirror and actually be look like a
 
05:11:38.930 --> 05:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
skeleton and pick skin out and say it's
 
05:11:38.940 --> 05:11:40.670 align:start position:0%
skeleton and pick skin out and say it's
fat

05:11:40.670 --> 05:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
fat
 
05:11:44.030 --> 05:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
um and they have they lose I mean the
 
05:11:46.010 --> 05:11:46.020 align:start position:0%
tennis player one of the things with
 
05:11:48.948 --> 05:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
that struck me was in high school tennis
 
05:11:51.470 --> 05:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
we call our own lines
 
05:11:53.750 --> 05:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
um you don't have referees like you do
 
05:11:55.490 --> 05:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
in basketball and soccer and stuff like
 
05:11:58.910 --> 05:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
that and I would have complaints by the
 
05:12:01.010 --> 05:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
other team that this girl was called
 
05:12:04.970 --> 05:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
just terrible at calling the lines and
 
05:12:06.830 --> 05:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
um would sit down talk with her and and
 
05:12:09.110 --> 05:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
she really couldn't
 
05:12:11.930 --> 05:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
she couldn't make that decision and
 
05:12:13.788 --> 05:12:13.798 align:start position:0%
oftentimes I mean it wasn't that she was
 
05:12:14.990 --> 05:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
trying to do it on purpose or anything
 
05:12:17.750 --> 05:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
she just it her vision and what she
 
05:12:20.330 --> 05:12:20.340 align:start position:0%
could see and her perception was totally
 
05:12:20.340 --> 05:12:21.890 align:start position:0%
could see and her perception was totally
skewed

05:12:21.890 --> 05:12:21.900 align:start position:0%
skewed
 
05:12:23.930 --> 05:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
um particularly when she was in a crisis
 
05:12:26.208 --> 05:12:26.218 align:start position:0%
and hadn't eaten and well we all know
 
05:12:28.190 --> 05:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
that if we hadn't eaten in a while you
 
05:12:29.570 --> 05:12:29.580 align:start position:0%
know how dizzy you can get and
 
05:12:32.868 --> 05:12:32.878 align:start position:0%
dehydrated you can get and and uh shaky
 
05:12:37.190 --> 05:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
and it happened to her so yes it it goes
 
05:12:39.890 --> 05:12:39.900 align:start position:0%
a lot lower so it's a point I was when I
 
05:12:41.930 --> 05:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
get through a real lost
 
05:12:44.150 --> 05:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
um curriculum wise when did Health
 
05:12:47.030 --> 05:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
instruction in in great saves Grace that
 
05:12:48.288 --> 05:12:48.298 align:start position:0%
when did Eating Disorders begin
 
05:12:50.448 --> 05:12:50.458 align:start position:0%
currently today is your best knowledge
 
05:12:51.410 --> 05:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
when is it integrated into the
 
05:12:51.420 --> 05:12:53.390 align:start position:0%
when is it integrated into the
curriculum

05:12:53.390 --> 05:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
05:12:56.030 --> 05:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
I think health is one of those areas
 
05:12:58.910 --> 05:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
that um hasn't totally been integrated
 
05:13:02.868 --> 05:13:02.878 align:start position:0%
into the elementary schools and is a
 
05:13:04.368 --> 05:13:04.378 align:start position:0%
political football like some of the
 
05:13:06.050 --> 05:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
other things so
 
05:13:09.470 --> 05:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
um I would say that hopefully there's
 
05:13:11.448 --> 05:13:11.458 align:start position:0%
some integration at the at the
 
05:13:14.208 --> 05:13:14.218 align:start position:0%
elementary school but I'm not sure that
 
05:13:16.128 --> 05:13:16.138 align:start position:0%
it's happening and I would say at Middle
 
05:13:17.990 --> 05:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
School level that's probably where they
 
05:13:20.090 --> 05:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
first hear about anything thank you Mr
 
05:13:22.430 --> 05:13:22.440 align:start position:0%

do you have a card over there
 
05:13:41.510 --> 05:13:41.520 align:start position:0%

well come on up and speak and then if we
 
05:13:50.470 --> 05:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:53.208 --> 05:13:53.218 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you Mr chairman
 
05:13:55.368 --> 05:13:55.378 align:start position:0%
thank you to the committee and to
 
05:13:56.990 --> 05:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
everyone attending to this very
 
05:13:59.090 --> 05:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
important issue I'm representative of
 
05:14:00.890 --> 05:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
Hope Damon Sullivan County District 8
 
05:14:02.930 --> 05:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
I'm going to save listing the nine towns
 
05:14:05.628 --> 05:14:05.638 align:start position:0%
between Croydon Claremont and Acworth
 
05:14:08.868 --> 05:14:08.878 align:start position:0%
I am a registered dietitian I retired at
 
05:14:12.590 --> 05:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
the end of December 22.
 
05:14:12.600 --> 05:14:13.430 align:start position:0%
the end of December 22.
um

05:14:13.430 --> 05:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:16.850 --> 05:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
35 years of my work were in private
 
05:14:16.860 --> 05:14:17.990 align:start position:0%
35 years of my work were in private
practice

05:14:17.990 --> 05:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
practice
 
05:14:20.208 --> 05:14:20.218 align:start position:0%
I would say about a third of my patients
 
05:14:20.218 --> 05:14:21.770 align:start position:0%
I would say about a third of my patients
were

05:14:21.770 --> 05:14:21.780 align:start position:0%
were
 
05:14:24.470 --> 05:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
referred to me or self-referred for
 
05:14:26.750 --> 05:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
eating disorders care
 
05:14:30.410 --> 05:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:32.690 --> 05:14:32.700 align:start position:0%
another 20 to 30 percent were people
 
05:14:34.490 --> 05:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
referred for a different diagnosis who
 
05:14:35.930 --> 05:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
turned out to also have an eating
 
05:14:35.940 --> 05:14:37.190 align:start position:0%
turned out to also have an eating
disorder

05:14:37.190 --> 05:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
disorder
 
05:14:39.470 --> 05:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
if you hear my voice shaking it's both
 
05:14:41.390 --> 05:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
because I am so passionate about this
 
05:14:44.570 --> 05:14:44.580 align:start position:0%
topic and it's hard to
 
05:14:47.510 --> 05:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
bring Decades of
 
05:14:49.788 --> 05:14:49.798 align:start position:0%
very challenging and very rewarding work
 
05:14:51.530 --> 05:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
into three minutes
 
05:14:54.770 --> 05:14:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:57.230 --> 05:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
I consulted for Colby's for a college
 
05:14:59.990 --> 05:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
Proctor Academy the local public schools
 
05:15:02.570 --> 05:15:02.580 align:start position:0%
a little bit for Kua and Dartmouth
 
05:15:04.430 --> 05:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth ultimately hired their own
 
05:15:06.948 --> 05:15:06.958 align:start position:0%
dietitian full-time to work with
 
05:15:08.448 --> 05:15:08.458 align:start position:0%
students on nutrition issues mainly
 
05:15:09.650 --> 05:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
Eating Disorders which I think
 
05:15:09.660 --> 05:15:11.090 align:start position:0%
Eating Disorders which I think
represents

05:15:11.090 --> 05:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
represents
 
05:15:12.948 --> 05:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
some degree of how present this
 
05:15:15.410 --> 05:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
situation is
 
05:15:18.050 --> 05:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
supporters are not necessarily visible
 
05:15:20.750 --> 05:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
I counted heads in this room a few
 
05:15:25.070 --> 05:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
minutes ago we're around 35 or 40 people
 
05:15:27.350 --> 05:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
I can tell you without looking anywhere
 
05:15:29.510 --> 05:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
and not knowing most of these people at
 
05:15:29.520 --> 05:15:30.288 align:start position:0%
and not knowing most of these people at
all

05:15:30.288 --> 05:15:30.298 align:start position:0%
all
 
05:15:32.448 --> 05:15:32.458 align:start position:0%
there are probably five people in here
 
05:15:34.490 --> 05:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
right now with an active eating disorder
 
05:15:37.190 --> 05:15:37.200 align:start position:0%
just based on the percentages
 
05:15:39.288 --> 05:15:39.298 align:start position:0%
and probably a third of the people here
 
05:15:41.270 --> 05:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
have personally dealt with an eating
 
05:15:42.830 --> 05:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
disorder whether it was labeled that or
 
05:15:45.770 --> 05:15:45.780 align:start position:0%
not it's rampant
 
05:15:47.868 --> 05:15:47.878 align:start position:0%
they're life-threatening
 
05:15:51.110 --> 05:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
they profoundly affect quality of life
 
05:15:52.970 --> 05:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
I Echo the statements that have already
 
05:15:55.010 --> 05:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
been made about suicide
 
05:15:57.530 --> 05:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
but also
 
05:16:00.470 --> 05:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
um premature Cardiac Arrest is quite
 
05:16:02.510 --> 05:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
common in people who are bulimic and
 
05:16:04.550 --> 05:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
it's often fatal we're talking people
 
05:16:08.150 --> 05:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
who are in their teens and 20s
 
05:16:10.670 --> 05:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
there are productivity issues related to
 
05:16:13.490 --> 05:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
the malnutrition or the distraction of
 
05:16:15.708 --> 05:16:15.718 align:start position:0%
being so obsessed and focused on the
 
05:16:17.690 --> 05:16:17.700 align:start position:0%
behaviors of the eating disorder
 
05:16:19.368 --> 05:16:19.378 align:start position:0%
that you can't study you can't
 
05:16:21.170 --> 05:16:21.180 align:start position:0%
concentrate you can't work in the way
 
05:16:22.670 --> 05:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
that you would otherwise be capable of
 
05:16:22.680 --> 05:16:25.190 align:start position:0%
that you would otherwise be capable of
doing

05:16:25.190 --> 05:16:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:27.708 --> 05:16:27.718 align:start position:0%
moments in helping people with eating
 
05:16:28.910 --> 05:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
disorders is when they make that
 
05:16:28.920 --> 05:16:30.530 align:start position:0%
disorders is when they make that
connection

05:16:30.530 --> 05:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
connection
 
05:16:32.390 --> 05:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago a young woman that
 
05:16:33.948 --> 05:16:33.958 align:start position:0%
I've been working with at that point for
 
05:16:35.510 --> 05:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
a couple of years
 
05:16:37.730 --> 05:16:37.740 align:start position:0%
and continue to work with until I
 
05:16:37.740 --> 05:16:39.110 align:start position:0%
and continue to work with until I
retired

05:16:39.110 --> 05:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
retired
 
05:16:42.288 --> 05:16:42.298 align:start position:0%
she's made tremendous progress
 
05:16:44.150 --> 05:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
she's a dancer
 
05:16:46.190 --> 05:16:46.200 align:start position:0%
dancing was her way of being a
 
05:16:48.708 --> 05:16:48.718 align:start position:0%
compulsive exerciser
 
05:16:51.650 --> 05:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
she's very very smart I hope to see her
 
05:16:53.750 --> 05:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
name on well I'm not going to be
 
05:16:55.128 --> 05:16:55.138 align:start position:0%
specific about what kind of authorship
 
05:16:58.310 --> 05:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
out of privacy but someday and say I
 
05:16:59.990 --> 05:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
know that person
 
05:17:01.970 --> 05:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
there was a moment where she looked at
 
05:17:05.570 --> 05:17:05.580 align:start position:0%
me tears rolling down her face and said
 
05:17:07.788 --> 05:17:07.798 align:start position:0%
I realized that when I eat I think
 
05:17:07.798 --> 05:17:09.948 align:start position:0%
I realized that when I eat I think
better

05:17:09.948 --> 05:17:09.958 align:start position:0%
better
 
05:17:13.128 --> 05:17:13.138 align:start position:0%
she didn't get that for a long time
 
05:17:15.410 --> 05:17:15.420 align:start position:0%
she's a junior in college and she's on
 
05:17:17.390 --> 05:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
the Dean's List so progress has been
 
05:17:17.400 --> 05:17:20.448 align:start position:0%
the Dean's List so progress has been
made

05:17:20.448 --> 05:17:20.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:20.458 --> 05:17:21.050 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:17:21.050 --> 05:17:21.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:24.770 --> 05:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
early diagnosis markedly increased the
 
05:17:26.868 --> 05:17:26.878 align:start position:0%
likelihood of a full recovery
 
05:17:29.150 --> 05:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
and that I think is what ties into this
 
05:17:31.550 --> 05:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
bill most specifically
 
05:17:34.550 --> 05:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
it is very hard for people to ask for
 
05:17:34.560 --> 05:17:35.628 align:start position:0%
it is very hard for people to ask for
help

05:17:35.628 --> 05:17:35.638 align:start position:0%
help
 
05:17:38.030 --> 05:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
denial is one of the psychological
 
05:17:40.250 --> 05:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
components of eating disorders
 
05:17:42.470 --> 05:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
both the distorted body image that
 
05:17:44.208 --> 05:17:44.218 align:start position:0%
representative tear described where
 
05:17:46.208 --> 05:17:46.218 align:start position:0%
people don't see themselves accurately
 
05:17:50.208 --> 05:17:50.218 align:start position:0%
and even if they're not skin and bones
 
05:17:52.850 --> 05:17:52.860 align:start position:0%
from a quite young age in our culture
 
05:17:55.550 --> 05:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
now I believe the most recent data is
 
05:17:57.590 --> 05:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
around eight years old
 
05:18:00.230 --> 05:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
both boys and girls identify themselves
 
05:18:02.448 --> 05:18:02.458 align:start position:0%
as more obese than what their height
 
05:18:05.750 --> 05:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
weight measurements show that they are
 
05:18:08.470 --> 05:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
we have a culture of fattism
 
05:18:12.470 --> 05:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
we admire people who are lean
 
05:18:15.430 --> 05:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
and we reward that in a variety of ways
 
05:18:18.830 --> 05:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
and that is one of the pieces that leads
 
05:18:21.050 --> 05:18:21.060 align:start position:0%
to distorted body image which leads to
 
05:18:23.030 --> 05:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
in part causing eating disorder
 
05:18:23.040 --> 05:18:25.368 align:start position:0%
in part causing eating disorder
behaviors

05:18:25.368 --> 05:18:25.378 align:start position:0%
behaviors
 
05:18:28.788 --> 05:18:28.798 align:start position:0%
it is males and females it is all ages
 
05:18:32.090 --> 05:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
all sizes
 
05:18:32.100 --> 05:18:33.410 align:start position:0%
all sizes
um

05:18:33.410 --> 05:18:33.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:35.750 --> 05:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
slip and see what else I might want to
 
05:18:35.760 --> 05:18:38.510 align:start position:0%
slip and see what else I might want to
know

05:18:38.510 --> 05:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:41.628 --> 05:18:41.638 align:start position:0%
many many people and this is my personal
 
05:18:43.128 --> 05:18:43.138 align:start position:0%
experience but it's also very well
 
05:18:44.868 --> 05:18:44.878 align:start position:0%
documented in the mental health
 
05:18:48.230 --> 05:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:50.510 --> 05:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
recognize that they have a problem and
 
05:18:53.030 --> 05:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
go years before they seek help
 
05:18:54.770 --> 05:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
and many many people don't recognize
 
05:18:57.050 --> 05:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
they have a problem one of the
 
05:18:58.550 --> 05:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
advantages that I see I'm putting the
 
05:19:01.610 --> 05:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
helpline number on ID cards is friends
 
05:19:02.750 --> 05:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
will call
 
05:19:04.490 --> 05:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
and when friends get more information
 
05:19:06.830 --> 05:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
about the language that helps their
 
05:19:09.410 --> 05:19:09.420 align:start position:0%
friends get into treatment
 
05:19:11.448 --> 05:19:11.458 align:start position:0%
that's actually a pretty effective way
 
05:19:14.868 --> 05:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
for young people to seek help
 
05:19:18.230 --> 05:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
I've had a number of times that a person
 
05:19:19.850 --> 05:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
I was treating
 
05:19:22.070 --> 05:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
and it's team treatment dietitians don't
 
05:19:23.628 --> 05:19:23.638 align:start position:0%
treat Eating Disorders by themselves I
 
05:19:24.830 --> 05:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
should be clear about that we're always
 
05:19:27.368 --> 05:19:27.378 align:start position:0%
on a team with mental health conditions
 
05:19:29.628 --> 05:19:29.638 align:start position:0%
pediatrician or physician sometimes
 
05:19:31.610 --> 05:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
other folks as well
 
05:19:33.770 --> 05:19:33.780 align:start position:0%
many times
 
05:19:35.750 --> 05:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
a patient that I was treating would say
 
05:19:37.910 --> 05:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
can I bring somebody in with me
 
05:19:39.830 --> 05:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
and my answer to all my patients for any
 
05:19:41.510 --> 05:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
diagnosis was you can bring anybody you
 
05:19:42.590 --> 05:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
want here
 
05:19:44.810 --> 05:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
as the more the merrier let's all figure
 
05:19:46.670 --> 05:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
this out
 
05:19:48.530 --> 05:19:48.540 align:start position:0%
but in the case of Eating Disorders it
 
05:19:50.570 --> 05:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
was usually that that person had a
 
05:19:52.010 --> 05:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
friend they were concerned about and
 
05:19:54.410 --> 05:19:54.420 align:start position:0%
they wanted that friend to appreciate
 
05:19:55.970 --> 05:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
that it was safe to come and talk with
 
05:19:55.980 --> 05:19:56.750 align:start position:0%
that it was safe to come and talk with
me

05:19:56.750 --> 05:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:19:59.208 --> 05:19:59.218 align:start position:0%
in the hope that they would then get on
 
05:20:01.990 --> 05:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
their own path to treatment
 
05:20:04.970 --> 05:20:04.980 align:start position:0%
so the helpline can help
 
05:20:08.150 --> 05:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
people who have a disorder and can help
 
05:20:08.160 --> 05:20:09.230 align:start position:0%
people who have a disorder and can help
folks

05:20:09.230 --> 05:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
folks
 
05:20:12.650 --> 05:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
who would be on the support team
 
05:20:14.990 --> 05:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
know how to be helpful
 
05:20:17.570 --> 05:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
language is extremely important in
 
05:20:20.390 --> 05:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
treating eating disorders
 
05:20:22.730 --> 05:20:22.740 align:start position:0%
people often hear comments people with
 
05:20:25.128 --> 05:20:25.138 align:start position:0%
eating disorders often hear comments
 
05:20:27.410 --> 05:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
through their
 
05:20:29.270 --> 05:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
different thought process through their
 
05:20:29.280 --> 05:20:30.650 align:start position:0%
different thought process through their
distortions

05:20:30.650 --> 05:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
distortions
 
05:20:32.390 --> 05:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
they'll hear comments that people
 
05:20:35.030 --> 05:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
without eating disorders would not be
 
05:20:37.190 --> 05:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
troubled by and it would not be
 
05:20:37.200 --> 05:20:38.390 align:start position:0%
troubled by and it would not be
triggering

05:20:38.390 --> 05:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
triggering
 
05:20:40.910 --> 05:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
to somebody who doesn't have an eating
 
05:20:40.920 --> 05:20:43.430 align:start position:0%
to somebody who doesn't have an eating
disorder

05:20:43.430 --> 05:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:46.310 --> 05:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
because of that language situation I
 
05:20:47.570 --> 05:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
think it's particularly important when
 
05:20:49.550 --> 05:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
people ask for help
 
05:20:52.190 --> 05:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
that the person if they're making a call
 
05:20:54.890 --> 05:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
expecting it to be professional help
 
05:20:56.930 --> 05:20:56.940 align:start position:0%
that the person be very knowledgeable
 
05:20:59.510 --> 05:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
about eating disorders
 
05:21:01.850 --> 05:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
there is an acute shortage of therapists
 
05:21:03.708 --> 05:21:03.718 align:start position:0%
who treat people with eating disorders
 
05:21:05.990 --> 05:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
it is true Nationwide it is true in New
 
05:21:06.000 --> 05:21:08.868 align:start position:0%
it is true Nationwide it is true in New
Hampshire

05:21:08.868 --> 05:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:10.850 --> 05:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
which means that even when you reach out
 
05:21:13.970 --> 05:21:13.980 align:start position:0%
to a person who would do their very best
 
05:21:18.250 --> 05:21:18.260 align:start position:0%
and has very good professional skills
 
05:21:21.410 --> 05:21:21.420 align:start position:0%
to literally or figuratively talk
 
05:21:24.470 --> 05:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
somebody off the ledge from suicide they
 
05:21:27.708 --> 05:21:27.718 align:start position:0%
might not say what is helpful to the
 
05:21:30.530 --> 05:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
person with an eating disorder
 
05:21:33.410 --> 05:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
they actually might be more triggering
 
05:21:36.708 --> 05:21:36.718 align:start position:0%
it also happens in emergency care
 
05:21:39.948 --> 05:21:39.958 align:start position:0%
I had several patients who
 
05:21:44.208 --> 05:21:44.218 align:start position:0%
went to ER usually for cardiac symptoms
 
05:21:46.550 --> 05:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes for fainting episodes
 
05:21:48.350 --> 05:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
lightheaded because of electrolyte
 
05:21:48.360 --> 05:21:50.510 align:start position:0%
lightheaded because of electrolyte
imbalances

05:21:50.510 --> 05:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
imbalances
 
05:21:52.788 --> 05:21:52.798 align:start position:0%
who will have a qualified medical
 
05:21:54.770 --> 05:21:54.780 align:start position:0%
provider in ER say to them Well you
 
05:21:56.690 --> 05:21:56.700 align:start position:0%
certainly don't have a weight problem
 
05:21:59.270 --> 05:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's validating to a person who has a
 
05:22:01.190 --> 05:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
restrictive eating disorder
 
05:22:03.830 --> 05:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
not helpful language so I don't mean to
 
05:22:06.350 --> 05:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
go on and on I'm vigorously supportive
 
05:22:07.910 --> 05:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
of this bill and I'm happy to answer
 
05:22:11.208 --> 05:22:11.218 align:start position:0%
questions now or at any point that I
 
05:22:12.830 --> 05:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
could be helpful
 
05:22:14.448 --> 05:22:14.458 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
05:22:17.208 --> 05:22:17.218 align:start position:0%
representative Miler thank you Mr
 
05:22:18.970 --> 05:22:18.980 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for your
 
05:22:21.788 --> 05:22:21.798 align:start position:0%
enlightening testimony
 
05:22:26.448 --> 05:22:26.458 align:start position:0%
if I were to call the the help line
 
05:22:28.610 --> 05:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
what would happen
 
05:22:31.850 --> 05:22:31.860 align:start position:0%
what's on the other end of that Alpine
 
05:22:35.030 --> 05:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
the other end of that helpline is a
 
05:22:38.570 --> 05:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
trained person who knows how to listen
 
05:22:43.010 --> 05:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:44.930 --> 05:22:44.940 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say minimally assessed
 
05:22:46.010 --> 05:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
but it's not going to be the same
 
05:22:47.390 --> 05:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
assessment as when you go into a
 
05:22:48.948 --> 05:22:48.958 align:start position:0%
professional's office
 
05:22:51.288 --> 05:22:51.298 align:start position:0%
but to do a basic assessment I guess is
 
05:22:53.208 --> 05:22:53.218 align:start position:0%
the word I need
 
05:22:55.670 --> 05:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
of what that person's needs are and
 
05:22:57.770 --> 05:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
where they should be how they should be
 
05:22:57.780 --> 05:22:58.788 align:start position:0%
where they should be how they should be
helped

05:22:58.788 --> 05:22:58.798 align:start position:0%
helped
 
05:23:03.288 --> 05:23:03.298 align:start position:0%
so they might be directed to
 
05:23:03.298 --> 05:23:04.850 align:start position:0%
so they might be directed to
um

05:23:04.850 --> 05:23:04.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:07.610 --> 05:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
particular treatment facilities or
 
05:23:10.310 --> 05:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
individuals in their area I believe they
 
05:23:12.590 --> 05:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
do identify geographically Rosemary
 
05:23:15.770 --> 05:23:15.780 align:start position:0%
maybe yeah thank you
 
05:23:17.330 --> 05:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
um I'm usually on the receiving end not
 
05:23:20.448 --> 05:23:20.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:20.458 --> 05:23:21.770 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:23:21.770 --> 05:23:21.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:26.270 --> 05:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
the idea is to get that person to have a
 
05:23:27.830 --> 05:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
place where they can get help as soon as
 
05:23:29.510 --> 05:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
possible and I believe there is also
 
05:23:32.948 --> 05:23:32.958 align:start position:0%
follow-up to see if they did that
 
05:23:37.310 --> 05:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
yes so so based upon that what you're
 
05:23:40.670 --> 05:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
saying is that rather than calling a
 
05:23:42.830 --> 05:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
general helpline
 
05:23:44.750 --> 05:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
that would deal with the variety of
 
05:23:46.610 --> 05:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
different crises
 
05:23:49.368 --> 05:23:49.378 align:start position:0%
by calling this particular helpline
 
05:23:52.010 --> 05:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
Theory you have that specialist who can
 
05:23:54.470 --> 05:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
deal immediately with it rather than
 
05:23:57.170 --> 05:23:57.180 align:start position:0%
somebody who might be in an opioid
 
05:23:59.990 --> 05:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
specialist for example but not a eating
 
05:24:02.930 --> 05:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
a specialist that that immediacy is
 
05:24:05.390 --> 05:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
there in this helpline rather than just
 
05:24:07.368 --> 05:24:07.378 align:start position:0%
a general crisis line is that correct
 
05:24:09.590 --> 05:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
that is a perfect summary thank you
 
05:24:11.810 --> 05:24:11.820 align:start position:0%
representative Myler thank you
 
05:24:13.610 --> 05:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to follow up a little bit
 
05:24:15.770 --> 05:24:15.780 align:start position:0%
where represent Myler was
 
05:24:18.410 --> 05:24:18.420 align:start position:0%
so the person the receiving end is going
 
05:24:19.670 --> 05:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
to do
 
05:24:21.530 --> 05:24:21.540 align:start position:0%
then contact
 
05:24:23.930 --> 05:24:23.940 align:start position:0%
those that are able to help but do we
 
05:24:26.628 --> 05:24:26.638 align:start position:0%
have those resources I've had Folks up
 
05:24:28.430 --> 05:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
in my neck the woods saying we have
 
05:24:30.110 --> 05:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
called Hitchcock
 
05:24:32.810 --> 05:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
and had no response
 
05:24:36.050 --> 05:24:36.060 align:start position:0%
so do we have
 
05:24:38.448 --> 05:24:38.458 align:start position:0%
the sources are the availability of
 
05:24:41.750 --> 05:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
resources in this state to help those
 
05:24:44.930 --> 05:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
which are dialing this number and saying
 
05:24:47.390 --> 05:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
I need some help
 
05:24:49.550 --> 05:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for very you're a very
 
05:24:51.830 --> 05:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
excellent question
 
05:24:55.368 --> 05:24:55.378 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth close their inpatient and
 
05:24:57.170 --> 05:24:57.180 align:start position:0%
outpatient Eating Disorders Treatment
 
05:24:57.180 --> 05:24:59.628 align:start position:0%
outpatient Eating Disorders Treatment
programs

05:24:59.628 --> 05:24:59.638 align:start position:0%
programs
 
05:25:01.368 --> 05:25:01.378 align:start position:0%
I don't even remember exactly how long
 
05:25:03.288 --> 05:25:03.298 align:start position:0%
it was ago because it's like 20 or 25
 
05:25:05.090 --> 05:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
05:25:05.100 --> 05:25:06.590 align:start position:0%
years ago
they

05:25:06.590 --> 05:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:25:08.208 --> 05:25:08.218 align:start position:0%
help people with eating disorders only
 
05:25:09.770 --> 05:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
through their General psychiatric care
 
05:25:12.830 --> 05:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
and they're overloaded in many ways in
 
05:25:15.050 --> 05:25:15.060 align:start position:0%
that regard
 
05:25:17.628 --> 05:25:17.638 align:start position:0%
we have one
 
05:25:19.490 --> 05:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
um what's called an IOP intensive
 
05:25:22.368 --> 05:25:22.378 align:start position:0%
outpatient program so it's many hours a
 
05:25:24.708 --> 05:25:24.718 align:start position:0%
day but it's not a residential program
 
05:25:27.170 --> 05:25:27.180 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it's right here in
 
05:25:29.690 --> 05:25:29.700 align:start position:0%
Concord it's quite well respected it's a
 
05:25:31.850 --> 05:25:31.860 align:start position:0%
branch of a long-established program
 
05:25:34.430 --> 05:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
based in Cambridge Mass
 
05:25:37.128 --> 05:25:37.138 align:start position:0%
um they generally do have availability
 
05:25:40.510 --> 05:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
and they provide very good care
 
05:25:43.128 --> 05:25:43.138 align:start position:0%
to different levels of care there's a
 
05:25:45.708 --> 05:25:45.718 align:start position:0%
three-hour Day program in a
 
05:25:51.110 --> 05:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:53.448 --> 05:25:53.458 align:start position:0%
I think one thing that came one
 
05:25:55.368 --> 05:25:55.378 align:start position:0%
beneficial thing that came out of the
 
05:25:58.190 --> 05:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
covet epidemic is a much greater
 
05:26:00.230 --> 05:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
recognition that virtual treatment
 
05:26:02.270 --> 05:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
sessions work for people with eating
 
05:26:04.070 --> 05:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
disorders quite well
 
05:26:06.770 --> 05:26:06.780 align:start position:0%
I myself did my whole practice for a
 
05:26:10.850 --> 05:26:10.860 align:start position:0%
year remotely in the height of covid
 
05:26:14.030 --> 05:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
I didn't want to I was skeptical that
 
05:26:16.610 --> 05:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
you could developer and see what you
 
05:26:19.850 --> 05:26:19.860 align:start position:0%
needed to see to be fully helpful
 
05:26:19.860 --> 05:26:21.470 align:start position:0%
needed to see to be fully helpful
and

05:26:21.470 --> 05:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:26:23.690 --> 05:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
I have to say it worked as well or
 
05:26:26.090 --> 05:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
better than the in-person work and so
 
05:26:29.208 --> 05:26:29.218 align:start position:0%
the advantage of virtual is doesn't
 
05:26:31.070 --> 05:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
matter what your ZIP code is
 
05:26:34.368 --> 05:26:34.378 align:start position:0%
so when I was making a list of other
 
05:26:36.350 --> 05:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
folks that people could work with as I
 
05:26:37.910 --> 05:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
was retiring
 
05:26:39.948 --> 05:26:39.958 align:start position:0%
it's not limited to people in New
 
05:26:41.270 --> 05:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because you're right there's
 
05:26:42.708 --> 05:26:42.718 align:start position:0%
not enough people in New Hampshire doing
 
05:26:44.510 --> 05:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
this work
 
05:26:46.190 --> 05:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
so it's broader
 
05:26:47.448 --> 05:26:47.458 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:26:50.690 --> 05:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:52.550 --> 05:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative thank
 
05:26:52.560 --> 05:26:56.208 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative thank
you

05:26:56.208 --> 05:26:56.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:04.368 --> 05:27:04.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:06.830 --> 05:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
05:27:11.230 --> 05:27:11.240 align:start position:0%
committee uh so I I had prepared uh some
 
05:27:14.570 --> 05:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
written testimony uh that I'd emailed to
 
05:27:17.570 --> 05:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
the committee a few days ago uh which I
 
05:27:19.250 --> 05:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
won't bore you all with because it is
 
05:27:21.050 --> 05:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
just statistics
 
05:27:24.470 --> 05:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
um but as somebody who has a loved one
 
05:27:27.070 --> 05:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
who has dealt with an eating disorder
 
05:27:30.410 --> 05:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
this bill is something where I am asking
 
05:27:32.750 --> 05:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
you all to support it because it
 
05:27:36.830 --> 05:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
provides background information and gets
 
05:27:39.590 --> 05:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
the gears turning in many kids heads as
 
05:27:42.530 --> 05:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
representative Damon had pointed out in
 
05:27:45.850 --> 05:27:45.860 align:start position:0%
her testimony uh it's something where
 
05:27:49.250 --> 05:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
oftentimes it's kids helping kids it's
 
05:27:51.770 --> 05:27:51.780 align:start position:0%
uh administrators helping kids in
 
05:27:54.288 --> 05:27:54.298 align:start position:0%
leading them uh or suggesting to them
 
05:27:56.830 --> 05:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
that they may need or want to reach out
 
05:28:01.490 --> 05:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
to this National hotline uh and that is
 
05:28:03.770 --> 05:28:03.780 align:start position:0%
the essence of this bill it's to provide
 
05:28:08.208 --> 05:28:08.218 align:start position:0%
a and a resource that may be unknown uh
 
05:28:10.330 --> 05:28:10.340 align:start position:0%
for many students
 
05:28:14.390 --> 05:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
and as a student at UNH myself uh of
 
05:28:16.430 --> 05:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
course because of this amendment that
 
05:28:19.190 --> 05:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
they would not be printing uh the uh
 
05:28:21.830 --> 05:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
hotline number or helpline number on the
 
05:28:24.590 --> 05:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
back of those IDs but I still support
 
05:28:27.350 --> 05:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
this bill because uh UNH and the
 
05:28:29.510 --> 05:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
university system has been doing quite a
 
05:28:32.350 --> 05:28:32.360 align:start position:0%
bit to try and educate the student body
 
05:28:35.330 --> 05:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
about these serious illnesses
 
05:28:38.868 --> 05:28:38.878 align:start position:0%
uh and uh so I'll leave it at that and
 
05:28:40.670 --> 05:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
that is why I'm supporting and asking
 
05:28:43.128 --> 05:28:43.138 align:start position:0%
all of you to support hb35 thank you
 
05:28:44.930 --> 05:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:28:46.190 --> 05:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
are there
 
05:28:48.770 --> 05:28:48.780 align:start position:0%
questions of Representative Howard
 
05:28:52.610 --> 05:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:11.750 --> 05:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:11.760 --> 05:29:13.610 align:start position:0%

committee my name is Matthew Brown and I
 
05:29:20.050 --> 05:29:20.060 align:start position:0%
am a freshman at Merrimack high school
 
05:29:23.208 --> 05:29:23.218 align:start position:0%
and I um brought this idea to
 
05:29:23.218 --> 05:29:24.590 align:start position:0%
and I um brought this idea to
representative

05:29:24.590 --> 05:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:29:29.448 --> 05:29:29.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:32.150 --> 05:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
in the United States today 30 million
 
05:29:33.890 --> 05:29:33.900 align:start position:0%
Americans have an eating disorder
 
05:29:35.810 --> 05:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
whether that be bulimia binge eating
 
05:29:38.270 --> 05:29:38.280 align:start position:0%
disorder or anorexia or any of the other
 
05:29:41.150 --> 05:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
forms of disordered eating 30 million
 
05:29:43.390 --> 05:29:43.400 align:start position:0%
Americans are suffering
 
05:29:46.010 --> 05:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
as I begin I want you to try to put
 
05:29:48.650 --> 05:29:48.660 align:start position:0%
yourselves in the shoes of a teenager
 
05:29:51.110 --> 05:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
imagine trying to drown out feelings of
 
05:29:53.930 --> 05:29:53.940 align:start position:0%
Stress and Anxiety by eating imagine
 
05:29:56.090 --> 05:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
finding yourself waking up to the real
 
05:29:58.670 --> 05:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
to the reality of how much you just ate
 
05:30:01.368 --> 05:30:01.378 align:start position:0%
this is something that the 2.8 million
 
05:30:03.410 --> 05:30:03.420 align:start position:0%
Americans who have binge eating disorder
 
05:30:09.708 --> 05:30:09.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:11.750 --> 05:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic teens were left
 
05:30:14.448 --> 05:30:14.458 align:start position:0%
isolated from school and friends and we
 
05:30:17.690 --> 05:30:17.700 align:start position:0%
all know how much of a brown impact this
 
05:30:20.570 --> 05:30:20.580 align:start position:0%
had on Mental Health
 
05:30:23.208 --> 05:30:23.218 align:start position:0%
stress anxiety depression and loneliness
 
05:30:24.590 --> 05:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
are all things that came out of the
 
05:30:27.050 --> 05:30:27.060 align:start position:0%
pandemic and are all leading causes of
 
05:30:28.850 --> 05:30:28.860 align:start position:0%
eating disorders
 
05:30:31.670 --> 05:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
I like to Echo the remarks of the people
 
05:30:34.670 --> 05:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
who came for me and say that
 
05:30:34.680 --> 05:30:36.288 align:start position:0%
who came for me and say that
um

05:30:36.288 --> 05:30:36.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:40.070 --> 05:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
this issue and suicide are deeply
 
05:30:43.610 --> 05:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
related if we have the ability to stop
 
05:30:46.788 --> 05:30:46.798 align:start position:0%
someone who has an eating disorder from
 
05:30:49.628 --> 05:30:49.638 align:start position:0%
beginning to form suicidal ideations
 
05:30:53.990 --> 05:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
that is so important
 
05:30:55.850 --> 05:30:55.860 align:start position:0%
um there are so many people personally
 
05:31:00.410 --> 05:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
that I know who struggle with this issue
 
05:31:02.750 --> 05:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
um and I'd like to touch on
 
05:31:05.930 --> 05:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
um the actual helpline number I reached
 
05:31:09.350 --> 05:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
out to this helpline in July and
 
05:31:12.770 --> 05:31:12.780 align:start position:0%
um I can just say how helpful that this
 
05:31:14.990 --> 05:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
was and how helpful I think this will be
 
05:31:17.930 --> 05:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
for other students in New Hampshire
 
05:31:20.868 --> 05:31:20.878 align:start position:0%
this is an issue that isn't talked about
 
05:31:24.708 --> 05:31:24.718 align:start position:0%
nearly as enough as it should be but it
 
05:31:27.890 --> 05:31:27.900 align:start position:0%
has to be really I think this bill will
 
05:31:31.670 --> 05:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
help to give those suffering a chance
 
05:31:34.868 --> 05:31:34.878 align:start position:0%
to just have a little bit of recognition
 
05:31:37.788 --> 05:31:37.798 align:start position:0%
this is an issue that is deeply personal
 
05:31:40.970 --> 05:31:40.980 align:start position:0%
for many people and many teens
 
05:31:43.128 --> 05:31:43.138 align:start position:0%
um for that reason a lot of teens don't
 
05:31:45.890 --> 05:31:45.900 align:start position:0%
think of reaching out to a professional
 
05:31:48.410 --> 05:31:48.420 align:start position:0%
or talking to a parent per se about this
 
05:31:51.110 --> 05:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
issue but providing those with a
 
05:31:54.770 --> 05:31:54.780 align:start position:0%
discreet and easy way to find help
 
05:31:57.230 --> 05:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
will be revolutionary and will truly
 
05:32:00.890 --> 05:32:00.900 align:start position:0%
save lives thank you well thank you very
 
05:32:03.770 --> 05:32:03.780 align:start position:0%

office and see if there are any
 
05:33:50.990 --> 05:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
brochures or any other uh pieces of
 
05:33:53.930 --> 05:33:53.940 align:start position:0%
commute paper like that for students uh
 
05:33:57.170 --> 05:33:57.180 align:start position:0%
I have looked um briefly not for that uh
 
05:34:00.350 --> 05:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
reason but I haven't seen anything
 
05:34:01.910 --> 05:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
um and I think one of the reasons why
 
05:34:03.708 --> 05:34:03.718 align:start position:0%
it's important to have a helpline number
 
05:34:06.350 --> 05:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
on ID cards is because of how personal
 
05:34:09.350 --> 05:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
this issue is and how truly traumatic
 
05:34:10.970 --> 05:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
some of the experiences of people with
 
05:34:13.550 --> 05:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
eating disorders can face
 
05:34:15.470 --> 05:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
um so I haven't seen
 
05:34:18.110 --> 05:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
uh any sort of brochures or anything on
 
05:34:19.788 --> 05:34:19.798 align:start position:0%
this issue but I think that that that
 
05:34:22.750 --> 05:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:25.010 --> 05:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
last question
 
05:34:26.570 --> 05:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
um earlier on the discussion they were
 
05:34:29.270 --> 05:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
talking about text verses or text in
 
05:34:31.310 --> 05:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
addition to uh would you have any
 
05:34:33.830 --> 05:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
thinking on that uh
 
05:34:36.350 --> 05:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
in your case if you had that card we've
 
05:34:38.510 --> 05:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
had a number and a text what would you
 
05:34:39.948 --> 05:34:39.958 align:start position:0%
think your preference might have been is
 
05:34:42.590 --> 05:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
there a value to both so
 
05:34:44.690 --> 05:34:44.700 align:start position:0%
um from what I know this helpline has
 
05:34:46.550 --> 05:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
you can text it or call it in my
 
05:34:49.448 --> 05:34:49.458 align:start position:0%
experience I did text and it's it's
 
05:34:52.070 --> 05:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
interchangeable thank you thank you Mr
 
05:34:55.610 --> 05:34:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:01.310 --> 05:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:03.230 --> 05:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
now we're just going to hang loose and
 
05:35:06.350 --> 05:35:06.360 align:start position:0%
get have to go through the rest of them
 
05:35:10.310 --> 05:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:13.310 --> 05:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
well thank you thank you very very much
 
05:35:16.368 --> 05:35:16.378 align:start position:0%
and Echo what reps in whitcott will said
 
05:35:24.410 --> 05:35:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:24.420 --> 05:35:25.970 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:35:25.970 --> 05:35:25.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:35:28.550 --> 05:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna jump right now to Shannon
 
05:35:30.770 --> 05:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
are you available right now Shannon Reed
 
05:35:34.310 --> 05:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
and I I'm Scott Tom are you on the same
 
05:35:37.730 --> 05:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
page I want both Tom uh Tom Crone is
 
05:35:39.708 --> 05:35:39.718 align:start position:0%
from the University system Shannon reads
 
05:35:41.390 --> 05:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
from the community college system in New
 
05:35:41.400 --> 05:35:46.150 align:start position:0%
from the community college system in New
Hampshire

05:35:46.150 --> 05:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:51.310 --> 05:35:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:54.230 --> 05:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you I I think it absolutely needs
 
05:35:56.030 --> 05:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
to be said from from us from this table
 
05:35:57.770 --> 05:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
that Matthew is just an amazing young
 
05:36:00.830 --> 05:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
person and I don't know where he went
 
05:36:00.840 --> 05:36:01.970 align:start position:0%
person and I don't know where he went
um

05:36:01.970 --> 05:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:04.788 --> 05:36:04.798 align:start position:0%
really just uh I'm kind of speechless
 
05:36:06.770 --> 05:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
which I can't be since I'm here to
 
05:36:06.780 --> 05:36:07.730 align:start position:0%
which I can't be since I'm here to
testify

05:36:07.730 --> 05:36:07.740 align:start position:0%
testify
 
05:36:09.230 --> 05:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
um my name is Shannon Reed I'm here on
 
05:36:10.970 --> 05:36:10.980 align:start position:0%
behalf of the community college system I
 
05:36:12.948 --> 05:36:12.958 align:start position:0%
have handed around written testimony I'd
 
05:36:14.570 --> 05:36:14.580 align:start position:0%
like to just say at the outset that the
 
05:36:16.788 --> 05:36:16.798 align:start position:0%
amendment brought in by the sponsor and
 
05:36:19.190 --> 05:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
100 addresses the concerns that we
 
05:36:21.890 --> 05:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
raised but just to outline what those
 
05:36:23.570 --> 05:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
were briefly
 
05:36:23.580 --> 05:36:24.288 align:start position:0%
were briefly
um

05:36:24.288 --> 05:36:24.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:26.990 --> 05:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
we absolutely uh believe that this bill
 
05:36:29.030 --> 05:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
is is well intentioned but we think that
 
05:36:30.890 --> 05:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
it's actually duplicative of what we are
 
05:36:33.350 --> 05:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
are already doing in a number of ways
 
05:36:35.390 --> 05:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
um last year the legislature passed
 
05:36:37.550 --> 05:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
05:36:40.610 --> 05:36:40.620 align:start position:0%
um Senate bill Senate Bill 234 which
 
05:36:42.170 --> 05:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
came through this committee and it
 
05:36:44.750 --> 05:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
required schools to put on their ID
 
05:36:47.030 --> 05:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
cards the National Suicide Prevention
 
05:36:49.670 --> 05:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
Lifeline which the community college
 
05:36:49.680 --> 05:36:50.570 align:start position:0%
Lifeline which the community college
system

05:36:50.570 --> 05:36:50.580 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:36:52.788 --> 05:36:52.798 align:start position:0%
um supported and readily complied with
 
05:36:56.690 --> 05:36:56.700 align:start position:0%
we put the that line and its smaller
 
05:37:01.070 --> 05:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
kind of analog 998 on our ID cards this
 
05:37:03.230 --> 05:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
new law became effective July 30th of
 
05:37:06.830 --> 05:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
last year July 31st of last year
 
05:37:09.410 --> 05:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
um in addition to putting that specific
 
05:37:12.650 --> 05:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
resource information on our ID cards we
 
05:37:14.470 --> 05:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
also put
 
05:37:16.910 --> 05:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
the resource lines for the New Hampshire
 
05:37:19.128 --> 05:37:19.138 align:start position:0%
Coalition against Domestic and Sexual
 
05:37:21.830 --> 05:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
Violence and we put the crisis text line
 
05:37:25.250 --> 05:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
for 24 7 mental health support and that
 
05:37:27.650 --> 05:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
crisis text line incidentally does
 
05:37:30.288 --> 05:37:30.298 align:start position:0%
um get you to if you if you put it into
 
05:37:33.110 --> 05:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
a web browser it gets you to a page that
 
05:37:36.230 --> 05:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
um that has specific a specific section
 
05:37:38.590 --> 05:37:38.600 align:start position:0%
on eating disorder in addition to
 
05:37:40.750 --> 05:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
depression anxiety
 
05:37:44.090 --> 05:37:44.100 align:start position:0%
and some other categories of kind of
 
05:37:44.100 --> 05:37:45.368 align:start position:0%
and some other categories of kind of
specific

05:37:45.368 --> 05:37:45.378 align:start position:0%
specific
 
05:37:49.010 --> 05:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
concerns and it gives you the ability to
 
05:37:53.270 --> 05:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
to chat uh text or communicate through
 
05:37:53.280 --> 05:37:54.890 align:start position:0%
to chat uh text or communicate through
WhatsApp

05:37:54.890 --> 05:37:54.900 align:start position:0%
WhatsApp
 
05:37:54.900 --> 05:37:55.670 align:start position:0%
WhatsApp
um

05:37:55.670 --> 05:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:58.190 --> 05:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
so following the the passage of Senate
 
05:38:01.850 --> 05:38:01.860 align:start position:0%
Bill 234 our system procured these new
 
05:38:04.430 --> 05:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
ID cards in bulk for our seven colleges
 
05:38:05.750 --> 05:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
and we probably have about two years
 
05:38:07.730 --> 05:38:07.740 align:start position:0%
worth of those cards and I want to
 
05:38:09.530 --> 05:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
repeat what the sponsor noted which is
 
05:38:11.570 --> 05:38:11.580 align:start position:0%
these aren't cards that we print out and
 
05:38:13.610 --> 05:38:13.620 align:start position:0%
laminate these are you know fairly
 
05:38:16.250 --> 05:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
sophisticated digitized cards that
 
05:38:18.110 --> 05:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
students use for building in room access
 
05:38:21.288 --> 05:38:21.298 align:start position:0%
and meal swipes and accessing printers
 
05:38:23.990 --> 05:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
and copiers so they're costly and
 
05:38:26.208 --> 05:38:26.218 align:start position:0%
they're fairly sophisticated and we we
 
05:38:27.830 --> 05:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
procure them from a vendor we don't make
 
05:38:29.570 --> 05:38:29.580 align:start position:0%
them ourselves although we just we can
 
05:38:32.030 --> 05:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
put on one side the student information
 
05:38:35.150 --> 05:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
so so soon after that requirement being
 
05:38:38.090 --> 05:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
adopted by the legislature we have a
 
05:38:42.170 --> 05:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
supply of cards they include those three
 
05:38:45.530 --> 05:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
um resource lines which we think are
 
05:38:47.230 --> 05:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
applicable to a college age population
 
05:38:50.330 --> 05:38:50.340 align:start position:0%
which is why we after considerable
 
05:38:53.090 --> 05:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
internal discussion why we chose the
 
05:38:54.590 --> 05:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
other two in addition to the suicide
 
05:38:56.208 --> 05:38:56.218 align:start position:0%
prevention line that was the specific
 
05:39:00.050 --> 05:39:00.060 align:start position:0%
subject of Senate bill 234. so
 
05:39:01.610 --> 05:39:01.620 align:start position:0%
um I guess more broadly we just ask that
 
05:39:03.350 --> 05:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
you you know you consider the role that
 
05:39:06.410 --> 05:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
these credit card size cards can play
 
05:39:08.090 --> 05:39:08.100 align:start position:0%
and how much information really can be
 
05:39:10.368 --> 05:39:10.378 align:start position:0%
on the back along with the magnetic
 
05:39:12.050 --> 05:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
strip and the thing that says Where to
 
05:39:14.410 --> 05:39:14.420 align:start position:0%
return them if they're found
 
05:39:17.270 --> 05:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
the colleges do per do have a lot of
 
05:39:19.550 --> 05:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
other mechanisms to provide helpful
 
05:39:21.410 --> 05:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
information to students we have
 
05:39:22.970 --> 05:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
programming we have Outreach we have
 
05:39:24.770 --> 05:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
other kinds of communications
 
05:39:26.570 --> 05:39:26.580 align:start position:0%
um and so we we feel that we are kind of
 
05:39:28.970 --> 05:39:28.980 align:start position:0%
comprehensively covering making sure
 
05:39:30.410 --> 05:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
that students understand what resources
 
05:39:33.050 --> 05:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
are available to them so I I'll stop you
 
05:39:35.150 --> 05:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
have my written testimony we
 
05:39:37.490 --> 05:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly support the committee
 
05:39:39.708 --> 05:39:39.718 align:start position:0%
Amendment commend those who brought this
 
05:39:42.230 --> 05:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
idea forward and I will be happy to take
 
05:39:44.030 --> 05:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
any questions or turn the microphone
 
05:39:47.270 --> 05:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
over to my counterpart let's just turn
 
05:39:48.890 --> 05:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
it over and then we can ask questions
 
05:39:50.390 --> 05:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
and maybe either one of you can field
 
05:39:52.670 --> 05:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
the question perfect uh thanks Shannon
 
05:39:53.690 --> 05:39:53.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
05:39:54.948 --> 05:39:54.958 align:start position:0%
committee Tom Cronin with the university
 
05:39:56.990 --> 05:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire I would Echo
 
05:39:59.330 --> 05:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
everything Shannon said both in terms of
 
05:40:01.128 --> 05:40:01.138 align:start position:0%
how the university system institutions
 
05:40:03.708 --> 05:40:03.718 align:start position:0%
have responded to passage of 234 last
 
05:40:06.110 --> 05:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
year including both the suicide helpline
 
05:40:07.430 --> 05:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
as well as in the case of the University
 
05:40:10.788 --> 05:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
system local counseling lines that
 
05:40:13.490 --> 05:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
students can call for other concerns
 
05:40:16.128 --> 05:40:16.138 align:start position:0%
that they're having on the you know just
 
05:40:18.650 --> 05:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
the Practical side similar concerns in
 
05:40:20.990 --> 05:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
terms of taking these cards that mean
 
05:40:23.150 --> 05:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
that really do serve many many functions
 
05:40:26.270 --> 05:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
across our campuses are somewhat uh
 
05:40:28.910 --> 05:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
technologically advanced and are not the
 
05:40:31.490 --> 05:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
easiest to procure in the cases of for
 
05:40:33.410 --> 05:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
us it's Keenum Plymouth who's similar to
 
05:40:34.690 --> 05:40:34.700 align:start position:0%
the to the community college system
 
05:40:37.490 --> 05:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
ordered an extended Supply they're
 
05:40:39.410 --> 05:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
actually I guess unsurprisingly at this
 
05:40:42.170 --> 05:40:42.180 align:start position:0%
point is a national shortage of the the
 
05:40:44.030 --> 05:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
kind of cars that we use for this
 
05:40:46.730 --> 05:40:46.740 align:start position:0%
purpose so I think we at least in cases
 
05:40:48.650 --> 05:40:48.660 align:start position:0%
of keen and Plymouth uh would actually
 
05:40:51.170 --> 05:40:51.180 align:start position:0%
have difficulty in complying with this
 
05:40:52.970 --> 05:40:52.980 align:start position:0%
you know anytime in the next year or two
 
05:40:55.368 --> 05:40:55.378 align:start position:0%
if we did decide to move forward uh UNH
 
05:40:57.770 --> 05:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
on the flip side we actually are able to
 
05:40:59.990 --> 05:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
purchase the blank cards and print both
 
05:41:02.150 --> 05:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
sides as opposed to uh you know how you
 
05:41:03.830 --> 05:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
saw Shannon's
 
05:41:05.270 --> 05:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
um that said I do think and we talked
 
05:41:05.930 --> 05:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
about this a little bit during
 
05:41:08.570 --> 05:41:08.580 align:start position:0%
orientation last week in terms of you
 
05:41:10.670 --> 05:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
know where some of the costs are in
 
05:41:12.230 --> 05:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
higher education right now and it is
 
05:41:14.330 --> 05:41:14.340 align:start position:0%
really around issues like this and it is
 
05:41:16.850 --> 05:41:16.860 align:start position:0%
around our recognition of the need to
 
05:41:19.128 --> 05:41:19.138 align:start position:0%
invest in counseling services resources
 
05:41:20.448 --> 05:41:20.458 align:start position:0%
and the work that needs to go into
 
05:41:22.250 --> 05:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
ensuring our students are aware of those
 
05:41:24.530 --> 05:41:24.540 align:start position:0%
resources because as everyone before us
 
05:41:26.390 --> 05:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
has testified to there are issues that
 
05:41:28.490 --> 05:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
are real for our campuses and I think as
 
05:41:30.470 --> 05:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
Shannon said and I would agree we we
 
05:41:32.330 --> 05:41:32.340 align:start position:0%
recognize that in our working hard hard
 
05:41:34.610 --> 05:41:34.620 align:start position:0%
to ensure our students are aware of the
 
05:41:36.050 --> 05:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
resources and that those resources
 
05:41:38.570 --> 05:41:38.580 align:start position:0%
resources are there for them when needed
 
05:41:40.490 --> 05:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
so with that I will also stop and happy
 
05:41:43.448 --> 05:41:43.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:45.770 --> 05:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
for both of you
 
05:41:48.948 --> 05:41:48.958 align:start position:0%
um in recent years last year and a half
 
05:41:51.770 --> 05:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
two years here we've seen a big spike in
 
05:41:54.190 --> 05:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
mental illness
 
05:41:59.150 --> 05:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
IEPs associated with that and I'm sure
 
05:42:00.770 --> 05:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
you're seeing that on the college
 
05:42:03.410 --> 05:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
campuses as well but have you taken it
 
05:42:05.570 --> 05:42:05.580 align:start position:0%
one step farther and found out that some
 
05:42:08.628 --> 05:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
of that is related to the the eating
 
05:42:11.090 --> 05:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
disar order
 
05:42:13.430 --> 05:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
concern that we've been just addressing
 
05:42:16.310 --> 05:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
today and if you have seen that what
 
05:42:18.470 --> 05:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
kind of percentage are are you are you
 
05:42:20.628 --> 05:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
seeing High numbers of kids in this
 
05:42:22.670 --> 05:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
going in this direction or not I'd want
 
05:42:24.170 --> 05:42:24.180 align:start position:0%
to be careful on on giving you numbers
 
05:42:25.730 --> 05:42:25.740 align:start position:0%
but we can certainly can say in trying
 
05:42:28.250 --> 05:42:28.260 align:start position:0%
to research our work around this in
 
05:42:30.050 --> 05:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
preparation for this hearing is we
 
05:42:32.030 --> 05:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
certainly see a link as again I think
 
05:42:33.170 --> 05:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
representative Damon and others
 
05:42:35.810 --> 05:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
testified to between a student's ability
 
05:42:38.930 --> 05:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
to succeed on our campus and you know
 
05:42:41.030 --> 05:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
healthy eating uh body image issues ETC
 
05:42:44.208 --> 05:42:44.218 align:start position:0%
uh again so that is why we have in place
 
05:42:45.530 --> 05:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
and continue to try to put information
 
05:42:47.810 --> 05:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
out about the fact that these resources
 
05:42:47.820 --> 05:42:48.948 align:start position:0%
out about the fact that these resources
exist

05:42:48.948 --> 05:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
exist
 
05:42:51.650 --> 05:42:51.660 align:start position:0%
um that hopefully hit both whoever the
 
05:42:53.090 --> 05:42:53.100 align:start position:0%
student who might be might be struggling
 
05:42:54.770 --> 05:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
but as others had commented to their
 
05:42:56.448 --> 05:42:56.458 align:start position:0%
friends and colleagues faculty
 
05:42:57.590 --> 05:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
professors that they come in contact
 
05:42:59.750 --> 05:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
with will know where those resources are
 
05:43:01.550 --> 05:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
and try and urge them to take advantage
 
05:43:04.070 --> 05:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
of looking for the community colleges I
 
05:43:06.350 --> 05:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
I don't know numbers or percentage um I
 
05:43:07.368 --> 05:43:07.378 align:start position:0%
did in my conversation with
 
05:43:08.650 --> 05:43:08.660 align:start position:0%
representative wrong
 
05:43:12.170 --> 05:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
it seemed that her information that this
 
05:43:14.390 --> 05:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
this issue tends to manifest itself at
 
05:43:16.850 --> 05:43:16.860 align:start position:0%
an earlier age maybe than College which
 
05:43:18.470 --> 05:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
I think you know Matthew's testimony
 
05:43:20.570 --> 05:43:20.580 align:start position:0%
perhaps Bears out
 
05:43:22.610 --> 05:43:22.620 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions from the
 
05:43:22.620 --> 05:43:25.190 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions from the
committee

05:43:25.190 --> 05:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:28.490 --> 05:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
don't see any thank you very much
 
05:43:30.650 --> 05:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
written testimony I'll hand in it is
 
05:43:32.690 --> 05:43:32.700 align:start position:0%
pertinent to the underlying bill it's a
 
05:43:34.128 --> 05:43:34.138 align:start position:0%
little less from the do you have
 
05:43:37.368 --> 05:43:37.378 align:start position:0%
multiple copies there Tom or not okay
 
05:43:39.670 --> 05:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:43:44.810 --> 05:43:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:49.610 --> 05:43:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:49.620 --> 05:43:53.570 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:43:53.570 --> 05:43:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:58.670 --> 05:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:04.730 --> 05:44:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:06.650 --> 05:44:06.660 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Ladd members of the
 
05:44:09.110 --> 05:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Holly Stevens I'm
 
05:44:11.030 --> 05:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
the director of public policy for Nami
 
05:44:12.650 --> 05:44:12.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the National Alliance on
 
05:44:14.628 --> 05:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
Mental Illness
 
05:44:16.610 --> 05:44:16.620 align:start position:0%
um which is a non-profit Grassroots
 
05:44:18.470 --> 05:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
organization whose mission is to improve
 
05:44:20.990 --> 05:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
the lives of all people impacted by
 
05:44:22.850 --> 05:44:22.860 align:start position:0%
mental illness and suicide through
 
05:44:26.330 --> 05:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
education advocacy and support I guess
 
05:44:29.448 --> 05:44:29.458 align:start position:0%
one of the blessings about testifying in
 
05:44:31.850 --> 05:44:31.860 align:start position:0%
front of you towards the end is you've
 
05:44:33.650 --> 05:44:33.660 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of the statistics so I'm not
 
05:44:35.930 --> 05:44:35.940 align:start position:0%
going to go over a lot of them again but
 
05:44:38.048 --> 05:44:38.058 align:start position:0%
I do want to reiterate
 
05:44:41.390 --> 05:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
and doing some research around eating
 
05:44:44.090 --> 05:44:44.100 align:start position:0%
disorders in preparation for this
 
05:44:47.868 --> 05:44:47.878 align:start position:0%
hearing one of the things that we found
 
05:44:50.090 --> 05:44:50.100 align:start position:0%
out through a study and I'm going to
 
05:44:52.430 --> 05:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
send that study to you folks it's about
 
05:44:55.730 --> 05:44:55.740 align:start position:0%
90 pages so I didn't want to make print
 
05:44:57.650 --> 05:44:57.660 align:start position:0%
copies of it for everybody but I will
 
05:44:58.930 --> 05:44:58.940 align:start position:0%
send it to you
 
05:45:03.230 --> 05:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
that approximately 20 of those who are
 
05:45:07.250 --> 05:45:07.260 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with Anna anorexia nervosa die
 
05:45:09.170 --> 05:45:09.180 align:start position:0%
by Suicide
 
05:45:12.350 --> 05:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
that's not 20 percent they have thoughts
 
05:45:15.590 --> 05:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
of suicide or 20 percent that attempt
 
05:45:19.490 --> 05:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
suicide but 20 percent that die by
 
05:45:22.850 --> 05:45:22.860 align:start position:0%
Suicide this is one of the most fatal
 
05:45:25.368 --> 05:45:25.378 align:start position:0%
mental illnesses
 
05:45:30.350 --> 05:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
um that we have in our country today
 
05:45:34.548 --> 05:45:34.558 align:start position:0%
um and uh coupled with that
 
05:45:34.558 --> 05:45:35.390 align:start position:0%
um and uh coupled with that
um

05:45:35.390 --> 05:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:38.990 --> 05:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
and and the other for folks who have
 
05:45:41.990 --> 05:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
um any kind of symptoms of
 
05:45:45.530 --> 05:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
any eating disorder in general there are
 
05:45:48.770 --> 05:45:48.780 align:start position:0%
11 more 11 times more likely to attempt
 
05:45:50.570 --> 05:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
suicide so you know the suicide
 
05:45:53.270 --> 05:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
connection as you've heard is uh very
 
05:45:55.730 --> 05:45:55.740 align:start position:0%
strong with these folks and one of the
 
05:45:58.490 --> 05:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
things that we do know is that
 
05:46:00.470 --> 05:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
um the treatment resources in our state
 
05:46:02.990 --> 05:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
are limited we do not have residential
 
05:46:05.628 --> 05:46:05.638 align:start position:0%
or inpatient treatment at this point
 
05:46:07.628 --> 05:46:07.638 align:start position:0%
um during a conversation that I had
 
05:46:10.610 --> 05:46:10.620 align:start position:0%
there was a Hampstead Hospital presented
 
05:46:13.670 --> 05:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
at a meeting that I was at yesterday I
 
05:46:15.948 --> 05:46:15.958 align:start position:0%
brought up that fact to them to see if
 
05:46:19.250 --> 05:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
they would look into maybe adding some
 
05:46:22.430 --> 05:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
eating disorder treatment inpatient for
 
05:46:24.110 --> 05:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
the kiddos that they bring in and they
 
05:46:25.970 --> 05:46:25.980 align:start position:0%
are going to look at it but as of right
 
05:46:29.330 --> 05:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
now we don't have it and so therefore
 
05:46:31.970 --> 05:46:31.980 align:start position:0%
you know having this extra number on the
 
05:46:34.310 --> 05:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
back of a card where you've heard you
 
05:46:36.250 --> 05:46:36.260 align:start position:0%
know a kid who has an eating disorder
 
05:46:39.708 --> 05:46:39.718 align:start position:0%
who is not necessarily suicidal in the
 
05:46:42.350 --> 05:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
moment might look at that crisis this
 
05:46:44.750 --> 05:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
number and say that doesn't pertain to
 
05:46:49.070 --> 05:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
me I'm not suicidal I'm not in crisis
 
05:46:52.070 --> 05:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
I just go home every night and I eat a
 
05:46:54.350 --> 05:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
lot and then I throw up
 
05:46:57.288 --> 05:46:57.298 align:start position:0%
and so they know they've got something
 
05:47:00.170 --> 05:47:00.180 align:start position:0%
going on with their eating and so they
 
05:47:01.850 --> 05:47:01.860 align:start position:0%
might look at that card and say oh
 
05:47:03.948 --> 05:47:03.958 align:start position:0%
eating disorder support
 
05:47:07.788 --> 05:47:07.798 align:start position:0%
and actually text or call it and I know
 
05:47:09.890 --> 05:47:09.900 align:start position:0%
chairman lad you said well what if they
 
05:47:11.208 --> 05:47:11.218 align:start position:0%
don't even know they have an eating
 
05:47:13.190 --> 05:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
disorder and I agree with you they may
 
05:47:13.200 --> 05:47:14.208 align:start position:0%
disorder and I agree with you they may
not

05:47:14.208 --> 05:47:14.218 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:47:18.350 --> 05:47:18.360 align:start position:0%
but for the handful of kids that do know
 
05:47:21.410 --> 05:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
that this may save the life of I think
 
05:47:24.410 --> 05:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
if it saves even one life of one kid in
 
05:47:26.390 --> 05:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
the state it's worth putting that number
 
05:47:29.448 --> 05:47:29.458 align:start position:0%
on the back of these cards so I will end
 
05:47:30.890 --> 05:47:30.900 align:start position:0%
it with that
 
05:47:32.510 --> 05:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
um and take any questions that you may
 
05:47:35.690 --> 05:47:35.700 align:start position:0%
have I've provided my my testimony with
 
05:47:38.628 --> 05:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
the rest of the statistics that um again
 
05:47:40.070 --> 05:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
you've heard a lot of so I didn't want
 
05:47:42.350 --> 05:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
to reiterate in oral testimony in front
 
05:47:43.610 --> 05:47:43.620 align:start position:0%
of you today
 
05:47:46.010 --> 05:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions yes
 
05:47:48.590 --> 05:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
represent Cornell thank you thank you
 
05:47:50.330 --> 05:47:50.340 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I don't know if
 
05:47:52.910 --> 05:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
you can answer this the 20 that die by
 
05:47:54.948 --> 05:47:54.958 align:start position:0%
Suicide is there any way to know or do
 
05:47:56.570 --> 05:47:56.580 align:start position:0%
you have any statistics if they have an
 
05:47:58.448 --> 05:47:58.458 align:start position:0%
underlying mental health
 
05:48:02.690 --> 05:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
concern or is it because of the eating
 
05:48:06.170 --> 05:48:06.180 align:start position:0%
disorder that they commit suicide or
 
05:48:09.110 --> 05:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know the absolute answer to that
 
05:48:12.170 --> 05:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
because again you know it was
 
05:48:15.590 --> 05:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
um the statistics that I read in the
 
05:48:17.510 --> 05:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
2020 study that was done by the
 
05:48:19.788 --> 05:48:19.798 align:start position:0%
Strategic Training Initiative for the
 
05:48:21.350 --> 05:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
prevention of Eating Disorders which I
 
05:48:23.750 --> 05:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
will send to you so those stats are in
 
05:48:27.230 --> 05:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
that and I'm not sure if it you know
 
05:48:30.670 --> 05:48:30.680 align:start position:0%
clarified one way or the other but
 
05:48:33.770 --> 05:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
during your your discussion here you may
 
05:48:37.070 --> 05:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned eating and then throwing up
 
05:48:39.350 --> 05:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
is there any communication being done
 
05:48:41.570 --> 05:48:41.580 align:start position:0%
with Dennis obviously if something's
 
05:48:43.310 --> 05:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
throwing up there must be a lot of acid
 
05:48:45.730 --> 05:48:45.740 align:start position:0%
in that and that's gonna
 
05:48:49.368 --> 05:48:49.378 align:start position:0%
ruin teeth and gums I would assume uh is
 
05:48:51.410 --> 05:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
there any communication being done with
 
05:48:53.330 --> 05:48:53.340 align:start position:0%
dentists so when they see something like
 
05:48:55.070 --> 05:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
that that there can be a communication
 
05:48:58.430 --> 05:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
made or discussed with the individual or
 
05:49:00.048 --> 05:49:00.058 align:start position:0%
with the parent
 
05:49:02.330 --> 05:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there's any discussions
 
05:49:04.070 --> 05:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
going on with dentists I don't know if
 
05:49:05.868 --> 05:49:05.878 align:start position:0%
there's anybody behind me that knows the
 
05:49:07.548 --> 05:49:07.558 align:start position:0%
answer to that question representative I
 
05:49:09.288 --> 05:49:09.298 align:start position:0%
think they're going like this so let's
 
05:49:16.310 --> 05:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:19.010 --> 05:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
um dentists are aware of this there's
 
05:49:21.470 --> 05:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
actually a specific pattern of erosion
 
05:49:23.208 --> 05:49:23.218 align:start position:0%
of enamel that occurs in people who are
 
05:49:25.670 --> 05:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
bulimic that's different from just
 
05:49:30.170 --> 05:49:30.180 align:start position:0%
regular Decay it's where the acid lands
 
05:49:33.288 --> 05:49:33.298 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge there has not been it's
 
05:49:35.448 --> 05:49:35.458 align:start position:0%
a really good idea
 
05:49:35.458 --> 05:49:37.250 align:start position:0%
a really good idea
um

05:49:37.250 --> 05:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:39.650 --> 05:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
public education Outreach to dentists I
 
05:49:41.270 --> 05:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
mean dentists could be diagnosing people
 
05:49:43.310 --> 05:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
or at least referring people for
 
05:49:45.530 --> 05:49:45.540 align:start position:0%
diagnosis because it is so specific
 
05:49:47.990 --> 05:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
05:49:50.570 --> 05:49:50.580 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
05:49:54.650 --> 05:49:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:57.948 --> 05:49:57.958 align:start position:0%
uh we have uh Becky are you going to
 
05:49:59.990 --> 05:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
speak on this
 
05:50:04.610 --> 05:50:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:06.288 --> 05:50:06.298 align:start position:0%
there's two cards left that means I'm
 
05:50:08.090 --> 05:50:08.100 align:start position:0%
not the closer I also like you don't get
 
05:50:10.070 --> 05:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
the no you don't win the prize that's
 
05:50:13.310 --> 05:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:14.930 --> 05:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for the record Becky Wilson
 
05:50:16.430 --> 05:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire school boards
 
05:50:16.440 --> 05:50:18.048 align:start position:0%

Association
 
05:50:19.730 --> 05:50:19.740 align:start position:0%
um we are not taking a position on this
 
05:50:22.010 --> 05:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
bill I did email the committee
 
05:50:23.628 --> 05:50:23.638 align:start position:0%
um some information and a cover letter
 
05:50:26.690 --> 05:50:26.700 align:start position:0%
earlier today in regards to this bill
 
05:50:29.270 --> 05:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
um and I certainly want to express our
 
05:50:29.280 --> 05:50:30.288 align:start position:0%
um and I certainly want to express our
support

05:50:30.288 --> 05:50:30.298 align:start position:0%
support
 
05:50:32.090 --> 05:50:32.100 align:start position:0%
um for the intent of this bill and to
 
05:50:33.708 --> 05:50:33.718 align:start position:0%
the sponsors of this bill for bringing
 
05:50:35.510 --> 05:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
this forward and to the young gentleman
 
05:50:37.788 --> 05:50:37.798 align:start position:0%
who was so eloquent in speaking prior to
 
05:50:40.910 --> 05:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
me on this bill as a previous District
 
05:50:43.788 --> 05:50:43.798 align:start position:0%
administrator and also as a high school
 
05:50:45.288 --> 05:50:45.298 align:start position:0%
administrator and a high school teacher
 
05:50:47.628 --> 05:50:47.638 align:start position:0%
prior to that a person with their
 
05:50:49.070 --> 05:50:49.080 align:start position:0%
license and emotional behavioral
 
05:50:51.650 --> 05:50:51.660 align:start position:0%
disorders and a mother of four children
 
05:50:56.270 --> 05:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
ages 17 18 19 and 21. I am deeply
 
05:50:58.548 --> 05:50:58.558 align:start position:0%
entrenched in these kind of mental
 
05:51:01.010 --> 05:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
health issues and struggles that follow
 
05:51:03.770 --> 05:51:03.780 align:start position:0%
young people these days and it does you
 
05:51:05.390 --> 05:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
know we do see it quite earlier and
 
05:51:08.030 --> 05:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
earlier in our school careers as
 
05:51:10.670 --> 05:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
administrators and teachers so
 
05:51:12.708 --> 05:51:12.718 align:start position:0%
um but as this committee most of you
 
05:51:15.048 --> 05:51:15.058 align:start position:0%
know a very similar bill was brought
 
05:51:17.930 --> 05:51:17.940 align:start position:0%
forward last year by the parents of
 
05:51:20.090 --> 05:51:20.100 align:start position:0%
Jason Dickey a young man who died by
 
05:51:22.730 --> 05:51:22.740 align:start position:0%
Suicide well after he had left high
 
05:51:24.948 --> 05:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
school but for people who were not here
 
05:51:28.730 --> 05:51:28.740 align:start position:0%
he had still his school ID on him when
 
05:51:30.770 --> 05:51:30.780 align:start position:0%
his parents found him and the parents
 
05:51:32.510 --> 05:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
felt that had the number been on there
 
05:51:35.150 --> 05:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
that perhaps he would have reached out
 
05:51:36.948 --> 05:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
even though he was well past his high
 
05:51:39.128 --> 05:51:39.138 align:start position:0%
school graduation year
 
05:51:41.570 --> 05:51:41.580 align:start position:0%
there was concern by the committee
 
05:51:43.250 --> 05:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
members and the legislators at that time
 
05:51:45.110 --> 05:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
that put in the National Suicide
 
05:51:47.270 --> 05:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
Prevention Hotline title on the card
 
05:51:49.850 --> 05:51:49.860 align:start position:0%
might dissuade some students from
 
05:51:52.610 --> 05:51:52.620 align:start position:0%
calling simply because of the stigma of
 
05:51:55.430 --> 05:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
the name of that line so it was stated
 
05:51:57.590 --> 05:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
in that bill that it would be listed on
 
05:51:59.208 --> 05:51:59.218 align:start position:0%
the IDS as the mental health support
 
05:52:01.910 --> 05:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
line so it is not listed as a Suicide
 
05:52:04.190 --> 05:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
Prevention Hotline per se and at the
 
05:52:06.770 --> 05:52:06.780 align:start position:0%
same time schools and districts did have
 
05:52:08.208 --> 05:52:08.218 align:start position:0%
the option of listing The New National
 
05:52:10.970 --> 05:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
number the 988 number which is the
 
05:52:13.190 --> 05:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
national hotline for help
 
05:52:15.170 --> 05:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
and we would just
 
05:52:17.270 --> 05:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
um ask if the sponsors of this bill
 
05:52:18.830 --> 05:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
might consider or the committee a
 
05:52:21.230 --> 05:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
further consideration of an amendment to
 
05:52:25.190 --> 05:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
list the 988 number it does cover an
 
05:52:27.590 --> 05:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
extraordinary number of mental health
 
05:52:30.530 --> 05:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
needs for students and you can certainly
 
05:52:33.770 --> 05:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
look on there and see that for students
 
05:52:35.270 --> 05:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
that anybody that would call it covers
 
05:52:38.448 --> 05:52:38.458 align:start position:0%

of those things if anybody were to call
 
05:53:03.470 --> 05:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
with any of those concerns and they will
 
05:53:07.010 --> 05:53:07.020 align:start position:0%
then route you to the Statewide for in

Monday through Thursday and Fridays from
 
05:53:42.708 --> 05:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
11 to 5 which a lot of students that
 
05:53:44.150 --> 05:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
might have access to this number are
 
05:53:45.770 --> 05:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
going to be in school during those times
 
05:53:48.470 --> 05:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
or in after school activities and
 
05:53:51.410 --> 05:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
texting is much more limited Monday to

05:54:00.048 --> 05:54:00.058 align:start position:0%
experience with young people or
 
05:54:01.850 --> 05:54:01.860 align:start position:0%
teenagers these days but reaching out
 
05:54:04.128 --> 05:54:04.138 align:start position:0%
for mental health issues can be really
 
05:54:07.430 --> 05:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
overwhelming text does seem to be for
 
05:54:09.530 --> 05:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
many people a more comfortable way to
 
05:54:12.770 --> 05:54:12.780 align:start position:0%
start so if that is a limited option for
 
05:54:14.930 --> 05:54:14.940 align:start position:0%
some of these lines depending on what is
 
05:54:17.448 --> 05:54:17.458 align:start position:0%
going to be listed it may dissuade some
 
05:54:19.190 --> 05:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
students if it isn't in the moment kind
 
05:54:20.390 --> 05:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
of thing where they're reaching out for

available to the maximum extent possible
 
05:54:27.948 --> 05:54:27.958 align:start position:0%
I think for people that age and again
 
05:54:31.310 --> 05:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
this is not at all to minimize the
 
05:54:32.868 --> 05:54:32.878 align:start position:0%
concerns about eating disorders in
 
05:54:35.030 --> 05:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
general we certainly support the intents
 
05:54:37.250 --> 05:54:37.260 align:start position:0%
of this bill overall we want all of our
 
05:54:39.650 --> 05:54:39.660 align:start position:0%

important bill

as a society we value our children and
 
05:55:22.970 --> 05:55:22.980 align:start position:0%
recognize the benefits to them
 
05:55:25.190 --> 05:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
our communities and society when we

hb35 is a tool aimed to do just that I'd
 
05:55:34.250 --> 05:55:34.260 align:start position:0%
like to take this opportunity to say how
 
05:55:36.410 --> 05:55:36.420 align:start position:0%
proud We are in Merrimack of Matt Brown
 
05:55:38.690 --> 05:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
a 14 year old freshman who's been so
 
05:55:40.850 --> 05:55:40.860 align:start position:0%
inspired to advocate for the health and
 
05:55:43.070 --> 05:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
lives of his peers and has made his way
 
05:55:45.590 --> 05:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
here to testify I agree with the
 
05:55:47.570 --> 05:55:47.580 align:start position:0%
testimony offered earlier that students
 
05:55:49.670 --> 05:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
that would be impacted by the passage of
 
05:55:52.610 --> 05:55:52.620 align:start position:0%
this bill would be far more likely to
 
05:55:54.410 --> 05:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
call or text a number they see a
 
05:55:58.670 --> 05:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
specific to an issue affecting them in
 
05:56:00.830 --> 05:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
their lives as a mother and a
 
05:56:02.690 --> 05:56:02.700 align:start position:0%
grandmother and retired nurse who worked
 
05:56:04.190 --> 05:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
in the Pediatric and mental health
 
05:56:06.288 --> 05:56:06.298 align:start position:0%
Fields I see the Eating Disorders
 
05:56:08.330 --> 05:56:08.340 align:start position:0%
hotline contact information on student
 
05:56:11.628 --> 05:56:11.638 align:start position:0%
IDs as a readily acceptable accessible
 
05:56:14.510 --> 05:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
tool for our children to access the help
 
05:56:17.090 --> 05:56:17.100 align:start position:0%
they need increased positive Health
 
05:56:19.490 --> 05:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
outcomes and save lives
 
05:56:21.470 --> 05:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
not only is this bill an important way
 
05:56:22.970 --> 05:56:22.980 align:start position:0%
to address the growing Health crisis
 
05:56:25.548 --> 05:56:25.558 align:start position:0%
facing Our Youth and give them a fast
 
05:56:27.350 --> 05:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
and convenient way to access help but it
 
05:56:29.750 --> 05:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
also saves money a report by the
 
05:56:31.548 --> 05:56:31.558 align:start position:0%

economics found that Eating Disorders
 
05:56:41.990 --> 05:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
cost New Hampshire over 368 million
 
05:56:44.510 --> 05:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
dollars in medical costs loss of
 
05:56:47.990 --> 05:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
productivity and more passage of hb35
 
05:56:51.170 --> 05:56:51.180 align:start position:0%
has potential to reduce these costs and
 
05:56:53.090 --> 05:56:53.100 align:start position:0%
the negative impacts on our children's
 
05:56:55.670 --> 05:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
health and lives I would urge the
