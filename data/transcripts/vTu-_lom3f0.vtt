00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 align:start position:0%
executive session on HB 282 increasing
 
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
the maximum benefits for First
 
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
Responders critically injured in the
 
00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:12.199 align:start position:0%
line of duty uh representative Warden do
 
00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
you have a motion I move inexpedient to
 
00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
legislate on 282 FM a motion inexpedient
 
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
to legislate is made by representative
 
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
Warden is there a second represent
 
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
Flanigan as you're discussing other
 
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
matters do you have a second on this
 
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate
 
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
that H Mr Warden would you like to yeah
 
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
like to address your your motion please
 
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
just briefly this bill was designed to
 
00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:43.479 align:start position:0%
double the total benefits paid from the
 
00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:44.589 align:start position:0%
double the total benefits paid from the
current

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
$500,000 to a million dollars per banum
 
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
we heard some testimony that the current
 
00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
maximum 500,000 has not yet been reached
 
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
in any bium so I think we're better off
 
00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:58.039 align:start position:0%
just leaving it as it is usually when
 
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
you expand a pot things find a way of
 
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
filling it and I think we should be more
 
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
conservative on this thank
 
00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:07.479 align:start position:0%
you and representative flang do you have
 
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
anything to add to the
 
00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
motion sorry Mr chairman no I agree with
 
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative Warden I I I
 
00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:18.199 align:start position:0%
too feel that if there was a need or
 
00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:19.879 align:start position:0%
demand then we should be looking at it
 
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:21.800 align:start position:0%
but since it hasn't met that Threshold
 
00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:23.639 align:start position:0%
at all anyway that we should just leave
 
00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
it the way it is okay are there any
 
00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
other comments or discussions
 
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
representative solivan
 
00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:33.639 align:start position:0%
during the hearing I
 
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
um asked a question about the um the
 
00:07:42.749 --> 00:07:42.759 align:start position:0%
possibility of a uh New Hampshire
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
version of 911 I'm sure that we don't
 
00:07:47.149 --> 00:07:47.159 align:start position:0%
have any skyscrapers or anything but it
 
00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:50.199 align:start position:0%
is not inconceivable that we could have
 
00:07:54.029 --> 00:07:54.039 align:start position:0%
a true disaster um where we would have
 
00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
multiple fire firefighters who might be
 
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:01.400 align:start position:0%
um injured or killed and if that were to
 
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
happen um 500,000 wouldn't be enough and
 
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
frankly a million dollars wouldn't be
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
enough um and one of the um people
 
00:08:12.309 --> 00:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
testifying uh suggested that perhaps
 
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
there should be no no cap on this
 
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
because if you had a disaster like that
 
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
we would want to spend the money um so
 
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to oppose the itl because I
 
00:08:25.469 --> 00:08:25.479 align:start position:0%
think um going to a million would be a
 
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
good start thank
 
00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie thank
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
you I I want to uh agree with
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan on this issue
 
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
you know the nature of the business is
 
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.750 align:start position:0%
you know the nature of the business is
incredibly

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
incredibly
 
00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
unpredictable so in instead of building
 
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
the fund to absorb potential uh issues
 
00:08:55.949 --> 00:08:55.959 align:start position:0%
and potential crisis that that uh that
 
00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
might occur in using this opportunity to
 
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:01.240 align:start position:0%
do that instead we decide we're going to
 
00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to cut that back because
 
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
well there's no
 
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:08.440 align:start position:0%
need well the as you mentioned
 
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
9911 at 8:00 in the morning there was no
 
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
need at 7:30 but at 8:00 or 8:30 when
 
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
that thing hit the the towers it was
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
there was a big need that's the nature
 
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
of the business and so we should take
 
00:09:25.069 --> 00:09:25.079 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to build that fund up
 
00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:27.399 align:start position:0%
to absorb things that could potentially
 
00:09:29.949 --> 00:09:29.959 align:start position:0%
occur now I can tell you man
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
Chester by the grace of God there were
 
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
two firefighters in the last couple
 
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
years one of which we pulled out of a
 
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
building dead he was dead in the
 
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
building and they revived him on the
 
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
outside went back to work the other one
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
was hanging out the window burnt half
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
his hands burnt them all uh he suffered
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
very serious injuries and ended up in
 
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
the Boston Hospital those are two
 
00:09:57.069 --> 00:09:57.079 align:start position:0%
firefighters in one town over the last
 
00:09:59.710 --> 00:09:59.720 align:start position:0%
couple years it almost died all almost
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
died one of them did but for the grace
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
of God we revived him so this is the
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
nature of the business take this
 
00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity to build a fund don't cheap
 
00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
out on this thing you you owe it to the
 
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
firefighters and officers who who do
 
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
this kind of work so thank you Mr
 
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:19.720 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you I appreciate your
 
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
comments president K thank you Mr chair
 
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:27.160 align:start position:0%
uh I was here when we created this uh
 
00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
fund and it was in response to to the
 
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
shooting of a young uh Manchester police
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
officer several wounds in his abdomen uh
 
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.710 align:start position:0%
officer several wounds in his abdomen uh
doing

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
permanent irreparable harm to his organs
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
and bipartisan we could we couldn't pass
 
00:10:44.629 --> 00:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
it fast
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
enough and I I note that in this bill
 
00:10:51.069 --> 00:10:51.079 align:start position:0%
there is no effort to increase the
 
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
125 per person maximum is just adding
 
00:10:57.629 --> 00:10:57.639 align:start position:0%
more in the in the event that there are
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
multiple people injured
 
00:11:01.949 --> 00:11:01.959 align:start position:0%
and you know with the things that happen
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
in the world today you could have
 
00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
firefighters police officers
 
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
EMTs they're all out there we don't know
 
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
what they're going to run into there
 
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
could be any number of injuries any
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
number of people hurt you know with
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
those kind of injuries and we shouldn't
 
00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
be waiting to see if it happens we
 
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
should raise this to to to uh 100,000
 
00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
and hoping we never we never reach that
 
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you all right sir thank you
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
what is that Susy thank you Mr chairman
 
00:11:33.949 --> 00:11:33.959 align:start position:0%
I want to Echo the sentiments of my
 
00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:35.720 align:start position:0%
colleagues here because someone who
 
00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:39.079 align:start position:0%
worked in Nashville for 29 years um came
 
00:11:41.629 --> 00:11:41.639 align:start position:0%
very close to being paralyzed for the
 
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
rest of my life when an air conditioner
 
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
from three stories above came down
 
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
knocked me in the head knocked me
 
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
unconscious woke up about four minutes
 
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
later gagging on blood spitting out
 
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
teeth hole in my tongue forehead wide
 
00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.230 align:start position:0%
teeth hole in my tongue forehead wide
open

00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
so when I went to work that morning it
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
was never expected that was going to
 
00:12:04.629 --> 00:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
happen but it did so I just want to Echo
 
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
the sentiments of these people in here
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
that you know we shouldn't wait till
 
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:11.720 align:start position:0%
something happens to expand the fund if
 
00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:13.519 align:start position:0%
we don't use it that's great I think
 
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
that's the best way to go let's not use
 
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
it um but if it's if something drastic
 
00:12:21.069 --> 00:12:21.079 align:start position:0%
happens in the state I definitely think
 
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
the money should be there so thank
 
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
you okay representative Clint excuse me
 
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker um we're always
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
talking about thanking our First
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
Responders and backing our First
 
00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
Responders so let's uh let's show them
 
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
that we really do and uh pass this Bill
 
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:39.670 align:start position:0%
that we really do and uh pass this Bill
thank

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:45.519 align:start position:0%
you represent flan thank you Mr chairman
 
00:12:47.949 --> 00:12:47.959 align:start position:0%
um I I hear all the comments and I can
 
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate our Our First Responders um
 
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
at the same token is if we do go over
 
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
that amount I would imagine we could
 
00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
probably find money in the general fund
 
00:13:00.509 --> 00:13:00.519 align:start position:0%
to to supplement it if in fact it went
 
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
over because there always the rainy day
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
fund that we tend to have millions of
 
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
dollars in uh and I think the math is
 
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
showing that as representative Warden uh
 
00:13:13.949 --> 00:13:13.959 align:start position:0%
said that um that we haven't gone over
 
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
the number so I think we should just
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
leave it there thank
 
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
you represent kale thank you Mr CH I I
 
00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
wonder if the the timing of the Calamity
 
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
would make a difference if we were not
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
in session what with if the uh governor
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
and executive Counsel had just met that
 
00:13:36.189 --> 00:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
Wednesday and now we have to wait two
 
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
weeks for another meeting uh how long
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
would it take to arrange this fund to
 
00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.829 align:start position:0%
would it take to arrange this fund to
suddenly

00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:49.160 align:start position:0%
appear okay I I do have I have one
 
00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.790 align:start position:0%
appear okay I I do have I have one
comment

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
so just bear with me a sec I I was
 
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:55.720 align:start position:0%
intimately aware of 911 I watched the
 
00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
Pentagon burn as my wife was in it and
 
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:02.519 align:start position:0%
so I understand the impact of of those
 
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
types of things and I and I am of the
 
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:07.240 align:start position:0%
opinion and we thought about this before
 
00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
we made the motion is that we could
 
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
react if necessary and I look at the the
 
00:14:15.949 --> 00:14:15.959 align:start position:0%
current state of the of the fund and we
 
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:17.800 align:start position:0%
have not gone above two-thirds of that
 
00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.110 align:start position:0%
have not gone above two-thirds of that
fund

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
historically and so I think it's enough
 
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
to to take those challenges that
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
come uh that we would anticipate if
 
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
there's a challenge that we don't
 
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:31.720 align:start position:0%
anticipate that I do have faith that we
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
as legislators and with the executive
 
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
branch could handle that and and that's
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
why I support an
 
00:14:41.949 --> 00:14:41.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:45.160 align:start position:0%

would you like to speak to your motion
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
yes so when we heard testimony we heard
 
00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:11.959 align:start position:0%
a lot about how uh workers compensation
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
uh can cover a lot of these Services
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
also when you look into uh a lot of the
 
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
stuff that came in through the portal
 
00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.079 align:start position:0%
and different comments uh there are some
 
00:17:20.669 --> 00:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
other services uh that are not
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
government related uh one of them is New
 
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:25.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 988 um there's also some other
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
services out there that do this exact
 
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
thing in the private sector that also
 
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
helped through workers comp when we
 
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
up okay thank you representative Hall
 
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
motion nothing really Dad I think
 
00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:41.799 align:start position:0%
there's sufficient services that we
 
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
don't need to add this on okay thank you
 
00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
and representative suan for a
 
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
comment yes um and we actually discussed
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
this the um during the hearing um it
 
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
appeared that some of the folks
 
00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
testifying were looking at a fiscal note
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
um however the committee did not have
 
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
that fiscal note the committee still
 
00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:04.280 align:start position:0%
does not have that fiscal note and I
 
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
think that fiscal note um would be very
 
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
helpful in figuring out if there's a way
 
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
to um make this work and I would um hope
 
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
that we could postpone um voting on this
 
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
until we have all the information that
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
this okay uh good
 
00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
this represent Flanigan thank you Mr
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan um the motion is
 
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
based that there's other services that
 
00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
are out there it's not the fiscal note
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
the money the dollar amount that it
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
would cost and I respect representative
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
Sullivan's opinion however you know I
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
think where we're looking at is the fact
 
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
that the service is already out there
 
00:18:57.149 --> 00:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
not the dollar amount of the
 
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
services okay got good point any other F
 
00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:01.870 align:start position:0%
services okay got good point any other F
further

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
Sullivan yeah I'll Dove a little deeper
 
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
then um the uh employee assistance
 
00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
program that uh was proposed here is a
 
00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:17.240 align:start position:0%
fast acting process um workers comp is
 
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
not um and um when someone has this type
 
00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
um trauma um they need quick assistance
 
00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
and that that quick assistance might be
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
enough to make it so that workers comp
 
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't come into play um and will save
 
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
money o o overall a lot of times these
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
folks just need one or two um sessions
 
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
with a counselor to um deal with the
 
00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:46.919 align:start position:0%
PTSD that's that's building and I think
 
00:19:48.909 --> 00:19:48.919 align:start position:0%
the uh employee assistance program is
 
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
the ideal mechanism to do that and I
 
00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
don't think we were looking at a great
 
00:19:55.149 --> 00:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
deal of cost but unfortunately we didn't
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
have an accurate cost um so um
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
I I intended to put put forth an
 
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
amendment um uh to um to put that cost
 
00:20:09.789 --> 00:20:09.799 align:start position:0%
into the bill but uh just don't have the
 
00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
information yet so I would renew my
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
request to uh postpone so that we could
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
um provide another fast acting tool for
 
00:20:24.029 --> 00:20:24.039 align:start position:0%
these um um First Responders to um deal
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
and Mr Allen any word on a fiscal note
 
00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:34.919 align:start position:0%
and we talked about it
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
you are there any other comments
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
representative kill thank you Mr chair
 
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh it would seem that if the EAS system
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
is the ideal uh assistance and the the
 
00:20:56.669 --> 00:20:56.679 align:start position:0%
bill would increase the funding to allow
 
00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
them to meet the need and I I don't
 
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
doubt there is a need then I would ask
 
00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:04.360 align:start position:0%
the committee to defeat the itl so that
 
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
we might postpone and get more
 
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
information and and see really what the
 
00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
what the dollar amount is and if we if
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not we're willing to make
 
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:17.320 align:start position:0%
that I think small investment to prevent
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
other additional costs uh such as
 
00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:23.919 align:start position:0%
workers comp and perhaps uh very serious
 
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
uh mental health issues in our first
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
are there any other further comments
 
00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:33.919 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie just a a point
 
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:37.640 align:start position:0%
of clarification Mr chairman um workers
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
comp has been mentioned here uh I I
 
00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:43.039 align:start position:0%
don't think workers comp covers uh
 
00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
Employee Assistance programs now they
 
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
may what they probably would cover most
 
00:21:52.269 --> 00:21:52.279 align:start position:0%
likely is if somebody fell apart and had
 
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:55.240 align:start position:0%
a mental breakdown or some other related
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
issues over um you know but they don't
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
cover that I know of uh those kinds of
 
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
programs so just for
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you any other
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
labry regarding the the financial note
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
on this I know we haven't seen one or
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
heard one specifically but was there
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
testimony from the sponsor correct me if
 
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong was it $150,000 ask in 106 for
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
somebody to administrate this is is that
 
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
what the cost was
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's just a question I the reason I
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
asked the question with a hiring freeze
 
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
and budget cuts I'm just trying to
 
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
square it all that's
 
00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.390 align:start position:0%
square it all that's
all

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
standby representative
 
00:22:47.549 --> 00:22:47.559 align:start position:0%
Solin I believe that as we were doing
 
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
sort of about back of the envelope um
 
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
math um I believe the amount that was
 
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned was
 
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
$270,000 um I I would I would be uncom
 
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
comtable um creating an amendment using
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
a number that was just sort of thrown
 
00:23:05.789 --> 00:23:05.799 align:start position:0%
out during um a hearing um especially
 
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
knowing that it's it's a second
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
committee bill it needs a fiscal note
 
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
it's got to show up sometime so um I I
 
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
just think we a better informed uh U
 
00:23:24.909 --> 00:23:24.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:28.029 --> 00:23:28.039 align:start position:0%
conclusion there's Schultz or cor stab
 
00:23:31.149 --> 00:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you um I I just have a
 
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
question we're talking about workman's
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
comp and from what I understand this was
 
00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
um to uh help very small rural um
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
firefighting groups and also um
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighting groups do
 
00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:00.029 --> 00:24:00.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:00.039 --> 00:24:01.110 align:start position:0%
 
represent

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
suiv with regard to workers comp um it
 
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
would cover PTSD but you would have to
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
prove that the PTSD was related to your
 
00:24:12.909 --> 00:24:12.919 align:start position:0%
firefighting work which can be a
 
00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
laborous um uh project so um the
 
00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:20.039 align:start position:0%
employee assistance program doesn't
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
require proof of a you know connection
 
00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
um workers comp does that's that's why
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
this employee um assistance program is
 
00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
um uh I I think a good stop Gap in in
 
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
between um someone who's you know
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
feeling the build of um trauma and
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
Trauma related mental health and someone
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
who is completely broken down to the
 
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
point where they need workers comp to
 
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
cover you know missed work medical bills
 
00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:50.799 align:start position:0%
and so on um it's it's an in between
 
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:53.919 align:start position:0%
layer that that can avoid workers comp
 
00:24:53.919 --> 00:24:57.110 align:start position:0%
layer that that can avoid workers comp
thank

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:59.789 --> 00:24:59.799 align:start position:0%
you okay so th this is a great
 
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
discussion and I'm just R reviewing my
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
notes and listening to the the
 
00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.789 align:start position:0%
notes and listening to the the
recommendations

00:25:05.789 --> 00:25:05.799 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
I I guess where I fall on it is that
 
00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
uh I think there are other ways there
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
there definitely is a way for these
 
00:25:16.389 --> 00:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
people to get the compensation they
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
needed there are other agencies
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
available and that those agencies aren't
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily tied to the fiscal note uh
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
so subject to any further questions I'd
 
00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
like to go ahead and hold the vote
 
00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:31.480 align:start position:0%

statement to make on your motion brief
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
comments this build generally advocates
 
00:28:00.269 --> 00:28:00.279 align:start position:0%
for attorneys to be able to capture
 
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
unlimited fees and costs Upon A Le level
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
one hearing at the Department of Labor
 
00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
currently attorneys are able to collect
 
00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
those fees at the level two appeal
 
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
hearings the committee also felt that it
 
00:28:13.389 --> 00:28:13.399 align:start position:0%
would uh Drive insurance rates and it
 
00:28:15.149 --> 00:28:15.159 align:start position:0%
would also potentially drive more
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
claims okay thank you and representative
 
00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:24.799 align:start position:0%
avalani do you have uh comments to your
 
00:28:27.509 --> 00:28:27.519 align:start position:0%
motion uh representative La uh was very
 
00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
eloquent thank you thank you all right
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
are there any other comments
 
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie sir thank you uh
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
I I would just take exception Mr chair
 
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
to the uh comment about
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
unlimited unrestrained uh costs uh in
 
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
the sense that uh the cost for for this
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
program this benefit or whatever uh is
 
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
would be the same I would think as it is
 
00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
for the other levels and it would be uh
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
governed by the uh the department of
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
label who has to approve all these uh
 
00:29:03.149 --> 00:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
fees so it's not it's not
 
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
unrestrained okay fair enough thank you
 
00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
right was
 
00:29:07.279 --> 00:29:08.870 align:start position:0%
right was
Solin

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
Solin
 
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
um I would agree with that point and I
 
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
would also raise another point that um
 
00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
uh there was testimony heard that when
 
00:29:21.149 --> 00:29:21.159 align:start position:0%
these um hearings are scheduled if
 
00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
there's representation for both sides
 
00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:26.200 align:start position:0%
they schedule them for an hour if
 
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
there's no represent presentation on um
 
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
the worker side they schedule it for an
 
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
hour and a half um so effectively um the
 
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:38.440 align:start position:0%
message sent is that when there's
 
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
somebody in the room that knows what
 
00:29:43.389 --> 00:29:43.399 align:start position:0%
they're doing um and guiding the the
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
hearing in a productive and uh
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
reasonable way um it's it's much more
 
00:29:52.669 --> 00:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
efficient um the other advantage of
 
00:29:55.509 --> 00:29:55.519 align:start position:0%
having an attorney involved is that if
 
00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
an if a worker goes to an attorney um
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
with with a just a bad appeal um you
 
00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
know the insurance company has denied
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
the claim and the um the worker mad and
 
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
goes to the attorney saying I want you
 
00:30:14.029 --> 00:30:14.039 align:start position:0%
to help me fight this thing if they've
 
00:30:16.389 --> 00:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
got no prayer the attorney is not going
 
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
to represent them and they will explain
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
why they have a bad case um so again I
 
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
think you get more efficiency out of
 
00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:26.799 align:start position:0%
people who are represented by a
 
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
competent workers to um attorney so um
 
00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
uh I think this would actually be an
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
improvement on the system thank you okay
 
00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any representative K
 
00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I I I also think that
 
00:30:46.029 --> 00:30:46.039 align:start position:0%
the presence of an attorney uh as my
 
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
colleague said you know would help
 
00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:49.919 align:start position:0%
screen out uh cases that really weren't
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
going to go anywhere but also I think it
 
00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:54.799 align:start position:0%
would likely bring a a settlement that
 
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
both parties can live with and that's
 
00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.470 align:start position:0%
both parties can live with and that's
equitable

00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
equitable
 
00:31:00.389 --> 00:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
uh you've probably seen the ads on TV
 
00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:02.559 align:start position:0%
you know you got an injury you know the
 
00:31:04.509 --> 00:31:04.519 align:start position:0%
our attorneys you know get you what you
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
deserve and you know the other the
 
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
insurance company will crumble just when
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
they see our name on the on the case
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
that might be a little bit of
 
00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:13.519 align:start position:0%
exaggeration but I think even attorney
 
00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
Russo felt that uh you know there was a
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
question about you know attorneys cost
 
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
more or they just bring more value so uh
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to buote against the
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
itl thank you
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
sir representative Flanigan
 
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I don't want to
 
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
um pound this into the ground but I mean
 
00:31:35.149 --> 00:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
these people are represented by
 
00:31:36.669 --> 00:31:36.679 align:start position:0%
attorneys it's not a matter of if they
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
can get an attorney they they can get
 
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
attorneys the issue is who pays for it
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
and about 10 five years ago six years
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
ago uh chairman infantine and I worked
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
on revising the entire workers comp
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
statue in the state of New Hampshire it
 
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:56.559 align:start position:0%
was a lot of work uh but the concern was
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
that workers comps uh premiums were
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
going really too high to a point where
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
we only had three
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
carriers now we have a much larger
 
00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:07.559 align:start position:0%
number than three carriers in the state
 
00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire but that's all I going
 
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:11.480 align:start position:0%
say as there is attorneys there that
 
00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
that will represent them so okay and
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
represent K thank you Mr chair and just
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
to assist my learning colleague with
 
00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
whom I've served several terms uh we did
 
00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:24.919 align:start position:0%
hear from uh the uh attorney represented
 
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
the insurers uh that
 
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
in in fact uh our our rates are down
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
because our safety standards our safety
 
00:32:36.669 --> 00:32:36.679 align:start position:0%
practices are better I think that's the
 
00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:39.519 align:start position:0%
key to this and if we improve safety as
 
00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:41.240 align:start position:0%
in the public sector as well just
 
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559 align:start position:0%
another plug for that um then then we
 
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
could do better it's the safety keeping
 
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
if reduce the claims then you have fewer
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
people going on appeals you have fewer
 
00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
injuries that's that's the key to lower
 
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no further

there any uh discussion to this motion
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
represent Sullivan yes um
 
00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
as I testified um last week um this bill
 
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
has come a long way it has vastly
 
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
improved from where where it was four
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
five years ago um that doesn't mean it's
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
perfect um and I'm uh persuaded that uh
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
if we retain the bill and continue to
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
work in a bipartisan way to try to um
 
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to say perfect it it might
 
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
never be perfect but improve um make
 
00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
make it a bit better so it's more
 
00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:29.560 align:start position:0%
palatable to the entire committee or at
 
00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:32.200 align:start position:0%
least the majority of the committee then
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm not going to say I'm happy to
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
do that but I'm willing to do that and
 
00:35:41.069 --> 00:35:41.079 align:start position:0%
um uh been working on this too long to
 
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh to see it go down in flame so I'm
 
00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
happy to keep working on it so thank you
 
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
and I I just uh from my perspective you
 
00:35:52.589 --> 00:35:52.599 align:start position:0%
know if you look at the numbers that
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
were provided us um over the weekend the
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
the fact of matters our public employees
 
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
are injured at a higher rate 2 to 4%
 
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
based on the year than there than the um
 
00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
than the private sector and the uh I'm
 
00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:13.079 align:start position:0%
not saying it's a direct cause to OSHA
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
but clearly anything we could do to
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
protect our workers we should
 
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:19.480 align:start position:0%
do um but I look at this bill as it is
 
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:21.400 align:start position:0%
and there's two big concerns that jump
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
out of me first is that I mean if you if
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
you take the OSHA regulations and you
 
00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:30.440 align:start position:0%
put them into this room you print them
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
all out they would fill this room and my
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
fear is that we subject New Hampshire to
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
that volume and the and the cost
 
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:39.640 align:start position:0%
associated with implementing that and I
 
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
understand that the bill is written so
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
that that's not supposed to happen but
 
00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not convinced it wouldn't happen and
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
then the other thing is that the
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
department uh has said that they would
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
need seven additional workers plus
 
00:36:56.349 --> 00:36:56.359 align:start position:0%
additional space to put these people in
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
and I I just I'm not comfortable with
 
00:37:01.309 --> 00:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
that under the current budget um
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
circumstances so Rec recognizing the
 
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
importance of the bill and the work
 
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:07.960 align:start position:0%
that's already been done I would like to
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
commit the committee to uh look at it
 
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
more detail and maybe uh come with
 
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
something that we can all agree to um in
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
the near future represent labry I would
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
just dovetail with what you said
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
regarding uh The Hires in the new
 
00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:23.560 align:start position:0%
building as written this is a
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar bill with the
 
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
request here uh is the first issue with
 
00:37:30.109 --> 00:37:30.119 align:start position:0%
the hiring frees and budget cuts again
 
00:37:32.109 --> 00:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
uh the second thing is my thought would
 
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
be if there is a union option for
 
00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:37.160 align:start position:0%
additional safety as we we hear all the
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
unions say that the safety is
 
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
unparalleled within the unions I would
 
00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
request that maybe that's view looked at
 
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
too within this the research that we can
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
if we do decide to continue with this
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
but it's awfully expensive and it's
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
definitely going to continue to be a big
 
00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
project I think thank you any other
 
00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
comments representive Flanigan thank you
 
00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:00.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I also support the motion
 
00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
to retain however I think what we need
 
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
to probably do is look at a phased in
 
00:38:10.589 --> 00:38:10.599 align:start position:0%
approach in that maybe establish a
 
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
fund that
 
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
says taking B taking by getting a
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
quarter of a loaf instead of the whole
 
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
loaf if I can use that that term meaning
 
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
that some areas may be need uh changes
 
00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:25.720 align:start position:0%
immediately some not needing the
 
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
implementation of the OSHA so it might
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
be on on a coordinated basis where we
 
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
say to labor is that we need to look at
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
this but we've got x amount of dollars
 
00:38:39.309 --> 00:38:39.319 align:start position:0%
to spend and go from there that's all I
 
00:38:39.319 --> 00:38:40.390 align:start position:0%
to spend and go from there that's all I
was

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
thinking good point represent Dro thank
 
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
chairman the study that uh was sent over
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
this or the numbers that were sent over
 
00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:51.400 align:start position:0%
this weekend I was actually surprised
 
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
that public sector was um 2 to 4% higher
 
00:38:58.109 --> 00:38:58.119 align:start position:0%
for um injuries my concern concern is
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
actually the Department of Labor put it
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
in the email that that could just be
 
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
because public sector is much better at
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
reporting injuries and I as a private
 
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
sector employer I know plenty of
 
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
employees who just offer to pay for
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
their employee to go to urgent care and
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
get stitches that doesn't get reported
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of times private
 
00:39:20.309 --> 00:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
sector employees don't even report the
 
00:39:22.309 --> 00:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
entry they got if it's not serious
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
enough that doesn't happen in the public
 
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
sector they they're very good at
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
reporting everything and I think that's
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
where the numbers get skewed so without
 
00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:31.240 align:start position:0%
good data I don't see and I'm not sure
 
00:39:33.309 --> 00:39:33.319 align:start position:0%
we'll ever get that data but I don't see
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
how we can force municipalities to spend
 
00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
Millions upgrading their standards and
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
we did hear partial testimony on that
 
00:39:44.109 --> 00:39:44.119 align:start position:0%
that depends on the M municipality and
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
what they have for safety gear now but
 
00:39:49.309 --> 00:39:49.319 align:start position:0%
the expenses might be extraordinary and
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
we all campaigned we all heard our taxes
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
are crazy so I'm not sure how we can
 
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
stick our constituents with that type of
 
00:39:58.910 --> 00:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
expense fair enough good
 
00:40:01.309 --> 00:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
all right um Mr clerk do you want to
 
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:02.680 align:start position:0%

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
735 on HB
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
735 uh through discussions with the
 
00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh we believe that there is an
 
00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
amendment that could come to place that
 
00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
would be an improvement over this bill
 
00:41:39.309 --> 00:41:39.319 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to postpone the executive
 
00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
session until next week so I close the
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
executive session on HB
 
00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:49.720 align:start position:0%

Hall and Schultz weighed in on this

there were five changes that we made um
 
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you guys have a copy of
 
00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
this did we have a copy for everybody
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
I'll just read it if I if You' like this
 
00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
just a copy of the amendment um so
 
00:43:18.589 --> 00:43:18.599 align:start position:0%
basically what we did was we added this
 
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
to try to close it off a little bit and
 
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
made it one year in one day so regarding
 
00:43:24.309 --> 00:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
the amount of time that a spouse could
 
00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
be not at the place of uh where they'
 
00:43:28.549 --> 00:43:28.559 align:start position:0%
work it was it was up to one year and
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
one day so it wasn't
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
open-ended uh the second item here was
 
00:43:34.549 --> 00:43:34.559 align:start position:0%
we defined what court meant uh local
 
00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:35.960 align:start position:0%
court or
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
magistrate and the third item we had
 
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
here was employer shall provide
 
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
employees with written acknowledgement
 
00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
deployment the fourth item we had is
 
00:43:49.549 --> 00:43:49.559 align:start position:0%
that the employer this was just a typo I
 
00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
think the employer may choose not to
 
00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:53.720 align:start position:0%
re-employ the employee if the employer
 
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
establishes that circumstances have so
 
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
changed this would be in the case of if
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
the uh if the business was sold or
 
00:44:02.549 --> 00:44:02.559 align:start position:0%
whatnot and then five uh if a violation
 
00:44:04.589 --> 00:44:04.599 align:start position:0%
is found the employer shall be liable
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
for reinstatement and back pay uh of any
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
benefits lost due to a violation Mr
 
00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
chairman sir point of order I think I
 
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
think it is
 
00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
um I I believe it's required that we
 
00:44:19.349 --> 00:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
have a written copy of an amendment
 
00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
before we vote on it so um okay I I
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
agree with that um Davis can you go get
 
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
just burn 20 copies of this and we'll
 
00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%

Amendment
20257

00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
20257
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
hotel and representative labry could you
 
00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:51.880 align:start position:0%
go through your changes as everyone has
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
a chance to look at what the committee's
 
00:53:56.789 --> 00:53:56.799 align:start position:0%
done and I just wanted to
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
thank the subcommittee uh for the work
 
00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:02.680 align:start position:0%
that they did on listening to testimony
 
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
and making uh adjustments as as
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate so over to you sir sure uh
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
okay so the the First Amendment here and
 
00:54:14.109 --> 00:54:14.119 align:start position:0%
everything's underlined and numbered um
 
00:54:17.789 --> 00:54:17.799 align:start position:0%
basically the the um original Bill kind
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
of left this openend open-ended so we
 
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
just tucked in to to close it off so it
 
00:54:24.789 --> 00:54:24.799 align:start position:0%
wasn't like forever one year and a day
 
00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
so that was the first First Amendment
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
here the second one is uh we need to
 
00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:32.680 align:start position:0%
identify what the word Court meant and
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh Court of course means a local court
 
00:54:34.079 --> 00:54:35.309 align:start position:0%
uh Court of course means a local court
or

00:54:35.309 --> 00:54:35.319 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:54:39.069 --> 00:54:39.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
one this was just an acknowledgement
 
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
that employers would provide employees
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
with written acknowledgement of notice
 
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
of their
 
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
deployment um so that there wouldn't be
 
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.549 align:start position:0%
deployment um so that there wouldn't be
any

00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
confusion number four second page
 
00:54:59.630 --> 00:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
I believe the word not was left out here
 
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
and the employer may choose not to
 
00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
re-employ the employee if the employee
 
00:55:04.829 --> 00:55:04.839 align:start position:0%
establishes some circumstances have
 
00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:07.480 align:start position:0%
changed change meaning you know possibly
 
00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:09.160 align:start position:0%
the business was sold or
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
whatnot and then number five of course
 
00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:13.559 align:start position:0%
was if there was a violation found the
 
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
employer would be liable for
 
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
reinstatement back pay and any benefits
 
00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
lost to the violation so we feel that
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
these five changes tightened up the
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
bill okay are there any questions to the
 
00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment representative McKenzie uh
 
00:55:32.549 --> 00:55:32.559 align:start position:0%
under Section uh five I guess it's 5B so
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
if a violation is
 
00:55:39.789 --> 00:55:39.799 align:start position:0%
found um does the U the claimant recover
 
00:55:39.799 --> 00:55:41.829 align:start position:0%
found um does the U the claimant recover
legal

00:55:41.829 --> 00:55:41.839 align:start position:0%
legal
 
00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:44.680 align:start position:0%
costs to have to enforce to have to
 
00:55:47.589 --> 00:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
enforce the law so is it their burden to
 
00:55:50.349 --> 00:55:50.359 align:start position:0%
uh to fund this whole appeal so
 
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie if you look
 
00:55:54.349 --> 00:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
under line nine it says the Department
 
00:55:57.309 --> 00:55:57.319 align:start position:0%
of Labor or local Court may also award
 
00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
the employee reasonable attorney
 
00:56:01.829 --> 00:56:01.839 align:start position:0%
fees so that's in the that's in that
 
00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
section thank
 
00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
you ready thank
 
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
you representative Flanigan thank you Mr
 
00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
chairman um uh item number
 
00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:14.200 align:start position:0%
three employer shall provide the
 
00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
employees with written acknowledgement
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
of the notice of deployment explicitly
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
confirming adherence of this term is
 
00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
that like a a wall posting that the
 
00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
employer has to say that if you are
 
00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
deployed or involved with a deployment
 
00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
will adhere to this
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
law Mr chair please I don't know that's
 
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
a specific wall posting but it's
 
00:56:40.029 --> 00:56:40.039 align:start position:0%
definitely a written acknowledgement to
 
00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
that to the employees to the employees
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
okay okay that's fine that's basically
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
closing the loop to make sure that
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
communication has occurred between the
 
00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:50.680 align:start position:0%
employee notification and the employers
 
00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
coming back saying yeah I got this
 
00:56:54.309 --> 00:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
you're covered the the only reason the
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
only concern I had was that it was
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
almost like saying saying well the
 
00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
employer is going to tell the person
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
that they're being deployed and I'm like
 
00:57:02.109 --> 00:57:02.119 align:start position:0%
no it's EAS the other way around if you
 
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
read it the first way that's right but
 
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
the question in if when we heard
 
00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:07.109 align:start position:0%
the question in if when we heard
testimony

00:57:07.109 --> 00:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
was just confirming that both parties
 
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
knew what was going on it's a notice yep
 
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
y represent
 
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
Salan on your first um change um it says
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
U involuntary mob mobilized for up to
 
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
one year in one day um so if it goes one
 
00:57:30.589 --> 00:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
year and 2
 
00:57:34.589 --> 00:57:34.599 align:start position:0%
days the U Reemployment is not
 
00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily at some point Mr chair if I
 
00:57:39.029 --> 00:57:39.039 align:start position:0%
might please at some point
 
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
representative we had to draw the line
 
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
in the sand someplace for this and close
 
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
the loop so at one year in one day that
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
closes the loop at one year in two days
 
00:57:49.589 --> 00:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
it's no longer
 
00:57:52.349 --> 00:57:52.359 align:start position:0%
effective and I guess I would follow up
 
00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:54.440 align:start position:0%
please I I would just question whether
 
00:57:57.150 --> 00:57:57.160 align:start position:0%
or not um it is
 
00:57:59.950 --> 00:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
extremely uncommon for a deployment to
 
00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:03.880 align:start position:0%
go more than a year and a day
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely 10 years ago a year
 
00:58:08.549 --> 00:58:08.559 align:start position:0%
deployment was sort of the standard and
 
00:58:11.029 --> 00:58:11.039 align:start position:0%
it's a year to the day they I mean
 
00:58:14.109 --> 00:58:14.119 align:start position:0%
you're you're track very closely uh
 
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
currently deployments are six to nine
 
00:58:19.789 --> 00:58:19.799 align:start position:0%
months um and so I I think a year and a
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
day is is completely reasonable based on
 
00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
deployment um
 
00:58:27.789 --> 00:58:27.799 align:start position:0%
schedules every more
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
in lines 26 and
 
00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
27 we just talked about a second ago
 
00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:37.160 align:start position:0%
says that the employers should provide
 
00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:39.160 align:start position:0%
shall provide written acknowledgement of
 
00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:45.069 --> 00:58:45.079 align:start position:0%
deployment that's fine that could be an
 
00:58:47.349 --> 00:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
email for example but then it says
 
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
explicitly confirming adherence to the
 
00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
terms of this
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
section that
 
00:58:56.190 --> 00:58:56.200 align:start position:0%
isn't it's sort of nonsensical I don't
 
00:58:58.670 --> 00:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
know what that means does that email
 
00:59:03.069 --> 00:59:03.079 align:start position:0%
have to say that yes we've received
 
00:59:06.670 --> 00:59:06.680 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement of your deployment and
 
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
we as an employer adhere to
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
RSA 110 colon C1 colon A-1 or whatever
 
00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
it is yeah I mean it's is it I mean
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
those are two different things it could
 
00:59:20.829 --> 00:59:20.839 align:start position:0%
say they can written written
 
00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement acknowledge acknowledge
 
00:59:25.950 --> 00:59:25.960 align:start position:0%
acknowledge re um that they know about
 
00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
the deployment and they shall confirm
 
00:59:31.789 --> 00:59:31.799 align:start position:0%
adherance to the I just don't think I
 
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
don't think it's clearly written like
 
00:59:35.789 --> 00:59:35.799 align:start position:0%
guess the point represent
 
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
labr it could be dumbed down okay and no
 
00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
disrespect basically what it means is
 
00:59:44.029 --> 00:59:44.039 align:start position:0%
when you draft the letter and there is a
 
00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:45.640 align:start position:0%
correspondence there needs to be
 
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
reference made to what we're talking
 
00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:49.880 align:start position:0%
about so it's just not off the cuff and
 
00:59:51.390 --> 00:59:51.400 align:start position:0%
just a a general statement that I'm
 
00:59:53.230 --> 00:59:53.240 align:start position:0%
leaving and I'll be back in a year it
 
00:59:54.829 --> 00:59:54.839 align:start position:0%
needs to be it needs to reference some
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
of which is what been talked about out
 
00:59:59.349 --> 00:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
here in this section five okay if that
 
01:00:02.029 --> 01:00:02.039 align:start position:0%
makes sense it maybe it is UN unclear
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
but we we suppose we could clean it up
 
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
but I think it's clear to most okay
 
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
represent K thank you Mr chair I mean to
 
01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
that point I mean I I think it's pretty
 
01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
straightforward if you say yes I will
 
01:00:14.829 --> 01:00:14.839 align:start position:0%
hold your
 
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
job you doesn't you don't have to quote
 
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
the RSA to make it to make it work and
 
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
okay I like it all right good any other
 
01:00:24.829 --> 01:00:24.839 align:start position:0%
questions representative McKenzie uh the
 
01:00:27.789 --> 01:00:27.799 align:start position:0%
only question I have is on the uh uh the
 
01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:29.720 align:start position:0%
section of the law that you put this in
 
01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:31.640 align:start position:0%
I haven't had a chance to look that up
 
01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:35.720 align:start position:0%
but the Department of Labor has um has a
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
whole section on protections and things
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
like that um but this doesn't I I don't
 
01:00:45.150 --> 01:00:45.160 align:start position:0%
know that they have that they're in that
 
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
110 C area so I I'm just I just wonder
 
01:00:53.829 --> 01:00:53.839 align:start position:0%
if this is should be moved over uh under
 
01:00:56.430 --> 01:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
the uh Department of Labor uh section of
 
01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:57.589 align:start position:0%
the uh Department of Labor uh section of
the

01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:00:59.870 --> 01:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
law I would say it'd be a great question
 
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
if I could sir to the Department of
 
01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
Labor to ask them that's out of my pay
 
01:01:07.309 --> 01:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
scale of my pay scale yeah if I may
 
01:01:09.829 --> 01:01:09.839 align:start position:0%
address his concern when I originally
 
01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
saw this bill I looked up the rsas and
 
01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.789 align:start position:0%
saw this bill I looked up the rsas and
chapter

01:01:14.789 --> 01:01:14.799 align:start position:0%
chapter
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
110- C col one is about employment
 
01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
protection for members of National Guard
 
01:01:23.549 --> 01:01:23.559 align:start position:0%
State militia uh when they're when
 
01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:25.720 align:start position:0%
they're called on duty and this adds
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
that was C colon one this new section is
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
C colon 1-A it's more specific so it it
 
01:01:36.069 --> 01:01:36.079 align:start position:0%
does follow nicely with the existing RSA
 
01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
opinion would it be possible to listen
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
to the uh get some opinion from the
 
01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:47.839 align:start position:0%
do miss Albert do you have uh can you
 
01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
give us some Enlightenment
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
good morning uh John garrian general
 
01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
counsel with the Department of Labor
 
01:02:02.109 --> 01:02:02.119 align:start position:0%
with me is Deputy Commissioner Danielle
 
01:02:05.470 --> 01:02:05.480 align:start position:0%
Albert um representative wardens is
 
01:02:08.789 --> 01:02:08.799 align:start position:0%
correct that that uh the existing 110c
 
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
covers employment protections for
 
01:02:12.589 --> 01:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
members of the National Guard and state
 
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
militia um the Department of Labor's
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
Authority regarding that section of law
 
01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
is located in 11e which uh is true it's
 
01:02:23.069 --> 01:02:23.079 align:start position:0%
not our typical uh neighborhood of laws
 
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
um but that does that is where that
 
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:27.039 align:start position:0%
exists now this would amend that portion
 
01:02:31.870 --> 01:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
of the law okay and alalani thank you Mr
 
01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
chairman uh for further clarification
 
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
under section four line three um it does
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
reference a um Federal section um I I
 
01:02:45.789 --> 01:02:45.799 align:start position:0%
know that you know we're subject to uh
 
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
state laws um would that be something if
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
this does go forward that the department
 
01:02:53.950 --> 01:02:53.960 align:start position:0%
could clean up in the Senate to Define
 
01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
that make the definition a state
 
01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:04.349 --> 01:03:04.359 align:start position:0%
definition we would certainly support
 
01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:07.160 align:start position:0%
such a technical clarification on that
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
um we had email correspondence to that
 
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
effect um there are I mean from a
 
01:03:13.829 --> 01:03:13.839 align:start position:0%
technical point of view there are there
 
01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
are different ways to do that um as the
 
01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
department uh provided to represent
 
01:03:23.230 --> 01:03:23.240 align:start position:0%
representative avalani um the state law
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
can reference a federal standard we
 
01:03:27.029 --> 01:03:27.039 align:start position:0%
would ly do our best to ascribe to the
 
01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
federal standard um it makes it kind of
 
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
difficult to read um and then also
 
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
there's no you know when the federal
 
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
standard changes that changes the
 
01:03:38.589 --> 01:03:38.599 align:start position:0%
standards even though there's no input
 
01:03:41.549 --> 01:03:41.559 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire legislature um on
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
that so um we would I think be
 
01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:46.599 align:start position:0%
supportive of anything that makes the
 
01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
law clear kind of whichever way the law
 
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
goes um so but whether or not the Senate
 
01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
can take that up is not a thing we'll
 
01:03:54.670 --> 01:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
overall take a position on that we're
 
01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
happy to provide technical guidance on
 
01:03:58.910 --> 01:03:58.920 align:start position:0%

name is Mark McKenzie I am the uh
 
01:33:56.350 --> 01:33:56.360 align:start position:0%
representative from District 40 the
 
01:33:58.430 --> 01:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
float out of Manchester I represent five
 
01:34:01.229 --> 01:34:01.239 align:start position:0%
ws in the city of Manchester I'm here
 
01:34:05.709 --> 01:34:05.719 align:start position:0%
today to introduce House Bill 542 FN
 
01:34:08.590 --> 01:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
which is an increase in the unemployment
 
01:34:12.910 --> 01:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
benefits uh and so I want to uh take
 
01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:16.360 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to uh give you a little
 
01:34:18.189 --> 01:34:18.199 align:start position:0%
background uh in terms of the
 
01:34:21.149 --> 01:34:21.159 align:start position:0%
unemployment bill in general uh I was
 
01:34:23.790 --> 01:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
looking at the when we came on board 19
 
01:34:28.270 --> 01:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
1938 we paid $6 uh the first time on
 
01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits the UI system was
 
01:34:33.470 --> 01:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
part of the the old age law which was
 
01:34:35.189 --> 01:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
actually where the Social Security was
 
01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
nested and so that it was part of this
 
01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
process of providing a uh an an
 
01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
underpinnings for the society in general
 
01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
and the UI was an important component of
 
01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
it excuse me so uh over the years uh the
 
01:34:54.990 --> 01:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
system has revolved and and uh and here
 
01:34:57.669 --> 01:34:57.679 align:start position:0%
we are today uh the system and as you
 
01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
will hear from commissioner labors is a
 
01:35:03.070 --> 01:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
uh joint is a partnership between the
 
01:35:07.629 --> 01:35:07.639 align:start position:0%
feds and uh in the State uh essentially
 
01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
the state has jurisdiction over the
 
01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
benefits uh that are that are delivered
 
01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
that was part of the handshake years ago
 
01:35:17.109 --> 01:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
when the law was passed and the FEDS uh
 
01:35:19.310 --> 01:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
keep all the money the repository is
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
down there the guidelines are all
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
provided through the federal uh the
 
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
and all the money is in DC somewhere so
 
01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
let me say that um the preamble to the
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh to the unemployment law if you will
 
01:35:37.149 --> 01:35:37.159 align:start position:0%
read the Preamble it was passed by the
 
01:35:39.550 --> 01:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
legislature actually and what they what
 
01:35:41.709 --> 01:35:41.719 align:start position:0%
it says is the general court declares
 
01:35:43.550 --> 01:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
that the public good and the general
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
welfare of the workers of the state
 
01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
require the enactment of unemployment
 
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
compensation laws providing for the
 
01:35:53.629 --> 01:35:53.639 align:start position:0%
setting aside of unemployment Reserves
 
01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
to be used for the benefit of persons
 
01:35:58.189 --> 01:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
unemployed do no fault of their own and
 
01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
for providing systematic accumulation of
 
01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
funds During the period of unemployment
 
01:36:05.709 --> 01:36:05.719 align:start position:0%
to provide benefits for the for for the
 
01:36:09.790 --> 01:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
people so the purpose is in the Preamble
 
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
and the purpose is actually
 
01:36:16.629 --> 01:36:16.639 align:start position:0%
twofold number one is to stabilize uh a
 
01:36:18.510 --> 01:36:18.520 align:start position:0%
person who through no fault of their own
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
loses their job who needs the support in
 
01:36:24.629 --> 01:36:24.639 align:start position:0%
this transition per period between one
 
01:36:27.109 --> 01:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
job and the next and the second thing
 
01:36:30.270 --> 01:36:30.280 align:start position:0%
this does is to stabilize communities to
 
01:36:33.189 --> 01:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
keep uh workers connected in some ways
 
01:36:34.229 --> 01:36:34.239 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:36:37.990 --> 01:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
employers uh and and this is uh this has
 
01:36:39.990 --> 01:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
been what I've seen over the course of
 
01:36:41.109 --> 01:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
the years
 
01:36:45.709 --> 01:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
now a lot of people uh don't realize how
 
01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
important unemployment insurance can be
 
01:36:51.950 --> 01:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
but I've managed through my former
 
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
professional life I've had a lot to do
 
01:36:58.030 --> 01:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
with layoffs uh big layoffs some were uh
 
01:37:01.590 --> 01:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
as as large as six or seven 8,000 people
 
01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
and that was when the wassaw paper mills
 
01:37:06.030 --> 01:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
all went down and butf for the
 
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
unemployment absolutely nothing they
 
01:37:10.590 --> 01:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
would have been in Berlin New Hampshire
 
01:37:12.870 --> 01:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
and gorum New Hampshire you're not going
 
01:37:16.390 --> 01:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
to put five or 6,000 people back to work
 
01:37:18.830 --> 01:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
the second problem that you run into big
 
01:37:21.229 --> 01:37:21.239 align:start position:0%
layoffs is that you have a Workforce
 
01:37:23.189 --> 01:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
many times that is connected to certain
 
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
skill skill set and the the the problem
 
01:37:28.149 --> 01:37:28.159 align:start position:0%
of trying to do a transition for
 
01:37:29.790 --> 01:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
somebody for instance it was a paper
 
01:37:33.550 --> 01:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
mill worker to a to a job in
 
01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
high-tech uh is very difficult so you
 
01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
hear a lot of times about well you can
 
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
just go out tomorrow and get another job
 
01:37:42.629 --> 01:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
well when you talk to the paperworkers
 
01:37:44.629 --> 01:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
up in the middle when it closed you ask
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
them what you want to do I want to make
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
paper well you can't make paper anymore
 
01:37:51.109 --> 01:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
there's nobody making paper anymore so
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
it was a really difficult uh thing to
 
01:37:57.149 --> 01:37:57.159 align:start position:0%
get them to a place where they
 
01:38:00.149 --> 01:38:00.159 align:start position:0%
understood uh that they had to move on
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
now the the uh federal government along
 
01:38:05.870 --> 01:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
with the unemployment office set up a
 
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
terrific operation up there but it it it
 
01:38:11.550 --> 01:38:11.560 align:start position:0%
was a good example of what happens when
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
workers are in one occupation for a long
 
01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
period of time the company closes and
 
01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:20.440 align:start position:0%
then all of a sudden they they are out
 
01:38:22.669 --> 01:38:22.679 align:start position:0%
and uh many times they didn't know they
 
01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
were going to be out Wasa paper was a
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
good example of it so the unemployment
 
01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:28.679 align:start position:0%
system comes uh when those kinds of
 
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
things happen and they do a number of
 
01:38:33.070 --> 01:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
different things and one of the things
 
01:38:34.910 --> 01:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
they do is to provide unemployment
 
01:38:38.350 --> 01:38:38.360 align:start position:0%
benefits but also to provide this they
 
01:38:41.229 --> 01:38:41.239 align:start position:0%
surround the worker with a system of
 
01:38:43.830 --> 01:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
benefits opportunities to get them back
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
to work and let me say that nobody on
 
01:38:50.629 --> 01:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
the unemployment system is a malingerer
 
01:38:52.750 --> 01:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
you are not sitting at home on the
 
01:38:54.910 --> 01:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
unemployment system system if you apply
 
01:38:56.910 --> 01:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
for unemployment and and the
 
01:39:00.390 --> 01:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner is here you have to show up
 
01:39:02.669 --> 01:39:02.679 align:start position:0%
you have to call employers you have to
 
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that you uh that you're
 
01:39:06.510 --> 01:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
connected and you're working hard so
 
01:39:09.070 --> 01:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
nobody's sitting home which is a which
 
01:39:12.350 --> 01:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
is uh sometimes what what people say
 
01:39:14.470 --> 01:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
about the unemployment system now let me
 
01:39:17.629 --> 01:39:17.639 align:start position:0%
speak to the specifics of the bill the
 
01:39:20.510 --> 01:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
rate has not been raised uh since I
 
01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
believe 2007 was the last time it was
 
01:39:27.149 --> 01:39:27.159 align:start position:0%
done uh in um uh uh representative
 
01:39:28.990 --> 01:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
infantine was actually on that committee
 
01:39:30.750 --> 01:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
back then Russy Bridle I think was the
 
01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
chair of the House labor committee and
 
01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
they raised they raised the rate and
 
01:39:36.709 --> 01:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
they brought it up in 2007 and there it
 
01:39:39.229 --> 01:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
sits so it sits at
 
01:39:42.109 --> 01:39:42.119 align:start position:0%
41,500 is the maximum income that you'll
 
01:39:44.270 --> 01:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
take into consideration the maximum
 
01:39:45.950 --> 01:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
benefit is
 
01:39:49.229 --> 01:39:49.239 align:start position:0%
$427 now for the heck of it I passed out
 
01:39:52.189 --> 01:39:52.199 align:start position:0%
uh something with the mean uh the wages
 
01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
in the different areas so you have a
 
01:39:59.109 --> 01:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
sense of what uh uh $4 $427 will
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
do uh and it doesn't do much and it
 
01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
really has has it's a shame that we've
 
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
got so far behind the curve on this
 
01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:08.589 align:start position:0%
got so far behind the curve on this
particular

01:40:08.589 --> 01:40:08.599 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:40:11.470 --> 01:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
issue the other thing I passed out and
 
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
you at your leisure is to give you a
 
01:40:16.189 --> 01:40:16.199 align:start position:0%
sense uh and it says that the top page
 
01:40:18.669 --> 01:40:18.679 align:start position:0%
the number of continuous weeks of
 
01:40:21.149 --> 01:40:21.159 align:start position:0%
unemployment and it also so that gives
 
01:40:22.830 --> 01:40:22.840 align:start position:0%
you a sense of how many how long people
 
01:40:24.070 --> 01:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
are out
 
01:40:27.109 --> 01:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh on the number of of weeks actually
 
01:40:29.109 --> 01:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
and then I'm sure the commission has
 
01:40:30.510 --> 01:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
some stuff on the number of weeks people
 
01:40:31.950 --> 01:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
are out but generally they're out around
 
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
12 weeks the other thing I gave you was
 
01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
a uh local area unemployment static
 
01:40:41.550 --> 01:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
because you need to understand that this
 
01:40:44.669 --> 01:40:44.679 align:start position:0%
unemployment system Services people in
 
01:40:47.070 --> 01:40:47.080 align:start position:0%
your district and this gives you a sense
 
01:40:48.910 --> 01:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
of that so it's not just the southern
 
01:40:51.070 --> 01:40:51.080 align:start position:0%
part of the state it's people all over
 
01:40:53.550 --> 01:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
the state that are being affected by
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
this so when you put
 
01:40:59.189 --> 01:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
427 which is the top benefit and you put
 
01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
it against the average wage you get a
 
01:41:03.950 --> 01:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
sense of how
 
01:41:06.830 --> 01:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
inadequate this system really is not so
 
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
much for the bottom end of the scale but
 
01:41:11.390 --> 01:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
clearly for the top end of the scale
 
01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
because what happens with the benefit is
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
you hit 415 and you're done that's the
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
maximum benefit anything you make above
 
01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
that you're not being compensating more
 
01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:21.990 align:start position:0%
that you're not being compensating more
than

01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
4415 so the the ratio replacement ratio
 
01:41:30.430 --> 01:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
deteriorates greatly at the 415 level so
 
01:41:31.709 --> 01:41:31.719 align:start position:0%
the people at the bottom end of the
 
01:41:34.149 --> 01:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
scale are getting about 54% replacement
 
01:41:37.229 --> 01:41:37.239 align:start position:0%
rate and it just goes down from there so
 
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
there are there are people in the higher
 
01:41:42.030 --> 01:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
end of scale are in the 20% 25% rate
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
replacement wage and you'll hear some of
 
01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
that what this bill does is to uh the
 
01:41:49.390 --> 01:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
original Bill and there's an amendment
 
01:41:51.390 --> 01:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
in process which I'll I'll have in my
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
hand by noon time I think
 
01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh it raises the the top of the scale
 
01:41:58.750 --> 01:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
brings it up so the the amendment will
 
01:42:01.589 --> 01:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
bring it up six steps the original uh
 
01:42:03.550 --> 01:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
Bill uh the bill that you see in front
 
01:42:06.589 --> 01:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
of you brings it up 12 steps uh I talked
 
01:42:08.310 --> 01:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner we had a good
 
01:42:10.350 --> 01:42:10.360 align:start position:0%
conversation the other day and there's a
 
01:42:12.109 --> 01:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
good reason why we want to stay within
 
01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
that within that six steps but let me
 
01:42:17.350 --> 01:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
say this that the only way you you're
 
01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
going to be able to get beyond the six
 
01:42:21.709 --> 01:42:21.719 align:start position:0%
steps uh is the way they got Beyond it
 
01:42:24.030 --> 01:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
when they passed the the increase in
 
01:42:26.510 --> 01:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
2007 which is you need to start looking
 
01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
at how much is actually coming into the
 
01:42:31.550 --> 01:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
system so there are two there is there's
 
01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
a going out and there's a coming in and
 
01:42:37.189 --> 01:42:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh the trouble with raising the rates is
 
01:42:39.310 --> 01:42:39.320 align:start position:0%
that you bump up against this uh the
 
01:42:41.790 --> 01:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
ceiling and you really not need to stop
 
01:42:44.870 --> 01:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
thinking about the taxable uh base rate
 
01:42:48.189 --> 01:42:48.199 align:start position:0%
because it's at 14,000 right now uh and
 
01:42:49.950 --> 01:42:49.960 align:start position:0%
you need to start to think about
 
01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
increasing that uh and you'll hear more
 
01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
about this but inre in that to really be
 
01:42:57.550 --> 01:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
able to provide additional benefits so I
 
01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
think we need to be in the range of my
 
01:43:02.149 --> 01:43:02.159 align:start position:0%
bill went up to
 
01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
65,000 but we need to at least be in the
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
range of 55 or 58,000 because that's
 
01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
basically where uh the average
 
01:43:13.709 --> 01:43:13.719 align:start position:0%
wages uh but we're not going to get
 
01:43:16.109 --> 01:43:16.119 align:start position:0%
there unless we raise the rate so what I
 
01:43:18.350 --> 01:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
did was I uh the amendment will show you
 
01:43:21.149 --> 01:43:21.159 align:start position:0%
this I I brought it back the commission
 
01:43:22.709 --> 01:43:22.719 align:start position:0%
will give you some sense of people that
 
01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
are cover
 
01:43:25.870 --> 01:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
how that will affect people on the on
 
01:43:28.430 --> 01:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
the scale his numbers don't relate to
 
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily the unemploy the uh
 
01:43:33.750 --> 01:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
amendments but we did discuss it uh but
 
01:43:35.870 --> 01:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
you'll have a better sense of that and
 
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and I have worked
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
closely on this people have worked with
 
01:43:41.109 --> 01:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
the Department of Employment Security
 
01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
and commissioner labors I know he's very
 
01:43:45.709 --> 01:43:45.719 align:start position:0%
competent so with that I'm going to
 
01:43:49.030 --> 01:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
yield to him and let him uh Dazzle you
 
01:43:51.910 --> 01:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
with all the facts and statistics Mr
 
01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
chairman I happy to answer questions now
 
01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
or at the end of the hearing all right
 
01:43:57.910 --> 01:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
thanks are there any questions right now
 
01:43:59.470 --> 01:43:59.480 align:start position:0%
or do we want to get to the commissioner
 
01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
first represent Sal just want to be
 
01:44:05.550 --> 01:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
clear on this looking at at your the
 
01:44:08.830 --> 01:44:08.840 align:start position:0%
bill as um introduced and um you said
 
01:44:13.109 --> 01:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
that currently the um um it stops at 41
 
01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
um five is that correct yes and uh
 
01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
that's step 30 on here and you said you
 
01:44:21.390 --> 01:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
added six steps in the amended version
 
01:44:24.310 --> 01:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
so that would stop at uh 2,000 correct
 
01:44:26.709 --> 01:44:26.719 align:start position:0%
right okay so the amended version would
 
01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
increase it from 415 to 52,000 yes thank
 
01:44:35.149 --> 01:44:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:37.870 --> 01:44:37.880 align:start position:0%
you represent Flanigan thank you Mr
 
01:44:40.229 --> 01:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
chairman so so you're not shooting for
 
01:44:43.870 --> 01:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
65,000 you're bringing it down okay just
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:55.830 --> 01:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:58.790 --> 01:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
you and representative or uh Mr John
 
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
Amherst uh thank you chair kraton and
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
members of committee John Reynolds the
 
01:45:10.430 --> 01:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
national Federation of Independent
 
01:45:12.430 --> 01:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
Business of New Hampshire I'm the state
 
01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
director of New Hampshire we represent
 
01:45:16.030 --> 01:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
over 1,700 small employers across the
 
01:45:18.709 --> 01:45:18.719 align:start position:0%
state um we did just I think
 
01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie touched on it
 
01:45:23.149 --> 01:45:23.159 align:start position:0%
the toward the end of his remarks uh we
 
01:45:24.750 --> 01:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
have concerns about this bill's impact
 
01:45:26.589 --> 01:45:26.599 align:start position:0%
on unemployment insurance tax rates for
 
01:45:28.950 --> 01:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
small employers well for all employers
 
01:45:30.709 --> 01:45:30.719 align:start position:0%
uh because at least certainly as was
 
01:45:32.270 --> 01:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
originally introduced and we haven't
 
01:45:33.629 --> 01:45:33.639 align:start position:0%
seen the amendment language but as
 
01:45:35.350 --> 01:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
originally introduced right it would
 
01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
require significantly higher
 
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance uh trust fund
 
01:45:40.950 --> 01:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
Reserve uh which of course has to be
 
01:45:43.229 --> 01:45:43.239 align:start position:0%
filled somehow and then in times of
 
01:45:45.510 --> 01:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
economic crisis or distress the draw
 
01:45:47.070 --> 01:45:47.080 align:start position:0%
down will be greater so this is going to
 
01:45:48.790 --> 01:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
end up having an impact one way or the
 
01:45:51.950 --> 01:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
other eventually on UI tax rates so with
 
01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
that thank you the opportunity to
 
01:45:56.629 --> 01:45:56.639 align:start position:0%
comment represent Flanigan thank you Mr
 
01:45:59.229 --> 01:45:59.239 align:start position:0%
chairman as a former business
 
01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
owner I didn't view unemployment tax as
 
01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:03.790 align:start position:0%
owner I didn't view unemployment tax as
a

01:46:03.790 --> 01:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
Herculean obstacle in finance other
 
01:46:09.550 --> 01:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
words it's it's it's based on like
 
01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
$1,400 and the assistant commissioner
 
01:46:14.669 --> 01:46:14.679 align:start position:0%
can fill us in
 
01:46:20.030 --> 01:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
but that's only increases if the rate of
 
01:46:22.990 --> 01:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
the unemployment tax goes up because I
 
01:46:25.149 --> 01:46:25.159 align:start position:0%
we're below a level that we're required
 
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
to have isn't that correct yeah Mr chair
 
01:46:30.990 --> 01:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
representative FL again it does float
 
01:46:32.830 --> 01:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
based on the fund fund balance and there
 
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
are various factors that go into that
 
01:46:36.990 --> 01:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
including your experience rating as an
 
01:46:38.350 --> 01:46:38.360 align:start position:0%
employer right so if you're in a higher
 
01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:39.830 align:start position:0%
employer right so if you're in a higher
turnover

01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
turnover
 
01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
industry this means a lot more to you uh
 
01:46:44.189 --> 01:46:44.199 align:start position:0%
perhaps than if you're in a lower
 
01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
turnover industry okay and the number of
 
01:46:51.070 --> 01:46:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:00.270 --> 01:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:03.510 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:47:03.510 --> 01:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:54.589 --> 01:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:56.709 --> 01:47:56.719 align:start position:0%
and Mr LS please uh introduce yourself
 
01:47:58.470 --> 01:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
and who you represent and we looking
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
testimony good morning thank you Mr
 
01:48:06.109 --> 01:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee
 
01:48:07.870 --> 01:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
Richard lers Deputy Commissioner with
 
01:48:08.990 --> 01:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
Employment Security um so in order to
 
01:48:14.629 --> 01:48:14.639 align:start position:0%
fulfill representative McKenzie's high
 
01:48:16.430 --> 01:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
expectations for dazzling you I did
 
01:48:18.270 --> 01:48:18.280 align:start position:0%
bring stuff that has color on it that
 
01:48:20.229 --> 01:48:20.239 align:start position:0%
might be the only thing dazzling that I
 
01:48:24.589 --> 01:48:24.599 align:start position:0%
have um but I I did want to just um
 
01:48:26.910 --> 01:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
quickly walk through some information
 
01:48:29.109 --> 01:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
some important data points I think most
 
01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
of which are familiar to the members um
 
01:48:33.229 --> 01:48:33.239 align:start position:0%
that have heard prior conversations
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
around bills seeking to increase the
 
01:48:38.030 --> 01:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
benefit amount and then um walk you
 
01:48:39.669 --> 01:48:39.679 align:start position:0%
through some analysis that the
 
01:48:42.629 --> 01:48:42.639 align:start position:0%
department did all of this is on the
 
01:48:46.350 --> 01:48:46.360 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced none of this is on an
 
01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
amended version which scales down the
 
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
benefits um obviously once that
 
01:48:53.149 --> 01:48:53.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment comes through the department
 
01:48:57.149 --> 01:48:57.159 align:start position:0%
will do an an analysis of that as well
 
01:48:58.669 --> 01:48:58.679 align:start position:0%
um And to clarify the department takes
 
01:49:01.870 --> 01:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
no position on the bill um we're here to
 
01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
provide information answer questions so
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll get started I'll try to
 
01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
quickly go through this um and I'll stop
 
01:49:10.669 --> 01:49:10.679 align:start position:0%
at any point that individuals have
 
01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
questions um so as representative
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
McKenzie had indicated current maximum
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
weekly benefit amount in New Hampshire
 
01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:17.430 align:start position:0%
weekly benefit amount in New Hampshire
is

01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
$427 that's been the maximum available
 
01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:21.589 align:start position:0%
$427 that's been the maximum available
since

01:49:21.589 --> 01:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
since
 
01:49:24.430 --> 01:49:24.440 align:start position:0%
2007 um um whether you get that amount
 
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
is determined based upon how much you
 
01:49:29.310 --> 01:49:29.320 align:start position:0%
earned in the four quarters prior to
 
01:49:31.830 --> 01:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
filing for unemployment um and obviously
 
01:49:34.109 --> 01:49:34.119 align:start position:0%
being unemployed through no fault of
 
01:49:37.629 --> 01:49:37.639 align:start position:0%
your own uh there are 52 benefit tiers
 
01:49:41.589 --> 01:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
uh they go from as low as $32 a week for
 
01:49:43.030 --> 01:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
someone that had earned
 
01:49:46.470 --> 01:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
$2,800 in their four quarter base period
 
01:49:47.390 --> 01:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:49:49.990 --> 01:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
427 uh for which someone has to earn at
 
01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:51.229 align:start position:0%
427 uh for which someone has to earn at
least

01:49:51.229 --> 01:49:51.239 align:start position:0%
least
 
01:49:54.430 --> 01:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
41,500 in that four quarter base period
 
01:49:56.229 --> 01:49:56.239 align:start position:0%
lower tiers currently provide about a
 
01:49:58.669 --> 01:49:58.679 align:start position:0%
60% wage replacement those upper tiers
 
01:50:00.229 --> 01:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
are 53
 
01:50:03.390 --> 01:50:03.400 align:start position:0%
54% wage replacement and benefits have
 
01:50:06.350 --> 01:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
not been touched since 2006 which was
 
01:50:09.229 --> 01:50:09.239 align:start position:0%
effective in 2007 and five additional
 
01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
tiers were added at that point in time
 
01:50:14.910 --> 01:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
uh what the original version of the bill
 
01:50:17.310 --> 01:50:17.320 align:start position:0%
looks to do is to leave the existing
 
01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
rates alone it does not touch the
 
01:50:22.709 --> 01:50:22.719 align:start position:0%
existing tiers but it looks to add 12
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
additional tiers so starting above uh
 
01:50:28.310 --> 01:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
415 which is that current Max earnings
 
01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
that get taken into consideration and it
 
01:50:35.310 --> 01:50:35.320 align:start position:0%
would start at 425 um with a benefit of
 
01:50:37.589 --> 01:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
437 um and then it would go all the way
 
01:50:42.950 --> 01:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
up to 65,000 and provide a benefit of
 
01:50:46.709 --> 01:50:46.719 align:start position:0%
$669 um these proposed new rates
 
01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
maintain the existing wage replacement
 
01:50:52.669 --> 01:50:52.679 align:start position:0%
rates that are in the current statute so
 
01:50:56.189 --> 01:50:56.199 align:start position:0%
53 54% wage replacement for someone that
 
01:50:58.589 --> 01:50:58.599 align:start position:0%
is right at those earning
 
01:51:02.470 --> 01:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
amounts uh when we move along uh to the
 
01:51:05.189 --> 01:51:05.199 align:start position:0%
uh next slide I talk a little bit about
 
01:51:07.790 --> 01:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
what the department has done to gauge
 
01:51:11.669 --> 01:51:11.679 align:start position:0%
the impact of the proposed bill um so we
 
01:51:14.350 --> 01:51:14.360 align:start position:0%
took the entire claim filing population
 
01:51:16.709 --> 01:51:16.719 align:start position:0%
from both 2023 and
 
01:51:20.910 --> 01:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
2024 to get a good flavor of uh regular
 
01:51:23.430 --> 01:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
expected filing activity and what the
 
01:51:27.350 --> 01:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
impact would be um we then took those
 
01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
individuals that received the 427
 
01:51:32.510 --> 01:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
currently and then parked them into the
 
01:51:34.709 --> 01:51:34.719 align:start position:0%
new schedule uh that the representative
 
01:51:37.390 --> 01:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
has filed um if you were someone that
 
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
was at 415 but not at 425 you stayed at
 
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
427 if you were at at least 425 you
 
01:51:49.149 --> 01:51:49.159 align:start position:0%
would go into that new rate of 437 and
 
01:51:51.910 --> 01:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
if you had at least 65 you would go into
 
01:51:54.589 --> 01:51:54.599 align:start position:0%
that new weekly benefit amount of
 
01:51:58.470 --> 01:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
669 so when we did that and then we uh
 
01:52:02.830 --> 01:52:02.840 align:start position:0%
ran 2023 and 2024 as if the bill had
 
01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
been in effect the impact on 2023 when
 
01:52:09.270 --> 01:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
claim volume was lower um was about an
 
01:52:12.069 --> 01:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
increase of $10 million in total
 
01:52:16.350 --> 01:52:16.360 align:start position:0%
benefits being paid out so um current um
 
01:52:18.310 --> 01:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
benefit schedule paid out a little over
 
01:52:21.950 --> 01:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
35 million the proposed benefit schedule
 
01:52:25.149 --> 01:52:25.159 align:start position:0%
would have paid out 45 million uh which
 
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
was about a 28% increase in total
 
01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
benefits being paid when we did the same
 
01:52:33.910 --> 01:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
to the 2024 population which there was
 
01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
an increase in the number of people
 
01:52:38.629 --> 01:52:38.639 align:start position:0%
filing in 2024 compared to the historic
 
01:52:40.589 --> 01:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
low levels experience in
 
01:52:43.870 --> 01:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
2023 um that was an increase of
 
01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
31% um or a total of
 
01:52:49.990 --> 01:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
14.6 million benefit payments going from
 
01:52:56.510 --> 01:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:59.310 --> 01:52:59.320 align:start position:0%
million the wage replacement rate when I
 
01:53:01.709 --> 01:53:01.719 align:start position:0%
move to the the next slide and then in
 
01:53:04.910 --> 01:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
some quick uh some data points the the
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
current wage replacement rate and what
 
01:53:10.510 --> 01:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
we mean by that is the amount of the
 
01:53:12.470 --> 01:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
earnings that you had while you were
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
employ in in employment how much of that
 
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
is replaced by your unemployment benefit
 
01:53:21.589 --> 01:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
if you qualify for it if you're right at
 
01:53:24.709 --> 01:53:24.719 align:start position:0%
that uh 415 right now like I said your
 
01:53:27.870 --> 01:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
wage replacement rate is 53 54% so
 
01:53:29.830 --> 01:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
you're getting about half that what you
 
01:53:32.030 --> 01:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
were earning while you were working a
 
01:53:33.950 --> 01:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
lot of incentive to get right back to
 
01:53:36.270 --> 01:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
work but that's only if you're right at
 
01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
that earnings earning level um what I
 
01:53:42.109 --> 01:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
did was provide the the members with
 
01:53:43.990 --> 01:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
some information on what the current
 
01:53:45.709 --> 01:53:45.719 align:start position:0%
experience is for people that are
 
01:53:48.790 --> 01:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
actually qualifying for that 427 right
 
01:53:51.750 --> 01:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
now so you can get a sense of what their
 
01:53:54.430 --> 01:53:54.440 align:start position:0%
real life wage replacement rate has been
 
01:53:56.910 --> 01:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
so what your constituents are receiving
 
01:54:01.149 --> 01:54:01.159 align:start position:0%
uh from unemployment in 2023 the average
 
01:54:03.229 --> 01:54:03.239 align:start position:0%
base period earnings for people getting
 
01:54:06.430 --> 01:54:06.440 align:start position:0%
that 427 was just over
 
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
$86,000 a year that's a wage replacement
 
01:54:11.550 --> 01:54:11.560 align:start position:0%
rate of
 
01:54:15.589 --> 01:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
26% in 2024 that average base period
 
01:54:19.709 --> 01:54:19.719 align:start position:0%
earnings was about 88,000 885,000 so a
 
01:54:22.669 --> 01:54:22.679 align:start position:0%
wage replacement rate of 25% so getting
 
01:54:25.030 --> 01:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
about a quarter of what they had
 
01:54:29.350 --> 01:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
employment looking at the impact of the
 
01:54:34.189 --> 01:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
bill and the number of people that it
 
01:54:36.189 --> 01:54:36.199 align:start position:0%
would have impacted when we we turn to
 
01:54:40.109 --> 01:54:40.119 align:start position:0%
the next uh page in 2023 the bill would
 
01:54:42.830 --> 01:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
have increased benefits for a little bit
 
01:54:45.830 --> 01:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
over half the benefit filing population
 
01:54:49.990 --> 01:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
or about 6,300 individuals in
 
01:54:52.950 --> 01:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
2024 uh that would have increased
 
01:54:55.830 --> 01:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh the benefits received by about
 
01:54:59.229 --> 01:54:59.239 align:start position:0%
63% of the claim filing population or
 
01:55:02.109 --> 01:55:02.119 align:start position:0%
about 8,200 individuals so those are the
 
01:55:03.950 --> 01:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
individuals that would have been parked
 
01:55:06.709 --> 01:55:06.719 align:start position:0%
in one of those new benefit tiers um but
 
01:55:09.550 --> 01:55:09.560 align:start position:0%
had received 427 when they
 
01:55:12.229 --> 01:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
filed um before getting into the
 
01:55:14.830 --> 01:55:14.840 align:start position:0%
analysis on some of the the stress
 
01:55:17.229 --> 01:55:17.239 align:start position:0%
testing that the economist in our labor
 
01:55:19.390 --> 01:55:19.400 align:start position:0%
market information Bureau conducted I
 
01:55:21.550 --> 01:55:21.560 align:start position:0%
just wanted to go over some data points
 
01:55:23.390 --> 01:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
that are relevant I'll quickly go over
 
01:55:25.750 --> 01:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
these These are good data points to have
 
01:55:27.550 --> 01:55:27.560 align:start position:0%
uh for all of the conversations we have
 
01:55:31.510 --> 01:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
around uh labor force issues um first
 
01:55:34.430 --> 01:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
slide looks at a comparison of what the
 
01:55:37.109 --> 01:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
change in private sector wages has done
 
01:55:38.709 --> 01:55:38.719 align:start position:0%
since the last time benefits were
 
01:55:40.790 --> 01:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
increased so you can see on the left
 
01:55:43.030 --> 01:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
hand slide for the uh left hand of the
 
01:55:45.510 --> 01:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
slide for the first one that has a chart
 
01:55:47.870 --> 01:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
um that the average private sector
 
01:55:50.229 --> 01:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
weekly wage in 2007 when benefits were
 
01:55:53.149 --> 01:55:53.159 align:start position:0%
increased was $852
 
01:55:56.030 --> 01:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
we fast forward to the most current um
 
01:55:57.910 --> 01:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
records that we have are the second
 
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
quarter of 2024 that average weekly wage
 
01:56:04.069 --> 01:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
private sector
 
01:56:06.790 --> 01:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
1,453 when we turn the slide we can see
 
01:56:09.830 --> 01:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
what that wage replacement rate is um in
 
01:56:12.030 --> 01:56:12.040 align:start position:0%
2007 that wage replacement rate for the
 
01:56:14.709 --> 01:56:14.719 align:start position:0%
average private sector worker was
 
01:56:18.589 --> 01:56:18.599 align:start position:0%
50% in 20124 that wage replacement rate
 
01:56:21.550 --> 01:56:21.560 align:start position:0%
is 29% for that average private sector
 
01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:22.790 align:start position:0%
is 29% for that average private sector
worker

01:56:22.790 --> 01:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
worker
 
01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh next slide I look at the change in
 
01:56:27.669 --> 01:56:27.679 align:start position:0%
inflation since benefits were increased
 
01:56:29.790 --> 01:56:29.800 align:start position:0%
Ben uh inflation has increased for New
 
01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire about
 
01:56:35.390 --> 01:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
42% um since the last time benefits were
 
01:56:37.629 --> 01:56:37.639 align:start position:0%
increased a significant amount of that
 
01:56:39.910 --> 01:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
is inflation that has increased over the
 
01:56:42.629 --> 01:56:42.639 align:start position:0%
last 3 years coming out of the pandemic
 
01:56:44.669 --> 01:56:44.679 align:start position:0%
uh when that's close to 20% of that
 
01:56:46.870 --> 01:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
increase has been
 
01:56:50.589 --> 01:56:50.599 align:start position:0%
experienced um return the slide I look
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
at how New Hampshire compared to other
 
01:56:56.350 --> 01:56:56.360 align:start position:0%
states and how much we currently pay um
 
01:56:58.310 --> 01:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
the first slide has all of the states
 
01:57:00.030 --> 01:57:00.040 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit busy I did break it
 
01:57:02.109 --> 01:57:02.119 align:start position:0%
down to just looking at states in the
 
01:57:04.390 --> 01:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
Northeast um but nationally New
 
01:57:07.550 --> 01:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire currently has the 19th lowest
 
01:57:10.669 --> 01:57:10.679 align:start position:0%
average weekly benefit amount at uh we
 
01:57:12.589 --> 01:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
are at uh
 
01:57:14.990 --> 01:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
367 um you can see where the other
 
01:57:17.629 --> 01:57:17.639 align:start position:0%
states fall and including Massachusetts
 
01:57:20.430 --> 01:57:20.440 align:start position:0%
averaging over $700 a week which is
 
01:57:22.870 --> 01:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
second highest in the country when we
 
01:57:24.830 --> 01:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
look at the next slide at just those
 
01:57:26.990 --> 01:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
states in the Northeast you can see that
 
01:57:29.510 --> 01:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has the lowest average
 
01:57:32.390 --> 01:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
weekly benefit amount um in New England
 
01:57:34.950 --> 01:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
at 367 you can see where the other
 
01:57:38.030 --> 01:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
states uh fall in in in comparison to
 
01:57:40.750 --> 01:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire when we move uh to the
 
01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
next slide you can see that uh New
 
01:57:46.149 --> 01:57:46.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has the lowest maximum weekly
 
01:57:48.950 --> 01:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
benefit amount that 427 that is the
 
01:57:51.189 --> 01:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
lowest maximum weekly benefit amount in
 
01:57:52.990 --> 01:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
the Northeast you can see how the other
 
01:57:56.109 --> 01:57:56.119 align:start position:0%
states Stack Up um the only correction
 
01:57:57.950 --> 01:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
to that slide is that the Massachusetts
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
amount is actually higher than that it's
 
01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
actually over $1,500 now uh might be why
 
01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
um I was reading an article in the globe
 
01:58:08.149 --> 01:58:08.159 align:start position:0%
yesterday on the fact that without any
 
01:58:09.790 --> 01:58:09.800 align:start position:0%
changes in the economy their trust fund
 
01:58:12.310 --> 01:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
is forecast to be depleted in
 
01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
2027 um and they owe the feds $2 billion
 
01:58:17.589 --> 01:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
might be part of that reason when you
 
01:58:20.069 --> 01:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
look at their their amount that they're
 
01:58:23.430 --> 01:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
paying out um and then the next slide
 
01:58:25.629 --> 01:58:25.639 align:start position:0%
looks at if the bill were passed with
 
01:58:28.510 --> 01:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
the 12 new tiers that would put New
 
01:58:32.229 --> 01:58:32.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at the 16th highest maximum
 
01:58:35.870 --> 01:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
weekly benefit amount in the country uh
 
01:58:39.430 --> 01:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
we flip to the next page um looking at
 
01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
how that would compare with states in
 
01:58:44.149 --> 01:58:44.159 align:start position:0%
the Northeast um if the bill were passed
 
01:58:45.870 --> 01:58:45.880 align:start position:0%
with the 12 new tiers New Hampshire
 
01:58:48.229 --> 01:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
would still have the third lowest
 
01:58:50.950 --> 01:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
maximum weekly benefit available in the
 
01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
Northeast um just higher than the state
 
01:58:55.229 --> 01:58:55.239 align:start position:0%
of New York but lower than the New
 
01:58:58.229 --> 01:58:58.239 align:start position:0%
England states when we look at duration
 
01:59:00.149 --> 01:59:00.159 align:start position:0%
and exhaustion so how long people
 
01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
currently file for benefits and how many
 
01:59:05.069 --> 01:59:05.079 align:start position:0%
utilize all of their benefits um we're
 
01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
talking about um right now an individual
 
01:59:10.870 --> 01:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire unemployed through no
 
01:59:13.229 --> 01:59:13.239 align:start position:0%
fault of their own they have 26 weeks of
 
01:59:16.390 --> 01:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
benefits available to them on average
 
01:59:19.149 --> 01:59:19.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents file and utilize
 
01:59:22.390 --> 01:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
unemployment for 11.6 weeks you'll see
 
01:59:24.189 --> 01:59:24.199 align:start position:0%
in this next chart that got rounded up
 
01:59:26.430 --> 01:59:26.440 align:start position:0%
to 12 so I could get the numbers to fit
 
01:59:29.790 --> 01:59:29.800 align:start position:0%
within all of our our small states um
 
01:59:32.189 --> 01:59:32.199 align:start position:0%
and then the the next page looks at how
 
01:59:34.270 --> 01:59:34.280 align:start position:0%
that average duration Stacks up with
 
01:59:38.390 --> 01:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
other um uh uh other New England states
 
01:59:41.510 --> 01:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
so our duration right now is 11th lowest
 
01:59:44.669 --> 01:59:44.679 align:start position:0%
in the country um and it is the lowest
 
01:59:47.589 --> 01:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
in the Northeast Vermont being closest
 
01:59:50.750 --> 01:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
Vermont is just a a little bit over 12
 
01:59:52.709 --> 01:59:52.719 align:start position:0%
weeks average duration
 
01:59:54.229 --> 01:59:54.239 align:start position:0%
and we're at that
 
01:59:56.990 --> 01:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
11.6 when we look at exhaustion so the
 
01:59:59.709 --> 01:59:59.719 align:start position:0%
number of individuals who utilize all 26
 
02:00:01.790 --> 02:00:01.800 align:start position:0%
weeks of their unemployment that
 
02:00:04.510 --> 02:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
exhaustion rate for New Hampshire is
 
02:00:07.790 --> 02:00:07.800 align:start position:0%
15% that's the second lowest exhaustion
 
02:00:10.350 --> 02:00:10.360 align:start position:0%
rate in the country uh you don't have to
 
02:00:12.270 --> 02:00:12.280 align:start position:0%
go very far to find the lowest and that
 
02:00:14.310 --> 02:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
is our neighbor to the west uh with
 
02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
Vermont at
 
02:00:19.149 --> 02:00:19.159 align:start position:0%
133% uh the next slide I did the same as
 
02:00:20.589 --> 02:00:20.599 align:start position:0%
what I did for other measures and
 
02:00:22.750 --> 02:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
included just the new are just the
 
02:00:25.629 --> 02:00:25.639 align:start position:0%
northeast states so you can see um how
 
02:00:28.109 --> 02:00:28.119 align:start position:0%
that compares against those that are
 
02:00:30.069 --> 02:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
closest to us and you can see the
 
02:00:31.550 --> 02:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
exhaustion rates for New Hampshire and
 
02:00:34.430 --> 02:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
Vermont are far lower than anyone else
 
02:00:36.229 --> 02:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
in the Northeast and the United States
 
02:00:40.229 --> 02:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
as a whole is is almost 40%
 
02:00:42.550 --> 02:00:42.560 align:start position:0%
exhaustion um when we shift gears and
 
02:00:44.350 --> 02:00:44.360 align:start position:0%
look at the impact on employers because
 
02:00:45.750 --> 02:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
the unemployment program in New
 
02:00:49.069 --> 02:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is 100% funded by employer
 
02:00:52.470 --> 02:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
taxes um New Hampshire has the four
 
02:00:55.390 --> 02:00:55.400 align:start position:0%
lowest unemployment tax burden in the
 
02:00:57.990 --> 02:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
country the way they arrive at that the
 
02:01:00.629 --> 02:01:00.639 align:start position:0%
um US Department of Labor Compares total
 
02:01:03.270 --> 02:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
taxes paid for unemployment systems
 
02:01:07.149 --> 02:01:07.159 align:start position:0%
against total wages paid in each state
 
02:01:09.669 --> 02:01:09.679 align:start position:0%
and they arrive at that Apples to Apples
 
02:01:11.589 --> 02:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
comparison despite a lot of differences
 
02:01:13.629 --> 02:01:13.639 align:start position:0%
in how employers are taxed from state to
 
02:01:16.669 --> 02:01:16.679 align:start position:0%
state so New Hampshire fourth lowest uh
 
02:01:18.709 --> 02:01:18.719 align:start position:0%
tax unemployment tax burden in the
 
02:01:21.310 --> 02:01:21.320 align:start position:0%
country when you flip to the next slide
 
02:01:23.950 --> 02:01:23.960 align:start position:0%
you can see that it is the lowest tax
 
02:01:26.470 --> 02:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
burden for unemployment purposes in the
 
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
Northeast um by far uh there is not
 
02:01:32.990 --> 02:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
another state close uh to New Hampshire
 
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
um when Massachusetts is the closest
 
02:01:37.669 --> 02:01:37.679 align:start position:0%
state to you from a tax perspective um
 
02:01:40.149 --> 02:01:40.159 align:start position:0%
and they're still over three times your
 
02:01:43.149 --> 02:01:43.159 align:start position:0%
rate um that just kind of shows how low
 
02:01:44.950 --> 02:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is right now for its
 
02:01:47.669 --> 02:01:47.679 align:start position:0%
unemployment tax burden um when we look
 
02:01:50.550 --> 02:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
at the next slide you can see actual um
 
02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh experience right now now with
 
02:01:55.350 --> 02:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
employers their average private employer
 
02:01:57.910 --> 02:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
pays at
 
02:02:01.990 --> 02:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
61% uh that equates out to about $85 per
 
02:02:05.350 --> 02:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
year per employee for unemployment
 
02:02:08.470 --> 02:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
taxes um and you can see that that is as
 
02:02:11.470 --> 02:02:11.480 align:start position:0%
low as we were experiencing prior to the
 
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic and as low a rate that New
 
02:02:15.870 --> 02:02:15.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employers have experienced
 
02:02:19.950 --> 02:02:19.960 align:start position:0%
going back uh the past 30 years um
 
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
flipping to the next slide uh drawing to
 
02:02:26.069 --> 02:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
the end of my comments um I get into the
 
02:02:28.109 --> 02:02:28.119 align:start position:0%
stress test scenarios that are
 
02:02:29.550 --> 02:02:29.560 align:start position:0%
economists in our labor market
 
02:02:32.189 --> 02:02:32.199 align:start position:0%
information Bureau conducted so I asked
 
02:02:35.229 --> 02:02:35.239 align:start position:0%
them to do three things one was to apply
 
02:02:36.830 --> 02:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
the benefit schedule against their
 
02:02:39.709 --> 02:02:39.719 align:start position:0%
existing forecast no changes no
 
02:02:42.589 --> 02:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
recession no economic downturn and let's
 
02:02:45.910 --> 02:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
see what happens when you apply this new
 
02:02:47.870 --> 02:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
schedule compared to our current
 
02:02:50.310 --> 02:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
schedule I then asked them to do model
 
02:02:52.149 --> 02:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
it against a mild recession recession
 
02:02:55.149 --> 02:02:55.159 align:start position:0%
like we experienced in the early 2000s
 
02:02:56.550 --> 02:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
Uh current unemployment rate in
 
02:02:59.550 --> 02:02:59.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is 2.6% the mild recession was
 
02:03:01.790 --> 02:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
an unemployment rate of 4 and a half and
 
02:03:03.669 --> 02:03:03.679 align:start position:0%
then we asked them to do a major
 
02:03:06.750 --> 02:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
recession model uh Great Recession type
 
02:03:09.149 --> 02:03:09.159 align:start position:0%
of scenario where unemployment in New
 
02:03:12.629 --> 02:03:12.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh goes up to 6 and a half%
 
02:03:14.589 --> 02:03:14.599 align:start position:0%
which prior to the pandemic was as high
 
02:03:17.069 --> 02:03:17.079 align:start position:0%
an unemployment rate as the state had
 
02:03:20.229 --> 02:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
experienced so in the modeling under
 
02:03:23.430 --> 02:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
current conditions I did uh put some key
 
02:03:25.709 --> 02:03:25.719 align:start position:0%
takeaways on the next slide but if you
 
02:03:27.870 --> 02:03:27.880 align:start position:0%
look at the chart you can see that the
 
02:03:29.950 --> 02:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
current benefits that would be the
 
02:03:31.589 --> 02:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
current condition of the trust fund
 
02:03:34.350 --> 02:03:34.360 align:start position:0%
rather if no changes were made is in the
 
02:03:37.629 --> 02:03:37.639 align:start position:0%
gry line the CH the trust fund
 
02:03:40.189 --> 02:03:40.199 align:start position:0%
performance if this bill were in effect
 
02:03:43.149 --> 02:03:43.159 align:start position:0%
is in the green line we started the bill
 
02:03:45.189 --> 02:03:45.199 align:start position:0%
going into effect in the third quarter
 
02:03:46.910 --> 02:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
of this year thinking that would be the
 
02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
earliest that the bill if passed would
 
02:03:52.750 --> 02:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
have an impact and then the key take on
 
02:03:55.669 --> 02:03:55.679 align:start position:0%
the current forecast again no economic
 
02:03:58.950 --> 02:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
downturn um in
 
02:04:01.589 --> 02:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
2026 the bill would result in the trust
 
02:04:03.870 --> 02:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
fund finishing the year about $21
 
02:04:06.229 --> 02:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
million below where it is currently
 
02:04:09.870 --> 02:04:09.880 align:start position:0%
forecast without any changes at 364
 
02:04:11.629 --> 02:04:11.639 align:start position:0%
million in
 
02:04:14.109 --> 02:04:14.119 align:start position:0%
2027 it would reduce the trust fund
 
02:04:18.629 --> 02:04:18.639 align:start position:0%
balance by 33 million down to 353
 
02:04:21.270 --> 02:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
million for a year-ending balance
 
02:04:23.990 --> 02:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
important ly uh for that uh for our
 
02:04:27.270 --> 02:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
prior discussions about uh the fund
 
02:04:30.109 --> 02:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
balance reductions that are are are
 
02:04:32.790 --> 02:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
keyed off of uh balance thresholds in
 
02:04:34.069 --> 02:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
the fund for
 
02:04:37.390 --> 02:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
solvency um it would not impact those um
 
02:04:39.790 --> 02:04:39.800 align:start position:0%
it would come very close there are two
 
02:04:42.950 --> 02:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
quarters in the model that would finish
 
02:04:47.109 --> 02:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
um at 351 and 353 million
 
02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
respectively that trigger uh for
 
02:04:52.109 --> 02:04:52.119 align:start position:0%
allowing employers to get a one %
 
02:04:55.030 --> 02:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
reduction on their rate kicks in at 350
 
02:04:58.430 --> 02:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
million so when you're looking at a $350
 
02:05:01.870 --> 02:05:01.880 align:start position:0%
$400 million account um moving the
 
02:05:03.990 --> 02:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
needle by 1 million doesn't take very
 
02:05:07.189 --> 02:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
much um so the forecast didn't call for
 
02:05:09.990 --> 02:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
it to go below that fund balance
 
02:05:13.189 --> 02:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
reduction um so uh I'm I'm just pointing
 
02:05:15.030 --> 02:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
out that it was very close in each of
 
02:05:17.990 --> 02:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
those quarters so current conditions uh
 
02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
no change to the forecasted fund balance
 
02:05:22.549 --> 02:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
reductions for employers
 
02:05:24.910 --> 02:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
um mild recession again here you can see
 
02:05:28.549 --> 02:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
gry line is without any changes what the
 
02:05:30.990 --> 02:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
trust fund would do if New Hampshire
 
02:05:34.350 --> 02:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
encountered that type of mild recession
 
02:05:36.750 --> 02:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
Green Line being what the trust fund
 
02:05:39.430 --> 02:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
would do with the proposed schedule from
 
02:05:41.790 --> 02:05:41.800 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie's bill as
 
02:05:46.069 --> 02:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
proposed um key takeaways from that are
 
02:05:49.629 --> 02:05:49.639 align:start position:0%
A $64 million reduction in
 
02:05:55.069 --> 02:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
2026 A1 $27 million reduction um or
 
02:05:59.030 --> 02:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
rather $87 million reduction in
 
02:06:01.910 --> 02:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
2027 um there would be an impact on the
 
02:06:05.589 --> 02:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
fund balance reductions in two quarters
 
02:06:08.830 --> 02:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
employers um would not get the
 
02:06:11.669 --> 02:06:11.679 align:start position:0%
forecasted uh 05 reduction to their
 
02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
rates if the bill were in in effect
 
02:06:15.750 --> 02:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
according to this
 
02:06:18.270 --> 02:06:18.280 align:start position:0%
forecast that would cause an increase in
 
02:06:20.830 --> 02:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
taxes to be paid in 2027 by New
 
02:06:24.069 --> 02:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire business of just over $26
 
02:06:27.069 --> 02:06:27.079 align:start position:0%
million uh when we look at the last uh
 
02:06:29.069 --> 02:06:29.079 align:start position:0%
scenario the major
 
02:06:32.149 --> 02:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
recession um this is the problematic the
 
02:06:35.310 --> 02:06:35.320 align:start position:0%
the even more problematic than the mild
 
02:06:37.390 --> 02:06:37.400 align:start position:0%
recession um this would cause the fund
 
02:06:40.189 --> 02:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
to go negative so there'd be no impact
 
02:06:42.030 --> 02:06:42.040 align:start position:0%
on the payment of benefits New Hampshire
 
02:06:43.870 --> 02:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
would continue to pay benefits we'd be
 
02:06:45.990 --> 02:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
borrowing from the federal government
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
those would be loans that would have to
 
02:06:49.830 --> 02:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
be paid back by New Hampshire employers
 
02:06:52.589 --> 02:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
they may or may not uh have interest
 
02:06:54.510 --> 02:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
associated with that depending on how
 
02:06:56.910 --> 02:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
quickly they are paid back the way the
 
02:06:58.709 --> 02:06:58.719 align:start position:0%
feds work that is that if you carry a
 
02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
balance every September 1 interest kicks
 
02:07:03.589 --> 02:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
in and if you pay it back prior to the
 
02:07:05.589 --> 02:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
next September one you don't hit another
 
02:07:07.790 --> 02:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
interest anniversary so it could or
 
02:07:11.709 --> 02:07:11.719 align:start position:0%
could not have that level of impact um
 
02:07:13.629 --> 02:07:13.639 align:start position:0%
what would so the takeaways from that
 
02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
major recession are uh a $55 million hit
 
02:07:21.709 --> 02:07:21.719 align:start position:0%
uh below the forecasted balance in 26
 
02:07:24.430 --> 02:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
and then in 27 was when the fund would
 
02:07:26.910 --> 02:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
go negative by $55
 
02:07:29.470 --> 02:07:29.480 align:start position:0%
million um New Hampshire did go negative
 
02:07:31.229 --> 02:07:31.239 align:start position:0%
during the Great Recession we borrowed
 
02:07:34.149 --> 02:07:34.159 align:start position:0%
from the federal government in both 2010
 
02:07:37.310 --> 02:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
2011 we did not borrow during the
 
02:07:41.350 --> 02:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
pandemic um and the 2010 and 11
 
02:07:43.350 --> 02:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
borrowing was paid back by New Hampshire
 
02:07:45.149 --> 02:07:45.159 align:start position:0%
because of reforms that were enacted by
 
02:07:48.510 --> 02:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature that increased um taxes
 
02:07:52.510 --> 02:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
on employers um implement a waiting week
 
02:07:55.470 --> 02:07:55.480 align:start position:0%
on claimants um and that was done fast
 
02:07:56.950 --> 02:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
enough where New Hampshire was able to
 
02:07:58.830 --> 02:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
avoid borrowing costs when they last
 
02:08:01.589 --> 02:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
borrowed so a big hit on the fund in
 
02:08:04.589 --> 02:08:04.599 align:start position:0%
that Great Recession uh scenario um
 
02:08:06.950 --> 02:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
there's also an additional impact where
 
02:08:09.310 --> 02:08:09.320 align:start position:0%
employers would lose out on fund balance
 
02:08:12.350 --> 02:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
reductions earlier than under the
 
02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
existing benefit schedule that would
 
02:08:18.430 --> 02:08:18.440 align:start position:0%
cost them nearly another $23 million so
 
02:08:20.990 --> 02:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
significant impacts uh with the major
 
02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:22.149 align:start position:0%
significant impacts uh with the major
recession

02:08:22.149 --> 02:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
recession
 
02:08:25.430 --> 02:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh big impacts with the mild recession
 
02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
um and zero impact on current conditions
 
02:08:31.470 --> 02:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
uh but any Economist will tell you um
 
02:08:33.310 --> 02:08:33.320 align:start position:0%
every seven years you can plan on an
 
02:08:34.950 --> 02:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
economic downturn they just don't know
 
02:08:37.589 --> 02:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
how significant it is going to be but
 
02:08:39.910 --> 02:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
they all build in a 15% chance of
 
02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
recession into their model um so I will
 
02:08:47.189 --> 02:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
stop there and um hopefully uh bored you
 
02:08:49.589 --> 02:08:49.599 align:start position:0%
enough right around lunch where there
 
02:08:51.870 --> 02:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
not too many questions and uh we can go
 
02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:52.709 align:start position:0%
not too many questions and uh we can go
from

02:08:52.709 --> 02:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:08:55.229 --> 02:08:55.239 align:start position:0%
there that as always that's great
 
02:08:58.510 --> 02:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
testimony uh representative K and then
 
02:09:00.750 --> 02:09:00.760 align:start position:0%
represent representative Alani thank you
 
02:09:03.350 --> 02:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you Mr labers so I
 
02:09:04.950 --> 02:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
understand that uh there's an amendment
 
02:09:07.430 --> 02:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
that would drastically reduce the impact
 
02:09:09.950 --> 02:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
that you've just laid out for us is that
 
02:09:13.109 --> 02:09:13.119 align:start position:0%
correct yeah I had um the SP
 
02:09:14.990 --> 02:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie did describe to
 
02:09:17.510 --> 02:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
me what he was looking to do with
 
02:09:19.830 --> 02:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
proposing six new tiers instead of 12
 
02:09:22.589 --> 02:09:22.599 align:start position:0%
tiers but again I have not modeled that
 
02:09:24.790 --> 02:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
or asked The Economist and elme to model
 
02:09:27.270 --> 02:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
that I'll wait till the um the amendment
 
02:09:29.549 --> 02:09:29.559 align:start position:0%
is provided and we'll we'll we'll do
 
02:09:32.709 --> 02:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
that at that point okay yeah please uh
 
02:09:33.870 --> 02:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
would you have an envelope that you
 
02:09:35.549 --> 02:09:35.559 align:start position:0%
could do the back of the envelope uh
 
02:09:39.350 --> 02:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
just sketch and give me some idea of We
 
02:09:41.069 --> 02:09:41.079 align:start position:0%
Still fall off the cliff in the event of
 
02:09:44.350 --> 02:09:44.360 align:start position:0%
a major uh recession um that I don't
 
02:09:46.750 --> 02:09:46.760 align:start position:0%
know um I don't want to speculate I want
 
02:09:49.470 --> 02:09:49.480 align:start position:0%
to run the the model the same way I did
 
02:09:54.189 --> 02:09:54.199 align:start position:0%
um in this first instance and um it's
 
02:09:56.549 --> 02:09:56.559 align:start position:0%
you know it's a pretty complicated data
 
02:09:58.990 --> 02:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
query that I get from the system that I
 
02:10:00.430 --> 02:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
set it up and then provide to The
 
02:10:02.350 --> 02:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
Economist but now that we have it set up
 
02:10:04.030 --> 02:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll turn it around pretty
 
02:10:05.629 --> 02:10:05.639 align:start position:0%
quickly I can guarantee you that it will
 
02:10:08.750 --> 02:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
have less of an impact um than the bill
 
02:10:11.669 --> 02:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
as proposed whether it's enough to
 
02:10:14.750 --> 02:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
prevent those fund balance reduction uh
 
02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
losses um in the two recession scenarios
 
02:10:20.310 --> 02:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
I don't know thank you okay
 
02:10:22.189 --> 02:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
representative avalani
 
02:10:23.549 --> 02:10:23.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Deputy
 
02:10:25.870 --> 02:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
Commissioner um just just to throw you a
 
02:10:25.880 --> 02:10:26.910 align:start position:0%
Commissioner um just just to throw you a
little

02:10:26.910 --> 02:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
little
 
02:10:30.950 --> 02:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
curveball um if we set a top rate at 50%
 
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
set a top rate of wages and set a top
 
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
rate of reimbursements would that be
 
02:10:39.390 --> 02:10:39.400 align:start position:0%
easier than all of
 
02:10:42.430 --> 02:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
these scales within the the rsas and
 
02:10:45.270 --> 02:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
whatnot would that be be easier for
 
02:10:47.390 --> 02:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
obviously your department to forecast
 
02:10:49.870 --> 02:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
but for tax for taxation purposes it
 
02:10:53.669 --> 02:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
would be easier to
 
02:10:55.790 --> 02:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
navigate just so I understand the
 
02:10:57.069 --> 02:10:57.079 align:start position:0%
question correctly representative so
 
02:10:59.270 --> 02:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
you're saying that if you set the the
 
02:11:01.430 --> 02:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
benefit amount at
 
02:11:04.549 --> 02:11:04.559 align:start position:0%
50% um so an across the board wage
 
02:11:06.470 --> 02:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
replacement rate of
 
02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
50% um having spent some time uh looking
 
02:11:14.229 --> 02:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
at the 8,000 individuals who received
 
02:11:15.910 --> 02:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
427 and
 
02:11:18.629 --> 02:11:18.639 align:start position:0%
2024 the individual that re that had
 
02:11:20.270 --> 02:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
earnings of just over a million dollars
 
02:11:21.990 --> 02:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
were not going to want to place that
 
02:11:25.229 --> 02:11:25.239 align:start position:0%
individual um at that rate um so there
 
02:11:28.030 --> 02:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
would be the top uh
 
02:11:32.790 --> 02:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
end where you have high income earners
 
02:11:35.669 --> 02:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
um those um I don't remember the number
 
02:11:37.629 --> 02:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
but you have a significant number that
 
02:11:38.669 --> 02:11:38.679 align:start position:0%
were over
 
02:11:40.990 --> 02:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
$100,000 a significant number over a
 
02:11:43.830 --> 02:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
quarter million dollars um not very many
 
02:11:45.189 --> 02:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
over a million dollars I think there was
 
02:11:48.229 --> 02:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
one so um but you would want to be
 
02:11:49.990 --> 02:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
careful um obviously you'd want to set a
 
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
Max similar to what social security does
 
02:11:54.629 --> 02:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
right now um with the max amount that
 
02:11:57.910 --> 02:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
they that they take taxes out um so
 
02:12:00.629 --> 02:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
you'd want to have a Max uh Sim and also
 
02:12:01.990 --> 02:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
similar to what the Paid Family Leave
 
02:12:04.549 --> 02:12:04.559 align:start position:0%
program does they only provide a 60%
 
02:12:06.350 --> 02:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
wage replacement up to the Social
 
02:12:10.390 --> 02:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
Security uh taxable wage cap um so you'd
 
02:12:13.669 --> 02:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
want to have something like that um but
 
02:12:16.790 --> 02:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
um it wouldn't be any more complicated
 
02:12:19.790 --> 02:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
than our current system some programming
 
02:12:24.069 --> 02:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
would be required um but uh we can
 
02:12:25.709 --> 02:12:25.719 align:start position:0%
certainly do that we have a a great
 
02:12:27.390 --> 02:12:27.400 align:start position:0%
support vendor uh that does all that
 
02:12:29.629 --> 02:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
work for us thank you and follow Mr
 
02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
chairman for a followup um would that
 
02:12:34.189 --> 02:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
also leave us in compliance if we did a
 
02:12:38.189 --> 02:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
Model like that you know maximum amount
 
02:12:43.149 --> 02:12:43.159 align:start position:0%
maximum salary maximum payout um I
 
02:12:44.990 --> 02:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
believe it would we would we would need
 
02:12:47.709 --> 02:12:47.719 align:start position:0%
to submit that to US Department of Labor
 
02:12:49.390 --> 02:12:49.400 align:start position:0%
which I did fail to mention we have done
 
02:12:52.149 --> 02:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
that with this bill as well we have not
 
02:12:54.350 --> 02:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
got a response from them but uh I'm sure
 
02:12:56.950 --> 02:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
they'll turn that around pretty quickly
 
02:12:59.790 --> 02:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
um generally they they don't care what
 
02:13:02.950 --> 02:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
the state sets those weekly benefit
 
02:13:05.790 --> 02:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
amounts at uh they would caution any
 
02:13:08.109 --> 02:13:08.119 align:start position:0%
state setting the rate at an amount that
 
02:13:10.870 --> 02:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
they know is going to uh cause the fund
 
02:13:12.189 --> 02:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
to be depleted because they don't want
 
02:13:13.950 --> 02:13:13.960 align:start position:0%
to set up states to have to borrow from
 
02:13:15.470 --> 02:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
US Treasury to pay
 
02:13:18.629 --> 02:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
benefits um they as long as there
 
02:13:19.870 --> 02:13:19.880 align:start position:0%
weren't any
 
02:13:24.750 --> 02:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
differentiation um between um types of
 
02:13:28.109 --> 02:13:28.119 align:start position:0%
unemployment types of Industry um my
 
02:13:30.069 --> 02:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
guess is that they would not take issue
 
02:13:32.149 --> 02:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
with it but again a lot of that would
 
02:13:35.510 --> 02:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
depend on the solvency analysis as well
 
02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
thank you follow follow um and also you
 
02:13:43.030 --> 02:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
alluded to the uh interest rate dedu uh
 
02:13:46.030 --> 02:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
reductions for employers would be
 
02:13:49.390 --> 02:13:49.400 align:start position:0%
um going away uh with any type of
 
02:13:51.669 --> 02:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
increase not going away but be harder to
 
02:13:53.109 --> 02:13:53.119 align:start position:0%
achieve with any type of increase that
 
02:13:56.750 --> 02:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
we have now um would you would you would
 
02:13:58.669 --> 02:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
you have to look at having additional
 
02:14:01.830 --> 02:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
triggers or maybe a smaller increase or
 
02:14:04.069 --> 02:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
decrease at certain levels at more
 
02:14:07.510 --> 02:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
intervals or a higher level of a trust
 
02:14:09.870 --> 02:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
fund yeah it is
 
02:14:13.510 --> 02:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
it there's only uh you know as I think
 
02:14:15.990 --> 02:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
represented McKenzie's line was that we
 
02:14:18.109 --> 02:14:18.119 align:start position:0%
we've got uh dollars going out and we've
 
02:14:20.629 --> 02:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
got dollars coming in right um so when
 
02:14:23.310 --> 02:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
you are increasing the amount going out
 
02:14:25.030 --> 02:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh it does question whether or not the
 
02:14:26.709 --> 02:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
amount coming in is going to be
 
02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
sufficient to maintain a solvent fund um
 
02:14:33.270 --> 02:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
the impact that the the bill as proposed
 
02:14:34.549 --> 02:14:34.559 align:start position:0%
has is it
 
02:14:39.030 --> 02:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
it it causes the fund balance to reduce
 
02:14:41.629 --> 02:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
at a quicker rate because you're paying
 
02:14:44.229 --> 02:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
out more and that causes the fund
 
02:14:47.870 --> 02:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
balance to be lower in quarters earlier
 
02:14:50.629 --> 02:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
than it is currently forecast under the
 
02:14:54.390 --> 02:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
existing benefit structure so rather
 
02:14:58.470 --> 02:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
than an employer receiving uh a the the
 
02:15:00.310 --> 02:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
lowest fund balance reduction that they
 
02:15:03.069 --> 02:15:03.079 align:start position:0%
can get it which is achieved if the fund
 
02:15:05.910 --> 02:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
is at 250 million for for a quarter then
 
02:15:07.750 --> 02:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
that next quarter employers get a half
 
02:15:10.750 --> 02:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
Point reduction on their rate um so if
 
02:15:13.310 --> 02:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
you're an average employer at 61 taking
 
02:15:15.109 --> 02:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
a half point off that and bringing you
 
02:15:17.709 --> 02:15:17.719 align:start position:0%
down to the minimum of 0.1 is pretty
 
02:15:19.950 --> 02:15:19.960 align:start position:0%
significant um so that's what the
 
02:15:22.189 --> 02:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
proposal does it causes the fund to be
 
02:15:26.310 --> 02:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
lower earlier and thus the those fund
 
02:15:29.069 --> 02:15:29.079 align:start position:0%
balance reductions are not achieved so
 
02:15:31.589 --> 02:15:31.599 align:start position:0%
employers pay at their higher earned
 
02:15:34.750 --> 02:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
rate rather than the earned rate minus
 
02:15:37.069 --> 02:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
the fund balance reduction currently
 
02:15:39.109 --> 02:15:39.119 align:start position:0%
your fund balance reductions these were
 
02:15:40.870 --> 02:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
changed in
 
02:15:44.990 --> 02:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
2021 um as part of House Bill 2 um and
 
02:15:46.990 --> 02:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
that what they were changed they
 
02:15:50.109 --> 02:15:50.119 align:start position:0%
previously it was at 250 million if the
 
02:15:51.910 --> 02:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
fund maintains that balance for every
 
02:15:53.990 --> 02:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
day of a quarter the next quarter
 
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
employers get a half point off their
 
02:16:00.310 --> 02:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
rate if the fund maintained uh
 
02:16:03.870 --> 02:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
275 million um employers received a
 
02:16:05.910 --> 02:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
point off their rate and if the fund
 
02:16:09.189 --> 02:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
maintained 300 million employers got one
 
02:16:12.030 --> 02:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
and a half points off their rate the
 
02:16:15.830 --> 02:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
change was um to the top two tiers the
 
02:16:18.270 --> 02:16:18.280 align:start position:0%
first one did not change So currently
 
02:16:21.149 --> 02:16:21.159 align:start position:0%
employers at 250 million they get get a
 
02:16:23.430 --> 02:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
half point off their rate just like
 
02:16:27.549 --> 02:16:27.559 align:start position:0%
prior to the change um and the top two
 
02:16:31.030 --> 02:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
um the next one is 350 million employers
 
02:16:32.629 --> 02:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
get the onep point reduction which is
 
02:16:34.589 --> 02:16:34.599 align:start position:0%
where they currently are at um they have
 
02:16:37.910 --> 02:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
been at for quite some time now for um
 
02:16:41.270 --> 02:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
well over a year um and the fund needs
 
02:16:43.349 --> 02:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
to maintain a balance of 400 million in
 
02:16:46.230 --> 02:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
order to get the 1 and a half% reduction
 
02:16:48.469 --> 02:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
and what those what those reductions do
 
02:16:49.990 --> 02:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
they're they're like I described them
 
02:16:52.509 --> 02:16:52.519 align:start position:0%
their solvency controls and they ease
 
02:16:55.509 --> 02:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
the money coming in when the when the
 
02:16:58.150 --> 02:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
fund is getting to those legislatively
 
02:17:00.669 --> 02:17:00.679 align:start position:0%
established solvy amounts meaning we
 
02:17:03.429 --> 02:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
feel the fund has enough to pay during
 
02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
an economic downturn based upon recent
 
02:17:07.830 --> 02:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
history therefore we're going to lower
 
02:17:10.309 --> 02:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
the burden on employers and that's how
 
02:17:14.309 --> 02:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
they function right now um we're at 391
 
02:17:17.110 --> 02:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
million uh we're not forecast to hit 400
 
02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
million we're forecast to stay in that
 
02:17:22.750 --> 02:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
375 to 390 three range as long as
 
02:17:25.389 --> 02:17:25.399 align:start position:0%
there's no economic downturn which Brian
 
02:17:28.270 --> 02:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
golob and his team are not forecasting
 
02:17:33.750 --> 02:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
um out through uh 2025 and into 26 um
 
02:17:36.030 --> 02:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
but that's where we're at not forecasted
 
02:17:38.230 --> 02:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
it hit that 400 forecast to maintain
 
02:17:41.429 --> 02:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
that 1% reduction for the foreseeable
 
02:17:44.629 --> 02:17:44.639 align:start position:0%
future thank you followup yeah let's go
 
02:17:47.190 --> 02:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
with represent plan again then come back
 
02:17:48.990 --> 02:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:17:51.230 --> 02:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
representative for yielding
 
02:17:54.110 --> 02:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
um two things come out and there's
 
02:17:56.669 --> 02:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
actually a third um but you addressed
 
02:17:58.509 --> 02:17:58.519 align:start position:0%
one of them uh which is the trust fund
 
02:18:00.990 --> 02:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
the trust fund will then be negative if
 
02:18:03.629 --> 02:18:03.639 align:start position:0%
this bill pass to the negative 55
 
02:18:06.190 --> 02:18:06.200 align:start position:0%
million am I not correct if New
 
02:18:07.950 --> 02:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire were to experience a major
 
02:18:10.950 --> 02:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
recession event yes okay and may I
 
02:18:13.549 --> 02:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
continue please um and now the
 
02:18:15.349 --> 02:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
unemployment tax that is what our
 
02:18:17.790 --> 02:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
employers are going to be paying uh
 
02:18:20.309 --> 02:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
since they're now being come lower and
 
02:18:22.870 --> 02:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
lower in the in the the brackets if I
 
02:18:24.709 --> 02:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
can use that term they'll see a
 
02:18:27.309 --> 02:18:27.319 align:start position:0%
subsequent increases of that thing but
 
02:18:28.790 --> 02:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
according to your document with like the
 
02:18:31.750 --> 02:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
fourth lowest unemployment tax in the
 
02:18:34.150 --> 02:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
country am that correct correct fourth
 
02:18:36.190 --> 02:18:36.200 align:start position:0%
lowest um unemployment tax burden in the
 
02:18:38.150 --> 02:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
country okay and then do you have
 
02:18:39.629 --> 02:18:39.639 align:start position:0%
another question I do thank would you
 
02:18:41.070 --> 02:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
like to ask for that question yes Mr
 
02:18:43.349 --> 02:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
chairman when I follow up with one last
 
02:18:44.870 --> 02:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
question thank
 
02:18:44.880 --> 02:18:46.469 align:start position:0%
question thank
you

02:18:46.469 --> 02:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:18:49.230 --> 02:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
um do you think people come to this
 
02:18:52.349 --> 02:18:52.359 align:start position:0%
state or come to specific ific States
 
02:18:57.230 --> 02:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:59.429 --> 02:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
benefits that's not why I came to New
 
02:19:03.429 --> 02:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um NE um I
 
02:19:06.629 --> 02:19:06.639 align:start position:0%
I I try not to get into other people's
 
02:19:08.830 --> 02:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
heads u i don't make decisions that way
 
02:19:11.230 --> 02:19:11.240 align:start position:0%
I don't think most workers do I I think
 
02:19:12.750 --> 02:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
they're looking for the right
 
02:19:16.389 --> 02:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity um and they my the right
 
02:19:22.469 --> 02:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
amount of everything else um but um
 
02:19:24.110 --> 02:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh New Hampshire you know
 
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
we do border Massachusetts that has the
 
02:19:28.110 --> 02:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
highest I know one of the highest
 
02:19:30.469 --> 02:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
average weekly benefit benefit amounts
 
02:19:32.910 --> 02:19:32.920 align:start position:0%
the average the highest maximum weekly
 
02:19:35.549 --> 02:19:35.559 align:start position:0%
benefit amount um in the country I think
 
02:19:39.589 --> 02:19:39.599 align:start position:0%
what second to Hawaii on that chart um
 
02:19:41.910 --> 02:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
but there's no one in the country that
 
02:19:43.509 --> 02:19:43.519 align:start position:0%
would tell you Massachusetts is managing
 
02:19:47.309 --> 02:19:47.319 align:start position:0%
a good unemployment program um they came
 
02:19:51.070 --> 02:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
out of their pandemic having uh made
 
02:19:53.110 --> 02:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
what they described as an error to the
 
02:19:56.270 --> 02:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
tune of $2.5 billion dollar and paying
 
02:19:58.190 --> 02:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
people Fally Finance benefits when they
 
02:19:59.429 --> 02:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
should have been paying them State
 
02:20:01.429 --> 02:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
Finance benefits like New Hampshire was
 
02:20:04.590 --> 02:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
doing so people like myself who sat
 
02:20:06.750 --> 02:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
there during the pandemic watched weekly
 
02:20:08.990 --> 02:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
payouts watched what other states were
 
02:20:11.550 --> 02:20:11.560 align:start position:0%
doing New Hampshire was paying about 50%
 
02:20:13.630 --> 02:20:13.640 align:start position:0%
of their benef beneficiaries State
 
02:20:16.469 --> 02:20:16.479 align:start position:0%
financed benefits Massachusetts was
 
02:20:18.309 --> 02:20:18.319 align:start position:0%
paying the about
 
02:20:21.590 --> 02:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
90% Bly finan benefits
 
02:20:22.790 --> 02:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
I knew there wasn't that much of a
 
02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
difference in our labor forces and the
 
02:20:25.710 --> 02:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
reason why people found themselves
 
02:20:28.349 --> 02:20:28.359 align:start position:0%
unemployed we played by the rules we
 
02:20:30.230 --> 02:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
depleted our trust fund down to about
 
02:20:32.950 --> 02:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
$60 million and those are some sleepless
 
02:20:35.790 --> 02:20:35.800 align:start position:0%
nights while Massachusetts did not I
 
02:20:37.790 --> 02:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
like the fact that the US Department of
 
02:20:39.270 --> 02:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
Labor is holding them accountable now
 
02:20:41.870 --> 02:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
and requiring uh at least two billion of
 
02:20:43.830 --> 02:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
that to be paid back but President Biden
 
02:20:47.070 --> 02:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
did give them a break of $500 million
 
02:20:49.070 --> 02:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
apparently in a Boston Globe article I
 
02:20:51.950 --> 02:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
just saw but um um it Massachusetts
 
02:20:55.630 --> 02:20:55.640 align:start position:0%
model is not what we need to achieve um
 
02:20:58.870 --> 02:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
we want to maintain a wage replacement
 
02:21:01.150 --> 02:21:01.160 align:start position:0%
rate that incentivizes people to get
 
02:21:03.150 --> 02:21:03.160 align:start position:0%
back to work and I think most people
 
02:21:05.870 --> 02:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
want to get back to work I wanted to get
 
02:21:08.110 --> 02:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
back to work people I speak with that
 
02:21:10.469 --> 02:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
utilize the program want to get back to
 
02:21:13.270 --> 02:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
work so um but it's a matter of
 
02:21:15.870 --> 02:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
adequately supporting them during a
 
02:21:17.630 --> 02:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount of time to find that
 
02:21:20.750 --> 02:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
next job thank you all right and
 
02:21:20.760 --> 02:21:22.270 align:start position:0%
next job thank you all right and
representative

02:21:22.270 --> 02:21:22.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:21:25.309 --> 02:21:25.319 align:start position:0%
Laing thank you Mr chair and this is
 
02:21:27.190 --> 02:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
nothing short of dazzling by the way
 
02:21:30.349 --> 02:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
this report thank you um just a couple
 
02:21:32.070 --> 02:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
of questions what New England state has
 
02:21:35.349 --> 02:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
the lowest unemployment rate in in the
 
02:21:38.030 --> 02:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
Six States here um so New Hampshire
 
02:21:39.670 --> 02:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
right now has the fourth lowest
 
02:21:41.590 --> 02:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate in the country we are
 
02:21:45.190 --> 02:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
second we are behind Vermont um in New
 
02:21:47.710 --> 02:21:47.720 align:start position:0%
England uh Vermont is I think a tenth of
 
02:21:50.750 --> 02:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
a point lower than our 2.6
 
02:21:52.910 --> 02:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
um I don't think anyone any Economist
 
02:21:54.630 --> 02:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
would tell you that there's any
 
02:21:56.910 --> 02:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
similarity between the New Hampshire
 
02:21:59.309 --> 02:21:59.319 align:start position:0%
economy and the Vermont economy uh their
 
02:22:01.990 --> 02:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
labor force is shrinking ours is growing
 
02:22:03.870 --> 02:22:03.880 align:start position:0%
um and our labor force is growing faster
 
02:22:05.990 --> 02:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
than every other New England State
 
02:22:08.950 --> 02:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
follow yes please and we have the lowest
 
02:22:11.309 --> 02:22:11.319 align:start position:0%
uh average average benefit paid New
 
02:22:13.510 --> 02:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does correct that's correct
 
02:22:15.910 --> 02:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
and one more followup one more followup
 
02:22:18.030 --> 02:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
so compared that to
 
02:22:21.150 --> 02:22:21.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts do we see that there's any
 
02:22:23.270 --> 02:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
type of motivation correlation here to
 
02:22:24.469 --> 02:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
get back to
 
02:22:27.070 --> 02:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
work well well I think Massachusetts
 
02:22:29.349 --> 02:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
goes on the other the opposite side of
 
02:22:30.990 --> 02:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
that right their average duration over
 
02:22:34.270 --> 02:22:34.280 align:start position:0%
18 weeks um their average benefits over
 
02:22:36.830 --> 02:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
700 bucks a week you can get up to 1500
 
02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
bucks a week so that that's not the
 
02:22:41.590 --> 02:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
model we would ever be looking to um
 
02:22:45.110 --> 02:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
mimic here in New Hampshire um I I think
 
02:22:47.150 --> 02:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
from a from a duration and exhaustion
 
02:22:49.270 --> 02:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
perspective New Hampshire is is doing
 
02:22:53.590 --> 02:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:56.110 --> 02:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
um however looking at the population
 
02:22:57.910 --> 02:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
that's currently getting that
 
02:23:01.270 --> 02:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
427 um a wage replacement rate of of a
 
02:23:04.070 --> 02:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
quarter of what you earned I can see
 
02:23:06.150 --> 02:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
that being very difficult for people who
 
02:23:09.469 --> 02:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
are legitimately unemployed you know not
 
02:23:11.150 --> 02:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
they're they're not a bad worker they're
 
02:23:13.510 --> 02:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
just in a bad situation they
 
02:23:16.389 --> 02:23:16.399 align:start position:0%
legitimately want to get back to work um
 
02:23:18.710 --> 02:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
and that can put them in a very
 
02:23:20.990 --> 02:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
difficult position um with a with a
 
02:23:22.750 --> 02:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
benefit amount that hasn't hasn't kept
 
02:23:25.950 --> 02:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
pace um with with the inflation and and
 
02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
purchasing power okay and one second
 
02:23:27.840 --> 02:23:29.030 align:start position:0%
purchasing power okay and one second
representative

02:23:29.030 --> 02:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:23:32.590 --> 02:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
stop um this is just a quick question um
 
02:23:36.070 --> 02:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
I was just curious um on the um uh
 
02:23:39.349 --> 02:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
projections that you did for the uh mild
 
02:23:42.070 --> 02:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
recession and the major recessions um do
 
02:23:43.230 --> 02:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
you have an
 
02:23:46.429 --> 02:23:46.439 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate for what those would
 
02:23:50.670 --> 02:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
look like yes so we um the UN employment
 
02:23:52.750 --> 02:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
rate for the mild recession is
 
02:23:55.469 --> 02:23:55.479 align:start position:0%
4.5% uh which was the rate experienced
 
02:23:59.070 --> 02:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
in the early 2000s the Great Recession
 
02:24:01.870 --> 02:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
uh the Great Recession the the major
 
02:24:03.469 --> 02:24:03.479 align:start position:0%
recession that's
 
02:24:06.110 --> 02:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
65% in both instances we took our
 
02:24:08.950 --> 02:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
current labor force um and we took those
 
02:24:10.870 --> 02:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
unemployment rates from those prior
 
02:24:13.910 --> 02:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
experiences so current labor force prior
 
02:24:16.830 --> 02:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
experiences um in term and then took the
 
02:24:19.030 --> 02:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
increases that were actually experienced
 
02:24:20.670 --> 02:24:20.680 align:start position:0%
at the intervals that they were
 
02:24:23.590 --> 02:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
experienced um and um that's the the
 
02:24:24.910 --> 02:24:24.920 align:start position:0%
results that you see and those numbers
 
02:24:27.349 --> 02:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
that you see are quarter ending balances
 
02:24:29.750 --> 02:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
um so each of those quarters through the
 
02:24:30.710 --> 02:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
end of
 
02:24:30.720 --> 02:24:32.630 align:start position:0%
end of
27

02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:32.640 align:start position:0%

02:24:36.870 --> 02:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and representative La
 
02:24:39.429 --> 02:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
last question thank you please um
 
02:24:41.790 --> 02:24:41.800 align:start position:0%
administrative load there's going to be
 
02:24:43.150 --> 02:24:43.160 align:start position:0%
a lot more people that want to collect
 
02:24:45.950 --> 02:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
if this benefit is much higher is your
 
02:24:47.670 --> 02:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
office prepared to handle that or would
 
02:24:49.950 --> 02:24:49.960 align:start position:0%
you need to hire more people in possibly
 
02:24:52.110 --> 02:24:52.120 align:start position:0%
a new bu to put them
 
02:24:55.790 --> 02:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
in um great question first of all uh no
 
02:24:59.830 --> 02:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
um our department has uh no needs for
 
02:25:03.469 --> 02:25:03.479 align:start position:0%
additional staff um you know the
 
02:25:05.389 --> 02:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
existence of an unemployment program and
 
02:25:08.309 --> 02:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
and I know um Brian golob our Economist
 
02:25:10.309 --> 02:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
has told this committee before the
 
02:25:12.190 --> 02:25:12.200 align:start position:0%
existing of unemployment existence of
 
02:25:14.510 --> 02:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits increases the
 
02:25:15.870 --> 02:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
duration of
 
02:25:18.030 --> 02:25:18.040 align:start position:0%
unemployment but it's better than the
 
02:25:20.429 --> 02:25:20.439 align:start position:0%
alternative um the existence of an
 
02:25:22.429 --> 02:25:22.439 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefit to get you that
 
02:25:24.349 --> 02:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
Financial bridge to your next job is
 
02:25:27.550 --> 02:25:27.560 align:start position:0%
critically important
 
02:25:31.510 --> 02:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
um while um we have low duration right
 
02:25:36.110 --> 02:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
now and low volume um if benefits were
 
02:25:38.670 --> 02:25:38.680 align:start position:0%
increased as long as there was an
 
02:25:41.910 --> 02:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
increase that was in line with existing
 
02:25:44.429 --> 02:25:44.439 align:start position:0%
wage replacement rates and didn't make
 
02:25:47.429 --> 02:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
it easier for people to have longer
 
02:25:50.550 --> 02:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
duration um than I would not expect much
 
02:25:52.429 --> 02:25:52.439 align:start position:0%
impact on
 
02:25:55.110 --> 02:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
duration when you increase
 
02:25:55.120 --> 02:25:56.790 align:start position:0%
duration when you increase
benefits

02:25:56.790 --> 02:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
02:25:59.830 --> 02:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
um Beyond in a reasonable amount which
 
02:26:02.469 --> 02:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
we experienced during the pandemic when
 
02:26:03.990 --> 02:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
the federal government kicked in an
 
02:26:06.990 --> 02:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
additional $600 a week for the early
 
02:26:09.750 --> 02:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
part of the pandemic about 30% of our
 
02:26:12.830 --> 02:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
filers were making more on unemployment
 
02:26:15.190 --> 02:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
than they were in their jobs prior to
 
02:26:18.150 --> 02:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
the pandemic however they couldn't
 
02:26:21.269 --> 02:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
work a lot of us couldn't some of us
 
02:26:25.190 --> 02:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
worked a little too much um it was it
 
02:26:27.870 --> 02:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
was a unique set of circumstances why
 
02:26:29.670 --> 02:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
the federal government did what they did
 
02:26:31.590 --> 02:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
but it also gave you a good example of
 
02:26:33.429 --> 02:26:33.439 align:start position:0%
what happens when you increase the rate
 
02:26:36.110 --> 02:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
too much um because what did employers
 
02:26:38.030 --> 02:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
have to do particularly in the service
 
02:26:41.150 --> 02:26:41.160 align:start position:0%
sector um I know representative avalani
 
02:26:43.710 --> 02:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
experienced this probably as well you've
 
02:26:45.190 --> 02:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
got to pay them more to get them to come
 
02:26:49.110 --> 02:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
back to work and when you're paying uh
 
02:26:51.590 --> 02:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
an individual to fold pizza box is at 18
 
02:26:54.590 --> 02:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
bucks an hour the cost of pizza goes up
 
02:26:57.190 --> 02:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
um and has an impact on
 
02:27:00.349 --> 02:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
inflation and represent avalani thank
 
02:27:01.870 --> 02:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman just to just to come
 
02:27:04.670 --> 02:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
back to the trust fund um typically the
 
02:27:07.349 --> 02:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
trust fund is filled at what time of
 
02:27:09.870 --> 02:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
year because we have the first 14,000
 
02:27:12.910 --> 02:27:12.920 align:start position:0%
and then if there was any secondary lag
 
02:27:15.030 --> 02:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
in the trust fund that goes down who
 
02:27:16.469 --> 02:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
would be paying
 
02:27:19.750 --> 02:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
that burden towards the third and fourth
 
02:27:19.760 --> 02:27:21.070 align:start position:0%
that burden towards the third and fourth
quarter

02:27:21.070 --> 02:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
quarter
 
02:27:23.429 --> 02:27:23.439 align:start position:0%
yeah so good question so it receives
 
02:27:26.590 --> 02:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue every quarter right the majority
 
02:27:28.830 --> 02:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
of the revenue comes in as a result of
 
02:27:32.030 --> 02:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
those first quarter reports uh so the
 
02:27:34.950 --> 02:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
first quarter tax and wage reports uh
 
02:27:37.389 --> 02:27:37.399 align:start position:0%
they come in in the month following the
 
02:27:39.590 --> 02:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
end of the quarter so they have to uh
 
02:27:39.600 --> 02:27:40.269 align:start position:0%
end of the quarter so they have to uh
come

02:27:40.269 --> 02:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
come
 
02:27:44.710 --> 02:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
in um um in April um that's when the
 
02:27:46.630 --> 02:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
majority of the revenue comes in because
 
02:27:48.190 --> 02:27:48.200 align:start position:0%
most employers unless you have a
 
02:27:50.710 --> 02:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
seasonal pattern to your hiring
 
02:27:54.309 --> 02:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
um you're taxed on the first $114,000 in
 
02:27:57.429 --> 02:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
annual earnings paid to each employee so
 
02:28:00.670 --> 02:28:00.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of that gets hit in and um eaten
 
02:28:03.389 --> 02:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
up in that first quarter some lag in the
 
02:28:05.750 --> 02:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
second quarter and then new hires you're
 
02:28:07.990 --> 02:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
going to have that uh could have that in
 
02:28:09.790 --> 02:28:09.800 align:start position:0%
the third and fourth quarter and then if
 
02:28:11.590 --> 02:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
you have a seasonal pattern you're going
 
02:28:13.590 --> 02:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
to have more of it within whatever
 
02:28:16.110 --> 02:28:16.120 align:start position:0%
season it is that you're hiring up for
 
02:28:18.870 --> 02:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
but most of that um the over the
 
02:28:20.830 --> 02:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
majority of Revenue comes in as a result
 
02:28:22.830 --> 02:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
of the first quarter so we see that like
 
02:28:27.070 --> 02:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
I said in April um and some some of
 
02:28:30.389 --> 02:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
it will uh come in in that first week of
 
02:28:34.030 --> 02:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
May thank you and my last followup Mr
 
02:28:36.630 --> 02:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
chairman is that a quote that's the last
 
02:28:38.429 --> 02:28:38.439 align:start position:0%
one all right go
 
02:28:42.070 --> 02:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
Ahad um on the negative ratings uh we
 
02:28:43.510 --> 02:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
have a positive rating employees we have
 
02:28:45.349 --> 02:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
negative rating employers if the trust
 
02:28:50.150 --> 02:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
fund were to move midcycle um
 
02:28:51.630 --> 02:28:51.640 align:start position:0%
and the negative ratings were catching
 
02:28:54.190 --> 02:28:54.200 align:start position:0%
up towards the end of the third and
 
02:28:55.510 --> 02:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
fourth quarter in the first quarter
 
02:28:58.510 --> 02:28:58.520 align:start position:0%
where most of us would file would get a
 
02:29:02.870 --> 02:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
significant increase in our unemployment
 
02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:04.710 align:start position:0%
significant increase in our unemployment
insurance

02:29:04.710 --> 02:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
02:29:07.510 --> 02:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
tax um how would the department look at
 
02:29:09.990 --> 02:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
that to mitigate that if there was
 
02:29:11.790 --> 02:29:11.800 align:start position:0%
another recession that came through the
 
02:29:13.230 --> 02:29:13.240 align:start position:0%
second and third and fourth quarters
 
02:29:16.230 --> 02:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
that so we wouldn't be as you know where
 
02:29:21.870 --> 02:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:25.110 --> 02:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
I did anticipating a question from you
 
02:29:29.150 --> 02:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
that was not rehearsed um I did look at
 
02:29:30.630 --> 02:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
current amount that you're paying based
 
02:29:33.469 --> 02:29:33.479 align:start position:0%
on each schedule um so right now
 
02:29:35.670 --> 02:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
positive rated employers meaning we've
 
02:29:38.790 --> 02:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh uh they've paid in more in taxes than
 
02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
we've paid out in benefit so they're the
 
02:29:44.070 --> 02:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
least risky to the program therefore
 
02:29:45.550 --> 02:29:45.560 align:start position:0%
they are taxed at the lowest rate
 
02:29:48.309 --> 02:29:48.319 align:start position:0%
schedule one you can have a rate as low
 
02:29:51.910 --> 02:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
as $14 per employee per year you can
 
02:29:54.510 --> 02:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
have a rate as high as
 
02:29:58.590 --> 02:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
$364 per employee per year on average
 
02:30:02.349 --> 02:30:02.359 align:start position:0%
they're paying $85 per employee per year
 
02:30:05.230 --> 02:30:05.240 align:start position:0%
schedule two if you are newly negative
 
02:30:08.110 --> 02:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
meaning that you just had an event that
 
02:30:10.750 --> 02:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
caused uh layoffs you haven't had that
 
02:30:12.750 --> 02:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
experience before so you've been
 
02:30:15.309 --> 02:30:15.319 align:start position:0%
negative for less than four years
 
02:30:17.230 --> 02:30:17.240 align:start position:0%
meaning that we have paid out more in
 
02:30:19.269 --> 02:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
benefits than you've paid out uh than
 
02:30:22.070 --> 02:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
you've paid in in taxes over the entire
 
02:30:25.110 --> 02:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
life of you as an employer in the state
 
02:30:29.870 --> 02:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
you start at a uh amount of
 
02:30:32.870 --> 02:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
$392 per employee per year and can go as
 
02:30:33.910 --> 02:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
high as
 
02:30:37.309 --> 02:30:37.319 align:start position:0%
$910 per employee per year in the
 
02:30:40.550 --> 02:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
highest uh schedule for those chronic
 
02:30:42.750 --> 02:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
negative employers so those that have
 
02:30:45.710 --> 02:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
been negative for more than four years
 
02:30:48.510 --> 02:30:48.520 align:start position:0%
they pay from as low as
 
02:30:50.590 --> 02:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
$462 a year
 
02:30:55.710 --> 02:30:55.720 align:start position:0%
per employee to as much as 980 per year
 
02:30:59.070 --> 02:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
per employee um there are adjustments
 
02:31:00.469 --> 02:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
that can be made for those negative
 
02:31:02.710 --> 02:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
rated employers because while they don't
 
02:31:04.389 --> 02:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
get the benefit of fund balance
 
02:31:06.790 --> 02:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
reductions they do get less of a sear
 
02:31:10.030 --> 02:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
charge no positive rated employer gets a
 
02:31:13.070 --> 02:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
search charge those were removed back in
 
02:31:16.190 --> 02:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
2021 um so the highest rate that that
 
02:31:18.830 --> 02:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
negative rated employer can pay um
 
02:31:22.590 --> 02:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
results in a a tax uh per employee per
 
02:31:24.910 --> 02:31:24.920 align:start position:0%
year of
 
02:31:28.110 --> 02:31:28.120 align:start position:0%
1,50 thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
02:31:30.950 --> 02:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you sir are there any other
 
02:31:34.070 --> 02:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
questions represent Flanigan thank you
 
02:31:36.230 --> 02:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'm going to put you on the
 
02:31:37.990 --> 02:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
spot Deputy
 
02:31:40.950 --> 02:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
Commissioner what do you think of the
 
02:31:43.309 --> 02:31:43.319 align:start position:0%
bill you have all the information you
 
02:31:45.389 --> 02:31:45.399 align:start position:0%
have all the numbers going and I mean
 
02:31:47.830 --> 02:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
you you you have the the rates you have
 
02:31:50.070 --> 02:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
they're pay paid what the employer are
 
02:31:52.950 --> 02:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
going to do let me reduce it down to do
 
02:31:55.070 --> 02:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
you think the amended Bill covering like
 
02:31:57.790 --> 02:31:57.800 align:start position:0%
a five versus 12 or whatever the number
 
02:32:01.150 --> 02:32:01.160 align:start position:0%
is 15 might be a better
 
02:32:04.469 --> 02:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
path I will uh once we're able to see
 
02:32:06.990 --> 02:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
that and we're able to provide some
 
02:32:09.790 --> 02:32:09.800 align:start position:0%
analysis um might be the way to go you
 
02:32:11.349 --> 02:32:11.359 align:start position:0%
guys will get that um you'll be able to
 
02:32:15.269 --> 02:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
take a look at it and um decide which
 
02:32:18.150 --> 02:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
direction you want to go all right good
 
02:32:23.590 --> 02:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
question so that being said uh I'm I'm
 
02:32:27.910 --> 02:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
I'm very interested in seeing what that
 
02:32:32.429 --> 02:32:32.439 align:start position:0%
six versus 12 means um we'll as soon as
 
02:32:34.550 --> 02:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
we have that Mr chair we'll prioritize
 
02:32:37.309 --> 02:32:37.319 align:start position:0%
it and uh we'll turn it around um I
 
02:32:40.469 --> 02:32:40.479 align:start position:0%
think for my part of it it's probably a
 
02:32:42.990 --> 02:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
day and then uh between the two
 
02:32:44.590 --> 02:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
economists that worked on it probably
 
02:32:47.190 --> 02:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
another day okay represent
 
02:32:49.309 --> 02:32:49.319 align:start position:0%
Solan actually I was going to ask you
 
02:32:50.630 --> 02:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
know what the time time frame would be
 
02:32:53.030 --> 02:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
and um and perhaps we got to develop a
 
02:32:54.110 --> 02:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
plan as to how we're going to move
 
02:32:56.950 --> 02:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
forward with this because um it it seems
 
02:32:59.269 --> 02:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
like we need that analysis we need more
 
02:33:03.269 --> 02:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
testimony right and um so whether we
 
02:33:06.389 --> 02:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
want to um bump this bill into um
 
02:33:09.590 --> 02:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
another um hearing day um perhaps next
 
02:33:10.910 --> 02:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
week and that might screw up the
 
02:33:14.429 --> 02:33:14.439 align:start position:0%
schedule we just set up but yeah so what
 
02:33:15.349 --> 02:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to do is we're going to
 
02:33:18.750 --> 02:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
recess the testimony on this bill and we
 
02:33:20.790 --> 02:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
will pick it up in the near future we
 
02:33:23.230 --> 02:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
got some scheduling issues to go through
 
02:33:25.910 --> 02:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
as you have some work to do so let's
 
02:33:27.830 --> 02:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
coordinate on when we want to do that
 
02:33:29.550 --> 02:33:29.560 align:start position:0%
right I think that's important for us to
 
02:33:30.910 --> 02:33:30.920 align:start position:0%
understand the impact of what you're
 
02:33:34.550 --> 02:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
what's being proposed is there any uh
 
02:33:36.750 --> 02:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
questions on that any commment does that
 
02:33:37.830 --> 02:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
make sense to
 
02:33:40.790 --> 02:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
everyone represent when are we expecting
 
02:33:40.800 --> 02:33:41.750 align:start position:0%
everyone represent when are we expecting
the

02:33:41.750 --> 02:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:33:43.830 --> 02:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
amendment uh represent McKenzie I
 
02:33:47.070 --> 02:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:52.269 --> 02:33:52.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:56.110 --> 02:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
okay so we're expecting it soon and uh
 
02:33:57.630 --> 02:33:57.640 align:start position:0%
we'll look at it for next Tuesday but
 
02:34:00.389 --> 02:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
maybe the week after and uh I think
 
02:34:02.830 --> 02:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
that's a a fair point thank you so much
 
02:34:05.429 --> 02:34:05.439 align:start position:0%
for your preparation and your concise
 
02:34:07.070 --> 02:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
testimony I appreciate
 
02:34:12.349 --> 02:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
it all right uh this closes the the
 
02:34:15.670 --> 02:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
hearing and uh we'll recess uh this
 
02:34:17.309 --> 02:34:17.319 align:start position:0%
hearing until we
 
02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
reconvene and we'll meet again back here
 
02:34:23.670 --> 02:34:23.680 align:start position:0%

House Bill 442 the sponsor was not able
 
03:04:24.030 --> 03:04:24.040 align:start position:0%
to be here today um this bill in essence
 
03:04:26.269 --> 03:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
would end the subminimum wage which is
 
03:04:28.950 --> 03:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
mostly paid to tipped workers those are
 
03:04:32.389 --> 03:04:32.399 align:start position:0%
restaurant workers waitresses servers um
 
03:04:35.830 --> 03:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
also hairdressers and some other um some
 
03:04:38.750 --> 03:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
other um classes of employees um the
 
03:04:41.110 --> 03:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
subminimum wage is problematic for a
 
03:04:43.950 --> 03:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
number of reasons first um the wage is
 
03:04:45.830 --> 03:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
based not on the number of hours the
 
03:04:48.750 --> 03:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
person works or the value but rather in
 
03:04:50.670 --> 03:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
the case of a waitress that the the
 
03:04:52.710 --> 03:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
value of the plate of food that they
 
03:04:55.190 --> 03:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
happen to be carrying so let me give you
 
03:04:58.429 --> 03:04:58.439 align:start position:0%
an example the the tip the uh sub
 
03:05:00.630 --> 03:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
minimum wage in New Hampshire is
 
03:05:05.070 --> 03:05:05.080 align:start position:0%
$327 an hour so if I um were to take my
 
03:05:07.469 --> 03:05:07.479 align:start position:0%
granddaughter out for lunch and I had a
 
03:05:10.150 --> 03:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
sandwich and she had a kids meal and the
 
03:05:11.830 --> 03:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
bill came to
 
03:05:16.030 --> 03:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
$20 um and I uh tipped at 20% the tip
 
03:05:20.710 --> 03:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
would be 20 uh would be $4 and the um
 
03:05:22.670 --> 03:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
the tipped wage from the employer would
 
03:05:22.680 --> 03:05:24.030 align:start position:0%
the tipped wage from the employer would
be

03:05:24.030 --> 03:05:24.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:05:26.590 --> 03:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
$327 so if it was a quiet day and we
 
03:05:28.469 --> 03:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
were the only people there then that
 
03:05:31.309 --> 03:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
person would be paid uh
 
03:05:34.510 --> 03:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
$727 for that hour of work if I was a
 
03:05:37.950 --> 03:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
bad Tipper um and I only gave her $2
 
03:05:40.190 --> 03:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
then the employer would be forced to
 
03:05:42.269 --> 03:05:42.279 align:start position:0%
make up that money up to
 
03:05:46.830 --> 03:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
$725 an hour um unfortunately for uh
 
03:05:49.630 --> 03:05:49.640 align:start position:0%
tipped workers their wages can be really
 
03:05:52.309 --> 03:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
variable but their expenses are not the
 
03:05:54.070 --> 03:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
rent is still going to be the rent
 
03:05:56.389 --> 03:05:56.399 align:start position:0%
regardless of how many people come in um
 
03:05:58.910 --> 03:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
to the restaurant so that that's one
 
03:06:01.590 --> 03:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
area that that's problematic the second
 
03:06:03.150 --> 03:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
thing is that
 
03:06:06.790 --> 03:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
um recently there have been a number of
 
03:06:10.229 --> 03:06:10.239 align:start position:0%
high-profile um um cases where there has
 
03:06:12.630 --> 03:06:12.640 align:start position:0%
been wage theft when people are paying
 
03:06:15.030 --> 03:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
with credit cards then the employee has
 
03:06:17.750 --> 03:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
to get that money from their employer
 
03:06:19.750 --> 03:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
after it's run through the system and
 
03:06:21.950 --> 03:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
there have been some situations recently
 
03:06:24.389 --> 03:06:24.399 align:start position:0%
where um that money has not been turned
 
03:06:27.190 --> 03:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
over to the employees so there are seven
 
03:06:29.870 --> 03:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
states that currently have a a single
 
03:06:32.590 --> 03:06:32.600 align:start position:0%
wage they don't have um they don't have
 
03:06:35.550 --> 03:06:35.560 align:start position:0%
a tipped wage um they just pay the
 
03:06:38.070 --> 03:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
regular minimum wage to whoever is
 
03:06:40.309 --> 03:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
working there and then they get tips on
 
03:06:43.269 --> 03:06:43.279 align:start position:0%
top of that um there are still
 
03:06:45.190 --> 03:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
restaurants in those States a place like
 
03:06:47.710 --> 03:06:47.720 align:start position:0%
Olive Garden still has restaurants
 
03:06:49.670 --> 03:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
California where they do have one Fair
 
03:06:53.670 --> 03:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
wage um so it's not
 
03:06:56.469 --> 03:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
um you know it's it it's it's not a deal
 
03:06:58.630 --> 03:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
breaker I think one of the things that
 
03:07:03.229 --> 03:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
that I've noticed is that because um
 
03:07:05.269 --> 03:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
because the amount the person is getting
 
03:07:08.150 --> 03:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
paid is dependent on the cost of
 
03:07:09.950 --> 03:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
whatever food they're bringing to the
 
03:07:13.070 --> 03:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
table that a lot of smaller full service
 
03:07:16.269 --> 03:07:16.279 align:start position:0%
restaurants with lower prices seem to
 
03:07:19.469 --> 03:07:19.479 align:start position:0%
be um you know like we we had a Blakes
 
03:07:22.070 --> 03:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
in Manchester that closed um they
 
03:07:24.070 --> 03:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't find people to work there just
 
03:07:25.790 --> 03:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
because people could not make enough
 
03:07:30.870 --> 03:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
money off of selling sandwiches so um so
 
03:07:33.030 --> 03:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
um there is some evidence that in states
 
03:07:34.990 --> 03:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
where they have one Fair wage those
 
03:07:37.150 --> 03:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
kinds of restaurants are more likely to
 
03:07:39.349 --> 03:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
expand so that that's really all I have
 
03:07:41.070 --> 03:07:41.080 align:start position:0%
to say on this bill if you have any
 
03:07:43.630 --> 03:07:43.640 align:start position:0%
questions I will try to answer them um
 
03:07:45.309 --> 03:07:45.319 align:start position:0%
this was not my bill so I haven't really
 
03:07:47.910 --> 03:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
done a huge amount of research but um
 
03:07:48.990 --> 03:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
there may be other people in the
 
03:07:51.670 --> 03:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
audience that can also uh give you
 
03:07:58.309 --> 03:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:00.870 --> 03:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
03:08:03.110 --> 03:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
salv thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:08:05.469 --> 03:08:05.479 align:start position:0%
taking my question um is it the intent
 
03:08:08.429 --> 03:08:08.439 align:start position:0%
of this bill to eliminate uh tips for
 
03:08:10.950 --> 03:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
the the people who are earning at least
 
03:08:14.229 --> 03:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
minimum wage no not at all um the the
 
03:08:16.910 --> 03:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
expression is tips on top so a person
 
03:08:19.590 --> 03:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
would be paid the minimum wage and then
 
03:08:21.710 --> 03:08:21.720 align:start position:0%
um people would still tip them in states
 
03:08:23.550 --> 03:08:23.560 align:start position:0%
where they have done this people still
 
03:08:26.110 --> 03:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
do get tips and they are still making
 
03:08:31.590 --> 03:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:34.150 --> 03:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
restaurants okay wait a minute I okay
 
03:08:36.670 --> 03:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
just to be clear because I I thought
 
03:08:39.990 --> 03:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
that in your opening testimony it was to
 
03:08:43.229 --> 03:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
eliminate the tipped wage okay the ti
 
03:08:46.590 --> 03:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
wage is 327 so eliminate that and just
 
03:08:49.630 --> 03:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
go with a St R minimum wage s and a
 
03:08:51.950 --> 03:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
quarter which is currently seven and a
 
03:08:53.950 --> 03:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
quarter right I'll be speaking to you
 
03:08:56.790 --> 03:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
later about that I understand but just
 
03:08:58.389 --> 03:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
okay so you want to you want to say hey
 
03:09:01.190 --> 03:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
there's no 327 it goes up to seven and a
 
03:09:03.670 --> 03:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
quarter okay gotcha thank you and
 
03:09:03.680 --> 03:09:04.630 align:start position:0%
quarter okay gotcha thank you and
representative

03:09:04.630 --> 03:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:09:06.790 --> 03:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
La uh thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:09:09.670 --> 03:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um is it possible
 
03:09:12.349 --> 03:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
that this bill could lead to a decrease
 
03:09:16.590 --> 03:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
in the Tipping culture uh tips on top um
 
03:09:18.150 --> 03:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
and how would that how would customers
 
03:09:19.750 --> 03:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh perceive the Tipping if they knew
 
03:09:21.870 --> 03:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
that the employee was already getting a
 
03:09:24.550 --> 03:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
wage do you think they would maybe tip
 
03:09:28.030 --> 03:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
less that's a good question um I you
 
03:09:29.590 --> 03:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
know there are seven states where they
 
03:09:32.389 --> 03:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
are doing this um Maine for example
 
03:09:34.990 --> 03:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
passed um a referendum a couple of years
 
03:09:37.990 --> 03:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
ago that aimed to eliminate the tipped
 
03:09:41.269 --> 03:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
wage um so that what what happens is
 
03:09:44.510 --> 03:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
that the um the the tipped wage will
 
03:09:47.429 --> 03:09:47.439 align:start position:0%
would would gradually increase until it
 
03:09:50.790 --> 03:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
met up with the um with the the um with
 
03:09:54.710 --> 03:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
the regular minimum wage um they're they
 
03:09:58.190 --> 03:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
haven't reached that yet um their uh
 
03:10:01.070 --> 03:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
their legislature kind of put a put a
 
03:10:04.870 --> 03:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
slow roll on that but um in those seven
 
03:10:07.510 --> 03:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
states where they like California and
 
03:10:10.510 --> 03:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
Montana mostly Western States they they
 
03:10:15.389 --> 03:10:15.399 align:start position:0%
they they still tip people I know I do
 
03:10:16.870 --> 03:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
if I'm happen to be in one of those
 
03:10:16.880 --> 03:10:18.429 align:start position:0%
if I'm happen to be in one of those
States

03:10:18.429 --> 03:10:18.439 align:start position:0%
States
 
03:10:20.830 --> 03:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
yeah for a followup sir thank you
 
03:10:23.150 --> 03:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
sir uh service quality with less
 
03:10:26.070 --> 03:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
Reliance on tips for income might there
 
03:10:30.750 --> 03:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
be um servers that may not try as hard
 
03:10:32.630 --> 03:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
because they you know they they depend
 
03:10:34.030 --> 03:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
on their tips right so they maybe give
 
03:10:35.710 --> 03:10:35.720 align:start position:0%
you a little extra effort and oh my
 
03:10:38.510 --> 03:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
goodness how would that square if oh my
 
03:10:41.590 --> 03:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
goodness there is a whole body of
 
03:10:44.389 --> 03:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
literature on the things that women have
 
03:10:47.510 --> 03:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
to put up with because they are relyant
 
03:10:49.870 --> 03:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
on that money to feed their children and
 
03:10:52.429 --> 03:10:52.439 align:start position:0%
keep a roof over their head they are
 
03:10:56.110 --> 03:10:56.120 align:start position:0%
constantly sexually harassed they are uh
 
03:11:00.910 --> 03:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
mistreated by both uh owners and and
 
03:11:03.269 --> 03:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
customers and one of the things that
 
03:11:07.030 --> 03:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
this one Fair wage would eliminate is
 
03:11:09.790 --> 03:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
what it would do is give um servers the
 
03:11:11.790 --> 03:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
ability to say no you can't keep
 
03:11:14.429 --> 03:11:14.439 align:start position:0%
grabbing me like that
 
03:11:17.429 --> 03:11:17.439 align:start position:0%
I or I refuse to serve you because of
 
03:11:21.150 --> 03:11:21.160 align:start position:0%
the way you're behaving so there's two
 
03:11:23.990 --> 03:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
there's two sides to that
 
03:11:26.070 --> 03:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
coin repr
 
03:11:29.030 --> 03:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
K thank you Mr chair and I I apologize
 
03:11:31.070 --> 03:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
for missing most of your testimony due
 
03:11:33.510 --> 03:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
to the tight scheduling of our
 
03:11:38.190 --> 03:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
hearings um does it seem right that I
 
03:11:40.150 --> 03:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
mean isn't only understanding that
 
03:11:42.590 --> 03:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
tipping is for service that if I get
 
03:11:46.229 --> 03:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
good service I leave a good tip um and
 
03:11:48.309 --> 03:11:48.319 align:start position:0%
if I don't get good service I leave less
 
03:11:52.670 --> 03:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
of a tip or no tip and that um tipping
 
03:11:55.190 --> 03:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
on the based on the price of the meal is
 
03:11:57.349 --> 03:11:57.359 align:start position:0%
seems kind of unfair when you a waitress
 
03:12:02.590 --> 03:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
in a a diner make we work very hard and
 
03:12:04.550 --> 03:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
and work hard for the money as uh as I
 
03:12:07.510 --> 03:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
heard in the song and uh and get small
 
03:12:09.990 --> 03:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
tips mely because of the price of of the
 
03:12:11.790 --> 03:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
meal that she's
 
03:12:15.950 --> 03:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
serving yeah I mean the there's that um
 
03:12:17.830 --> 03:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
I there are people here who know more
 
03:12:19.990 --> 03:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
about this than I do but this the whole
 
03:12:22.710 --> 03:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
idea of the tipped wage actually came
 
03:12:25.030 --> 03:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
out of um out of
 
03:12:28.630 --> 03:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
reconstruction um people um particularly
 
03:12:30.590 --> 03:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
in the South and in other parts of the
 
03:12:30.600 --> 03:12:32.150 align:start position:0%
in the South and in other parts of the
country

03:12:32.150 --> 03:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
country
 
03:12:36.030 --> 03:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
um chafed at the idea of actually paying
 
03:12:39.309 --> 03:12:39.319 align:start position:0%
black people who had been enslaved a
 
03:12:43.590 --> 03:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
wage so they would have to rely on tips
 
03:12:45.710 --> 03:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
in order to make any money so you've you
 
03:12:48.750 --> 03:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
know you had Porters on the rail Road um
 
03:12:52.349 --> 03:12:52.359 align:start position:0%
and um you know Barbers and anybody like
 
03:12:54.469 --> 03:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
that rather than paying them a wage they
 
03:12:56.429 --> 03:12:56.439 align:start position:0%
they would have to rely on on the
 
03:12:58.670 --> 03:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
kindness of strangers if you'll forgive
 
03:13:02.590 --> 03:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
me for saying that but yeah it really um
 
03:13:04.550 --> 03:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
you know I think there's as much work
 
03:13:06.870 --> 03:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
involved in you know in serving me and
 
03:13:10.429 --> 03:13:10.439 align:start position:0%
my granddaughter that sandwich and that
 
03:13:13.229 --> 03:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
um and that uh kids meal as there is in
 
03:13:17.269 --> 03:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
bringing somebody um a $ 35 $40 stake I
 
03:13:18.630 --> 03:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
mean they're they're doing the same
 
03:13:20.790 --> 03:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
amount of work and you know the service
 
03:13:23.710 --> 03:13:23.720 align:start position:0%
is probably just as good but because the
 
03:13:26.550 --> 03:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
cost of the meal is so much higher then
 
03:13:28.150 --> 03:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
that person would get paid more than
 
03:13:30.910 --> 03:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
somebody who is working in in a in a
 
03:13:33.429 --> 03:13:33.439 align:start position:0%
lunch place now there are two reasons
 
03:13:36.630 --> 03:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
that one goes out to eat one is because
 
03:13:38.110 --> 03:13:38.120 align:start position:0%
you know it's a special occasion where
 
03:13:40.269 --> 03:13:40.279 align:start position:0%
you're going to be buying that $ 35 $40
 
03:13:41.950 --> 03:13:41.960 align:start position:0%
steak and it's a it's you know you're
 
03:13:43.870 --> 03:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
making an evening of it but then there
 
03:13:46.469 --> 03:13:46.479 align:start position:0%
are those situations like you're a state
 
03:13:48.229 --> 03:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
legislator and you've got half an hour
 
03:13:50.870 --> 03:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
to eat and you didn't bring anything so
 
03:13:54.349 --> 03:13:54.359 align:start position:0%
you need to you need you need to to find
 
03:13:56.150 --> 03:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
someplace to eat locally or you're on
 
03:13:59.229 --> 03:13:59.239 align:start position:0%
the road or you know and so you're
 
03:14:01.229 --> 03:14:01.239 align:start position:0%
you're going to go someplace
 
03:14:03.550 --> 03:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
where you just you just need to get
 
03:14:05.150 --> 03:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
something to eat and sometimes you just
 
03:14:08.229 --> 03:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
want to sit down and and at a table
 
03:14:09.910 --> 03:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
you're you're you're not anxious to go
 
03:14:13.309 --> 03:14:13.319 align:start position:0%
to a lunch counter um and you know and
 
03:14:14.750 --> 03:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
that's the model that a lot of these
 
03:14:16.830 --> 03:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
lower pric restaurants are going to now
 
03:14:19.349 --> 03:14:19.359 align:start position:0%
where you it's counter service and you
 
03:14:22.630 --> 03:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
you're your own waiter um just because
 
03:14:25.190 --> 03:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
they can't find people to do the work
 
03:14:25.200 --> 03:14:26.389 align:start position:0%
they can't find people to do the work
follow

03:14:26.389 --> 03:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
follow
 
03:14:29.630 --> 03:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
up thank you for followup sir thank you
 
03:14:32.309 --> 03:14:32.319 align:start position:0%
and and do do I understand that the the
 
03:14:34.710 --> 03:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
the bill does not eliminate tips it so
 
03:14:37.110 --> 03:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
it's still the incentive for the person
 
03:14:39.269 --> 03:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
to do better than the seven and a
 
03:14:42.550 --> 03:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
quarter current wage and receive a tip
 
03:14:45.389 --> 03:14:45.399 align:start position:0%
for providing good service correct
 
03:14:48.990 --> 03:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
correct yes so the $3 27 Cent wage would
 
03:14:51.429 --> 03:14:51.439 align:start position:0%
go away and it would be replaced by
 
03:14:53.190 --> 03:14:53.200 align:start position:0%
everybody getting whatever the minimum
 
03:14:55.670 --> 03:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
wage is and currently it's said it's
 
03:14:57.790 --> 03:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
$725 an hour which is the federal
 
03:15:00.790 --> 03:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
minimum wage one more one more yes sir
 
03:15:02.630 --> 03:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and representative would you
 
03:15:05.429 --> 03:15:05.439 align:start position:0%
believe that I spent my lunch uh my
 
03:15:08.030 --> 03:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
eating my my tun sandwich half of that
 
03:15:11.389 --> 03:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
lunch time was spent talking with a
 
03:15:13.710 --> 03:15:13.720 align:start position:0%
lobbyist and that was your
 
03:15:15.950 --> 03:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
choice okay I'm just checking to make
 
03:15:15.960 --> 03:15:18.269 align:start position:0%
choice okay I'm just checking to make
sure

03:15:18.269 --> 03:15:18.279 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:15:20.469 --> 03:15:20.479 align:start position:0%
okay are there any questions
 
03:15:21.870 --> 03:15:21.880 align:start position:0%
representative fton thank you what
 
03:15:23.429 --> 03:15:23.439 align:start position:0%
effect do you think this would have on
 
03:15:25.630 --> 03:15:25.640 align:start position:0%
the demand for labor with restaurants
 
03:15:29.469 --> 03:15:29.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:29.479 --> 03:15:33.510 align:start position:0%
 
difference

03:15:33.510 --> 03:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:36.990 --> 03:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
well it it's it's hard to say and and
 
03:15:38.750 --> 03:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to try to speculate on
 
03:15:42.309 --> 03:15:42.319 align:start position:0%
that I mean I think you know there is a
 
03:15:45.469 --> 03:15:45.479 align:start position:0%
really there have PE people working in
 
03:15:47.750 --> 03:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
restaurants have had a really hard time
 
03:15:49.870 --> 03:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
finding people to come and work for them
 
03:15:52.670 --> 03:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
and I think places like Blakes which was
 
03:15:54.790 --> 03:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
an ice cream and sandwich place in
 
03:15:56.750 --> 03:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester it wasn't you know there they
 
03:15:58.070 --> 03:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
had a couple of restaurants but it
 
03:16:00.309 --> 03:16:00.319 align:start position:0%
wasn't a big chain that didn't rely on
 
03:16:02.189 --> 03:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
you know it was a neighborhood place
 
03:16:04.469 --> 03:16:04.479 align:start position:0%
they they just couldn't couldn't make a
 
03:16:06.870 --> 03:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
go of it because they couldn't pay
 
03:16:09.950 --> 03:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
people um and and because the wages are
 
03:16:12.510 --> 03:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:16:14.870 --> 03:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
volatile cuz you know if you go into
 
03:16:17.269 --> 03:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
work and there nobody comes in you don't
 
03:16:19.229 --> 03:16:19.239 align:start position:0%
get paid you get paid
 
03:16:21.750 --> 03:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
$327 an hour or you know they'll send
 
03:16:21.760 --> 03:16:23.389 align:start position:0%
$327 an hour or you know they'll send
you

03:16:23.389 --> 03:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:16:26.469 --> 03:16:26.479 align:start position:0%
home they have to pay up to
 
03:16:30.110 --> 03:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
$725 for example if if you're working
 
03:16:33.150 --> 03:16:33.160 align:start position:0%
for a full hour and nobody comes in then
 
03:16:34.429 --> 03:16:34.439 align:start position:0%
you you're paid
 
03:16:37.790 --> 03:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
$7.25 an hour your your uh employer is
 
03:16:40.870 --> 03:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
forced to pay up to the minimum wage um
 
03:16:42.309 --> 03:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
but I think that there would be more
 
03:16:44.269 --> 03:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
stability for people who are working in
 
03:16:47.229 --> 03:16:47.239 align:start position:0%
the restaurant industry um I think you
 
03:16:50.349 --> 03:16:50.359 align:start position:0%
know it would make uh their lives um
 
03:16:53.630 --> 03:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
more stable and think about the
 
03:16:57.110 --> 03:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
restaurant and Industry as something
 
03:16:59.150 --> 03:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
that's more viable rather than a stop
 
03:17:01.830 --> 03:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
Gap or a second
 
03:17:05.389 --> 03:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
job okay thank you and representative
 
03:17:09.630 --> 03:17:09.640 align:start position:0%
Sullivan thank you um is it true that in
 
03:17:11.830 --> 03:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
order to fill some of these uh positions
 
03:17:15.550 --> 03:17:15.560 align:start position:0%
that are acknowledged to be hard to fill
 
03:17:17.910 --> 03:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
um employers sometimes use a base wage
 
03:17:20.469 --> 03:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
that's higher than 327 and in fact
 
03:17:24.510 --> 03:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
higher than 725 in order to um uh fill
 
03:17:26.710 --> 03:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
those positions and then again the
 
03:17:29.229 --> 03:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
employees make tips on top of that um
 
03:17:32.150 --> 03:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
elevated um base
 
03:17:35.790 --> 03:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
wage I am I'm unsure about that but what
 
03:17:38.510 --> 03:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
I will say is that
 
03:17:41.630 --> 03:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
um most of the people that I know who
 
03:17:44.990 --> 03:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
are people that I know who who I've met
 
03:17:48.189 --> 03:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
through this um through this work of one
 
03:17:52.189 --> 03:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
Fair wage they pay their employees $15
 
03:17:56.469 --> 03:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
an hour um and but they and and the but
 
03:17:58.630 --> 03:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
the model is different they don't go to
 
03:18:01.950 --> 03:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
the table and take the um take the um
 
03:18:05.269 --> 03:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
the order um they you know you come to
 
03:18:06.950 --> 03:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
the counter and then they will deliver
 
03:18:09.790 --> 03:18:09.800 align:start position:0%
your food to you um but it's the
 
03:18:11.710 --> 03:18:11.720 align:start position:0%
everyone has paid $15 an hour and they
 
03:18:13.790 --> 03:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
do all the work you know they Ser their
 
03:18:17.269 --> 03:18:17.279 align:start position:0%
servers their prep cooks and they they
 
03:18:19.910 --> 03:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
and Order takers and they just they just
 
03:18:22.269 --> 03:18:22.279 align:start position:0%
it's they do everything and that's kind
 
03:18:24.830 --> 03:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
of what I'm seeing more of as opposed to
 
03:18:27.110 --> 03:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
going into Blakes and sitting down in a
 
03:18:29.349 --> 03:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
booth and having someone come over and
 
03:18:31.790 --> 03:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
take your order so I'm not really aware
 
03:18:35.950 --> 03:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
of that other people in the room might
 
03:18:39.309 --> 03:18:39.319 align:start position:0%
be perhaps
 
03:18:42.189 --> 03:18:42.199 align:start position:0%
you I do believe that okay
 
03:18:44.389 --> 03:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
representative Flanigan thank you Mr
 
03:18:46.950 --> 03:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
chairman uh and thanks for testifying uh
 
03:18:51.630 --> 03:18:51.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:54.269 --> 03:18:54.279 align:start position:0%
hour that that's a good question
 
03:18:56.750 --> 03:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
apparently there are 5,000 people in the
 
03:18:58.469 --> 03:18:58.479 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire who make
 
03:19:02.950 --> 03:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
$7.25 an hour or less um again you know
 
03:19:06.150 --> 03:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
if you are a server and nobody comes in
 
03:19:08.030 --> 03:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
during your shift you're making
 
03:19:13.389 --> 03:19:13.399 align:start position:0%
$725 an hour other um um agricultural
 
03:19:16.750 --> 03:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
workers are exempt from the minimum wage
 
03:19:18.469 --> 03:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
also there's a law in the state that
 
03:19:22.950 --> 03:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
says that you are um unable you're not
 
03:19:25.070 --> 03:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
it's illegal to pay someone with a
 
03:19:27.349 --> 03:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
disability who's in a sheltered workshop
 
03:19:30.469 --> 03:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
less than the minimum wage so I someone
 
03:19:31.990 --> 03:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Labor might have
 
03:19:34.110 --> 03:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
a better understanding of that I was
 
03:19:36.189 --> 03:19:36.199 align:start position:0%
unable to get that information but there
 
03:19:37.950 --> 03:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
are five according to the Bureau of
 
03:19:40.269 --> 03:19:40.279 align:start position:0%
Labor Statistics there are 5,000 people
 
03:19:44.630 --> 03:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
in the state who make 725 or less follow
 
03:19:46.389 --> 03:19:46.399 align:start position:0%
and for a followup sir thank you Mr
 
03:19:49.030 --> 03:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
chair um would you believe that four
 
03:19:52.910 --> 03:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
years ago that number was 5,000 5,000
 
03:19:52.920 --> 03:19:54.910 align:start position:0%
years ago that number was 5,000 5,000
employees

03:19:54.910 --> 03:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
employees
 
03:19:58.510 --> 03:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
sure okay and representative labrin
 
03:20:00.309 --> 03:20:00.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair my final question if
 
03:20:02.990 --> 03:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
you don't mind are there any provisions
 
03:20:05.750 --> 03:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh for a transition period to roll this
 
03:20:07.750 --> 03:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
out I see 60 days here it would take
 
03:20:10.389 --> 03:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
effect after passage that's a big wallup
 
03:20:12.269 --> 03:20:12.279 align:start position:0%
to drop on any business owner that would
 
03:20:14.910 --> 03:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
have a tipping situation um I could see
 
03:20:16.429 --> 03:20:16.439 align:start position:0%
this driving the the cost of food
 
03:20:19.469 --> 03:20:19.479 align:start position:0%
through the roof in 60 days which might
 
03:20:21.269 --> 03:20:21.279 align:start position:0%
reduce some folks going out to eat just
 
03:20:21.279 --> 03:20:21.990 align:start position:0%
reduce some folks going out to eat just
a

03:20:21.990 --> 03:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:20:25.070 --> 03:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
thought uh well as I said I am not the
 
03:20:28.309 --> 03:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill um like I and and
 
03:20:30.469 --> 03:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
like I said I'm aware in Maine and other
 
03:20:32.309 --> 03:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
states where they're looking to phase
 
03:20:34.269 --> 03:20:34.279 align:start position:0%
out the tipped wage they're doing it
 
03:20:37.070 --> 03:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
gradually and and I'm certain that the
 
03:20:39.309 --> 03:20:39.319 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of this bill um would be
 
03:20:42.469 --> 03:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
open to amending it to do
 
03:20:45.150 --> 03:20:45.160 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you and any further
 
03:20:47.590 --> 03:20:47.600 align:start position:0%

and position for the record please yes
 
03:21:10.670 --> 03:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
okay um so my name is Henry veu and I'm
 
03:21:12.750 --> 03:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of the New Hampshire
 
03:21:15.110 --> 03:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
lodging and Restaurant
 
03:21:17.070 --> 03:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
Association uh and
 
03:21:21.070 --> 03:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
nhlra is opposed to this bill um maybe
 
03:21:24.150 --> 03:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
just by a quick show of hands who ever
 
03:21:26.189 --> 03:21:26.199 align:start position:0%
worked in the restaurant
 
03:21:28.990 --> 03:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
industry okay so we have some people
 
03:21:32.229 --> 03:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
that are familiar with the industry um
 
03:21:35.950 --> 03:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
so while the tipped employees and the
 
03:21:39.590 --> 03:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
tip wage are included in the minimum
 
03:21:39.600 --> 03:21:41.150 align:start position:0%
tip wage are included in the minimum
wage

03:21:41.150 --> 03:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
wage
 
03:21:45.510 --> 03:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
statute tipped employees are by no means
 
03:21:47.349 --> 03:21:47.359 align:start position:0%
at the minimum
 
03:21:50.309 --> 03:21:50.319 align:start position:0%
uh wage in in and the lowest wage
 
03:21:53.830 --> 03:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
earners if you go into a restaurant and
 
03:21:57.309 --> 03:21:57.319 align:start position:0%
ask the folks that work in there um
 
03:21:59.790 --> 03:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
whether they'd rather work in the back
 
03:22:02.269 --> 03:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
of the house meaning in the kitchen at
 
03:22:06.990 --> 03:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
an hourly rate with no tips or work in
 
03:22:09.189 --> 03:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
the front of the house at the sub
 
03:22:12.429 --> 03:22:12.439 align:start position:0%
minimum wage with tips they'll tell you
 
03:22:13.870 --> 03:22:13.880 align:start position:0%
they'd rather work in the front of the
 
03:22:17.070 --> 03:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
house um the tipped employees end up
 
03:22:20.389 --> 03:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
bringing home the most take-home money
 
03:22:23.590 --> 03:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
and they should they're the face of the
 
03:22:26.349 --> 03:22:26.359 align:start position:0%
business they're the brand um they're
 
03:22:31.590 --> 03:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
the Goodwill um so they should um but um
 
03:22:35.150 --> 03:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
for those that the bill doesn't have the
 
03:22:37.309 --> 03:22:37.319 align:start position:0%
statute uh it just says it's going to
 
03:22:40.950 --> 03:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
repeal uh or just says um no rate can be
 
03:22:43.550 --> 03:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
paid less than the than the minimum so
 
03:22:46.990 --> 03:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
the statute right now says um that
 
03:22:47.000 --> 03:22:48.030 align:start position:0%
the statute right now says um that
tipped

03:22:48.030 --> 03:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
tipped
 
03:22:51.229 --> 03:22:51.239 align:start position:0%
employees those that receive tips um
 
03:22:55.030 --> 03:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
must be paid at least
 
03:22:58.950 --> 03:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
45% of the applicable minimum wage so
 
03:22:58.960 --> 03:22:59.950 align:start position:0%
45% of the applicable minimum wage so
the

03:22:59.950 --> 03:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:23:03.790 --> 03:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
725 is the new New Hampshire doesn't
 
03:23:05.469 --> 03:23:05.479 align:start position:0%
have a minimum wage statute we go with a
 
03:23:07.630 --> 03:23:07.640 align:start position:0%
federal uh which is
 
03:23:10.990 --> 03:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
725 um but if the if the wage was able
 
03:23:15.349 --> 03:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
to go up um then uh 45% it would go up
 
03:23:17.189 --> 03:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
with it um
 
03:23:21.229 --> 03:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
so the the major obviously the majority
 
03:23:24.110 --> 03:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
of money that uh tip workers are
 
03:23:27.550 --> 03:23:27.560 align:start position:0%
bringing home are tips that's that's
 
03:23:31.670 --> 03:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
they they they're it's taxed as income
 
03:23:34.990 --> 03:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
uh so uh they have to uh file their
 
03:23:38.389 --> 03:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
income taxes and those tips are
 
03:23:42.710 --> 03:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
considered income um so it's it's very
 
03:23:47.349 --> 03:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
similar to wages um in Maine uh to your
 
03:23:50.229 --> 03:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
question uh what would the servers think
 
03:23:52.070 --> 03:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
of this you know would they be concerned
 
03:23:55.070 --> 03:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
about making less tips uh because people
 
03:23:57.790 --> 03:23:57.800 align:start position:0%
would know that uh they are now making
 
03:24:01.070 --> 03:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
the full minimum in Maine in
 
03:24:05.590 --> 03:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
2016 there was a ballot question about
 
03:24:08.670 --> 03:24:08.680 align:start position:0%
doing away with the tip wage it
 
03:24:10.710 --> 03:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
passed a year
 
03:24:15.349 --> 03:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
later um storm of tip employees showed
 
03:24:17.990 --> 03:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
up at the State House for a 15-hour
 
03:24:22.150 --> 03:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
hearing and they repealed it um the tip
 
03:24:23.990 --> 03:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
workers would
 
03:24:27.590 --> 03:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
rather I think have the system that we
 
03:24:30.790 --> 03:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
have now um on average and this is
 
03:24:34.309 --> 03:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
probably for a mid-range restaurant take
 
03:24:39.309 --> 03:24:39.319 align:start position:0%
home 19 to 20 19 to 25 an hour um I've
 
03:24:41.910 --> 03:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
seen some high-end restaurants in
 
03:24:45.309 --> 03:24:45.319 align:start position:0%
Manchester where they're $44 an hour on
 
03:24:49.590 --> 03:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
average when you take the tip wage and
 
03:24:50.790 --> 03:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
the tips
 
03:24:55.030 --> 03:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
combined um so again these are not tip
 
03:24:58.189 --> 03:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
these are not the low wage earners and I
 
03:25:01.349 --> 03:25:01.359 align:start position:0%
would ask you this too I know a lot of
 
03:25:03.030 --> 03:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
them are probably working so they're not
 
03:25:07.469 --> 03:25:07.479 align:start position:0%
here today but where is the swarm of
 
03:25:09.990 --> 03:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
tipped employees that saying we need
 
03:25:13.150 --> 03:25:13.160 align:start position:0%
this bill and have you gotten a lot of
 
03:25:16.309 --> 03:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
emails from tipped employees saying we
 
03:25:18.429 --> 03:25:18.439 align:start position:0%
we need this bill this bill comes up
 
03:25:21.910 --> 03:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
every few years uh it gets killed um
 
03:25:23.750 --> 03:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of misunderstanding I
 
03:25:27.349 --> 03:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
think about the tip wage um they're only
 
03:25:30.150 --> 03:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
getting 327 an hour um that's the
 
03:25:33.469 --> 03:25:33.479 align:start position:0%
minimum cash wage that the employer has
 
03:25:35.630 --> 03:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
to give them and they obviously make
 
03:25:38.790 --> 03:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
most of their wages under tips it's been
 
03:25:42.269 --> 03:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
like that forever um and this bill in
 
03:25:45.990 --> 03:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
one full swoop will turn its on its head
 
03:25:50.389 --> 03:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
um for a restaurant operator um I talked
 
03:25:52.990 --> 03:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
with one who has uh you know places in
 
03:25:55.349 --> 03:25:55.359 align:start position:0%
Salem Hudson Beford around the state
 
03:25:58.469 --> 03:25:58.479 align:start position:0%
he's got a New Hampshire chain and the
 
03:26:00.870 --> 03:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
current cost for his servers right now
 
03:26:05.510 --> 03:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
under the 327 minimum is a million $1.4
 
03:26:08.189 --> 03:26:08.199 align:start position:0%
million that's what he pays out to his
 
03:26:10.349 --> 03:26:10.359 align:start position:0%
servers he's obviously got a lot of
 
03:26:13.110 --> 03:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
servers he's got multiple locations
 
03:26:16.309 --> 03:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
under this bill it would increase to 3.4
 
03:26:21.429 --> 03:26:21.439 align:start position:0%
million which is a 60% increase in costs
 
03:26:23.790 --> 03:26:23.800 align:start position:0%
and he can't absorb that much where's it
 
03:26:25.830 --> 03:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
going to go the menu prices are going to
 
03:26:28.830 --> 03:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
go up and menu prices going up people no
 
03:26:31.349 --> 03:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
longer paying $25 for a meal they're
 
03:26:31.359 --> 03:26:32.110 align:start position:0%
longer paying $25 for a meal they're
paying

03:26:32.110 --> 03:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
paying
 
03:26:35.269 --> 03:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
$34 and they're knowing that the tipped
 
03:26:37.189 --> 03:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
employees is getting the full minimum
 
03:26:39.510 --> 03:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
and am I going to now go from 25 bucks
 
03:26:41.990 --> 03:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
to you know I think the tips would go
 
03:26:43.910 --> 03:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
down maybe some people would still tip
 
03:26:46.830 --> 03:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
the same but you can't in increase the
 
03:26:49.510 --> 03:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
cost and the price of a menu uh that
 
03:26:52.070 --> 03:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
much and expect everything to remain the
 
03:26:55.070 --> 03:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
same it just won't so we're opposed to
 
03:26:57.790 --> 03:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
this bill uh and I'll answer any
 
03:26:59.510 --> 03:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir for your
 
03:27:01.750 --> 03:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
testimony representive plan again and
 
03:27:05.110 --> 03:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
then representa sylvestra thank you Mr
 
03:27:07.269 --> 03:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
03:27:12.590 --> 03:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
question over here oh over here oh flan
 
03:27:14.950 --> 03:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
again I don't I would probably take hers
 
03:27:17.590 --> 03:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
first too no um
 
03:27:20.349 --> 03:27:20.359 align:start position:0%
there's current discussion in Washington
 
03:27:22.590 --> 03:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
DC about no tax on
 
03:27:26.710 --> 03:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
tips so if we increase the base pay from
 
03:27:30.510 --> 03:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
$324 to some number that's I in the bill
 
03:27:32.630 --> 03:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
could in essence the tip wage person be
 
03:27:35.189 --> 03:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
paying more income tax based on that
 
03:27:37.429 --> 03:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
scenario conceivably if we're going to
 
03:27:39.229 --> 03:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
uh not tax the tips and if we're going
 
03:27:41.269 --> 03:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
to essentially do away with the tips up
 
03:27:43.110 --> 03:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
here I mean people will still tip but if
 
03:27:44.990 --> 03:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
they receive less tips up here I think
 
03:27:46.510 --> 03:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
that's the point you're trying to make
 
03:27:48.229 --> 03:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
is that they are now going to get more
 
03:27:50.229 --> 03:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
of a cash wage from the employer which
 
03:27:52.269 --> 03:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
will be taxable I think that's what
 
03:27:55.590 --> 03:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
you're trying to say yeah mhm represent
 
03:27:57.710 --> 03:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
sestro thank you and thank you for
 
03:28:00.070 --> 03:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
taking the question you mentioned the
 
03:28:01.469 --> 03:28:01.479 align:start position:0%
back of the house and that the front of
 
03:28:03.349 --> 03:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
the house wouldn't want to be back there
 
03:28:04.710 --> 03:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
can you just throw me out a figure of
 
03:28:06.349 --> 03:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
what the back of the house makes on an
 
03:28:09.870 --> 03:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
hourly wage um no one's making 725 you
 
03:28:12.229 --> 03:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
can't find people for 725 Mike what
 
03:28:14.550 --> 03:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
would you say back of the
 
03:28:18.269 --> 03:28:18.279 align:start position:0%
house 18 to 30 bucks in the back you
 
03:28:21.150 --> 03:28:21.160 align:start position:0%
know depends on the quality of the
 
03:28:24.229 --> 03:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
restaurant yeah obviously I mean $30 is
 
03:28:26.550 --> 03:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
going to be a high-end you know a Chop
 
03:28:28.990 --> 03:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
House a copper door you know the
 
03:28:31.189 --> 03:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
high-end that's where the $30 is going
 
03:28:33.510 --> 03:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
to be and those servers are probably
 
03:28:35.510 --> 03:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
make the servers are probably doing 44
 
03:28:39.670 --> 03:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
an hour with the tips so
 
03:28:42.990 --> 03:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
followup yes ma'am thank you all right
 
03:28:46.710 --> 03:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
and it's been said over time that the
 
03:28:49.030 --> 03:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
weight staff supplements the back of the
 
03:28:51.990 --> 03:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
house is that true or false I'm not sure
 
03:28:53.189 --> 03:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
I understand the question in other words
 
03:28:56.030 --> 03:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
their tips are taken and then given to
 
03:29:00.030 --> 03:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
the so uh the labor department will come
 
03:29:03.429 --> 03:29:03.439 align:start position:0%
down very hard and there have been
 
03:29:05.070 --> 03:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
restaurants that have learned the hard
 
03:29:10.389 --> 03:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
way okay tips uh they can be pulled
 
03:29:15.229 --> 03:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
among um uh uh the other servers but um
 
03:29:17.189 --> 03:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
you can't take tips from the front of
 
03:29:19.269 --> 03:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
the house and give it to the dishwasher
 
03:29:21.269 --> 03:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
or the cook uh because the labor
 
03:29:23.670 --> 03:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
department will come down very hard okay
 
03:29:25.910 --> 03:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
that's what I believe to okay I'll wait
 
03:29:28.389 --> 03:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
in case anybody else has anything go
 
03:29:30.349 --> 03:29:30.359 align:start position:0%
ahead floor is yours and then
 
03:29:30.359 --> 03:29:32.910 align:start position:0%
ahead floor is yours and then
representative

03:29:32.910 --> 03:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:35.590 --> 03:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
McKenzie first represent D sylvestro and
 
03:29:37.429 --> 03:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
then representative McKenzie go
 
03:29:40.229 --> 03:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
ahead all right this is democracy
 
03:29:42.349 --> 03:29:42.359 align:start position:0%
represent McKenzie the floor has been
 
03:29:44.950 --> 03:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
yielded to you thank you thank you Mr
 
03:29:44.960 --> 03:29:46.630 align:start position:0%
yielded to you thank you thank you Mr
chairman

03:29:46.630 --> 03:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:29:48.950 --> 03:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
um there have been changes in the
 
03:29:52.870 --> 03:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
federal law uh the regulations changed I
 
03:29:54.950 --> 03:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
think last year or the year
 
03:29:58.670 --> 03:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
before and it the the change is as it
 
03:30:02.030 --> 03:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
relates to how people who are serving
 
03:30:04.229 --> 03:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
when they come off the serving clock and
 
03:30:06.389 --> 03:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
when they go back on the serving clock
 
03:30:08.870 --> 03:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
which I think is going to be quite
 
03:30:11.269 --> 03:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
frankly pretty problematic can you give
 
03:30:13.790 --> 03:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
us some sense of what that how that's
 
03:30:15.710 --> 03:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
playing itself out in restaurants and
 
03:30:15.720 --> 03:30:16.630 align:start position:0%
playing itself out in restaurants and
maybe

03:30:16.630 --> 03:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
03:30:18.870 --> 03:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
explain a little bit uh about what that
 
03:30:21.309 --> 03:30:21.319 align:start position:0%
regulation is yeah so I think you're
 
03:30:25.150 --> 03:30:25.160 align:start position:0%
referring to a situation where server
 
03:30:28.830 --> 03:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
gets uh called in um maybe it's not busy
 
03:30:31.710 --> 03:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
early on uh so they are not they're
 
03:30:34.590 --> 03:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
doing maybe rolling the silverware in
 
03:30:38.429 --> 03:30:38.439 align:start position:0%
the napkins or whatever so the labor
 
03:30:41.229 --> 03:30:41.239 align:start position:0%
department um the ruling you're speaking
 
03:30:44.910 --> 03:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
to uh is about what wage do they get
 
03:30:48.469 --> 03:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
paid when they're doing uh that kind of
 
03:30:55.309 --> 03:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
work um is it the 327 or the 725 or
 
03:30:58.630 --> 03:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
whatever the applicable minimum wage is
 
03:31:04.110 --> 03:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
in the Gibbon State um and so
 
03:31:07.790 --> 03:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
um Mike might be able to speak to Mike
 
03:31:09.950 --> 03:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
Summers from the Restaurant Association
 
03:31:12.229 --> 03:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
Summers if you could uh join at the
 
03:31:17.150 --> 03:31:17.160 align:start position:0%
podium introduce yourself and then uh
 
03:31:18.830 --> 03:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh for the record
 
03:31:20.349 --> 03:31:20.359 align:start position:0%
Mike Summers president CEO of the New
 
03:31:21.550 --> 03:31:21.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lodging and Restaurant
 
03:31:23.910 --> 03:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
Association so representing mcken Dan
 
03:31:25.070 --> 03:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
your question you're talking about the
 
03:31:27.990 --> 03:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
8020 rule the 8020 rule essentially
 
03:31:30.229 --> 03:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
requires that 80% of a server or a
 
03:31:32.550 --> 03:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
tipped employes time must be used
 
03:31:34.830 --> 03:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
directly waiting on tables or customers
 
03:31:36.590 --> 03:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
whether bartending whatever it might be
 
03:31:38.670 --> 03:31:38.680 align:start position:0%
and 20% of that time could be used for
 
03:31:40.469 --> 03:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
incidental activities that are
 
03:31:42.910 --> 03:31:42.920 align:start position:0%
supportive of that uh service that
 
03:31:46.229 --> 03:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
you're providing um there was a change
 
03:31:47.790 --> 03:31:47.800 align:start position:0%
under the Biden Administration that
 
03:31:49.710 --> 03:31:49.720 align:start position:0%
added a 30 minute cap that you couldn't
 
03:31:51.150 --> 03:31:51.160 align:start position:0%
have them doing incidental work for more
 
03:31:53.309 --> 03:31:53.319 align:start position:0%
than 30 minutes um and then that was
 
03:31:54.710 --> 03:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
taken up by the courts and has since
 
03:31:56.150 --> 03:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
been overturned so we're now back to the
 
03:31:58.309 --> 03:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
old rule of the 8020 rule if that's
 
03:32:04.309 --> 03:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:07.150 --> 03:32:07.160 align:start position:0%
question or followup yes
 
03:32:11.150 --> 03:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
sir so how do you how do you manage that
 
03:32:12.150 --> 03:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
in a
 
03:32:14.630 --> 03:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
restaurant how do you how do you manage
 
03:32:17.750 --> 03:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
to I'm working 80 % and 20 how do you
 
03:32:17.760 --> 03:32:18.910 align:start position:0%
to I'm working 80 % and 20 how do you
managed

03:32:18.910 --> 03:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
managed
 
03:32:21.269 --> 03:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
that I'll be frank and honest it's not
 
03:32:24.590 --> 03:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
easy um but frankly the 30 minute cap
 
03:32:26.469 --> 03:32:26.479 align:start position:0%
actually made it even harder because we
 
03:32:28.349 --> 03:32:28.359 align:start position:0%
had a scenario where you would and this
 
03:32:29.910 --> 03:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
is just as an expectation of of an
 
03:32:31.750 --> 03:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
employee so an employee would come in
 
03:32:33.550 --> 03:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
they would clock in they would work for
 
03:32:35.830 --> 03:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
30 minutes at uh tip wage because that's
 
03:32:37.349 --> 03:32:37.359 align:start position:0%
the 30 minute allotment that you could
 
03:32:39.070 --> 03:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
have and if they weren't done with side
 
03:32:40.229 --> 03:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
work or they didn't have any customers
 
03:32:41.750 --> 03:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
yet they'd have to clock out clock back
 
03:32:44.110 --> 03:32:44.120 align:start position:0%
in at 7:25 uh then when they got a
 
03:32:45.309 --> 03:32:45.319 align:start position:0%
customer they'd have to clock out and
 
03:32:47.229 --> 03:32:47.239 align:start position:0%
clock back in at 327 then they'd have to
 
03:32:48.469 --> 03:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
work their shift and at the end of the
 
03:32:50.750 --> 03:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
shift they'd probably have to clock out
 
03:32:53.349 --> 03:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
um and and and switch around and and I
 
03:32:55.309 --> 03:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
will tell you having managed restaurants
 
03:32:56.510 --> 03:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
that it's hard enough to get them to
 
03:32:57.950 --> 03:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
clock in and out let alone have them
 
03:33:00.870 --> 03:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
clock in and out six times in a shift um
 
03:33:03.269 --> 03:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
so but frankly to answer your question
 
03:33:05.469 --> 03:33:05.479 align:start position:0%
the way it's handled with the 8020 rule
 
03:33:07.750 --> 03:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
is if a if an employee Works a six- hour
 
03:33:08.990 --> 03:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
shift we just have to make sure that
 
03:33:10.510 --> 03:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
they're not spending more than 20% of
 
03:33:12.110 --> 03:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
that working on things other than
 
03:33:14.469 --> 03:33:14.479 align:start position:0%
waiting on staff um again it's a little
 
03:33:16.189 --> 03:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
bit of a you know Loosey Goosey but
 
03:33:17.309 --> 03:33:17.319 align:start position:0%
you're trying to keep track of it as
 
03:33:19.030 --> 03:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
best you can based on hours and business
 
03:33:20.790 --> 03:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
and those kinds of things and for those
 
03:33:22.229 --> 03:33:22.239 align:start position:0%
of you who have worked in restaurants
 
03:33:23.910 --> 03:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
many of you know that there's always the
 
03:33:25.429 --> 03:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
early shift they come in a little bit
 
03:33:27.429 --> 03:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
before you really open to customers they
 
03:33:28.870 --> 03:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
do the opening side work they leave
 
03:33:30.630 --> 03:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
early and then the other group comes in
 
03:33:32.349 --> 03:33:32.359 align:start position:0%
there the closing shift they work their
 
03:33:33.870 --> 03:33:33.880 align:start position:0%
shift and then they'll do the closed the
 
03:33:35.830 --> 03:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
shut down stuff at the end so it's
 
03:33:37.349 --> 03:33:37.359 align:start position:0%
always kind of rotating and there are
 
03:33:38.990 --> 03:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
ways to kind of Safeguard to make sure
 
03:33:41.830 --> 03:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
that we're not taking advantage of our
 
03:33:44.990 --> 03:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
employees okay uh one more represent
 
03:33:45.000 --> 03:33:46.710 align:start position:0%
employees okay uh one more represent
McKenzie

03:33:46.710 --> 03:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
McKenzie
 
03:33:50.269 --> 03:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
thank you um so I've heard over the
 
03:33:52.510 --> 03:33:52.520 align:start position:0%
course of the years uh numbers kicked
 
03:33:54.950 --> 03:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
around about what actually White staff
 
03:33:54.960 --> 03:33:56.269 align:start position:0%
around about what actually White staff
is

03:33:56.269 --> 03:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:33:58.910 --> 03:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
making there is a
 
03:34:01.550 --> 03:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
um there is there are a number of people
 
03:34:05.269 --> 03:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
who say that tips are being cash tips
 
03:34:07.469 --> 03:34:07.479 align:start position:0%
are being in the pockets and nobody's
 
03:34:10.830 --> 03:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
reporting that do you have accurate data
 
03:34:13.349 --> 03:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
to back up these what you are saying in
 
03:34:16.469 --> 03:34:16.479 align:start position:0%
terms of what uh employees are actually
 
03:34:18.590 --> 03:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
making can I go to the Department of
 
03:34:21.150 --> 03:34:21.160 align:start position:0%
Employment Security for instance and ask
 
03:34:25.349 --> 03:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
them to pull data based on weight staff
 
03:34:27.830 --> 03:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
and uh would it support the numbers that
 
03:34:30.189 --> 03:34:30.199 align:start position:0%
you're actually talking about the 17 18
 
03:34:33.150 --> 03:34:33.160 align:start position:0%
$20 I think years ago when cash was used
 
03:34:36.870 --> 03:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
a lot more often um I mean you think how
 
03:34:40.830 --> 03:34:40.840 align:start position:0%
many how often do folks here use a lot
 
03:34:42.349 --> 03:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
of people it's on the credit card so
 
03:34:46.229 --> 03:34:46.239 align:start position:0%
there's a record uh whereas um
 
03:34:49.510 --> 03:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
you know with cash to your you know your
 
03:34:53.349 --> 03:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
explanation of pocketing uh the money um
 
03:34:59.309 --> 03:34:59.319 align:start position:0%
I asked um one of the operators uh
 
03:35:05.429 --> 03:35:05.439 align:start position:0%
for no names on this thing um and he's
 
03:35:08.510 --> 03:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
got these are these the he's got the
 
03:35:11.910 --> 03:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
tips and the cash wage and the number of
 
03:35:16.510 --> 03:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
hours and calculated it uh the average
 
03:35:19.630 --> 03:35:19.640 align:start position:0%
uh hourly rate and the bottom you know
 
03:35:23.229 --> 03:35:23.239 align:start position:0%
you're down at like $19 an hour and the
 
03:35:27.150 --> 03:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
top is $44 an hour this is this
 
03:35:30.870 --> 03:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
is uh the cash wage and the tips
 
03:35:35.469 --> 03:35:35.479 align:start position:0%
combined over the hours they worked um
 
03:35:37.990 --> 03:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
and that's what you get divide you
 
03:35:40.189 --> 03:35:40.199 align:start position:0%
divide it up and
 
03:35:45.830 --> 03:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
so $19 to $42 an hour uh is the range
 
03:35:49.309 --> 03:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
you know depends what shift you get um
 
03:35:52.349 --> 03:35:52.359 align:start position:0%
what day you get uh whatever you know a
 
03:35:55.070 --> 03:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
bunch of variables
 
03:35:57.790 --> 03:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
but representative solvan
 
03:35:59.870 --> 03:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
sir thank
 
03:36:02.630 --> 03:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
you I don't think OLS office of
 
03:36:04.389 --> 03:36:04.399 align:start position:0%
legislative Services did us a great
 
03:36:07.790 --> 03:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
favor in the way they structured this um
 
03:36:10.870 --> 03:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
there's a huge chunk that should have a
 
03:36:12.110 --> 03:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
strike through through it so we could
 
03:36:14.429 --> 03:36:14.439 align:start position:0%
all look at it and see what fell out of
 
03:36:16.590 --> 03:36:16.600 align:start position:0%
the stat
 
03:36:19.229 --> 03:36:19.239 align:start position:0%
um and I think some of the testimony
 
03:36:23.550 --> 03:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
earlier Got U caught up in some of that
 
03:36:25.830 --> 03:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
lack of a strike through I I think there
 
03:36:29.070 --> 03:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
was testimony saying that um um as the
 
03:36:32.670 --> 03:36:32.680 align:start position:0%
minimum goes up um the 45% will be a
 
03:36:36.110 --> 03:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
bigger um chunk of money do do you
 
03:36:38.670 --> 03:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
recollect that a few years ago there was
 
03:36:40.670 --> 03:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
a Senate bill that came through that
 
03:36:44.550 --> 03:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
established that 327 would be the tipped
 
03:36:47.870 --> 03:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
wage regardless of whether the federal
 
03:36:52.429 --> 03:36:52.439 align:start position:0%
um minimum wage goes up or not so uh
 
03:36:54.630 --> 03:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
you're a couple years ago there was a
 
03:36:57.309 --> 03:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
bill that passed that said if the
 
03:36:59.830 --> 03:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
federal minimum wage goes
 
03:37:03.429 --> 03:37:03.439 align:start position:0%
up New Hampshire's cash wage for tip
 
03:37:06.150 --> 03:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
employees would remain at
 
03:37:09.030 --> 03:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
327 but that doesn't preclude the state
 
03:37:11.990 --> 03:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire at some point in time
 
03:37:16.349 --> 03:37:16.359 align:start position:0%
um setting its own uh C minimum wage and
 
03:37:18.429 --> 03:37:18.439 align:start position:0%
cash wage for tipped employees so it
 
03:37:22.269 --> 03:37:22.279 align:start position:0%
does if the feds go up um to your point
 
03:37:25.510 --> 03:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
um the 45% doesn't apply uh but I but I
 
03:37:27.990 --> 03:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
would State this another point that uh
 
03:37:30.030 --> 03:37:30.040 align:start position:0%
the restaurant operator pointed out to
 
03:37:33.590 --> 03:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
me um he increases his menu prices about
 
03:37:38.910 --> 03:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
3% a year and tipped employees get tips
 
03:37:43.550 --> 03:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
on the price of the meal so over time 3%
 
03:37:46.269 --> 03:37:46.279 align:start position:0%
a year 3% a year there's already this
 
03:37:49.870 --> 03:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
built-in factor that helps tipped
 
03:37:53.510 --> 03:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
employees wages go up because they're
 
03:37:57.110 --> 03:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
based on the price of the
 
03:38:01.590 --> 03:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
meal you just for clarification so today
 
03:38:02.870 --> 03:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
under current
 
03:38:07.070 --> 03:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
law the tip wages are indexed to the
 
03:38:11.830 --> 03:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
federal minimum wage so um at 45% well
 
03:38:14.830 --> 03:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire doesn't have a minimum
 
03:38:16.269 --> 03:38:16.279 align:start position:0%
wage la
 
03:38:19.790 --> 03:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
uh we default to the federal
 
03:38:22.670 --> 03:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
725 and the bill that we were talking
 
03:38:25.269 --> 03:38:25.279 align:start position:0%
about there's a section I wish we I know
 
03:38:27.229 --> 03:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
I wish they had the strike through like
 
03:38:30.110 --> 03:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
you were pointing out yeah so there's
 
03:38:32.790 --> 03:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
the the RSA on the minimum wage there is
 
03:38:35.189 --> 03:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
a separate section that was passed a
 
03:38:38.389 --> 03:38:38.399 align:start position:0%
couple years back that said if the
 
03:38:42.030 --> 03:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
federal minimum wage goes up new hampsh
 
03:38:42.040 --> 03:38:43.269 align:start position:0%
federal minimum wage goes up new hampsh
the

03:38:43.269 --> 03:38:43.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:38:46.389 --> 03:38:46.399 align:start position:0%
45% uh won't apply to the federal
 
03:38:50.750 --> 03:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
minimum wage that New Hampshire's
 
03:38:55.550 --> 03:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
current 45% of 725 now 327 if the feds
 
03:38:58.030 --> 03:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
go up we're going to stay at 327 that's
 
03:38:59.750 --> 03:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
what passed a couple years ago okay and
 
03:39:01.429 --> 03:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
that's what's on the books today that's
 
03:39:04.389 --> 03:39:04.399 align:start position:0%
what uh okay fa enough Mr chairman if I
 
03:39:07.229 --> 03:39:07.239 align:start position:0%
may it actually doesn't say any of that
 
03:39:08.990 --> 03:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
what you said makes a lot more sense
 
03:39:11.269 --> 03:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
yeah um but you have to read it four
 
03:39:13.429 --> 03:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
times to figure out exactly there's two
 
03:39:16.389 --> 03:39:16.399 align:start position:0%
separate paragraphs that deal with
 
03:39:20.070 --> 03:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
the 725 or the U federal minimum wage
 
03:39:22.309 --> 03:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
and then one of them says 45% the the
 
03:39:24.550 --> 03:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
second paragraph says um it stays at
 
03:39:26.510 --> 03:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
three um it doesn't say it stays it says
 
03:39:28.790 --> 03:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
simply says it is
 
03:39:32.309 --> 03:39:32.319 align:start position:0%
$327 it OS didn't do us a favor there
 
03:39:34.309 --> 03:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
either I agree with you very confusing
 
03:39:37.070 --> 03:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
when you read the statute
 
03:39:41.750 --> 03:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay uh represent avalani and labry and
 
03:39:44.910 --> 03:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
then D Sylvester I got you thank you Mr
 
03:39:47.150 --> 03:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
chairman um in in regards to what was
 
03:39:50.070 --> 03:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
just discussed um I think we uncoupled
 
03:39:53.710 --> 03:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
the 45% from the minimum wage um and we
 
03:39:55.910 --> 03:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
separated out the tip wage from the
 
03:39:57.309 --> 03:39:57.319 align:start position:0%
minimum wage in case the minimum wage
 
03:39:58.990 --> 03:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
ever went up it was always an argument
 
03:40:01.750 --> 03:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
that you know 45% of
 
03:40:05.070 --> 03:40:05.080 align:start position:0%
$15 so we uncoupled it so it maintained
 
03:40:08.150 --> 03:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
the 327 in one statute and it maintained
 
03:40:09.790 --> 03:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
our minimum wage Statute in a different
 
03:40:12.110 --> 03:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
statute explain well thank you thank you
 
03:40:12.120 --> 03:40:13.269 align:start position:0%
statute explain well thank you thank you
thank

03:40:13.269 --> 03:40:13.279 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:40:15.950 --> 03:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
you representative lry thank you Mr
 
03:40:17.830 --> 03:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you for taking my
 
03:40:20.510 --> 03:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
question sir what level of animosity
 
03:40:22.990 --> 03:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
would this bill cause between the front
 
03:40:24.630 --> 03:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
and the back of the
 
03:40:27.950 --> 03:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
house in terms of one getting a raise
 
03:40:28.870 --> 03:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
and one
 
03:40:31.790 --> 03:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
not yeah I mean I I I uh what would the
 
03:40:33.630 --> 03:40:33.640 align:start position:0%
impact be I think you probably see
 
03:40:35.550 --> 03:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
something similar to what happened in
 
03:40:38.550 --> 03:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
Maine I mean again for the folks that
 
03:40:40.550 --> 03:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
this is going to benefit have you heard
 
03:40:42.870 --> 03:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
a lot from them no because I don't I
 
03:40:45.389 --> 03:40:45.399 align:start position:0%
think this is a solution looking for a
 
03:40:48.790 --> 03:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
problem and I think what reaction could
 
03:40:50.670 --> 03:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
there be you probably have those tip
 
03:40:53.870 --> 03:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
workers coming here next year asking for
 
03:40:57.229 --> 03:40:57.239 align:start position:0%
that build this build to be
 
03:40:59.830 --> 03:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
repealed represen D
 
03:41:03.150 --> 03:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
sylvestro thank you I was just curious
 
03:41:05.389 --> 03:41:05.399 align:start position:0%
when you were throwing out the S uh
 
03:41:08.389 --> 03:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
hourly wages do they receive any
 
03:41:11.110 --> 03:41:11.120 align:start position:0%
benefits in a restaurant for those
 
03:41:15.469 --> 03:41:15.479 align:start position:0%
numbers $18 $20 $40 an hour uh it it
 
03:41:18.110 --> 03:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
varies widely um and it also depends on
 
03:41:19.630 --> 03:41:19.640 align:start position:0%
whether they're full-time or part-time
 
03:41:22.309 --> 03:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
Etc you know in many cases the $19 is a
 
03:41:24.229 --> 03:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
part-time employee um they might be
 
03:41:26.590 --> 03:41:26.600 align:start position:0%
making as much as 30 or $35 an hour
 
03:41:29.950 --> 03:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
working 30 25 or 30 hours a week so um I
 
03:41:31.790 --> 03:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
would say that it varies by company and
 
03:41:33.670 --> 03:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
it varies by their category within that
 
03:41:36.550 --> 03:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
company all right thank you followup yes
 
03:41:38.710 --> 03:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
ma'am thank you and then when you talked
 
03:41:42.030 --> 03:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
about um the pricing going up it's
 
03:41:45.269 --> 03:41:45.279 align:start position:0%
actually the consumers here that in
 
03:41:47.149 --> 03:41:47.159 align:start position:0%
increas so we're
 
03:41:50.910 --> 03:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
supplementing the wages by tipping based
 
03:41:53.110 --> 03:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
on what the the customers are paying for
 
03:41:56.149 --> 03:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah okay all right that's it thank
 
03:41:59.590 --> 03:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
you representative hasing thank you Mr
 
03:42:01.670 --> 03:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
chair and thank for taking my question
 
03:42:03.950 --> 03:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
um I have read some articles in the past
 
03:42:05.830 --> 03:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire was the number two
 
03:42:08.110 --> 03:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
leading um in the amount of tips that
 
03:42:10.070 --> 03:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
are given to a server is that actually
 
03:42:11.469 --> 03:42:11.479 align:start position:0%
true and could you validate that
 
03:42:12.710 --> 03:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
information for me or give me some of
 
03:42:15.189 --> 03:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
that I think I read the same article I
 
03:42:17.429 --> 03:42:17.439 align:start position:0%
believe it to be true um there are some
 
03:42:18.950 --> 03:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
various Publications that kind of rank
 
03:42:20.510 --> 03:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
States and I will say that the states in
 
03:42:22.990 --> 03:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
the west that have higher wages and then
 
03:42:25.590 --> 03:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
tips on top of are the lowest tippers in
 
03:42:27.670 --> 03:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
the country so I think it's fair to say
 
03:42:29.590 --> 03:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
that you know yes we have more generous
 
03:42:31.870 --> 03:42:31.880 align:start position:0%
tippers here I also think Co had a lot
 
03:42:34.070 --> 03:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
to do with that I think uh folks were
 
03:42:35.670 --> 03:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
were very sympathetic of our industry
 
03:42:37.229 --> 03:42:37.239 align:start position:0%
and we certainly appreciate that but but
 
03:42:38.590 --> 03:42:38.600 align:start position:0%
I believe those numbers to be pretty
 
03:42:38.600 --> 03:42:40.349 align:start position:0%
I believe those numbers to be pretty
accurate

03:42:40.349 --> 03:42:40.359 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
03:42:44.590 --> 03:42:44.600 align:start position:0%
yes okay representative mclair thank you
 
03:42:46.710 --> 03:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks gentlemen for uh taking
 
03:42:47.910 --> 03:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
our questions do you know what the
 
03:42:50.870 --> 03:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
percentage of the of the tips that
 
03:42:53.670 --> 03:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
servers make have to be
 
03:42:56.750 --> 03:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
claimed under IRS rules it is
 
03:43:01.389 --> 03:43:01.399 align:start position:0%
100% really yes now um having worked in
 
03:43:03.630 --> 03:43:03.640 align:start position:0%
the industry and waited a lot of tables
 
03:43:06.389 --> 03:43:06.399 align:start position:0%
and bartended Etc um there are certainly
 
03:43:08.950 --> 03:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
some cash uh tips that are forgotten in
 
03:43:11.110 --> 03:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
the general processing of your cash out
 
03:43:13.070 --> 03:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
at the end of the night but it
 
03:43:15.429 --> 03:43:15.439 align:start position:0%
technically it's 100% okay quick
 
03:43:18.670 --> 03:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
followup if I sir it and it's been a
 
03:43:20.229 --> 03:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
long time since I've waited on tables or
 
03:43:23.510 --> 03:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
bartended you know since 30 Years anyway
 
03:43:26.590 --> 03:43:26.600 align:start position:0%
um I kind of remember it being 50% but I
 
03:43:29.030 --> 03:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
mean that so they would basically take
 
03:43:32.110 --> 03:43:32.120 align:start position:0%
you know what you sold 50% of that or or
 
03:43:34.429 --> 03:43:34.439 align:start position:0%
multiply by 20% and then take 50% of
 
03:43:36.750 --> 03:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
that is that kind of the same how they
 
03:43:39.149 --> 03:43:39.159 align:start position:0%
do it or uh no because back when you and
 
03:43:41.710 --> 03:43:41.720 align:start position:0%
I waited tables um we were actually like
 
03:43:43.790 --> 03:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
physically Cashing Out nowadays it's all
 
03:43:45.870 --> 03:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
processed to the POS system
 
03:43:48.830 --> 03:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
um but what I will say is that uh what I
 
03:43:50.630 --> 03:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
think you're referencing is the IRS has
 
03:43:52.790 --> 03:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
kind of A Safe Harbor and the business
 
03:43:54.349 --> 03:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
can have an agreement with the IRS that
 
03:43:56.990 --> 03:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
they will declare no less than 75% of
 
03:43:59.269 --> 03:43:59.279 align:start position:0%
the you know credit card tips Etc in
 
03:44:01.469 --> 03:44:01.479 align:start position:0%
order to be essentially
 
03:44:04.590 --> 03:44:04.600 align:start position:0%
um exempt from be receiving an audit um
 
03:44:06.189 --> 03:44:06.199 align:start position:0%
and there are mechanisms that they have
 
03:44:07.950 --> 03:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
to take that the IRS makes them follow
 
03:44:10.590 --> 03:44:10.600 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to to do that but
 
03:44:12.790 --> 03:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
ultimately the IRS standard and the
 
03:44:14.630 --> 03:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
business owner you know Advocates to
 
03:44:16.670 --> 03:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
their employ emplo you must claim 100%
 
03:44:17.910 --> 03:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
of your tips because ultimately it's
 
03:44:20.550 --> 03:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
income and is therefore taxable one more
 
03:44:23.309 --> 03:44:23.319 align:start position:0%
quick pH yes sir so did did they do that
 
03:44:27.750 --> 03:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
by your amount of sales
 
03:44:31.189 --> 03:44:31.199 align:start position:0%
and yeah I guess right so I guess did
 
03:44:33.830 --> 03:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
they claim like say okay the average is
 
03:44:37.309 --> 03:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
tip is 20% your sales were $300 tonight
 
03:44:40.590 --> 03:44:40.600 align:start position:0%
so you made no so it again in the age of
 
03:44:42.030 --> 03:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
credit cards almost everything is credit
 
03:44:44.790 --> 03:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
cards now um and they see it they know
 
03:44:46.469 --> 03:44:46.479 align:start position:0%
they they know exactly what it is so if
 
03:44:48.030 --> 03:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
you got a really great tip over here and
 
03:44:49.710 --> 03:44:49.720 align:start position:0%
a not so great tip over there at the end
 
03:44:51.910 --> 03:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
of the day the number is the number um
 
03:44:53.950 --> 03:44:53.960 align:start position:0%
and usually what the IRS and the
 
03:44:55.510 --> 03:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
business owner will look at is that
 
03:44:57.870 --> 03:44:57.880 align:start position:0%
provided you're not less than 75 or 80%
 
03:44:59.389 --> 03:44:59.399 align:start position:0%
of what that total credit card tip
 
03:45:01.229 --> 03:45:01.239 align:start position:0%
number is you're probably okay that's
 
03:45:03.510 --> 03:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
kind of how it works all right thank you
 
03:45:05.269 --> 03:45:05.279 align:start position:0%
good question represent d
 
03:45:08.349 --> 03:45:08.359 align:start position:0%
sylvestro one last one I just want to
 
03:45:10.670 --> 03:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
know if a any one of us or are in a
 
03:45:13.269 --> 03:45:13.279 align:start position:0%
restaurant to you to the question about
 
03:45:16.149 --> 03:45:16.159 align:start position:0%
the Tipping and it's cash I pay the
 
03:45:18.950 --> 03:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
credit card for the bill can I tell that
 
03:45:21.269 --> 03:45:21.279 align:start position:0%
server to pocket them I don't know if we
 
03:45:23.110 --> 03:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
can say that on can I tell that server
 
03:45:26.149 --> 03:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
to uh I want that specifically for them
 
03:45:27.790 --> 03:45:27.800 align:start position:0%
in their pocket so you're you're saying
 
03:45:29.710 --> 03:45:29.720 align:start position:0%
you're putting the the the dinner bill
 
03:45:32.030 --> 03:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
on a credit card and cash is tip you
 
03:45:33.710 --> 03:45:33.720 align:start position:0%
don't have to tell
 
03:45:36.950 --> 03:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
them kind of I wasn't sure if they had
 
03:45:38.550 --> 03:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
to say
 
03:45:42.830 --> 03:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
it all right see one more question
 
03:45:45.510 --> 03:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
representa avalani thank you Mr chairman
 
03:45:49.309 --> 03:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
um we are required to withhold um tips
 
03:45:51.349 --> 03:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
and claim tips uh could you tell us to
 
03:45:53.429 --> 03:45:53.439 align:start position:0%
structure how that is the employer pays
 
03:45:55.550 --> 03:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
half the employee pays half but the
 
03:45:57.269 --> 03:45:57.279 align:start position:0%
employee also has the ability to claim
 
03:45:58.630 --> 03:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
above and beyond and who would be
 
03:46:00.790 --> 03:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
03:46:03.469 --> 03:46:03.479 align:start position:0%
that wait can you ask that question
 
03:46:05.790 --> 03:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
again loed question we are responsible
 
03:46:09.389 --> 03:46:09.399 align:start position:0%
for paying half of the uh claim tips and
 
03:46:11.830 --> 03:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
the employee is able to claim above and
 
03:46:15.189 --> 03:46:15.199 align:start position:0%
beyond what we've claimed given our
 
03:46:17.870 --> 03:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
basis which would come down to cash tips
 
03:46:19.229 --> 03:46:19.239 align:start position:0%
you're referring to the tip credit
 
03:46:19.239 --> 03:46:20.469 align:start position:0%
you're referring to the tip credit
correct

03:46:20.469 --> 03:46:20.479 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:46:23.429 --> 03:46:23.439 align:start position:0%
okay you really want to go down this
 
03:46:27.990 --> 03:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
road so so the what's that brief oh I
 
03:46:29.670 --> 03:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's brief so the tip
 
03:46:31.870 --> 03:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
credit essentially is how the business
 
03:46:34.469 --> 03:46:34.479 align:start position:0%
owner actually gets to the 327 right so
 
03:46:36.950 --> 03:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
essentially they have to prove to the
 
03:46:38.670 --> 03:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor the IRS and others
 
03:46:40.590 --> 03:46:40.600 align:start position:0%
that they have that the employee has
 
03:46:42.269 --> 03:46:42.279 align:start position:0%
collected enough tips to be well over
 
03:46:45.550 --> 03:46:45.560 align:start position:0%
the 725 and then there's a credit of $5
 
03:46:48.070 --> 03:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
and whatever the number is $5 in change
 
03:46:49.710 --> 03:46:49.720 align:start position:0%
that is then essentially deducted from
 
03:46:51.950 --> 03:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
their hourly wage requirement so
 
03:46:53.429 --> 03:46:53.439 align:start position:0%
essentially you're technically paying
 
03:46:55.550 --> 03:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
725 but you're taking it back as a
 
03:46:57.269 --> 03:46:57.279 align:start position:0%
credit because they made enough tips to
 
03:46:59.269 --> 03:46:59.279 align:start position:0%
then receive the credit so it's it's
 
03:47:01.309 --> 03:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
almost like a you back into the number
 
03:47:02.790 --> 03:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
if that's a fair characterization I
 
03:47:04.110 --> 03:47:04.120 align:start position:0%
don't know how to better explain it
 
03:47:08.149 --> 03:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:11.990 --> 03:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
slideshows all right representative Hall
 
03:47:14.950 --> 03:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
how many what percentage of employees
 
03:47:17.710 --> 03:47:17.720 align:start position:0%
fall into that category where they would
 
03:47:21.070 --> 03:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:23.389 --> 03:47:23.399 align:start position:0%
725 honestly Henry asked me that
 
03:47:26.750 --> 03:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
question a minute ago I am my 16 years
 
03:47:29.309 --> 03:47:29.319 align:start position:0%
here and you know 20 years in the
 
03:47:31.149 --> 03:47:31.159 align:start position:0%
industry I have never heard of a person
 
03:47:32.750 --> 03:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
actually have to be reimbursed for
 
03:47:34.950 --> 03:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
making not making minimum wage on tips
 
03:47:39.550 --> 03:47:39.560 align:start position:0%
not once follow so in other words this
 
03:47:41.389 --> 03:47:41.399 align:start position:0%
bill is not going to make the difference
 
03:47:44.990 --> 03:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
between somebody getting to 725 or not
 
03:47:47.630 --> 03:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
nope no thank

03:48:41.910 --> 03:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
something that the previous testimony
 
03:48:44.429 --> 03:48:44.439 align:start position:0%
said um servers do actually have to tip
 
03:48:46.830 --> 03:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
out their busers um at least at Olive
 
03:48:48.309 --> 03:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
Garden the restaurant that I work at the
 
03:48:50.910 --> 03:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
busers will make a uh uh the minimum
 
03:48:53.990 --> 03:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
wage seven what is it 725 725 the
 
03:48:55.670 --> 03:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
servers will make the sub minimum wage
 
03:48:57.110 --> 03:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
and they will have to tip out their
 
03:48:59.670 --> 03:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
busers whereas people in in the actual
 
03:49:01.710 --> 03:49:01.720 align:start position:0%
back of the house like the uh the cooks
 
03:49:04.550 --> 03:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
will make about like 17 to 20 and
 
03:49:07.469 --> 03:49:07.479 align:start position:0%
dishwashers will make about 14 to 15 so
 
03:49:08.309 --> 03:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure that
 
03:49:11.349 --> 03:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
distinction is clear um at Olive Garden
 
03:49:13.510 --> 03:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
I never heard that it was like illegal
 
03:49:15.429 --> 03:49:15.439 align:start position:0%
or wrong that's just what
 
03:49:18.510 --> 03:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
was done um I also want to say that no
 
03:49:20.870 --> 03:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
27-year-old mom trying to feed her kids
 
03:49:23.550 --> 03:49:23.560 align:start position:0%
will be mad if you give her a raise no
 
03:49:25.750 --> 03:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
one is going to be up in arms about that
 
03:49:27.790 --> 03:49:27.800 align:start position:0%
people deserve to be making a minimum
 
03:49:30.229 --> 03:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
wage I've seen people I was a Hostess so
 
03:49:34.349 --> 03:49:34.359 align:start position:0%
I made uh $14 an hour but people deserve
 
03:49:37.030 --> 03:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
to be making a livable wage and 725 is
 
03:49:38.910 --> 03:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
an livable wage we all know that I mean
 
03:49:40.510 --> 03:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sure everyone in this room makes a
 
03:49:42.670 --> 03:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
lot more than that um I make a salary
 
03:49:45.070 --> 03:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
position and I'm still struggling um and
 
03:49:46.630 --> 03:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
then with my experience working at Mr
 
03:49:48.469 --> 03:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
Max where we didn't earn tips we all
 
03:49:52.830 --> 03:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
made like 12 to $14 an hour people still
 
03:49:55.950 --> 03:49:55.960 align:start position:0%
bought the food Mr Max the prices were
 
03:49:57.870 --> 03:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
expensive but I can tell you from
 
03:49:59.830 --> 03:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
working you know on a Saturday night
 
03:50:01.189 --> 03:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
that people are definitely still willing
 
03:50:02.870 --> 03:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
to pay whatever the price is for that
 
03:50:06.149 --> 03:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
food and we all made $14 an hour and we
 
03:50:10.110 --> 03:50:10.120 align:start position:0%
still got tips um there were shared tips
 
03:50:12.710 --> 03:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
cuz it was you know but we uh we served
 
03:50:16.630 --> 03:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
them we bust them and we're all happy um
 
03:50:18.349 --> 03:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
this is just my real experience and I
 
03:50:20.429 --> 03:50:20.439 align:start position:0%
want you to know that I wasn't working
 
03:50:22.269 --> 03:50:22.279 align:start position:0%
in the restaurants 30 years ago I worked
 
03:50:25.550 --> 03:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
there last year um so yeah this is this
 
03:50:27.189 --> 03:50:27.199 align:start position:0%
is what real life looks like that's all
 
03:50:28.910 --> 03:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
I have to say thank you no thank you for
 
03:50:30.309 --> 03:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
your your testimony I appreciate you
 
03:50:33.070 --> 03:50:33.080 align:start position:0%
coming in are there any questions
 
03:50:35.189 --> 03:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
representative labry thank you Mr chair
 
03:50:37.590 --> 03:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question do
 
03:50:39.590 --> 03:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
you believe that if you were to give the
 
03:50:42.830 --> 03:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
servers at where you work a $4 raise to
 
03:50:45.149 --> 03:50:45.159 align:start position:0%
to make minimum wage ballpark
 
03:50:46.510 --> 03:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
do you believe that the rest of the
 
03:50:48.269 --> 03:50:48.279 align:start position:0%
folks that work in that same restaurant
 
03:50:50.229 --> 03:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
in the back of the house the dishwashers
 
03:50:52.389 --> 03:50:52.399 align:start position:0%
the management do you believe that they
 
03:50:55.670 --> 03:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
would also expect a $4 raise no because
 
03:50:57.269 --> 03:50:57.279 align:start position:0%
they're already making more they're
 
03:50:59.070 --> 03:50:59.080 align:start position:0%
still making more the people in in the
 
03:51:00.269 --> 03:51:00.279 align:start position:0%
back of the house like they said they're
 
03:51:02.510 --> 03:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
making 15 the minimum wage everywhere
 
03:51:05.510 --> 03:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
else they're not making 725 um so maybe
 
03:51:08.229 --> 03:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
at certain restaurants but I can also
 
03:51:09.309 --> 03:51:09.319 align:start position:0%
like most people who work at a
 
03:51:11.189 --> 03:51:11.199 align:start position:0%
restaurant know the experience of being
 
03:51:13.790 --> 03:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
a server and it's hard work being yelled
 
03:51:16.189 --> 03:51:16.199 align:start position:0%
at being being disrespected being spat
 
03:51:18.830 --> 03:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
at you know um so no I don't I don't
 
03:51:21.670 --> 03:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
think so but who knows follow up for
 
03:51:23.550 --> 03:51:23.560 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you Mr chair the reason
 
03:51:25.149 --> 03:51:25.159 align:start position:0%
I would ask that is is I own several
 
03:51:26.590 --> 03:51:26.600 align:start position:0%
businesses and and I know that when I
 
03:51:28.070 --> 03:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
pay one employee a little bit more than
 
03:51:29.790 --> 03:51:29.800 align:start position:0%
the next it goes through the company
 
03:51:32.429 --> 03:51:32.439 align:start position:0%
like wildfire and everybody has to get a
 
03:51:35.030 --> 03:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
raise if I pay one person something so
 
03:51:36.389 --> 03:51:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh it was just a consideration I didn't
 
03:51:37.790 --> 03:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
know I'm out of the restaurant industry
 
03:51:39.110 --> 03:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
for a while and I didn't know if that it
 
03:51:40.750 --> 03:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
might play the same way so you've
 
03:51:42.309 --> 03:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
answered it I think in this circumstance
 
03:51:43.830 --> 03:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
it would be slightly different because
 
03:51:47.269 --> 03:51:47.279 align:start position:0%
this would be a law that would change uh
 
03:51:51.229 --> 03:51:51.239 align:start position:0%
the the uh pay not uh the manager
 
03:51:53.910 --> 03:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
deciding that someone deserves more so
 
03:51:56.429 --> 03:51:56.439 align:start position:0%
no I don't think so good point thank you
 
03:51:59.189 --> 03:51:59.199 align:start position:0%
okay and representa K thank you Mr chair
 
03:52:01.269 --> 03:52:01.279 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question am
 
03:52:02.750 --> 03:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
I correct in understanding that the
 
03:52:04.269 --> 03:52:04.279 align:start position:0%
people working in the back of the house
 
03:52:05.910 --> 03:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
who are already making more than seven
 
03:52:08.670 --> 03:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
in a quarter are paid that same wage
 
03:52:10.990 --> 03:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
regardless of their customers in the in
 
03:52:13.710 --> 03:52:13.720 align:start position:0%
the front of the house or if it's snowed
 
03:52:16.950 --> 03:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
or any other negative uh economic that
 
03:52:20.070 --> 03:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
might slow down the the the serving yeah
 
03:52:21.950 --> 03:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's their wage they make
 
03:52:25.229 --> 03:52:25.239 align:start position:0%
$15 an hour no matter who's there follow
 
03:52:29.870 --> 03:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
up yes sir um thank you again and is it
 
03:52:32.510 --> 03:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
also correct that in most other
 
03:52:34.429 --> 03:52:34.439 align:start position:0%
businesses other than the restaurant
 
03:52:37.389 --> 03:52:37.399 align:start position:0%
trade you pay your wages you pay
 
03:52:39.229 --> 03:52:39.239 align:start position:0%
everyone the same wage based on their
 
03:52:41.590 --> 03:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
skill or what they do and you don't
 
03:52:44.309 --> 03:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
expect the customer to directly pay part
 
03:52:47.110 --> 03:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
of the wage for instance if I had a
 
03:52:50.149 --> 03:52:50.159 align:start position:0%
factory I wouldn't think my the end user
 
03:52:52.469 --> 03:52:52.479 align:start position:0%
who buys the widget is going to pay
 
03:52:54.870 --> 03:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
directly my uh factory
 
03:52:57.349 --> 03:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
worker um I can't answer that question I
 
03:52:59.389 --> 03:52:59.399 align:start position:0%
don't own any businesses and I don't pay
 
03:53:01.830 --> 03:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
people so I'm I'm not sure I quite
 
03:53:04.229 --> 03:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
understand the question I would just
 
03:53:06.229 --> 03:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
follow for followup yes sir I would just
 
03:53:08.710 --> 03:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
trying to explain the difference between
 
03:53:12.510 --> 03:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
uh a tipped worker being paid the where
 
03:53:15.269 --> 03:53:15.279 align:start position:0%
the customer is expected to pay the wage
 
03:53:17.910 --> 03:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
is probably more than half the wages and
 
03:53:20.590 --> 03:53:20.600 align:start position:0%
that's unheard of in other
 
03:53:23.149 --> 03:53:23.159 align:start position:0%
employment okay yeah I yeah I definitely
 
03:53:24.870 --> 03:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
understand yeah another point I wanted
 
03:53:26.830 --> 03:53:26.840 align:start position:0%
to raise is the idea that this is the
 
03:53:30.630 --> 03:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
way it's always been why have we ever
 
03:53:33.189 --> 03:53:33.199 align:start position:0%
thought about that why when no under
 
03:53:35.590 --> 03:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
other industry pays their their workers
 
03:53:38.670 --> 03:53:38.680 align:start position:0%
like that why do we do this does that
 
03:53:41.389 --> 03:53:41.399 align:start position:0%
kind of answer a little bit I'm thank
 
03:53:44.790 --> 03:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
03:53:47.110 --> 03:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
representative Mackenzie thank you Mr
 
03:53:50.189 --> 03:53:50.199 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for appearing today
 
03:53:52.550 --> 03:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
when I'm trying to uh nail down and
 
03:53:54.950 --> 03:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
you're an experienced weight staff we've
 
03:53:56.750 --> 03:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
heard all kinds of numbers about what
 
03:54:00.710 --> 03:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
you make um now you worked at Olive Gard
 
03:54:03.990 --> 03:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
yes that's a pretty busy restaurant yes
 
03:54:08.870 --> 03:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
um the state uh lists the average wage
 
03:54:12.670 --> 03:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
uh at $20 an hour for weight staff it's
 
03:54:14.950 --> 03:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
the average wage the lowest age that
 
03:54:19.469 --> 03:54:19.479 align:start position:0%
they list in the Unemployment uh uh
 
03:54:21.389 --> 03:54:21.399 align:start position:0%
figures is is
 
03:54:24.110 --> 03:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
1144 which number were you closer
 
03:54:27.149 --> 03:54:27.159 align:start position:0%
to um so again I was a hostess I wasn't
 
03:54:28.389 --> 03:54:28.399 align:start position:0%
specifically a weight staff so I was
 
03:54:32.110 --> 03:54:32.120 align:start position:0%
still paid hourly but I my friends were
 
03:54:37.189 --> 03:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
not making $27 an hour I mean maybe if
 
03:54:38.790 --> 03:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
you're you know more if you're an
 
03:54:41.830 --> 03:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
experienced server you might be making
 
03:54:45.189 --> 03:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
20 an hour but I really doubt it most
 
03:54:47.149 --> 03:54:47.159 align:start position:0%
people my age would probably be making
 
03:54:51.389 --> 03:54:51.399 align:start position:0%
with their tips like 15 uh to 19 an hour
 
03:54:54.790 --> 03:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
but I haven't done the math so the would
 
03:54:56.429 --> 03:54:56.439 align:start position:0%
you like a followup yeah real quick
 
03:55:00.630 --> 03:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely so the the range then uh is
 
03:55:03.870 --> 03:55:03.880 align:start position:0%
from 11 to 20 that's somewhere where
 
03:55:06.110 --> 03:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
where weight staff is dropping in that's
 
03:55:08.389 --> 03:55:08.399 align:start position:0%
what I would assume yes all right thank
 
03:55:11.309 --> 03:55:11.319 align:start position:0%
you thank for all right thank you ma'am
 
03:55:13.030 --> 03:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate you coming in and
 
03:55:16.670 --> 03:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:19.030 --> 03:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no further questions
 
03:55:23.229 --> 03:55:23.239 align:start position:0%
and no pin cards I Clos the hearing on
 
03:55:23.239 --> 03:55:25.750 align:start position:0%
and no pin cards I Clos the hearing on
HP

03:55:25.750 --> 03:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
HP
 
03:55:28.750 --> 03:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
442 we've got about five minutes so what
 
03:55:31.670 --> 03:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
I wanted to do if you can indulge me
 
03:55:34.309 --> 03:55:34.319 align:start position:0%

of this bill um and I'm here to
 
04:04:09.550 --> 04:04:09.560 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill 726 which will
 
04:04:11.110 --> 04:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
raise the state's minimum wage and
 
04:04:14.990 --> 04:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
increments to $15 an hour by by
 
04:04:17.429 --> 04:04:17.439 align:start position:0%
2028 uh this is a modest bill that
 
04:04:20.070 --> 04:04:20.080 align:start position:0%
increases the wage to $10 in September
 
04:04:26.429 --> 04:04:26.439 align:start position:0%
1250 in 2026 14 in 2027 and 15 in 2028
 
04:04:28.910 --> 04:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
it also sets the tipped wage at half of
 
04:04:31.590 --> 04:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage the last time New
 
04:04:33.429 --> 04:04:33.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire raised the minimum wage John

Lynch was governor in 2008 the average
 
04:04:39.670 --> 04:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
rent in the state for two-bedroom
 
04:04:43.990 --> 04:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
apartment was $1,000 $1,044
 
04:04:46.030 --> 04:04:46.040 align:start position:0%
and today a two-bedroom apartment rents
 
04:04:46.040 --> 04:04:47.110 align:start position:0%
and today a two-bedroom apartment rents
for

04:04:49.510 --> 04:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
$1,800 times have changed and things
 
04:04:51.670 --> 04:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
have gotten a lot more expensive and
 
04:04:54.070 --> 04:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
most states around us have responded by
 
04:04:56.070 --> 04:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
raising their minimum wage the lowest
 
04:04:58.110 --> 04:04:58.120 align:start position:0%
minimum wage in New England is Vermont
 
04:04:58.120 --> 04:04:59.229 align:start position:0%

04:04:59.229 --> 04:04:59.239 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:05:02.229 --> 04:05:02.239 align:start position:0%
$141 Maine is at
 
04:05:04.670 --> 04:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
$14.65 Massachusetts and Rhode Island
 
04:05:07.070 --> 04:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
are at 15 and Connecticut's minimum wage
 
04:05:09.429 --> 04:05:09.439 align:start position:0%
is set at
 
04:05:11.990 --> 04:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
$16.25 the Bureau of Labor Statistics
 
04:05:13.870 --> 04:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
reports that about 5,000 people people
 
04:05:16.830 --> 04:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
in the state make 725 or less the
 
04:05:19.510 --> 04:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
economic policy in um Institute
 
04:05:22.429 --> 04:05:22.439 align:start position:0%
estimates that there are about uh 61,000
 
04:05:24.950 --> 04:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
workers in the state who make $15 or
 
04:05:27.990 --> 04:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
less who will benefit from this increase
 
04:05:30.710 --> 04:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
I've given you a chart from um the
 
04:05:34.309 --> 04:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
economic labor market whatever it is
 
04:05:37.269 --> 04:05:37.279 align:start position:0%
elmi that shows that some of the occupa
 
04:05:38.910 --> 04:05:38.920 align:start position:0%
some that show some of the occupations
 
04:05:41.750 --> 04:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
that have starting wages below $15 they
 
04:05:43.870 --> 04:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
are mostly people working in Food
 
04:05:45.910 --> 04:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
Service retail child care and home
 
04:05:48.750 --> 04:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
health aids these folks are an important
 
04:05:50.309 --> 04:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
to the economy of the state and the
 
04:05:52.469 --> 04:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
quality of life for all granted Staters
 
04:05:54.149 --> 04:05:54.159 align:start position:0%
and I believe that it is important for
 
04:05:55.910 --> 04:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
us as New Hampshire's elected government
 
04:05:57.750 --> 04:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate to the working people of
 
04:06:00.349 --> 04:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
our state that they are valued and that
 
04:06:02.389 --> 04:06:02.399 align:start position:0%
this is and that is why I would urge you
 
04:06:04.550 --> 04:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
to send this to the house floor with an
 
04:06:06.990 --> 04:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
autopass recommendation and I will take
 
04:06:09.269 --> 04:06:09.279 align:start position:0%
any questions that you have thank you
 
04:06:11.030 --> 04:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
ma'am I appreciate your testimony thank
 
04:06:14.469 --> 04:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
you representative ly
 
04:06:15.910 --> 04:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you again
 
04:06:18.030 --> 04:06:18.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question could you tell me
 
04:06:21.590 --> 04:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
what industry predominantly holds the
 
04:06:23.670 --> 04:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
seven and a quarter workers where would
 
04:06:26.110 --> 04:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
they work what industry is that I can't
 
04:06:28.429 --> 04:06:28.439 align:start position:0%
tell you because that information is not
 
04:06:32.510 --> 04:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
available but as I said earlier um um
 
04:06:34.590 --> 04:06:34.600 align:start position:0%
agricultural workers are exempt from the
 
04:06:37.590 --> 04:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
minimum wage um people working in
 
04:06:39.510 --> 04:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
sheltered workshops who have
 
04:06:42.870 --> 04:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities are the are required to be
 
04:06:47.790 --> 04:06:47.800 align:start position:0%
paid 7 25 an hour um and um on on those
 
04:06:51.229 --> 04:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
occasions when um tipped workers do not
 
04:06:54.750 --> 04:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
make um the minimum wage then they are
 
04:06:58.149 --> 04:06:58.159 align:start position:0%
technically working for 725 an hour um I
 
04:07:00.790 --> 04:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
would love to know that information um
 
04:07:03.269 --> 04:07:03.279 align:start position:0%
perhaps we um I can find out from the
 
04:07:06.229 --> 04:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor or perhaps from the
 
04:07:08.950 --> 04:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
um um uh Department of Employment
 
04:07:10.790 --> 04:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
Security but I have not been able to
 
04:07:12.469 --> 04:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
find that information this comes from
 
04:07:15.070 --> 04:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Labor for statistics okay
 
04:07:17.670 --> 04:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you representative
 
04:07:20.670 --> 04:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
bshar uh thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:07:22.750 --> 04:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
04:07:25.469 --> 04:07:25.479 align:start position:0%
question now wages have gone up in New
 
04:07:28.389 --> 04:07:28.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire without a minimum wage so why
 
04:07:32.269 --> 04:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
is it necessary can't we just rely on
 
04:07:33.349 --> 04:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
the free
 
04:07:35.670 --> 04:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
market that's a very good question thank
 
04:07:38.910 --> 04:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
you for asking that um yes wages have
 
04:07:40.790 --> 04:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
gone up significantly in the state of
 
04:07:42.269 --> 04:07:42.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but it didn't happen
 
04:07:45.269 --> 04:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
organically not not not in my estimation
 
04:07:48.109 --> 04:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
for example the fight for 15 campaign
 
04:07:51.189 --> 04:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
was a large national campaign that
 
04:07:53.710 --> 04:07:53.720 align:start position:0%
involved millions of people who
 
04:07:57.550 --> 04:07:57.560 align:start position:0%
advocated for $15 minimum wage um every
 
04:07:59.670 --> 04:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
one of the states surrounding us has a
 
04:08:02.790 --> 04:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
much higher minimum wage and um as you
 
04:08:04.830 --> 04:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
know we're a physically very small state
 
04:08:07.229 --> 04:08:07.239 align:start position:0%
and I would say that 80 to 90% of our
 
04:08:09.910 --> 04:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
Workforce can drive an hour in any
 
04:08:12.630 --> 04:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
direction and be guaranteed uh minimum
 
04:08:15.710 --> 04:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
wage of 14 or $15 an hour just by
 
04:08:18.790 --> 04:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
crossing the border into another
 
04:08:21.950 --> 04:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
state thank you for a followup
 
04:08:25.149 --> 04:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
sir wouldn't a higher minimum wage
 
04:08:27.309 --> 04:08:27.319 align:start position:0%
reduce Reliance on public
 
04:08:30.830 --> 04:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
assistance ultimately saving taxpayer
 
04:08:34.189 --> 04:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
dollars that yes people who are because
 
04:08:36.149 --> 04:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
things are so expensive particularly
 
04:08:39.630 --> 04:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
housing is ridiculously expensive people
 
04:08:43.630 --> 04:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
um are paying um more than 30 to 50% %
 
04:08:45.189 --> 04:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
of their income for their housing so
 
04:08:47.149 --> 04:08:47.159 align:start position:0%
they need to rely on things like food
 
04:08:50.630 --> 04:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
stamps um and um housing vouchers and
 
04:08:52.830 --> 04:08:52.840 align:start position:0%
other things like that so if people were
 
04:08:55.389 --> 04:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
making a living wage which is around
 
04:08:58.389 --> 04:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
according to the um MIT living wage
 
04:09:00.389 --> 04:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
calculator single person would need to
 
04:09:00.399 --> 04:09:01.550 align:start position:0%
calculator single person would need to
make

04:09:01.550 --> 04:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
make
 
04:09:04.389 --> 04:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
$23.58 an hour to be able to pay for
 
04:09:09.030 --> 04:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
housing food and incidentals um and um
 
04:09:11.189 --> 04:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
so yeah though so people who are making
 
04:09:13.389 --> 04:09:13.399 align:start position:0%
less than that at places like Walmart or
 
04:09:18.269 --> 04:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
or wherever um are receiving um those
 
04:09:19.710 --> 04:09:19.720 align:start position:0%
companies are receiving corporate
 
04:09:22.870 --> 04:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
welfare because their profit margins are
 
04:09:24.550 --> 04:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
higher because they're paying so little
 
04:09:27.510 --> 04:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
at the dollar store um but those people
 
04:09:31.229 --> 04:09:31.239 align:start position:0%
are forced to um use food stamps and um
 
04:09:35.109 --> 04:09:35.119 align:start position:0%
Avail themselves of other um Public
 
04:09:38.670 --> 04:09:38.680 align:start position:0%
Assistance okay thank you representative
 
04:09:42.109 --> 04:09:42.119 align:start position:0%
Dro I just want to follow that up I I've
 
04:09:43.710 --> 04:09:43.720 align:start position:0%
had a few examples of employ employees
 
04:09:46.309 --> 04:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
over the years who have had public
 
04:09:48.309 --> 04:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
assistance and uh so they can only work
 
04:09:50.830 --> 04:09:50.840 align:start position:0%
a day or two a week otherwise they lose
 
04:09:53.109 --> 04:09:53.119 align:start position:0%
assistance so and I've even talked to
 
04:09:54.189 --> 04:09:54.199 align:start position:0%
them and said well if you work all five
 
04:09:55.750 --> 04:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
days you actually make more money you
 
04:09:57.710 --> 04:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
just won't get the assistance and they
 
04:09:58.830 --> 04:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
said no no I'm just going to stay with
 
04:10:00.830 --> 04:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
my two days a week so can you speak to
 
04:10:03.710 --> 04:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
that because in my mind it doesn't
 
04:10:05.429 --> 04:10:05.439 align:start position:0%
matter how much money you make if they
 
04:10:07.109 --> 04:10:07.119 align:start position:0%
know that they can only make x amount
 
04:10:08.389 --> 04:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
they'll just work under that so even if
 
04:10:09.870 --> 04:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
you raise a minimum wage does that
 
04:10:14.830 --> 04:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:16.469 --> 04:10:16.479 align:start position:0%
um yeah well I think what you're talking
 
04:10:19.389 --> 04:10:19.399 align:start position:0%
about is the cliff um so that if people
 
04:10:20.990 --> 04:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
make more than a certain amount of money
 
04:10:23.910 --> 04:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
they lose benefits so yeah that that
 
04:10:25.630 --> 04:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
that's definitely something that's out
 
04:10:28.349 --> 04:10:28.359 align:start position:0%
there so I think people uh talk about
 
04:10:30.469 --> 04:10:30.479 align:start position:0%
raging that raising the threshold for
 
04:10:33.269 --> 04:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
benefits but if a person is making
 
04:10:35.070 --> 04:10:35.080 align:start position:0%
enough money so that they can fulfill
 
04:10:37.910 --> 04:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
all of their needs then they don't need
 
04:10:39.469 --> 04:10:39.479 align:start position:0%
they don't need the food stamps they
 
04:10:43.510 --> 04:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
don't need the other stuff um so I mean
 
04:10:46.870 --> 04:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
there are um when I looked at the elmi
 
04:10:49.830 --> 04:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
report I was really astounded by the
 
04:10:52.109 --> 04:10:52.119 align:start position:0%
starting wages that are well below a
 
04:10:54.070 --> 04:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
living wage and how many people and how
 
04:10:56.870 --> 04:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
many different um occupations are making
 
04:11:00.750 --> 04:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
less than $20 an hour um you know I I
 
04:11:02.229 --> 04:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
put together a list of some of the
 
04:11:03.469 --> 04:11:03.479 align:start position:0%
lowest paid
 
04:11:06.309 --> 04:11:06.319 align:start position:0%
occupations um I use median wage instead
 
04:11:08.670 --> 04:11:08.680 align:start position:0%
of um minimum wage you know that means
 
04:11:10.630 --> 04:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
that half of the the people in those
 
04:11:13.790 --> 04:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
occupations are making less than that
 
04:11:17.550 --> 04:11:17.560 align:start position:0%
um you know so Hostess like Mckenzie was
 
04:11:19.189 --> 04:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
telling us about earlier the starting
 
04:11:21.670 --> 04:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
wage for that is 1171 in the median
 
04:11:21.680 --> 04:11:23.510 align:start position:0%
wage for that is 1171 in the median
wages

04:11:23.510 --> 04:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
wages
 
04:11:26.510 --> 04:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
1533 child care workers starting wages
 
04:11:26.520 --> 04:11:27.309 align:start position:0%
1533 child care workers starting wages
are

04:11:27.309 --> 04:11:27.319 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:11:31.189 --> 04:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
$127 an hour um fast food counter
 
04:11:35.950 --> 04:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
workers $12 u18 an hour um
 
04:11:40.429 --> 04:11:40.439 align:start position:0%
cashiers um um home health aids $14.30
 
04:11:42.990 --> 04:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
an hour that's well below what um people
 
04:11:45.750 --> 04:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
need need to actually
 
04:11:49.389 --> 04:11:49.399 align:start position:0%
um pay for their basic needs you know
 
04:11:53.750 --> 04:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
food shelter and incidentals so you know
 
04:11:57.429 --> 04:11:57.439 align:start position:0%
I um and and let's face it going from
 
04:12:00.590 --> 04:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
7:25 all the way up to to 15 is going to
 
04:12:02.750 --> 04:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
make a big difference but yeah I I know
 
04:12:04.830 --> 04:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
that there are people like that you know
 
04:12:08.710 --> 04:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
I have um yesterday I was in the grocery
 
04:12:10.510 --> 04:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
store and one of my favorite cashiers I
 
04:12:14.590 --> 04:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
think she must be close to 80 um and um
 
04:12:16.349 --> 04:12:16.359 align:start position:0%
I'm sure she's on Social Security and
 
04:12:18.630 --> 04:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
she seems to be there a lot but I I
 
04:12:19.990 --> 04:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
can't you know I don't know how many
 
04:12:22.309 --> 04:12:22.319 align:start position:0%
hours she's allowed to work there and
 
04:12:24.070 --> 04:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
and still keep her social security
 
04:12:26.349 --> 04:12:26.359 align:start position:0%
payments but that's not enough for her
 
04:12:30.189 --> 04:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
to to to um pay for her daily needs so
 
04:12:31.670 --> 04:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
she needs to
 
04:12:35.229 --> 04:12:35.239 align:start position:0%
work I think she enjoys it but you know
 
04:12:35.239 --> 04:12:36.349 align:start position:0%
work I think she enjoys it but you know
represent

04:12:36.349 --> 04:12:36.359 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:12:39.189 --> 04:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
Flanigan thank you Mr chairman and uh
 
04:12:41.590 --> 04:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question sure so
 
04:12:43.309 --> 04:12:43.319 align:start position:0%
is this bill dealing with the minimum
 
04:12:46.950 --> 04:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
wage or is this bill dealing with uh
 
04:12:46.960 --> 04:12:48.070 align:start position:0%
wage or is this bill dealing with uh
livable

04:12:48.070 --> 04:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
livable
 
04:12:51.870 --> 04:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
wage um this is a a minimum wage bill um
 
04:12:53.710 --> 04:12:53.720 align:start position:0%
I would love to see a working uh you
 
04:12:56.830 --> 04:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
know people making uh living wage but if
 
04:12:59.950 --> 04:12:59.960 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage in the state is 725 and
 
04:13:04.149 --> 04:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
a living wage is $20 an hour certainly
 
04:13:08.510 --> 04:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh TW the the gap between um $15 an hour
 
04:13:11.990 --> 04:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
and $20 an hour is much smaller than the
 
04:13:14.389 --> 04:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
gap between
 
04:13:17.710 --> 04:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
$11.9 an hour and and what you actually
 
04:13:21.109 --> 04:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
need to live which would be uh $20 an
 
04:13:24.630 --> 04:13:24.640 align:start position:0%
hour followup for a followup so
 
04:13:26.990 --> 04:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
basically I guess my question really is
 
04:13:29.469 --> 04:13:29.479 align:start position:0%
that is this bill mislabeled then
 
04:13:31.070 --> 04:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
because you're talking about sustainable
 
04:13:33.349 --> 04:13:33.359 align:start position:0%
wages that is what someone needs to live
 
04:13:35.109 --> 04:13:35.119 align:start position:0%
whereas minimum wage is someone who's
 
04:13:36.950 --> 04:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
never worked a job someone just out of
 
04:13:39.830 --> 04:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
school or in school that working so I
 
04:13:41.590 --> 04:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm saying is minimum wage is
 
04:13:44.349 --> 04:13:44.359 align:start position:0%
not a liable wage we all agree to that
 
04:13:46.469 --> 04:13:46.479 align:start position:0%
so why is this bill why are these bills
 
04:13:48.510 --> 04:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
labeled increase in minimum wage then
 
04:13:50.189 --> 04:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
because you're talking about sustainable
 
04:13:52.309 --> 04:13:52.319 align:start position:0%
wages because a living wage in New
 
04:13:53.630 --> 04:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is
 
04:13:57.030 --> 04:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
$23.58 an hour for an adult with both
 
04:13:59.389 --> 04:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
with two P for two adults both working
 
04:14:03.189 --> 04:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
with two children uh it's $29. 34 an
 
04:14:06.030 --> 04:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
hour and that's not 15 so 15 would be a
 
04:14:09.510 --> 04:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
minimum wage and um because 15 is not a
 
04:14:11.950 --> 04:14:11.960 align:start position:0%
living wage and that's as high as it
 
04:14:14.990 --> 04:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
goes okay representative
 
04:14:18.070 --> 04:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
King thank you Mr chair um question for
 
04:14:19.910 --> 04:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
you uh I looked here on the numbers from
 
04:14:21.830 --> 04:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
the other states did you do any um
 
04:14:23.550 --> 04:14:23.560 align:start position:0%
information or look up anything on
 
04:14:25.510 --> 04:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
specific impacts that the minimum wage
 
04:14:27.149 --> 04:14:27.159 align:start position:0%
increases in these states have had on
 
04:14:29.550 --> 04:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
whether it's the cost of those goods in
 
04:14:31.389 --> 04:14:31.399 align:start position:0%
those businesses or anything like that
 
04:14:32.990 --> 04:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
to see if there's any increases in that
 
04:14:37.990 --> 04:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
when the wage went up um I
 
04:14:42.109 --> 04:14:42.119 align:start position:0%
um I did not include that in this um
 
04:14:44.149 --> 04:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
however new Hampshire has the 13th
 
04:14:46.790 --> 04:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
highest cost of living in the
 
04:14:50.309 --> 04:14:50.319 align:start position:0%
country um and we have one of the lowest
 
04:14:52.590 --> 04:14:52.600 align:start position:0%
minimum wages I mean our minimum wage is
 
04:14:55.950 --> 04:14:55.960 align:start position:0%
lower than Arkansas where where they
 
04:15:00.189 --> 04:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
have a much lower cost of living um so
 
04:15:02.189 --> 04:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
we are already pretty high in terms of
 
04:15:05.790 --> 04:15:05.800 align:start position:0%
cost of living um I think we're we're
 
04:15:08.149 --> 04:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
closely aligned with Maine Maine is
 
04:15:10.590 --> 04:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
interesting because like 10 years ago
 
04:15:12.630 --> 04:15:12.640 align:start position:0%
when I first started looking at this
 
04:15:15.790 --> 04:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
issue our minimum wage was 725 and
 
04:15:16.910 --> 04:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
theirs was like
 
04:15:21.550 --> 04:15:21.560 align:start position:0%
$783 an hour and then they passed their
 
04:15:25.070 --> 04:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
um they passed the the ballot initiative
 
04:15:27.670 --> 04:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
that began to raise their minimum wage
 
04:15:32.950 --> 04:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
which is now up to um um uh
 
04:15:35.910 --> 04:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
$14.65 an hour and it was interesting to
 
04:15:39.189 --> 04:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
watch what happened with both economies
 
04:15:42.189 --> 04:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
and they're pretty much have followed
 
04:15:47.670 --> 04:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
exactly the same track um the um average
 
04:15:50.229 --> 04:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
wage in New Hampshire is a little bit
 
04:15:52.710 --> 04:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
higher but the number of people making
 
04:15:56.710 --> 04:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
very low wages in Maine is is is not as
 
04:15:59.269 --> 04:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
many as we have here in New
 
04:16:02.910 --> 04:16:02.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it's so I don't think it
 
04:16:04.070 --> 04:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
really I
 
04:16:06.189 --> 04:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
mean I mean you looking at the housing
 
04:16:09.790 --> 04:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
costs in New Hampshire there nobody I
 
04:16:12.349 --> 04:16:12.359 align:start position:0%
can't imagine and that's a huge part of
 
04:16:15.590 --> 04:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
person's expenses and there's no place
 
04:16:17.269 --> 04:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
in the country where it's worse than it
 
04:16:20.590 --> 04:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
is here in New Hampshire so I you know I
 
04:16:23.429 --> 04:16:23.439 align:start position:0%
I so I don't think I I didn't see
 
04:16:26.309 --> 04:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
anything other than you know we we also
 
04:16:28.550 --> 04:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
heard you know Vermont is very similar
 
04:16:32.229 --> 04:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
to to us in terms of unemployment Etc
 
04:16:34.269 --> 04:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
there hasn't really been any kind of
 
04:16:36.910 --> 04:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
negative impact on Main's
 
04:16:39.830 --> 04:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
economy their unemployment has stayed
 
04:16:42.510 --> 04:16:42.520 align:start position:0%
pretty low the the growth in the economy
 
04:16:45.429 --> 04:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
has been
 
04:16:47.990 --> 04:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
sustained and for a
 
04:16:50.910 --> 04:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
followup yes thank you um so as far as
 
04:16:52.830 --> 04:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
you you pointed out Maine a couple times
 
04:16:54.790 --> 04:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
here do you know the actual people that
 
04:16:57.309 --> 04:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
were the amount of people that wages
 
04:16:59.550 --> 04:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
increased in that that have you done any
 
04:17:02.269 --> 04:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
research on that I have I didn't bring
 
04:17:04.269 --> 04:17:04.279 align:start position:0%
it with me I am happy to send that to
 
04:17:07.189 --> 04:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
you the the main U main
 
04:17:10.269 --> 04:17:10.279 align:start position:0%
c um which is the equivalent of what our
 
04:17:12.030 --> 04:17:12.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire fiscal policy Institute
 
04:17:14.189 --> 04:17:14.199 align:start position:0%
they did a big study on what happened
 
04:17:15.910 --> 04:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
what what the first thing that happened
 
04:17:18.670 --> 04:17:18.680 align:start position:0%
was that the poverty rate went way down
 
04:17:21.790 --> 04:17:21.800 align:start position:0%
in the state um but I certainly have a
 
04:17:24.750 --> 04:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
lot of information about um the impact
 
04:17:27.710 --> 04:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
of of course it was so long ago that I
 
04:17:29.510 --> 04:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
might not be able to find all of it but
 
04:17:32.070 --> 04:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
there was certainly some reports on how
 
04:17:34.830 --> 04:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
um what impact raising the minimum wage
 
04:17:36.510 --> 04:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
in the state of Maine had on their
 
04:17:38.630 --> 04:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
economy and on the quality of life of
 
04:17:41.510 --> 04:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
the people who live there thank you
 
04:17:43.590 --> 04:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
representative bashard thank you Mr
 
04:17:46.349 --> 04:17:46.359 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:17:48.630 --> 04:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
question now how can we justify not
 
04:17:51.189 --> 04:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
investing in our workers well-being when
 
04:17:53.950 --> 04:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
studies show that increased wages lead
 
04:17:57.469 --> 04:17:57.479 align:start position:0%
to improved productivity and reduce
 
04:18:00.349 --> 04:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
turnover well yeah I think one of the
 
04:18:04.189 --> 04:18:04.199 align:start position:0%
big ISS one of the big hold um one of
 
04:18:05.830 --> 04:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
the things that's holding our economy
 
04:18:08.630 --> 04:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
back is that um we have a shortage of
 
04:18:11.189 --> 04:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
workers the people who are most impacted
 
04:18:13.229 --> 04:18:13.239 align:start position:0%
by the minimum wage are people who are
 
04:18:15.109 --> 04:18:15.119 align:start position:0%
just starting out in their careers
 
04:18:16.469 --> 04:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
because they're you know they're making
 
04:18:18.910 --> 04:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
those entry level wages if those are
 
04:18:23.269 --> 04:18:23.279 align:start position:0%
lower then um young people might be who
 
04:18:25.590 --> 04:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
are not attached in the community are
 
04:18:27.910 --> 04:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
more likely to leave the state and look
 
04:18:29.149 --> 04:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
for work
 
04:18:32.870 --> 04:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
elsewhere um and um you know neither of
 
04:18:36.349 --> 04:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
my kids live in New Hampshire
 
04:18:41.070 --> 04:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:44.030 --> 04:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
um you know in terms of of of of just
 
04:18:46.429 --> 04:18:46.439 align:start position:0%
having a stable Workforce having a group
 
04:18:48.670 --> 04:18:48.680 align:start position:0%
of people who can afford to pay for
 
04:18:51.149 --> 04:18:51.159 align:start position:0%
their living expenses and not have to
 
04:18:54.030 --> 04:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
worry about losing their apartments or
 
04:18:56.109 --> 04:18:56.119 align:start position:0%
um not being able to fix their car when
 
04:18:58.070 --> 04:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
it get when it breaks down so they can
 
04:19:02.830 --> 04:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
get to work um a higher higher raising
 
04:19:06.389 --> 04:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
the the the floor of the people who are
 
04:19:08.990 --> 04:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
struggling fiscal policy Institute
 
04:19:10.550 --> 04:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
reports that a third of the people in
 
04:19:13.030 --> 04:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
the state according reported to the
 
04:19:15.070 --> 04:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
United States s census that they are
 
04:19:16.590 --> 04:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
having a difficult time paying for
 
04:19:19.269 --> 04:19:19.279 align:start position:0%
everyday expenses so if we enable people
 
04:19:21.429 --> 04:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
to pay for their everyday expenses and
 
04:19:24.109 --> 04:19:24.119 align:start position:0%
feel like um they have a decent quality
 
04:19:25.630 --> 04:19:25.640 align:start position:0%
of life and that they don't have to
 
04:19:29.149 --> 04:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
worry about um what will happen to them
 
04:19:31.990 --> 04:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
if their car breaks down or they you
 
04:19:33.469 --> 04:19:33.479 align:start position:0%
know they get evicted from their
 
04:19:35.790 --> 04:19:35.800 align:start position:0%
apartment um then you have a more stable
 
04:19:38.070 --> 04:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce and those people are are are
 
04:19:41.670 --> 04:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
here to stay they're um invested in
 
04:19:45.550 --> 04:19:45.560 align:start position:0%
their work work place and in their
 
04:19:48.550 --> 04:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
communities thank you representative lry
 
04:19:50.510 --> 04:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh just a couple
 
04:19:52.189 --> 04:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
final things uh I just wanted to clean
 
04:19:54.349 --> 04:19:54.359 align:start position:0%
this up if I could the what is the
 
04:19:57.030 --> 04:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
average demographic of the person that
 
04:20:00.429 --> 04:20:00.439 align:start position:0%
makes the 725 was it in fact young kids
 
04:20:02.990 --> 04:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
or is it adults in in apartments or we
 
04:20:04.469 --> 04:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
weren't able to figure out what sector
 
04:20:05.750 --> 04:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
these folks worked in maybe we could
 
04:20:08.349 --> 04:20:08.359 align:start position:0%
figure out what age they are I like I
 
04:20:10.710 --> 04:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
said I have no idea we have been trying
 
04:20:12.830 --> 04:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
to find out that information for 10
 
04:20:15.630 --> 04:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
years okay we we only have that number
 
04:20:19.389 --> 04:20:19.399 align:start position:0%
the the the number of workers at each um
 
04:20:23.149 --> 04:20:23.159 align:start position:0%
wage level that um the 10 12 and
 
04:20:26.269 --> 04:20:26.279 align:start position:0%
$15 marks that information cames from
 
04:20:28.670 --> 04:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
comes from the economic policy Institute
 
04:20:29.950 --> 04:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
and they were able to find that
 
04:20:33.710 --> 04:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
information but that 5,000 person number
 
04:20:35.750 --> 04:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
comes from the Bureau of Labor Labor
 
04:20:37.870 --> 04:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
Statistics and it seems to be kind of a
 
04:20:41.349 --> 04:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
black box and I mean if you ask um
 
04:20:43.910 --> 04:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
people from uh the Department of
 
04:20:46.349 --> 04:20:46.359 align:start position:0%
Employment Security or whoever um you
 
04:20:46.359 --> 04:20:47.910 align:start position:0%
Employment Security or whoever um you
know

04:20:47.910 --> 04:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:20:50.750 --> 04:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
they they they they spoke to this kind
 
04:20:53.189 --> 04:20:53.199 align:start position:0%
of issue a couple weeks ago when we were
 
04:20:54.950 --> 04:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
talking to them that you know that
 
04:20:58.149 --> 04:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
people people issue quarterly reports
 
04:21:01.109 --> 04:21:01.119 align:start position:0%
with how many employees they have and
 
04:21:03.030 --> 04:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
and how much they how much they're
 
04:21:06.189 --> 04:21:06.199 align:start position:0%
spending on salaries but they don't it
 
04:21:09.429 --> 04:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
it's not broken down as far as I know
 
04:21:11.750 --> 04:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if uh there isn't
 
04:21:13.750 --> 04:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
anyone here from Employment Security and
 
04:21:15.149 --> 04:21:15.159 align:start position:0%
there is someone here from Department of
 
04:21:17.790 --> 04:21:17.800 align:start position:0%
Labor but I would be willing to bet that
 
04:21:19.189 --> 04:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
they don't know either that's okay
 
04:21:22.910 --> 04:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
understood one follow up or followup
 
04:21:25.149 --> 04:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um say we went ahead
 
04:21:27.070 --> 04:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
and and passed this law and we set the
 
04:21:28.229 --> 04:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage here in the state of
 
04:21:29.309 --> 04:21:29.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire at
 
04:21:32.910 --> 04:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
$15 um and then we had a massive
 
04:21:35.429 --> 04:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
recession and we had to lay off folks
 
04:21:38.830 --> 04:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
because we we didn't have the work um
 
04:21:41.469 --> 04:21:41.479 align:start position:0%
would it be best to let you know the
 
04:21:43.670 --> 04:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
organic process of capitalism and supply
 
04:21:46.630 --> 04:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
and demand take its place or do you
 
04:21:47.790 --> 04:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
think we should
 
04:21:51.630 --> 04:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
be beholden to that 15 even if it means
 
04:21:53.910 --> 04:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
the whole ship goes down with the so to
 
04:21:56.429 --> 04:21:56.439 align:start position:0%
speak ship goes down with the uh the bad
 
04:21:58.109 --> 04:21:58.119 align:start position:0%
recession we ran well you know we've had
 
04:22:00.590 --> 04:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
minimum wage in the United States since
 
04:22:04.149 --> 04:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
the 1930s and 40s or 50s or you know
 
04:22:06.309 --> 04:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
it's been around for a long time it was
 
04:22:09.349 --> 04:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
something that um Franklin Roosevelt was
 
04:22:12.030 --> 04:22:12.040 align:start position:0%
very invested in so I mean we've been
 
04:22:13.750 --> 04:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
through a a lot we've been through ups
 
04:22:16.030 --> 04:22:16.040 align:start position:0%
and downs and we've had a minimum wage
 
04:22:18.990 --> 04:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
and the minimum wage used to be a lot
 
04:22:22.189 --> 04:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
closer to a living wage than it is now
 
04:22:26.469 --> 04:22:26.479 align:start position:0%
um I think if um you know we just spent
 
04:22:28.590 --> 04:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of time talking about what
 
04:22:30.950 --> 04:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
happens during a recession and how there
 
04:22:36.750 --> 04:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
is um um stop Gap measures for um people
 
04:22:38.910 --> 04:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
and that the federal government will
 
04:22:41.550 --> 04:22:41.560 align:start position:0%
also step in and help in a period of
 
04:22:44.030 --> 04:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
severe recession
 
04:22:47.870 --> 04:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
04:22:52.990 --> 04:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
um ensuring that that um people are are
 
04:22:56.109 --> 04:22:56.119 align:start position:0%
paid a a wage that allows them to live
 
04:22:59.189 --> 04:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
with dignity
 
04:23:02.109 --> 04:23:02.119 align:start position:0%
um I think that that that's really
 
04:23:04.630 --> 04:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
important I I you know as as the minimum
 
04:23:06.950 --> 04:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
wage has gone up it really hasn't been
 
04:23:09.149 --> 04:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
something that
 
04:23:12.750 --> 04:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
um that you know there's studies that go
 
04:23:14.830 --> 04:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
back and forth sometimes you do lose a
 
04:23:18.189 --> 04:23:18.199 align:start position:0%
few jobs but then you get more jobs and
 
04:23:20.510 --> 04:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
people who had been working two jobs are
 
04:23:24.189 --> 04:23:24.199 align:start position:0%
now only working one job um so it
 
04:23:25.990 --> 04:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
appears that there are fewer job there
 
04:23:28.750 --> 04:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
are few people working but they're um
 
04:23:30.469 --> 04:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
they're actually only working one job
 
04:23:32.790 --> 04:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
now and before they had to work two or
 
04:23:36.830 --> 04:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
one and a half um no I I I think you
 
04:23:39.790 --> 04:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
know paying somebody a living wage or
 
04:23:39.800 --> 04:23:40.670 align:start position:0%
know paying somebody a living wage or
paying

04:23:40.670 --> 04:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
paying
 
04:23:43.790 --> 04:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
someone uh
 
04:23:48.349 --> 04:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
something paying people a wage that um
 
04:23:52.189 --> 04:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
reflects their value and that and the
 
04:23:54.990 --> 04:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that they are contributing to
 
04:23:58.469 --> 04:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
the economy and to the society I think
 
04:24:01.870 --> 04:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
you know we should we should do that
 
04:24:04.870 --> 04:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
cuz when you're paying people who are at
 
04:24:06.950 --> 04:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
the bottom end of the economic scale
 
04:24:08.710 --> 04:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
more money they're going to spend that
 
04:24:10.750 --> 04:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
money it's not going in the bank they're
 
04:24:12.950 --> 04:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
not going to buy a yacht going to spend
 
04:24:15.109 --> 04:24:15.119 align:start position:0%
it you know they're going to go out and
 
04:24:17.870 --> 04:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
get a pizza they're going to stop and
 
04:24:20.950 --> 04:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
get um a coffee the next time they buy
 
04:24:22.870 --> 04:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
gas they have a little bit of extra
 
04:24:26.109 --> 04:24:26.119 align:start position:0%
money to spend and you know like the the
 
04:24:27.950 --> 04:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
situation we have now is sort of like a
 
04:24:29.950 --> 04:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
tornado where all the money gets scooped
 
04:24:32.750 --> 04:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
up and then sent to the Top This is a
 
04:24:35.109 --> 04:24:35.119 align:start position:0%
way of keeping it down at ground level
 
04:24:39.030 --> 04:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
so that it can um so it can you know
 
04:24:41.030 --> 04:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
stimulate the
 
04:24:44.790 --> 04:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
economy okay represent
 
04:24:47.550 --> 04:24:47.560 align:start position:0%
Hall so if you set a minimum wage for an
 
04:24:50.630 --> 04:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
employer that has say 20 employees say
 
04:24:54.309 --> 04:24:54.319 align:start position:0%
it's a small landscape company or a
 
04:24:57.750 --> 04:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
restaurant or um whatever and you tell
 
04:24:59.590 --> 04:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
them they have to start paying their
 
04:25:02.109 --> 04:25:02.119 align:start position:0%
employees twice as much where does the
 
04:25:04.309 --> 04:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
money come
 
04:25:04.319 --> 04:25:06.189 align:start position:0%
money come
from

04:25:06.189 --> 04:25:06.199 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:25:09.670 --> 04:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
well first of all
 
04:25:14.030 --> 04:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
um it it's not automatic it I mean
 
04:25:15.710 --> 04:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
that's why we're doing it over a period
 
04:25:19.750 --> 04:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
of years first of all right now um wages
 
04:25:22.870 --> 04:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
are are fairly High there are people
 
04:25:25.309 --> 04:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
that very like as you pointed out there
 
04:25:28.109 --> 04:25:28.119 align:start position:0%
are very few people making 725 an hour
 
04:25:30.030 --> 04:25:30.040 align:start position:0%
in order to get people to come to work
 
04:25:32.149 --> 04:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
you're paying more than that this is
 
04:25:35.710 --> 04:25:35.720 align:start position:0%
really very modest I would say that you
 
04:25:38.389 --> 04:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
know if you look at these numbers here
 
04:25:40.670 --> 04:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
um when the when the minimum wage goes
 
04:25:44.429 --> 04:25:44.439 align:start position:0%
up to $10 there are 10,000 out of the
 
04:25:47.750 --> 04:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
600 close to 700 or maybe more than
 
04:25:50.910 --> 04:25:50.920 align:start position:0%
700,000 working people in the state who
 
04:25:53.189 --> 04:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
will be impacted by that who will get a
 
04:25:56.389 --> 04:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
raise from that at the most when you get
 
04:25:59.229 --> 04:25:59.239 align:start position:0%
to $15 an hour it's going to be about
 
04:26:02.590 --> 04:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
on10th of the workforce
 
04:26:05.950 --> 04:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
so the thing is that you know if if
 
04:26:08.550 --> 04:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
you've uh if you've got a business and
 
04:26:10.790 --> 04:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
you've got 20 people working for you the
 
04:26:13.189 --> 04:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
likelihood that um you're paying them
 
04:26:17.429 --> 04:26:17.439 align:start position:0%
$15 an hour or less um in this
 
04:26:20.670 --> 04:26:20.680 align:start position:0%
environment is is is pretty unlikely so
 
04:26:24.550 --> 04:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
the idea that going up to $15 three
 
04:26:26.990 --> 04:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
years from now
 
04:26:29.109 --> 04:26:29.119 align:start position:0%
um is you know you're going to be
 
04:26:31.229 --> 04:26:31.239 align:start position:0%
doubling people's salaries is pretty
 
04:26:34.870 --> 04:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
unlikely with these numbers I mean if if
 
04:26:36.830 --> 04:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
you know if you were paying people 15
 
04:26:39.309 --> 04:26:39.319 align:start position:0%
and the minimum wage went up to 30 well
 
04:26:41.830 --> 04:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
then that that would be this this is
 
04:26:44.750 --> 04:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
based on on being modest and thinking
 
04:26:46.830 --> 04:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
about how businesses are going to cope
 
04:26:49.510 --> 04:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
with the increased minimum wage thank
 
04:26:49.520 --> 04:26:50.269 align:start position:0%
with the increased minimum wage thank
you

04:26:50.269 --> 04:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:26:52.710 --> 04:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
represent representa Hall go ahead thank
 
04:26:56.269 --> 04:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
you um just to be clear though leaving
 
04:26:58.189 --> 04:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
the specific numbers out if you're
 
04:27:01.030 --> 04:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
telling employers they have to pay more
 
04:27:04.349 --> 04:27:04.359 align:start position:0%
you're either assuming they are just
 
04:27:06.830 --> 04:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
banking larger profits than they deserve
 
04:27:09.710 --> 04:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
or they're going to have to pass that on
 
04:27:11.550 --> 04:27:11.560 align:start position:0%
is that do you agree with that well I
 
04:27:12.870 --> 04:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
think if you're you know there are
 
04:27:16.109 --> 04:27:16.119 align:start position:0%
places that that that pay much less than
 
04:27:17.670 --> 04:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
they you know I I think of large
 
04:27:20.189 --> 04:27:20.199 align:start position:0%
corporations like dollar stores they're
 
04:27:22.030 --> 04:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
the worst they pay the lowest salaries
 
04:27:24.510 --> 04:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
of anybody and I think you know those
 
04:27:26.349 --> 04:27:26.359 align:start position:0%
people that are working in those stores
 
04:27:28.189 --> 04:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely deserve more money than
 
04:27:31.750 --> 04:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
they're getting um and and so that would
 
04:27:35.950 --> 04:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
be the case I mean most small
 
04:27:38.670 --> 04:27:38.680 align:start position:0%
businesses they pay their their they
 
04:27:42.269 --> 04:27:42.279 align:start position:0%
they work you know cheek to Jal with I
 
04:27:43.990 --> 04:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
mean they're doing the work too I mean
 
04:27:45.790 --> 04:27:45.800 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not like Darden
 
04:27:48.109 --> 04:27:48.119 align:start position:0%
corporation that owns Olive Garden and
 
04:27:50.590 --> 04:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
whatnot it's you know it's you know it's
 
04:27:52.870 --> 04:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
somebody that um owns a local lumber
 
04:27:56.189 --> 04:27:56.199 align:start position:0%
yard or or has a small restaurant or
 
04:27:58.189 --> 04:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
whatever they they know they're
 
04:28:00.229 --> 04:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
employees and they try to pay them as
 
04:28:04.750 --> 04:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
much as they can um and so in those
 
04:28:06.750 --> 04:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
cases I
 
04:28:09.309 --> 04:28:09.319 align:start position:0%
mean because of the way the environment
 
04:28:11.429 --> 04:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
is now and where wages have already gone
 
04:28:16.510 --> 04:28:16.520 align:start position:0%
up so much much um this is incremental I
 
04:28:19.950 --> 04:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
think um you know yes sometimes maybe
 
04:28:22.349 --> 04:28:22.359 align:start position:0%
prices will need to go up like in the
 
04:28:25.070 --> 04:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
dollar stores the these dollar stores
 
04:28:27.349 --> 04:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
that come into communities and knock out
 
04:28:29.030 --> 04:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
you know the local grocery store and
 
04:28:32.750 --> 04:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
they knock out the local um um you know
 
04:28:35.710 --> 04:28:35.720 align:start position:0%
the the local you
 
04:28:39.070 --> 04:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
know for mostly the grocery stores but
 
04:28:41.269 --> 04:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
other little stores and and and small
 
04:28:44.830 --> 04:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
businesses and then you know they're
 
04:28:46.469 --> 04:28:46.479 align:start position:0%
they just don't provide the same level
 
04:28:48.710 --> 04:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
of service and and you know and the
 
04:28:50.229 --> 04:28:50.239 align:start position:0%
person who owned the grocery store the
 
04:28:52.389 --> 04:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
hardware store um they no longer can
 
04:28:53.870 --> 04:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
make a living because they've been
 
04:28:55.990 --> 04:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
undercut by this large corporation
 
04:28:57.790 --> 04:28:57.800 align:start position:0%
that's nowhere near New Hampshire that's
 
04:28:59.710 --> 04:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
paying the people that they came into
 
04:29:03.670 --> 04:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
the community that undermined
 
04:29:07.070 --> 04:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
um they um yeah they should pay more
 
04:29:10.030 --> 04:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
they absolutely should pay more okay are
 
04:29:12.229 --> 04:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
there any questions um represent
 
04:29:15.830 --> 04:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
farington and then Drago thank you so it
 
04:29:18.870 --> 04:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
seems like 61,000 people be affected by
 
04:29:23.229 --> 04:29:23.239 align:start position:0%
this at this point right now if firms if
 
04:29:25.510 --> 04:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
employers are willing to pay those
 
04:29:30.469 --> 04:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
61,000 people at $15 or below isn't it
 
04:29:33.630 --> 04:29:33.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable to think that at the higher
 
04:29:37.469 --> 04:29:37.479 align:start position:0%
price of 15 firms would be less willing
 
04:29:39.710 --> 04:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
to pay those people and so that
 
04:29:43.830 --> 04:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
unemployment would increase
 
04:29:43.840 --> 04:29:45.790 align:start position:0%
unemployment would increase
um

04:29:45.790 --> 04:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:49.030 --> 04:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
that there have been um a lot of
 
04:29:52.070 --> 04:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
analyses um uh Mark Twain once said
 
04:29:53.990 --> 04:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
there are three kinds of lies lies damn
 
04:29:56.830 --> 04:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
lies and statistics so uh you know
 
04:29:59.349 --> 04:29:59.359 align:start position:0%
however you want to read the the stuff
 
04:30:01.990 --> 04:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
there are cases where you know I think
 
04:30:05.990 --> 04:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
um the Seattle and Tacoma Airport area
 
04:30:08.910 --> 04:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
they raised their minimum wage um they
 
04:30:11.469 --> 04:30:11.479 align:start position:0%
didn't really see there were two people
 
04:30:13.389 --> 04:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
that looked at the the data and decided
 
04:30:17.269 --> 04:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
two absolutely different things that um
 
04:30:20.229 --> 04:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
uh employment went down employment went
 
04:30:23.670 --> 04:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
up but I mean if you look at these other
 
04:30:25.550 --> 04:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
New England
 
04:30:28.030 --> 04:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
states there they you know the EMP
 
04:30:31.070 --> 04:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
unemployment rates have still stayed low
 
04:30:33.070 --> 04:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
I mean when when Maine started raising
 
04:30:35.309 --> 04:30:35.319 align:start position:0%
their minimum wage there wasn't a huge
 
04:30:37.750 --> 04:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
spike in unemployment in fact it's it
 
04:30:41.109 --> 04:30:41.119 align:start position:0%
has been at 3% since they started doing
 
04:30:43.710 --> 04:30:43.720 align:start position:0%
it it hasn't really varied much at all
 
04:30:45.950 --> 04:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
so as people were getting paid more they
 
04:30:47.790 --> 04:30:47.800 align:start position:0%
weren't laying people off in fact the
 
04:30:50.269 --> 04:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
economy was growing because more people
 
04:30:52.910 --> 04:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
had more money to spend in in a
 
04:30:55.229 --> 04:30:55.239 align:start position:0%
consumer-based society that's that's
 
04:30:58.149 --> 04:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
what happens all represent
 
04:31:01.389 --> 04:31:01.399 align:start position:0%
Drago a quick question yeah really quick
 
04:31:04.309 --> 04:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm just curious you
 
04:31:06.590 --> 04:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned obviously it's a tight labor
 
04:31:08.590 --> 04:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
market that drives prices up uh right
 
04:31:09.950 --> 04:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
now if anybody has a pulse we're hiring
 
04:31:13.910 --> 04:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
them for 20 $25 an hour um during our HB
 
04:31:16.429 --> 04:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
238 hearing we heard a lot about um if
 
04:31:18.710 --> 04:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
you don't like the union portion just go
 
04:31:22.189 --> 04:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
find another job you referenced um the
 
04:31:23.790 --> 04:31:23.800 align:start position:0%
dollar stores and stuff like that not
 
04:31:25.950 --> 04:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
paying a lot my question is why can't
 
04:31:27.950 --> 04:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
those people everybody's hiring why
 
04:31:30.550 --> 04:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
can't they just find a different job why
 
04:31:32.510 --> 04:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
why are we so focused on a job that
 
04:31:33.830 --> 04:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't pay a lot because if nobody's
 
04:31:35.349 --> 04:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
going there they're going to have to
 
04:31:38.070 --> 04:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
increase their rates
 
04:31:40.389 --> 04:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
anyways well one of the things that
 
04:31:42.710 --> 04:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
happens when Dollar Stores come in in is
 
04:31:44.990 --> 04:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
that they drive out the other businesses
 
04:31:47.550 --> 04:31:47.560 align:start position:0%
because their prices are so low you know
 
04:31:49.870 --> 04:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
if you're if you run a a community
 
04:31:52.790 --> 04:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
grocery store um and you know you're
 
04:31:55.349 --> 04:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
bringing in fresh produce and you know
 
04:31:58.830 --> 04:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
it's a family family-owned business um
 
04:32:01.469 --> 04:32:01.479 align:start position:0%
it's hard for you to compete with their
 
04:32:04.309 --> 04:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
their prices because they can buy in
 
04:32:06.590 --> 04:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
bulk and they don't
 
04:32:09.910 --> 04:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
pay the people that work there very well
 
04:32:11.950 --> 04:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
so they drive out the businesses where
 
04:32:11.960 --> 04:32:12.910 align:start position:0%
so they drive out the businesses where
other

04:32:12.910 --> 04:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:32:15.510 --> 04:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
people had had worked
 
04:32:19.189 --> 04:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
before and then um then the only place
 
04:32:20.750 --> 04:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
left for them to work is at the dollar
 
04:32:23.510 --> 04:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
store and then they get really
 
04:32:25.870 --> 04:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
underpaid that's one of the things that
 
04:32:28.269 --> 04:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
that happens and so you know I always
 
04:32:30.229 --> 04:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
hate and they they tend to go into
 
04:32:33.269 --> 04:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
underserved communities where people are
 
04:32:37.269 --> 04:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
um you know are are are already
 
04:32:39.790 --> 04:32:39.800 align:start position:0%
underpaid and and you know they're
 
04:32:42.349 --> 04:32:42.359 align:start position:0%
they're attracted by the low low prices
 
04:32:45.990 --> 04:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
but then in in doing that they're they
 
04:32:47.790 --> 04:32:47.800 align:start position:0%
drive out the other
 
04:32:51.469 --> 04:32:51.479 align:start position:0%
community um centered businesses where
 
04:32:54.550 --> 04:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
they could work for more money but they
 
04:32:56.309 --> 04:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
wanted those
 
04:32:59.590 --> 04:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
cheap um whatever things that they sell
 
04:33:02.750 --> 04:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
at the dollar store okay thank you thank
 
04:33:04.349 --> 04:33:04.359 align:start position:0%

Kenny I am a resident of Kanan New
 
04:33:42.629 --> 04:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I am here speaking here on
 
04:33:45.029 --> 04:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
behalf of the New Hampshire Conference
 
04:33:47.150 --> 04:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
of the United Church of Christ so for
 
04:33:49.629 --> 04:33:49.639 align:start position:0%
the whole denomination of uh known as
 
04:33:53.070 --> 04:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
the UCC or the congregationalists and um
 
04:33:54.670 --> 04:33:54.680 align:start position:0%
the United Church of Christ is the
 
04:33:57.390 --> 04:33:57.400 align:start position:0%
largest Protestant denomination in New
 
04:34:00.470 --> 04:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and in our 13 cities and
 
04:34:04.189 --> 04:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
221 towns there are over
 
04:34:07.869 --> 04:34:07.879 align:start position:0%
130 um UCC or congregational churches
 
04:34:12.990 --> 04:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
and so um the our denomination back into
 
04:34:16.590 --> 04:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
2014 um passed a resolution the whole
 
04:34:19.750 --> 04:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
denomination imp uh calling upon our
 
04:34:23.189 --> 04:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
churches to come before you and implore
 
04:34:26.470 --> 04:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire legislature to pass um
 
04:34:29.750 --> 04:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
a to reinstate the minimum wage for New
 
04:34:33.269 --> 04:34:33.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and to move toward um the
 
04:34:36.269 --> 04:34:36.279 align:start position:0%
minimum wage being a living wage and so
 
04:34:38.830 --> 04:34:38.840 align:start position:0%
just a couple of things um so we hear
 
04:34:40.949 --> 04:34:40.959 align:start position:0%
about the market working well the market
 
04:34:44.990 --> 04:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
works except when it doesn't and so the
 
04:34:50.390 --> 04:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
idea of setting a floor below which we
 
04:34:55.709 --> 04:34:55.719 align:start position:0%
as people of um of decency below which
 
04:34:58.910 --> 04:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
we should not go as a state in terms of
 
04:35:01.269 --> 04:35:01.279 align:start position:0%
valuing work whatever the work is and
 
04:35:04.070 --> 04:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
whoever does it um a minimum wage is
 
04:35:09.789 --> 04:35:09.799 align:start position:0%
meant to be a floor and um so we the the
 
04:35:12.629 --> 04:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
um United Churches of Christ um are
 
04:35:15.629 --> 04:35:15.639 align:start position:0%
asking the legislature to create a a a
 
04:35:18.750 --> 04:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable floor for when the market is
 
04:35:21.629 --> 04:35:21.639 align:start position:0%
not otherwise working so I just want to
 
04:35:24.510 --> 04:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
um address sort of a couple of of myths
 
04:35:28.150 --> 04:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
first is um when the the concept of a
 
04:35:30.551 --> 04:35:30.561 align:start position:0%
minimum wage was first established on
 
04:35:33.869 --> 04:35:33.879 align:start position:0%
during in the the FDR the Roosevelt era
 
04:35:36.789 --> 04:35:36.799 align:start position:0%
it was never intended to be a training
 
04:35:39.670 --> 04:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
wage it was meant right from the start
 
04:35:43.029 --> 04:35:43.039 align:start position:0%
to be the bare minimum that people that
 
04:35:45.189 --> 04:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
working people would need and families
 
04:35:47.990 --> 04:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
would need in order to survive and so
 
04:35:49.990 --> 04:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
just a couple of things so somebody has
 
04:35:52.230 --> 04:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
been asking questions about um
 
04:35:54.150 --> 04:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
demographics and so this is from the
 
04:35:56.869 --> 04:35:56.879 align:start position:0%
economic policy Institute what people
 
04:35:59.590 --> 04:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
generally think part the myths are that
 
04:36:01.551 --> 04:36:01.561 align:start position:0%
minimum wage is just for teenagers or
 
04:36:03.750 --> 04:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
minimum wage is for somebody who stepped
 
04:36:05.629 --> 04:36:05.639 align:start position:0%
into the Working World for the very
 
04:36:07.990 --> 04:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
first time minimum wage is only for
 
04:36:10.189 --> 04:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
people who work uh part-time kids who
 
04:36:11.869 --> 04:36:11.879 align:start position:0%
work part-time after school or who live
 
04:36:13.709 --> 04:36:13.719 align:start position:0%
with their parents or people who just
 
04:36:16.310 --> 04:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
want to earn uh extra spending money in
 
04:36:17.869 --> 04:36:17.879 align:start position:0%
the early days of going to these
 
04:36:19.949 --> 04:36:19.959 align:start position:0%
hearings I remember people referring to
 
04:36:21.551 --> 04:36:21.561 align:start position:0%
or some legislators referring to isn't
 
04:36:23.789 --> 04:36:23.799 align:start position:0%
this just for pin money for people who
 
04:36:26.789 --> 04:36:26.799 align:start position:0%
want extra the reality is and again from
 
04:36:30.470 --> 04:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
the um economic um policy Institute is
 
04:36:32.830 --> 04:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
the people in New Hampshire who would
 
04:36:35.349 --> 04:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
benefit from an increase in the minimum
 
04:36:38.109 --> 04:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
wage getting up to the 61,000 that were
 
04:36:40.750 --> 04:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
referred to um if the minimum wage
 
04:36:43.750 --> 04:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
reached 15 um dollars an hour just
 
04:36:47.349 --> 04:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
working up to from going from 10 to
 
04:36:49.990 --> 04:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
15 the average age of the person who
 
04:36:53.910 --> 04:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
would benefit is 35 years of age um 90%
 
04:36:56.269 --> 04:36:56.279 align:start position:0%
of the people um who would benefit are
 
04:36:58.709 --> 04:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
not teenagers they're 20 years of age
 
04:37:02.390 --> 04:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
and older 59% are women 28% of the
 
04:37:04.709 --> 04:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
people who would benefit have children
 
04:37:06.789 --> 04:37:06.799 align:start position:0%
and uh 54% of the people who would
 
04:37:09.590 --> 04:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
benefit work full-time so that's the
 
04:37:11.629 --> 04:37:11.639 align:start position:0%
reality those are the demographics that
 
04:37:15.470 --> 04:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
have been studied um
 
04:37:18.150 --> 04:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
so I think that we all know I think that
 
04:37:20.990 --> 04:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
we all share an understanding that um no
 
04:37:25.349 --> 04:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
one in New Hampshire can Thrive not just
 
04:37:28.510 --> 04:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
on 7:25 an hour but on $10 an hour on
 
04:37:32.429 --> 04:37:32.439 align:start position:0%
$11 an hour on 12 um dollars an hour
 
04:37:34.390 --> 04:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
based on the cost of living in the state
 
04:37:37.990 --> 04:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and again the churches
 
04:37:40.429 --> 04:37:40.439 align:start position:0%
the 130 churches that are you know do
 
04:37:42.310 --> 04:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
practically the land Cape all over the
 
04:37:43.869 --> 04:37:43.879 align:start position:0%
state if there's not a United Church of
 
04:37:45.590 --> 04:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
Christ Church in your town there's one
 
04:37:48.189 --> 04:37:48.199 align:start position:0%
in the town next door um we are all
 
04:37:51.429 --> 04:37:51.439 align:start position:0%
saying to you pleading with you this
 
04:37:55.109 --> 04:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
should not be a partisan issue this is a
 
04:37:57.590 --> 04:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
matter of basic decency and basic
 
04:38:00.189 --> 04:38:00.199 align:start position:0%
morality and um in this recent past
 
04:38:02.910 --> 04:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
election I think that on the um at the
 
04:38:06.510 --> 04:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
national level you may all recall um
 
04:38:09.470 --> 04:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
that a big part of the um the
 
04:38:11.590 --> 04:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
conversation was the price of grow
 
04:38:15.109 --> 04:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
groceries and the even the um the new
 
04:38:17.470 --> 04:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
president has said that groceries is a
 
04:38:19.949 --> 04:38:19.959 align:start position:0%
beautiful word and groceries helped him
 
04:38:22.750 --> 04:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
talking about groceries helped him win
 
04:38:26.750 --> 04:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
the win the election um so I would again
 
04:38:28.990 --> 04:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
to each one of you to look in your heart
 
04:38:31.869 --> 04:38:31.879 align:start position:0%
and to ask you for somebody making $10
 
04:38:34.150 --> 04:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
an hour now somebody making $11 an hour
 
04:38:35.869 --> 04:38:35.879 align:start position:0%
now in our nursing homes the people who
 
04:38:37.590 --> 04:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
are taking care of our children and
 
04:38:39.750 --> 04:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
taking care of our parents or our
 
04:38:41.629 --> 04:38:41.639 align:start position:0%
grandparents um and the people people
 
04:38:43.390 --> 04:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
who were serving Us in the in the dollar
 
04:38:46.830 --> 04:38:46.840 align:start position:0%
stores for those who frequent those
 
04:38:50.910 --> 04:38:50.920 align:start position:0%
um let us let this state say as a matter
 
04:38:55.269 --> 04:38:55.279 align:start position:0%
of public policy that we will pay enough
 
04:38:57.910 --> 04:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
so that everyone can afford the price of
 
04:39:00.429 --> 04:39:00.439 align:start position:0%
groceries let the price of the cost of
 
04:39:02.470 --> 04:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
living in New Hampshire be what guides
 
04:39:08.029 --> 04:39:08.039 align:start position:0%
us to create a moral floor below which
 
04:39:10.470 --> 04:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
this state says we will not go because
 
04:39:13.590 --> 04:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
we value all work so thank you very much
 
04:39:16.070 --> 04:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
for your consideration of this bill I
 
04:39:19.551 --> 04:39:19.561 align:start position:0%
hope that you will find um HB 726 ought
 
04:39:21.830 --> 04:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
to pass thank you man' appreciate your
 
04:39:25.230 --> 04:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
testimony are there any
 
04:39:28.709 --> 04:39:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:31.910 --> 04:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
no representative labry thank you Mr
 
04:39:33.990 --> 04:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
chair I'm just looking at the way that
 
04:39:36.349 --> 04:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
this scales over the next four years at
 
04:39:39.868 --> 04:39:39.878 align:start position:0%
10 12 14 and 15 yep does that track with
 
04:39:41.750 --> 04:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
inflation and is that enough or should
 
04:39:45.190 --> 04:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:48.070 --> 04:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
more um well in order for people to
 
04:39:50.430 --> 04:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
really survive it should be far more
 
04:39:52.830 --> 04:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
than that but this bill is trying to be
 
04:39:57.550 --> 04:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
reasonable to create a basic floor so I
 
04:40:00.230 --> 04:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
would have to you know just to be honest
 
04:40:02.030 --> 04:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
with you I do look at these statistics a
 
04:40:03.550 --> 04:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
lot and I know the folks are the
 
04:40:05.350 --> 04:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
economic Justice Ministry of the United
 
04:40:06.910 --> 04:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
Church of Christ looks at these numbers
 
04:40:09.390 --> 04:40:09.400 align:start position:0%
all the time I don't have the inflation
 
04:40:10.868 --> 04:40:10.878 align:start position:0%
numbers I'd have to really look at them
 
04:40:12.948 --> 04:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
and I could certainly ask you about that
 
04:40:15.628 --> 04:40:15.638 align:start position:0%
but part of what this bill is trying to
 
04:40:20.708 --> 04:40:20.718 align:start position:0%
do is to make up to to get us to a point
 
04:40:23.910 --> 04:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
where we're closer to a
 
04:40:27.830 --> 04:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
floor so that people who are making the
 
04:40:31.270 --> 04:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
10 11 12 or even the people of making
 
04:40:33.670 --> 04:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
the 5,000 people that are still making
 
04:40:39.190 --> 04:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
725 are not living in abject poverty or
 
04:40:41.628 --> 04:40:41.638 align:start position:0%
constant economic anxiety when work
 
04:40:43.948 --> 04:40:43.958 align:start position:0%
fulltime so if you need the statistics I
 
04:40:46.990 --> 04:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
can I can try to do that an analytical
 
04:40:49.990 --> 04:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:52.510 --> 04:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you and representative Hall
 
04:40:54.470 --> 04:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
please uh thank you for taking my
 
04:40:57.430 --> 04:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
question uh would you be in favor of
 
04:40:59.230 --> 04:40:59.240 align:start position:0%
making the minimum wage in New Hampshire
 
04:41:03.750 --> 04:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:07.070 --> 04:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
not I think if we were really serious
 
04:41:11.948 --> 04:41:11.958 align:start position:0%
about the value of valuing work
 
04:41:14.948 --> 04:41:14.958 align:start position:0%
and an understanding that all work has
 
04:41:17.430 --> 04:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
dignity in the state no matter what it
 
04:41:21.150 --> 04:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
is and no matter who does it um that we
 
04:41:24.310 --> 04:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
should take a look at what it takes to
 
04:41:27.350 --> 04:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
survive in the state of New Hampshire so
 
04:41:30.510 --> 04:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
that you are not living in constant
 
04:41:32.910 --> 04:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
economic um anxiety so that you can
 
04:41:36.110 --> 04:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
afford even a one-bedroom apartment and
 
04:41:38.510 --> 04:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
you can afford to clothe and feed your
 
04:41:41.830 --> 04:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
children um if you are one of those um
 
04:41:44.070 --> 04:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
you know a wage earner who's trying to
 
04:41:47.150 --> 04:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
um support a family I don't think that
 
04:41:49.390 --> 04:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
the cost of living requires that to be
 
04:41:52.670 --> 04:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
$50 an hour yet but I do think if you
 
04:41:57.030 --> 04:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
look at the statistics that 50 uh $10 an
 
04:41:58.830 --> 04:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
hour gets us closer than where we are
 
04:42:01.310 --> 04:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
now $15 an hour gets us closer than
 
04:42:03.550 --> 04:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
where we are now so that we don't have
 
04:42:05.628 --> 04:42:05.638 align:start position:0%
an escalating homelessness crisis in the
 
04:42:10.070 --> 04:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and so we should
 
04:42:13.990 --> 04:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
care about all people in New
 
04:42:16.590 --> 04:42:16.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire even those For Whom the market
 
04:42:19.150 --> 04:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
is not working should be able to have a
 
04:42:20.948 --> 04:42:20.958 align:start position:0%
roof over their head and put food on the
 
04:42:25.390 --> 04:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
table and the an anal analytics now tell
 
04:42:28.708 --> 04:42:28.718 align:start position:0%
us that that's about 20 or $21 an hour
 
04:42:30.590 --> 04:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
we're not saying that it's it
 
04:42:32.510 --> 04:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
realistically New Hampshire doesn't move
 
04:42:34.910 --> 04:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
that quickly and so what this bill is
 
04:42:37.830 --> 04:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
trying to do is to get us to someplace
 
04:42:39.750 --> 04:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
better than where we are
 
04:42:42.788 --> 04:42:42.798 align:start position:0%
now thank you so much and seeing no
 
04:42:44.628 --> 04:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
questions thank you ma'am I appreciate
 
04:42:46.430 --> 04:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
your testimony again thank you so much
 
04:42:51.868 --> 04:42:51.878 align:start position:0%
sir and I'd like to call uh Viola
 
04:42:57.550 --> 04:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:00.708 --> 04:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
ma'am good afternoon uh my name is Viola
 
04:43:04.430 --> 04:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
ksim for the record and um I'm here on
 
04:43:06.190 --> 04:43:06.200 align:start position:0%
behalf of the gr State organizing
 
04:43:08.628 --> 04:43:08.638 align:start position:0%
project we are grassroot organization
 
04:43:11.670 --> 04:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
that's best in um in manchest but we
 
04:43:13.948 --> 04:43:13.958 align:start position:0%
represent different regions uh Upper
 
04:43:18.230 --> 04:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
Valley uh the mil soan Valley um and the
 
04:43:21.110 --> 04:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
the other pieces of the hillsbor county
 
04:43:22.510 --> 04:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
um and our goal is really to bring
 
04:43:24.830 --> 04:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
people together uh we bring uh Faith
 
04:43:26.470 --> 04:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
communities we bring people that are
 
04:43:29.350 --> 04:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
interested in economic Justice and also
 
04:43:31.868 --> 04:43:31.878 align:start position:0%
uh fairness uh as well as labor unions
 
04:43:33.990 --> 04:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
and the goal is to make sure that we are
 
04:43:35.750 --> 04:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
working towards a New Hampshire that
 
04:43:38.708 --> 04:43:38.718 align:start position:0%
allows people to thrive um and so we're
 
04:43:41.948 --> 04:43:41.958 align:start position:0%
here to support uh HB 726
 
04:43:44.070 --> 04:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
um on the notion that this support is
 
04:43:47.110 --> 04:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
not only from gsop but also uh we've
 
04:43:49.310 --> 04:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
seen policies that lift the wage flow
 
04:43:52.070 --> 04:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
being supported um across New Hampshire
 
04:43:55.270 --> 04:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh in May 2021 there was a poll that was
 
04:43:58.628 --> 04:43:58.638 align:start position:0%
commissioned by the public policy um
 
04:44:01.310 --> 04:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
polling and of that they uh they pulled
 
04:44:02.910 --> 04:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
voters in New Hampshire and they found
 
04:44:05.910 --> 04:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
out that 63% of New Hamshire voters
 
04:44:08.270 --> 04:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
voters supported a gradual increase of
 
04:44:11.948 --> 04:44:11.958 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 20
 
04:44:15.310 --> 04:44:15.320 align:start position:0%
25 um of that section of Voters that
 
04:44:17.590 --> 04:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
were pulled uh six
 
04:44:20.990 --> 04:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
56% were in support of increasing the
 
04:44:22.510 --> 04:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
subminimum wage that we just talked
 
04:44:26.110 --> 04:44:26.120 align:start position:0%
about in the last bill to $15 an hour by
 
04:44:29.948 --> 04:44:29.958 align:start position:0%
2027 so this is not just um something
 
04:44:32.390 --> 04:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's not supported wide wide uh not
 
04:44:34.708 --> 04:44:34.718 align:start position:0%
Statewide but it is it has a lot of
 
04:44:37.310 --> 04:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
ground Roots uh support and I can just
 
04:44:40.590 --> 04:44:40.600 align:start position:0%
add on to say that um this last election
 
04:44:42.230 --> 04:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
we went around uh in different
 
04:44:44.788 --> 04:44:44.798 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods uh speaking with voters on
 
04:44:46.430 --> 04:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
a nonpartisan issue just kind of trying
 
04:44:48.070 --> 04:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
to figure out where people were and what
 
04:44:50.830 --> 04:44:50.840 align:start position:0%
they cared about um we talked to nearly
 
04:44:53.510 --> 04:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
10,000 bers I knocked on 10,000 doors
 
04:44:56.670 --> 04:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
and talked to nearly 1,400 bers and of
 
04:44:59.350 --> 04:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
all the people that we spoke to um the
 
04:45:02.030 --> 04:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
biggest uh concerns were housing costs
 
04:45:03.868 --> 04:45:03.878 align:start position:0%
child care costs as well as health care
 
04:45:07.150 --> 04:45:07.160 align:start position:0%
costs um and uh several of them talked
 
04:45:08.830 --> 04:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
about how wages were very low in New
 
04:45:11.590 --> 04:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so this is again something
 
04:45:13.070 --> 04:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
that keeps coming up in most of your
 
04:45:14.628 --> 04:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
districts if you haven't talked to your
 
04:45:18.150 --> 04:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
constituents you should um and so I want
 
04:45:20.350 --> 04:45:20.360 align:start position:0%
to highlight U some of the studies that
 
04:45:23.910 --> 04:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
have been mentioned earlier um the New
 
04:45:25.750 --> 04:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the National Low Income
 
04:45:28.230 --> 04:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
Housing Coalition which is a national
 
04:45:30.070 --> 04:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
advocacy group uh that works around
 
04:45:33.110 --> 04:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
housing mostly cering to people that are
 
04:45:35.990 --> 04:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
extremely low income um has studies out
 
04:45:39.430 --> 04:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
there and they indicate that a worker
 
04:45:42.708 --> 04:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
that's making $7 and 25 cents an hour uh
 
04:45:46.230 --> 04:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
they need to work 140 hours a week if
 
04:45:47.990 --> 04:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
they want to afford a one-bedroom
 
04:45:50.470 --> 04:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
apartment at market rate which is around
 
04:45:57.390 --> 04:45:57.400 align:start position:0%
$1,300 a month um and um for that um uh
 
04:45:59.788 --> 04:45:59.798 align:start position:0%
the the actual uh housing wage for New
 
04:46:02.310 --> 04:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is around
 
04:46:04.750 --> 04:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
$25.33 according to the national income
 
04:46:06.628 --> 04:46:06.638 align:start position:0%
housing um
 
04:46:09.910 --> 04:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
Coalition and so for for one bedroom so
 
04:46:11.670 --> 04:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
someone has to be making a around that
 
04:46:13.590 --> 04:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
that wage to afford a one bedroom in New
 
04:46:15.708 --> 04:46:15.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh and we know that our
 
04:46:18.708 --> 04:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
current rate of 725 cents an hour uh we
 
04:46:20.510 --> 04:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
are very far from
 
04:46:23.070 --> 04:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
that um I also want
 
04:46:26.510 --> 04:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
to highlight that uh when I was uh this
 
04:46:29.110 --> 04:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
was back years back when I was um
 
04:46:31.750 --> 04:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
working at one of the stores Macy I used
 
04:46:35.868 --> 04:46:35.878 align:start position:0%
to make $88.50 an hour and at the time I
 
04:46:37.190 --> 04:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
used to take every shift that was
 
04:46:38.990 --> 04:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
available and sometimes closing until
 
04:46:42.150 --> 04:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
like midnight um and I just remember
 
04:46:44.868 --> 04:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
working I didn't have a life and I was
 
04:46:46.590 --> 04:46:46.600 align:start position:0%
the I was I was an individual I didn't
 
04:46:48.270 --> 04:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
have a household I didn't have anyone to
 
04:46:50.350 --> 04:46:50.360 align:start position:0%
support it was just me paying rent and
 
04:46:52.470 --> 04:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
paying my costs uh living cost and I
 
04:46:54.990 --> 04:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
just remember working non-stop to get
 
04:46:56.590 --> 04:46:56.600 align:start position:0%
every shift that I could so I could pay
 
04:46:58.830 --> 04:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
my rent um and
 
04:47:01.948 --> 04:47:01.958 align:start position:0%
so that is the reality I know a mother
 
04:47:03.708 --> 04:47:03.718 align:start position:0%
through the conversations I was talking
 
04:47:05.150 --> 04:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
about earlier that we had talking to
 
04:47:07.708 --> 04:47:07.718 align:start position:0%
people on the doors uh who's making $10
 
04:47:10.910 --> 04:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
an hour and. 50 and she has two kids and
 
04:47:13.670 --> 04:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
lives in a a one studio apartment uh
 
04:47:15.910 --> 04:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
with her two kids so that's the reality
 
04:47:18.070 --> 04:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
of people in New Hampshire and that's
 
04:47:20.350 --> 04:47:20.360 align:start position:0%
why when we say raising the minimum wage
 
04:47:22.548 --> 04:47:22.558 align:start position:0%
does benefit families we are not talking
 
04:47:24.110 --> 04:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
about just single people we're talking
 
04:47:25.150 --> 04:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
about we're not talking about teenss
 
04:47:28.030 --> 04:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking about families um and so
 
04:47:31.190 --> 04:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
I'm just here to encourage the committee
 
04:47:32.910 --> 04:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
uh to consider raising the minimum wage
 
04:47:34.830 --> 04:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
and supporting this Bill thank you for
 
04:47:36.788 --> 04:47:36.798 align:start position:0%
your time thank you for your time thank
 
04:47:39.270 --> 04:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony uh any questions
 
04:47:42.948 --> 04:47:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:45.230 --> 04:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions thank you ma'am I
 
04:47:46.430 --> 04:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate you coming down and talking
 
04:47:48.910 --> 04:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
to us thank you I'd like to call Mr
 
04:47:54.750 --> 04:47:54.760 align:start position:0%

Trumble please state your name and who
 
04:48:00.948 --> 04:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
your affiliation yes
 
04:48:03.310 --> 04:48:03.320 align:start position:0%
sir hello Mr chairman and committee
 
04:48:05.230 --> 04:48:05.240 align:start position:0%
members my name is David Trumble I'm
 
04:48:07.830 --> 04:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
from the town of whereare um I'm also a
 
04:48:10.390 --> 04:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
small business owner I support this bill
 
04:48:13.230 --> 04:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
for few reasons first is the question of
 
04:48:16.510 --> 04:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
economic dignity you can't live on
 
04:48:18.470 --> 04:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
minimum wage or you can't even live on a
 
04:48:20.670 --> 04:48:20.680 align:start position:0%
little bit more than minimum wage nor
 
04:48:22.510 --> 04:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
support a family you've heard the
 
04:48:25.350 --> 04:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
numbers so New Hampshire is way out of
 
04:48:26.910 --> 04:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
touch with the rest of the country it's
 
04:48:28.788 --> 04:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
not just all the New England states that
 
04:48:30.548 --> 04:48:30.558 align:start position:0%
have higher minimum wages this year
 
04:48:34.628 --> 04:48:34.638 align:start position:0%
alone in 2025 23 states are raising
 
04:48:37.030 --> 04:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
their minimum wage in Missouri in the
 
04:48:40.190 --> 04:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
last election 58% of the people in that
 
04:48:42.150 --> 04:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
state voted to raise their minimum wage
 
04:48:45.548 --> 04:48:45.558 align:start position:0%
to 1375 they just did it and going up to
 
04:48:48.590 --> 04:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
$15 next year this is not just the New
 
04:48:50.590 --> 04:48:50.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire versus the rest of New England
 
04:48:52.830 --> 04:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
we are out of touch with the entire rest
 
04:48:55.510 --> 04:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
of the country it's not just the people
 
04:48:58.150 --> 04:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
who earn the very lowest wage that would
 
04:49:00.590 --> 04:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
be benefited by this but also it would
 
04:49:02.270 --> 04:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
set a floor that would help the people
 
04:49:04.030 --> 04:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
ear earn a little bit more than the
 
04:49:06.350 --> 04:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
lowest I know that in my own business
 
04:49:07.948 --> 04:49:07.958 align:start position:0%
you want to have good workers you pay
 
04:49:09.510 --> 04:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
them a little bit more than somebody who
 
04:49:11.868 --> 04:49:11.878 align:start position:0%
just starts with with you so if you have
 
04:49:13.510 --> 04:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
a minimum wage that means people who
 
04:49:16.150 --> 04:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
make a little more than the minimum more
 
04:49:17.510 --> 04:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
than what you're paying your starter
 
04:49:19.110 --> 04:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
workers would get up so that means
 
04:49:22.510 --> 04:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
people who make 15 16 17 $18 an hour
 
04:49:24.230 --> 04:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
would benefit from this as well this is
 
04:49:26.070 --> 04:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
people at the lower end of the of the
 
04:49:28.548 --> 04:49:28.558 align:start position:0%
bracket you asked for some statistics
 
04:49:30.990 --> 04:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
about New Hampshire there was a study
 
04:49:32.788 --> 04:49:32.798 align:start position:0%
specific to New Hampshire done by the
 
04:49:36.030 --> 04:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization Oxfam America and
 
04:49:37.670 --> 04:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
they reported this I'll I'll hand in
 
04:49:39.350 --> 04:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
written testimony it was in public news
 
04:49:42.150 --> 04:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
service July 30th of last year they said
 
04:49:44.548 --> 04:49:44.558 align:start position:0%
that more than 130,000 New Hampshire
 
04:49:46.708 --> 04:49:46.718 align:start position:0%
workers would benefit from a raise in
 
04:49:48.910 --> 04:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
the federal minimum wage and that it
 
04:49:52.030 --> 04:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
would include the more than 20% of women
 
04:49:54.830 --> 04:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
in the state who earn less than $17 an
 
04:49:57.270 --> 04:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
hour who make up the bulk of the state's
 
04:50:00.030 --> 04:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
child care and Elder Care WorkForce One
 
04:50:02.990 --> 04:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
in every five women in this state make
 
04:50:05.670 --> 04:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
less than $17 an hour if you pass this
 
04:50:08.868 --> 04:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
bill you will be helping 20% of women go
 
04:50:10.788 --> 04:50:10.798 align:start position:0%
to the grocery store on your way home
 
04:50:13.310 --> 04:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
tonight one out of every five women you
 
04:50:15.788 --> 04:50:15.798 align:start position:0%
see would benefit if you pass this plan
 
04:50:17.150 --> 04:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
and these folks are struggling to
 
04:50:18.510 --> 04:50:18.520 align:start position:0%
support their own families and that
 
04:50:20.628 --> 04:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
Oxfam report also said that the
 
04:50:22.430 --> 04:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
overwhelming majority of low wage
 
04:50:24.590 --> 04:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
earners this is New Hampshire are over
 
04:50:27.510 --> 04:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
the age of 20 you already heard that the
 
04:50:28.990 --> 04:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
other thing that comes up is the
 
04:50:31.310 --> 04:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
question of what's the economic impact
 
04:50:34.390 --> 04:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
of raising minimum wages and you heard
 
04:50:36.030 --> 04:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
their studies that go this way and that
 
04:50:37.750 --> 04:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
way I'll just leave you with a few that
 
04:50:39.070 --> 04:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
would suggest that it would be
 
04:50:41.948 --> 04:50:41.958 align:start position:0%
positively beneficial first is it helps
 
04:50:45.628 --> 04:50:45.638 align:start position:0%
economic growth this study um was done
 
04:50:48.350 --> 04:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
by uh the center for American progress
 
04:50:51.070 --> 04:50:51.080 align:start position:0%
in 2023 they looked at the 30 states
 
04:50:53.110 --> 04:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
that have minimum wages higher than the
 
04:50:55.030 --> 04:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
federal wage which is what we have and
 
04:50:57.670 --> 04:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
they looked at their recovery from 21 to
 
04:51:00.110 --> 04:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
23 they had a
 
04:51:03.590 --> 04:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
38% industrywide growth double that of
 
04:51:05.230 --> 04:51:05.240 align:start position:0%
the states that used the federal minimum
 
04:51:07.670 --> 04:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
wage with a 19% growth so other words
 
04:51:10.430 --> 04:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
when you have a higher minimum wage you
 
04:51:12.350 --> 04:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
have more money circling through your
 
04:51:15.750 --> 04:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
local economy if you have the money
 
04:51:17.390 --> 04:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
somehow gets divided up in this country
 
04:51:19.190 --> 04:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
into pies if it's going to the very
 
04:51:21.910 --> 04:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
richest people it's not staying in New
 
04:51:24.110 --> 04:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if you give more wages to the
 
04:51:26.070 --> 04:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
people who work in your communities
 
04:51:27.830 --> 04:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to spend more of it Henry
 
04:51:30.390 --> 04:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
Ford found that out he raised wages when
 
04:51:32.390 --> 04:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
he set up the first automobile plant a
 
04:51:34.628 --> 04:51:34.638 align:start position:0%
100 years ago so that his workers could
 
04:51:37.190 --> 04:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
then turn around and buy cars there's
 
04:51:38.590 --> 04:51:38.600 align:start position:0%
other studies somebody mentioned
 
04:51:40.910 --> 04:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
turnover in productivity this was done
 
04:51:42.708 --> 04:51:42.718 align:start position:0%
by the center for economic policy
 
04:51:44.670 --> 04:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
research and they looked at data over
 
04:51:46.390 --> 04:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
the last 30 years and they said that
 
04:51:48.830 --> 04:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
actually it is more cost effective for
 
04:51:51.190 --> 04:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
employers to pay a higher wage because
 
04:51:53.230 --> 04:51:53.240 align:start position:0%
they don't have to retrain people as
 
04:51:55.910 --> 04:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
often if you pay a decent wage you'll be
 
04:51:58.110 --> 04:51:58.120 align:start position:0%
able to keep your workers that in the
 
04:52:00.510 --> 04:52:00.520 align:start position:0%
long run increases productivity reduces
 
04:52:02.590 --> 04:52:02.600 align:start position:0%
the cost of retraining and then the last
 
04:52:04.230 --> 04:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
question was one about does it cause
 
04:52:06.230 --> 04:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
unemployment this one is from the
 
04:52:09.190 --> 04:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
quarterly Journal of economics in 2019
 
04:52:12.070 --> 04:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
they looked at 37 years of research
 
04:52:13.948 --> 04:52:13.958 align:start position:0%
comparing States and they also look at
 
04:52:16.470 --> 04:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
counties that are like between states
 
04:52:18.350 --> 04:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
and they found the overall number of low
 
04:52:21.230 --> 04:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
wage jobs remained essentially unchanged
 
04:52:22.868 --> 04:52:22.878 align:start position:0%
five years following an increase in
 
04:52:25.628 --> 04:52:25.638 align:start position:0%
minimum wage and the union leader just
 
04:52:28.470 --> 04:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
had a report on this in January 5th of
 
04:52:31.750 --> 04:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
25 and they they cited a 2015 study from
 
04:52:33.910 --> 04:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth College that a minimum wage
 
04:52:35.830 --> 04:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
hike would have not likely have
 
04:52:37.310 --> 04:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
significant negative effects on
 
04:52:38.708 --> 04:52:38.718 align:start position:0%
employment in New Hampshire so in other
 
04:52:40.590 --> 04:52:40.600 align:start position:0%
words what I'm trying to say is that if
 
04:52:42.548 --> 04:52:42.558 align:start position:0%
raise the minimum wage you're going to
 
04:52:43.990 --> 04:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
have more money circling through your
 
04:52:46.270 --> 04:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
local economies it's going to benefit
 
04:52:48.150 --> 04:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire the
 
04:52:49.990 --> 04:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
government is always making economic
 
04:52:51.750 --> 04:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
decisions we're trying to get a $4
 
04:52:54.150 --> 04:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
trillion doll tax cut mostly through the
 
04:52:55.590 --> 04:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
wealthy through the federal government
 
04:52:57.628 --> 04:52:57.638 align:start position:0%
that's the first item on the agenda we
 
04:53:00.270 --> 04:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
just had a big tax cut 180 million in
 
04:53:02.110 --> 04:53:02.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the interest and dividends
 
04:53:04.190 --> 04:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
tax most of which went to the wealthiest
 
04:53:05.830 --> 04:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
people in the state the government is
 
04:53:07.750 --> 04:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
always putting its thumb on the scale
 
04:53:09.390 --> 04:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
the question here is are you willing to
 
04:53:10.830 --> 04:53:10.840 align:start position:0%
put your thumb on the scale said we're
 
04:53:12.270 --> 04:53:12.280 align:start position:0%
willing to help the people on the lowest
 
04:53:14.150 --> 04:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
end of the income scale I think it's
 
04:53:15.510 --> 04:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
time for New Hampshire to catch up with
 
04:53:17.110 --> 04:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
Missouri and the rest of the country
 
04:53:17.120 --> 04:53:18.350 align:start position:0%
Missouri and the rest of the country
thank

name is Christine cyber and I'm from um
 
04:54:01.470 --> 04:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
I represent Hillsboro district 21 which
 
04:54:02.910 --> 04:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
is Ward one in
 
04:54:05.310 --> 04:54:05.320 align:start position:0%
Manchester and I just wanted to add a
 
04:54:07.708 --> 04:54:07.718 align:start position:0%
little bit to the conversation here I
 
04:54:09.350 --> 04:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say me and my
 
04:54:12.230 --> 04:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
constituents fully support this
 
04:54:14.750 --> 04:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
legislation um when I go around and talk
 
04:54:18.910 --> 04:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
to my constituents um I often talk to I
 
04:54:20.190 --> 04:54:20.200 align:start position:0%
don't talk to you just because you have
 
04:54:22.670 --> 04:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
a d behind your name you know I talk to
 
04:54:24.350 --> 04:54:24.360 align:start position:0%
anybody who's outside working in their
 
04:54:27.110 --> 04:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
yard that type of a thing and this issue
 
04:54:29.948 --> 04:54:29.958 align:start position:0%
very specifically has been brought up to
 
04:54:33.150 --> 04:54:33.160 align:start position:0%
me um you know just with them bringing
 
04:54:36.948 --> 04:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
it up not me instigating that um that it
 
04:54:39.990 --> 04:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
has a lot of bipartisan support um from
 
04:54:42.030 --> 04:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
across the board it's it's a big issue
 
04:54:43.230 --> 04:54:43.240 align:start position:0%
to a lot of
 
04:54:46.190 --> 04:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
people um and then also I just wanted to
 
04:54:48.510 --> 04:54:48.520 align:start position:0%
bring up having worked um for minimum
 
04:54:51.910 --> 04:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
wage before um back when it was like 525
 
04:54:56.548 --> 04:54:56.558 align:start position:0%
or something an hour um but um the often
 
04:55:00.350 --> 04:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
the jobs are very labor intensive they
 
04:55:03.390 --> 04:55:03.400 align:start position:0%
also involve um a lot of customer
 
04:55:06.310 --> 04:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
service um face Toof face with customers
 
04:55:08.948 --> 04:55:08.958 align:start position:0%
that type of thing um and it's often a
 
04:55:11.270 --> 04:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
very like you know not the most
 
04:55:13.670 --> 04:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
conducive environments it's it tends to
 
04:55:15.948 --> 04:55:15.958 align:start position:0%
be underst staffed so it puts a lot of
 
04:55:17.830 --> 04:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
work on the workers so these folks work
 
04:55:21.310 --> 04:55:21.320 align:start position:0%
really really hard and I would just like
 
04:55:23.830 --> 04:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
to add that you know it would be helpful
 
04:55:26.628 --> 04:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
for the overall morality of our society
 
04:55:30.270 --> 04:55:30.280 align:start position:0%
to do this um and I believe worker in
 
04:55:32.990 --> 04:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
output will also be affected in a
 
04:55:36.708 --> 04:55:36.718 align:start position:0%
positive way um so thank you and I hope
 
04:55:39.830 --> 04:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
you support this legislation well thank
 
04:55:41.030 --> 04:55:41.040 align:start position:0%

afternoon um I'm here to support the
 
04:56:23.910 --> 04:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
bill um as a person of faith I believe
 
04:56:26.470 --> 04:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
that every worker deserves respect and a
 
04:56:29.708 --> 04:56:29.718 align:start position:0%
living wage for so their Labor uh for
 
04:56:31.990 --> 04:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
their labor so that they can provide for
 
04:56:33.670 --> 04:56:33.680 align:start position:0%

Care and education um um I I have
 
04:56:43.948 --> 04:56:43.958 align:start position:0%
submitted this in the portal so I'll try
 
04:56:46.110 --> 04:56:46.120 align:start position:0%
to summarize there are four points that
 
04:56:47.628 --> 04:56:47.638 align:start position:0%
I would really like to bring to your
 
04:56:49.910 --> 04:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
attention one is that today the federal
 
04:56:52.110 --> 04:56:52.120 align:start position:0%
minimum wage remains at the same level
 
04:56:54.910 --> 04:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
that it was in 2009 at
 
04:56:58.350 --> 04:56:58.360 align:start position:0%
$725 an hour there are 5,000 workers in
 
04:57:02.230 --> 04:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who earn um at or below
 
04:57:05.910 --> 04:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
the 725 an hour there are 10,000 who
 
04:57:09.070 --> 04:57:09.080 align:start position:0%
earn less than $10 an hour 19,000 who
 
04:57:12.990 --> 04:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
earn less than $12 an hour and 61,000
 
04:57:15.628 --> 04:57:15.638 align:start position:0%
who earn less than $15 an hour that's
 
04:57:18.350 --> 04:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
nearly one in 10 of workers in our
 
04:57:20.670 --> 04:57:20.680 align:start position:0%
states and not all of them are teenagers
 
04:57:23.230 --> 04:57:23.240 align:start position:0%
ear working for their first job I'm a
 
04:57:25.390 --> 04:57:25.400 align:start position:0%
retired teacher and I know that many of
 
04:57:27.948 --> 04:57:27.958 align:start position:0%
my students um were working while they
 
04:57:29.350 --> 04:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
were in high school because their
 
04:57:32.230 --> 04:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
parents expected them to be able to take
 
04:57:35.470 --> 04:57:35.480 align:start position:0%
on um paying for their clothing their
 
04:57:37.548 --> 04:57:37.558 align:start position:0%
school supplies and even to contribute
 
04:57:41.270 --> 04:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
to the family um bills
 
04:57:42.670 --> 04:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
um the second thing I'd like to point
 
04:57:45.070 --> 04:57:45.080 align:start position:0%
out is that if a worker was working 40
 
04:57:48.990 --> 04:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
hours a week 52 weeks a year which is um
 
04:57:51.910 --> 04:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
the maximum that they could work at a
 
04:57:54.190 --> 04:57:54.200 align:start position:0%
minim at the minimum wage they would be
 
04:57:54.200 --> 04:57:57.150 align:start position:0%
minim at the minimum wage they would be
earning

04:57:57.150 --> 04:57:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:00.548 --> 04:58:00.558 align:start position:0%
$15,804 they would be earning
 
04:58:04.868 --> 04:58:04.878 align:start position:0%
$2,080 a $800 a year and even at $15 an
 
04:58:07.310 --> 04:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
hour it's
 
04:58:07.320 --> 04:58:08.868 align:start position:0%
hour it's
$31,200

04:58:08.868 --> 04:58:08.878 align:start position:0%
$31,200
 
04:58:14.548 --> 04:58:14.558 align:start position:0%
um the federal poverty level in 2025 for
 
04:58:17.230 --> 04:58:17.240 align:start position:0%
an individual is
 
04:58:19.150 --> 04:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
$5,650 which is more than what you're
 
04:58:21.110 --> 04:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
earning at the minimum wage so the
 
04:58:23.750 --> 04:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
minimum wage as it currently stands as a
 
04:58:28.590 --> 04:58:28.600 align:start position:0%
poverty wage and even for at $10 an hour
 
04:58:32.350 --> 04:58:32.360 align:start position:0%
um the wage the poverty level for a
 
04:58:34.628 --> 04:58:34.638 align:start position:0%
couple is
 
04:58:37.390 --> 04:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
$2,150 so again that's still a poverty
 
04:58:40.948 --> 04:58:40.958 align:start position:0%
wage um we know from the MIT um living
 
04:58:44.150 --> 04:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
wage calculator that the living wage for
 
04:58:47.190 --> 04:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
a single person in Coos County is nearly
 
04:58:50.190 --> 04:58:50.200 align:start position:0%
$19 an hour and in Rockingham County
 
04:58:54.670 --> 04:58:54.680 align:start position:0%
it's over $25 an hour almost $26 an hour
 
04:58:56.270 --> 04:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
um all the other counties fall in
 
04:59:00.310 --> 04:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
between that but the point is is that um
 
04:59:02.190 --> 04:59:02.200 align:start position:0%
it's two and a half to three and a half
 
04:59:04.788 --> 04:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
times what the minimum wage is to have a
 
04:59:07.390 --> 04:59:07.400 align:start position:0%
to earn a living wage in the state of
 
04:59:07.400 --> 04:59:08.190 align:start position:0%
to earn a living wage in the state of
New

04:59:08.190 --> 04:59:08.200 align:start position:0%
New
 
04:59:12.670 --> 04:59:12.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so so this this bill which
 
04:59:15.948 --> 04:59:15.958 align:start position:0%
proposes raising the minimum wage to $15
 
04:59:21.270 --> 04:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
an hour in in in increments um even at
 
04:59:25.670 --> 04:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
in 2028 the $15 an hour will be well
 
04:59:28.350 --> 04:59:28.360 align:start position:0%
below the living what a living wage is
 
04:59:31.310 --> 04:59:31.320 align:start position:0%
now and certainly will be in three years
 
04:59:33.350 --> 04:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
so my third point is that I would
 
04:59:35.990 --> 04:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
implore you to recognize that we have a
 
04:59:39.110 --> 04:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
divided State and I'm not talking about
 
04:59:40.190 --> 04:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
politically I'm talking about
 
04:59:44.030 --> 04:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
economically we have we have fully 25%
 
04:59:45.990 --> 04:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
of the households in New Hampshire earn
 
04:59:49.628 --> 04:59:49.638 align:start position:0%
less than $50,000 a year and are
 
04:59:53.948 --> 04:59:53.958 align:start position:0%
financially insecure and cannot um
 
04:59:57.190 --> 04:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
maintain the can struggle to pay for
 
05:00:00.030 --> 05:00:00.040 align:start position:0%
their daily bills um we pride ourselves
 
05:00:04.030 --> 05:00:04.040 align:start position:0%
on having a strong economy and um and
 
05:00:06.910 --> 05:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
for people to be independent but this is
 
05:00:09.030 --> 05:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
my last point that I would ask you to
 
05:00:11.230 --> 05:00:11.240 align:start position:0%
think about the other impact of minimum
 
05:00:16.750 --> 05:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
wage is that um in some places companies
 
05:00:19.868 --> 05:00:19.878 align:start position:0%
expect their pay their employees to make
 
05:00:22.190 --> 05:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
up the differences that they need by
 
05:00:24.830 --> 05:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
applying for public assistance and my
 
05:00:28.030 --> 05:00:28.040 align:start position:0%
point is that if that public assistance
 
05:00:30.670 --> 05:00:30.680 align:start position:0%
is coming at the at an expense to the
 
05:00:32.788 --> 05:00:32.798 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so basically we are
 
05:00:35.150 --> 05:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
subsidizing businesses and I feel
 
05:00:36.910 --> 05:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
strongly the businesses should be able
 
05:00:40.430 --> 05:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
to survive on their own and to pay
 
05:00:44.350 --> 05:00:44.360 align:start position:0%
um their workers sufficiently well thank
 
05:00:47.190 --> 05:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
you thank you ma'am I appreciate your
 
05:00:49.350 --> 05:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
testimony subject
 
05:00:51.948 --> 05:00:51.958 align:start position:0%
to representative lab's question I just
 
05:00:53.270 --> 05:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
have one question thank you Mr chair
 
05:00:56.430 --> 05:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
please ma'am you said uh at $15 and in
 
05:00:58.628 --> 05:00:58.638 align:start position:0%
uh 2028 would still be far below the
 
05:01:01.590 --> 05:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
living wage is that is that right yes I
 
05:01:03.750 --> 05:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
okay is this really the right
 
05:01:06.708 --> 05:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
Bill to solve that
 
05:01:06.718 --> 05:01:08.510 align:start position:0%
Bill to solve that
problem

05:01:08.510 --> 05:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
problem
 
05:01:11.030 --> 05:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
um I think raising the minimum wage
 
05:01:14.310 --> 05:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
would certainly help it's not it's not
 
05:01:16.190 --> 05:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
the full answer but at least it's a
 
05:01:19.230 --> 05:01:19.240 align:start position:0%
start okay thank you at $15 an hour it's
 
05:01:22.270 --> 05:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
twice what we get over twice what we're
 
05:01:24.070 --> 05:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
paying now understood thank you okay
 
05:01:28.150 --> 05:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:30.548 --> 05:01:30.558 align:start position:0%
McKenzie so we've heard during the
 
05:01:34.270 --> 05:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
course of the testimony that uh when you
 
05:01:36.310 --> 05:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
ask somebody well who's actually paying
 
05:01:37.868 --> 05:01:37.878 align:start position:0%
minimum wage in the
 
05:01:42.510 --> 05:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
state um and the qu the question I have
 
05:01:48.670 --> 05:01:48.680 align:start position:0%
uh is uh it does it come down to
 
05:01:51.910 --> 05:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
employers uh who may stipulate that
 
05:01:53.990 --> 05:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
nobody's paying 725 but they don't want
 
05:01:57.708 --> 05:01:57.718 align:start position:0%
to pay 15 can you can you give any
 
05:02:02.350 --> 05:02:02.360 align:start position:0%
insight into into what's behind that uh
 
05:02:04.430 --> 05:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of whether they control Le the
 
05:02:06.070 --> 05:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
market but they actually control the
 
05:02:07.708 --> 05:02:07.718 align:start position:0%
wages they want to go up and down which
 
05:02:10.110 --> 05:02:10.120 align:start position:0%
is what we heard I I know it's a
 
05:02:12.948 --> 05:02:12.958 align:start position:0%
question to frame so if you can't answer
 
05:02:15.788 --> 05:02:15.798 align:start position:0%
it fine um I'm sorry I'm not an
 
05:02:19.470 --> 05:02:19.480 align:start position:0%
economist and so I really I'm a teacher
 
05:02:21.750 --> 05:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
yes I don't have the answer to that
 
05:02:25.310 --> 05:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
question I I guess I would say one thing
 
05:02:27.910 --> 05:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
is that um you know there are always
 
05:02:30.948 --> 05:02:30.958 align:start position:0%
arguments I I've also as as the one of
 
05:02:32.910 --> 05:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
the representatives spoke I I've I've
 
05:02:34.990 --> 05:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
run for office and I've spoken to a lot
 
05:02:37.670 --> 05:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
of people and people are very concerned
 
05:02:39.830 --> 05:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
about this but one I remember one person
 
05:02:41.948 --> 05:02:41.958 align:start position:0%
and saying well if we raise the wages
 
05:02:44.470 --> 05:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
then everything else will go up but um I
 
05:02:46.788 --> 05:02:46.798 align:start position:0%
think I would agree with Mr trumble's
 
05:02:49.350 --> 05:02:49.360 align:start position:0%
point that people who are not earning a
 
05:02:51.270 --> 05:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
lot of money put all that money back
 
05:02:54.190 --> 05:02:54.200 align:start position:0%
into the local
 
05:02:57.230 --> 05:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
economy okay thank you so much ma'am for
 
05:02:58.830 --> 05:02:58.840 align:start position:0%

744 and ask that you uh pass this bill
 
05:04:39.750 --> 05:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
now let me uh this is a a little
 
05:04:41.628 --> 05:04:41.638 align:start position:0%
complicated let me see if I can break
 
05:04:43.868 --> 05:04:43.878 align:start position:0%
this down as best I
 
05:04:47.350 --> 05:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
can but I sent out to you and I numbered
 
05:04:49.310 --> 05:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
the pages and please if it's a little
 
05:04:52.948 --> 05:04:52.958 align:start position:0%
messy uh I'm sorry about that but I
 
05:04:54.708 --> 05:04:54.718 align:start position:0%
wanted to give you a sense of kind of
 
05:04:56.788 --> 05:04:56.798 align:start position:0%
where the industry was and we started
 
05:04:59.788 --> 05:04:59.798 align:start position:0%
through all of these reforms this
 
05:05:02.708 --> 05:05:02.718 align:start position:0%
particular volume this book right here
 
05:05:05.110 --> 05:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh is a 20y year about a 20 somewhat
 
05:05:08.510 --> 05:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
year uh history of the uh workers
 
05:05:10.830 --> 05:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
compensation changes
 
05:05:12.190 --> 05:05:12.200 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think a whole lot of people
 
05:05:13.670 --> 05:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
have this information I've shared it
 
05:05:16.030 --> 05:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
with people but this gives you a sense
 
05:05:19.230 --> 05:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
of what was what's been going on with uh
 
05:05:21.868 --> 05:05:21.878 align:start position:0%
with unemploy with workers compensation
 
05:05:24.788 --> 05:05:24.798 align:start position:0%
so back in the U in the
 
05:05:28.150 --> 05:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
90s the system was in uh it was in a
 
05:05:30.948 --> 05:05:30.958 align:start position:0%
crisis uh we had hollowed out most of
 
05:05:33.990 --> 05:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
the uh people who were uh who were
 
05:05:35.470 --> 05:05:35.480 align:start position:0%
willing to write insurance in New
 
05:05:38.910 --> 05:05:38.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we ended up uh with and if
 
05:05:41.070 --> 05:05:41.080 align:start position:0%
you look at page 5 you can see at the
 
05:05:43.590 --> 05:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
bottom of the paragraph uh there was a
 
05:05:47.590 --> 05:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
proposed rate which was in the 33% range
 
05:05:50.788 --> 05:05:50.798 align:start position:0%
um so th this and it ended up they
 
05:05:52.390 --> 05:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't accept that it ended up in the
 
05:05:54.590 --> 05:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
12% rate but what what essentially
 
05:05:56.548 --> 05:05:56.558 align:start position:0%
happened everybody was every all the
 
05:05:58.548 --> 05:05:58.558 align:start position:0%
employee insurance companies left New
 
05:06:00.150 --> 05:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with the exception of
 
05:06:02.868 --> 05:06:02.878 align:start position:0%
one so there were a number of study
 
05:06:04.350 --> 05:06:04.360 align:start position:0%
committees that occurred over the course
 
05:06:07.510 --> 05:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
of the years um there was one that was
 
05:06:10.190 --> 05:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
uh the Greg uh Governor Greg put
 
05:06:13.390 --> 05:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
together uh uh there was one prior to
 
05:06:15.948 --> 05:06:15.958 align:start position:0%
the Greg study there was one that Merill
 
05:06:17.548 --> 05:06:17.558 align:start position:0%
put together there was one John Lynch
 
05:06:19.030 --> 05:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
put together so there was a whole bunch
 
05:06:20.708 --> 05:06:20.718 align:start position:0%
of studies that occurred over the course
 
05:06:21.548 --> 05:06:21.558 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:06:26.310 --> 05:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
years now as a uh an advocate and I was
 
05:06:29.830 --> 05:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
in the aflco for a number of years um I
 
05:06:32.670 --> 05:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
worked on a number of those reforms over
 
05:06:35.708 --> 05:06:35.718 align:start position:0%
the course of the years some of which I
 
05:06:39.030 --> 05:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely did not agree with but we we
 
05:06:42.430 --> 05:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
we did what we did um but what it has
 
05:06:45.350 --> 05:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
resulted in is um is this is according
 
05:06:48.150 --> 05:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
to judge uh the attorney was here last
 
05:06:50.150 --> 05:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
week is that the market is much
 
05:06:52.310 --> 05:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
different today the market is a good
 
05:06:54.910 --> 05:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
line of business today and it wasn't
 
05:06:57.350 --> 05:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
when we started through this process so
 
05:07:00.910 --> 05:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
the question is um you know what
 
05:07:02.548 --> 05:07:02.558 align:start position:0%
happened over the course of the years in
 
05:07:04.548 --> 05:07:04.558 align:start position:0%
the market and what changed now I'm not
 
05:07:06.150 --> 05:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
going to go through all these changes
 
05:07:08.910 --> 05:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
because it would I'd be here three days
 
05:07:10.708 --> 05:07:10.718 align:start position:0%
but I'm going focus in on one change
 
05:07:12.590 --> 05:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
that occurred in the system that I think
 
05:07:16.070 --> 05:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
we could uh we could deal with and we
 
05:07:18.150 --> 05:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
could change and it would make a
 
05:07:21.430 --> 05:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
difference to people uh and that is the
 
05:07:24.788 --> 05:07:24.798 align:start position:0%
uh the change that occurred when they
 
05:07:27.990 --> 05:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
reduced the amount that workers get from
 
05:07:30.788 --> 05:07:30.798 align:start position:0%
66 and 23 to
 
05:07:35.150 --> 05:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
60% and this occurred in uh in the 19
 
05:07:37.150 --> 05:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
actually was in
 
05:07:40.310 --> 05:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
1994 but they they took the rate down as
 
05:07:42.708 --> 05:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
one of these ways to control costs and
 
05:07:45.310 --> 05:07:45.320 align:start position:0%
they brought that down and it's been in
 
05:07:46.910 --> 05:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
effect ever since now there's still a
 
05:07:50.110 --> 05:07:50.120 align:start position:0%
few people that are under 66 and 2/3 but
 
05:07:53.030 --> 05:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
for the most part new workers are under
 
05:07:55.628 --> 05:07:55.638 align:start position:0%
60% and the question I have before this
 
05:07:58.430 --> 05:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
committee is whether or not where the
 
05:08:01.190 --> 05:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
market has recovered fairly well well we
 
05:08:02.948 --> 05:08:02.958 align:start position:0%
have a pretty good line of business
 
05:08:05.628 --> 05:08:05.638 align:start position:0%
where people are making money is it time
 
05:08:07.390 --> 05:08:07.400 align:start position:0%
to start taking a look at some of the
 
05:08:09.830 --> 05:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
cuts that were made over the course of
 
05:08:12.350 --> 05:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
these years to bring this Market into
 
05:08:15.868 --> 05:08:15.878 align:start position:0%
line so this is one of them and this has
 
05:08:17.750 --> 05:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
been before this committee more than
 
05:08:20.670 --> 05:08:20.680 align:start position:0%
once and the people behind me know that
 
05:08:22.430 --> 05:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
but I think it's a good way it's a good
 
05:08:25.150 --> 05:08:25.160 align:start position:0%
start it's a good start to bring this up
 
05:08:27.510 --> 05:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
to where it was at one time and restore
 
05:08:30.390 --> 05:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
this so the workers are making at least
 
05:08:34.990 --> 05:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
66 and 2/3 of their pay so that's that's
 
05:08:38.230 --> 05:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
essentially uh what the bill does now
 
05:08:39.948 --> 05:08:39.958 align:start position:0%
there are questions that that have come
 
05:08:41.548 --> 05:08:41.558 align:start position:0%
up with the labor department and some of
 
05:08:43.868 --> 05:08:43.878 align:start position:0%
the lobbyists and I think we need to
 
05:08:46.548 --> 05:08:46.558 align:start position:0%
work on this and one of the things is so
 
05:08:49.628 --> 05:08:49.638 align:start position:0%
where do you draw the line uh in terms
 
05:08:52.750 --> 05:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
of the of of this change if you think of
 
05:08:55.708 --> 05:08:55.718 align:start position:0%
workers compensation as a system like a
 
05:08:57.990 --> 05:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
train moving that people jump on the
 
05:08:59.270 --> 05:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
train and they're going through the
 
05:09:02.230 --> 05:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
system so it's hard to draw a hard line
 
05:09:04.030 --> 05:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
to say this is going to be implemented
 
05:09:05.750 --> 05:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
at this particular point so that's going
 
05:09:07.910 --> 05:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
to be the challenge and I would ask that
 
05:09:10.030 --> 05:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
we put a subcommittee together so we can
 
05:09:11.990 --> 05:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
actually determine if if this is of
 
05:09:13.190 --> 05:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
interest to the committee if they
 
05:09:15.788 --> 05:09:15.798 align:start position:0%
support it where we how we implement
 
05:09:19.750 --> 05:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
this thing uh it was not my uh intention
 
05:09:23.230 --> 05:09:23.240 align:start position:0%
to go retroactively I'm to go back to
 
05:09:25.948 --> 05:09:25.958 align:start position:0%
the beginning but I would want I would
 
05:09:27.868 --> 05:09:27.878 align:start position:0%
want to start this and the there some
 
05:09:31.030 --> 05:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
language the bill itself uh says one
 
05:09:33.030 --> 05:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to startop this but I think
 
05:09:34.628 --> 05:09:34.638 align:start position:0%
I think we need to really look at that
 
05:09:36.390 --> 05:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
because it it's a legitimate thing as
 
05:09:38.670 --> 05:09:38.680 align:start position:0%
the where we started now let me finally
 
05:09:40.310 --> 05:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
say this
 
05:09:43.070 --> 05:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
um this book here represents the changes
 
05:09:45.830 --> 05:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
that took place uh if you think of
 
05:09:48.590 --> 05:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
workers compensation if we don't we get
 
05:09:51.190 --> 05:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
nothing else out of this testimony
 
05:09:53.750 --> 05:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
workers compensation is a is a handshake
 
05:09:56.390 --> 05:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
that took place a number of years ago
 
05:09:59.590 --> 05:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
it's an agreement that employees would
 
05:10:02.310 --> 05:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
not sue their employers they're
 
05:10:04.310 --> 05:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
insulated they have insulated the
 
05:10:07.750 --> 05:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
employers and in exchange for that there
 
05:10:10.190 --> 05:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
was this system of work compensation
 
05:10:12.110 --> 05:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
that was developed to make sure we take
 
05:10:15.150 --> 05:10:15.160 align:start position:0%
care of workers now I got some I have
 
05:10:18.830 --> 05:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
questions about about that and also I
 
05:10:20.708 --> 05:10:20.718 align:start position:0%
have questions about some of the changes
 
05:10:22.830 --> 05:10:22.840 align:start position:0%
that we made we probably should have
 
05:10:24.788 --> 05:10:24.798 align:start position:0%
gone to court years ago as they made
 
05:10:27.350 --> 05:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
these changes but that that be said here
 
05:10:30.350 --> 05:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
we are here's the thing in front of you
 
05:10:32.190 --> 05:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
here's what I think we can change and we
 
05:10:33.868 --> 05:10:33.878 align:start position:0%
can do it and I think you're going to
 
05:10:36.270 --> 05:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
hear a whole lot of people behind me
 
05:10:36.280 --> 05:10:37.150 align:start position:0%
hear a whole lot of people behind me
maybe

05:10:37.150 --> 05:10:37.160 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
05:10:40.110 --> 05:10:40.120 align:start position:0%
disagree but it's time to to kind of
 
05:10:41.990 --> 05:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
restore some of these benefits thank you
 
05:10:45.190 --> 05:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman okay so just to be clear
 
05:10:47.868 --> 05:10:47.878 align:start position:0%
you're introducing this bill with the
 
05:10:47.878 --> 05:10:49.510 align:start position:0%
you're introducing this bill with the
intention

05:10:49.510 --> 05:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
intention
 
05:10:55.830 --> 05:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
of interim no of what motion not OTP not
 
05:10:59.070 --> 05:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
a it aop pass I'm sorry you want you
 
05:11:02.390 --> 05:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
want to a to pass yeah but it's going to
 
05:11:04.590 --> 05:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
need what is the subcommittee do then
 
05:11:05.628 --> 05:11:05.638 align:start position:0%
what's we're going to have to work
 
05:11:07.868 --> 05:11:07.878 align:start position:0%
through implementation actually when we
 
05:11:10.030 --> 05:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
draw the line how and you'll hear some
 
05:11:12.270 --> 05:11:12.280 align:start position:0%
of this from the do so how we you can't
 
05:11:14.310 --> 05:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
just have a hard line because there but
 
05:11:16.270 --> 05:11:16.280 align:start position:0%
there's a hard line in the Bill of
 
05:11:19.230 --> 05:11:19.240 align:start position:0%
66.3 Right 3 no that's that's a
 
05:11:22.030 --> 05:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
percentage but how you actually if you
 
05:11:24.110 --> 05:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
think of people are in the process of
 
05:11:27.750 --> 05:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
work as of of a claim so at what point
 
05:11:30.510 --> 05:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
do you say okay they're the 66 and 2/3
 
05:11:32.788 --> 05:11:32.798 align:start position:0%
group and that's that's kind of the
 
05:11:35.350 --> 05:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
challenge for this and I think we have
 
05:11:37.270 --> 05:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
people that are willing to work on that
 
05:11:40.190 --> 05:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
to try to figure that out okay
 
05:11:42.670 --> 05:11:42.680 align:start position:0%
representative alalani for a question
 
05:11:44.430 --> 05:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um wouldn't the
 
05:11:48.470 --> 05:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
first of the year be a great start is
 
05:11:51.708 --> 05:11:51.718 align:start position:0%
January 1 of 26 well I I think you can
 
05:11:53.788 --> 05:11:53.798 align:start position:0%
probably start it going forward but you
 
05:11:55.190 --> 05:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
have a whole bunch of people that are
 
05:11:57.990 --> 05:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
going to you know that are making 60%
 
05:11:59.510 --> 05:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
and they're in the process now and they
 
05:12:01.750 --> 05:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
settle on the other side of that so how
 
05:12:05.110 --> 05:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
do you what what rate are they getting
 
05:12:08.430 --> 05:12:08.440 align:start position:0%
you know so so would and that was raised
 
05:12:10.548 --> 05:12:10.558 align:start position:0%
by the do and they'll explain it to you
 
05:12:11.948 --> 05:12:11.958 align:start position:0%
and also some of the some of the
 
05:12:13.310 --> 05:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
attorneys raised
 
05:12:16.708 --> 05:12:16.718 align:start position:0%
that for a followup no good you good
 
05:12:18.430 --> 05:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
okay good thank you
 
05:12:20.548 --> 05:12:20.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:12:22.390 --> 05:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question it
 
05:12:24.868 --> 05:12:24.878 align:start position:0%
would seem to me that if the various
 
05:12:27.430 --> 05:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
departments and uh could tell us how
 
05:12:29.910 --> 05:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
many people are at
 
05:12:32.868 --> 05:12:32.878 align:start position:0%
66 and then we would know kind of what
 
05:12:34.310 --> 05:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
and what that dollar amount would look
 
05:12:37.510 --> 05:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
like and what that would cost uh either
 
05:12:39.548 --> 05:12:39.558 align:start position:0%
where it's whether it's going to come
 
05:12:41.990 --> 05:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
from and that would be the one
 
05:12:44.350 --> 05:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
complication then we if we agree that 66
 
05:12:47.070 --> 05:12:47.080 align:start position:0%
and 2/3 is appropriate going forward
 
05:12:49.230 --> 05:12:49.240 align:start position:0%
then then that's the only thing we have
 
05:12:50.990 --> 05:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
to worry about is that correct well I
 
05:12:52.948 --> 05:12:52.958 align:start position:0%
mean I think that the people uh to
 
05:12:55.150 --> 05:12:55.160 align:start position:0%
answer your question representative the
 
05:12:57.190 --> 05:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
people that administer the workers
 
05:12:59.990 --> 05:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
compensation are here and they I think
 
05:13:02.310 --> 05:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
they'll give you a sense of of of how
 
05:13:04.270 --> 05:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
this is could work and whether or not
 
05:13:06.110 --> 05:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
needs clarification and those kinds of
 
05:13:08.510 --> 05:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
things so I I I think that that's what
 
05:13:09.948 --> 05:13:09.958 align:start position:0%
we need to do and I think I've talked to
 
05:13:12.310 --> 05:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
them enough to to understand that
 
05:13:13.750 --> 05:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
something we probably need to make some
 
05:13:15.310 --> 05:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
arrangements here some
 
05:13:18.750 --> 05:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
changes okay representative K or
 
05:13:21.270 --> 05:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
question representative flan and then
 
05:13:23.390 --> 05:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
representative KK thank you Mr
 
05:13:26.230 --> 05:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
chairman again uh going back to when
 
05:13:29.110 --> 05:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
chairman infantine was here I seem to
 
05:13:32.390 --> 05:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
remember his logic of the 60% and maybe
 
05:13:33.990 --> 05:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's in your book that you have all of
 
05:13:36.270 --> 05:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
the notes of the work as comp changes
 
05:13:40.510 --> 05:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
but um the reason why it's 60% and not
 
05:13:43.548 --> 05:13:43.558 align:start position:0%
66 and 3/4 is that we don't have any
 
05:13:45.868 --> 05:13:45.878 align:start position:0%
sales income tax in the state of me in
 
05:13:47.830 --> 05:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire whereas in Massachusetts
 
05:13:51.670 --> 05:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
which has uh 66 and 3/4 does have an
 
05:13:54.230 --> 05:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
income tax additionally is when you're
 
05:13:57.948 --> 05:13:57.958 align:start position:0%
on on a workers comp out of work you
 
05:14:00.310 --> 05:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
don't have all those anay expenses like
 
05:14:03.470 --> 05:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
you know clothing gasoline uh food
 
05:14:05.750 --> 05:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
outside of the home so that's why it's
 
05:14:08.230 --> 05:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
not 100% of your wages that's why it's
 
05:14:10.910 --> 05:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
60 and in this case is there a question
 
05:14:12.628 --> 05:14:12.638 align:start position:0%
no are you familiar with that
 
05:14:14.910 --> 05:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
conversation with the representative
 
05:14:17.868 --> 05:14:17.878 align:start position:0%
inside you don't okay I I the only
 
05:14:20.150 --> 05:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
recollection I have that uh uh
 
05:14:21.548 --> 05:14:21.558 align:start position:0%
representative infant timee when I
 
05:14:22.868 --> 05:14:22.878 align:start position:0%
talked to him he thought we had changed
 
05:14:24.628 --> 05:14:24.638 align:start position:0%
this already it's been in front of this
 
05:14:27.030 --> 05:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
labor committee a number of times I know
 
05:14:29.430 --> 05:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
represent kale thank you Mr chair and
 
05:14:31.670 --> 05:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you again representative do you
 
05:14:33.788 --> 05:14:33.798 align:start position:0%
recall our former colleague our late
 
05:14:36.190 --> 05:14:36.200 align:start position:0%
colleague The Honorable herb Richardson
 
05:14:39.070 --> 05:14:39.080 align:start position:0%
I do who tried to do this uh at least
 
05:14:40.910 --> 05:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
going forward that he' had a terrible
 
05:14:44.110 --> 05:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
injury working in a supermarket that and
 
05:14:46.150 --> 05:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
I believe he was in danger of losing his
 
05:14:48.948 --> 05:14:48.958 align:start position:0%
home because of there just wasn't enough
 
05:14:52.270 --> 05:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
money coming in at 60% I think you did
 
05:14:54.110 --> 05:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
lose his home actually but yeah I
 
05:14:56.270 --> 05:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
remember that very well I remember him
 
05:15:00.350 --> 05:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
and I I you know I uh I I think the
 
05:15:02.830 --> 05:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
point of all this is is if the market is
 
05:15:05.350 --> 05:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
doing really well is it time to start
 
05:15:07.670 --> 05:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
thinking about you know giving some of
 
05:15:09.270 --> 05:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
this back that was taken away away from
 
05:15:11.030 --> 05:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
us during the course of the years and
 
05:15:13.590 --> 05:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
this book is an example of it uh of all
 
05:15:15.270 --> 05:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
the changes that have taken place and
 
05:15:16.990 --> 05:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
many of them are not in the best
 
05:15:18.948 --> 05:15:18.958 align:start position:0%
interest of working the workers in New
 
05:15:21.070 --> 05:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and let me say one final thing
 
05:15:23.430 --> 05:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
I'll sit down there's another thing
 
05:15:25.350 --> 05:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
floating around and they Tred to do this
 
05:15:26.548 --> 05:15:26.558 align:start position:0%
when I was on the commission with
 
05:15:29.190 --> 05:15:29.200 align:start position:0%
Governor Lynch is is right now you're on
 
05:15:31.430 --> 05:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
the hook for the medical benefits you
 
05:15:33.230 --> 05:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
can the indemnity there's two sides of
 
05:15:35.070 --> 05:15:35.080 align:start position:0%
work as comp it's the indemnity side and
 
05:15:37.430 --> 05:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
there the medical side now right right
 
05:15:39.350 --> 05:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
now you can't get relief from the iCal
 
05:15:42.628 --> 05:15:42.638 align:start position:0%
side of of the of the the claim that's
 
05:15:44.708 --> 05:15:44.718 align:start position:0%
with you now the indemnity side they can
 
05:15:47.670 --> 05:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
settle and they do uh and that be the
 
05:15:49.070 --> 05:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
that's the next thing I believe that
 
05:15:51.670 --> 05:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
they're looking to do is to get out from
 
05:15:56.190 --> 05:15:56.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:58.270 --> 05:15:58.280 align:start position:0%
testimony and thank you for introducing
 
05:16:13.470 --> 05:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:15.430 --> 05:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh chairman members of

uh I'm an attorney at pretty flarity
 
05:16:22.628 --> 05:16:22.638 align:start position:0%

ncci uh for those of you some of you
 
05:16:30.750 --> 05:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
probably already know uh but for those

advisory

05:16:34.070 --> 05:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
advisory
 
05:16:36.230 --> 05:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
organization uh that's authorized to
 
05:16:38.270 --> 05:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
make rate filings on behalf of the
 
05:16:40.830 --> 05:16:40.840 align:start position:0%
workers Compensation Insurance companies
 
05:16:45.390 --> 05:16:45.400 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh the filings are uh
 
05:16:47.990 --> 05:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
objectively prepared B based off of
 
05:16:50.110 --> 05:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
Actuarial uh methodology that's
 
05:16:53.310 --> 05:16:53.320 align:start position:0%
generally recognized uh ncci doesn't
 
05:16:55.670 --> 05:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
take a position on a bill like this uh
 
05:16:57.750 --> 05:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
but one of the things we do is serve as
 
05:17:01.230 --> 05:17:01.240 align:start position:0%
a resource to uh both the committee and
 
05:17:02.590 --> 05:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
the insurance department and the labor
 
05:17:04.948 --> 05:17:04.958 align:start position:0%
department so I'm here to testify
 
05:17:06.788 --> 05:17:06.798 align:start position:0%
because I did get an inquiry uh
 
05:17:09.350 --> 05:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
yesterday about whether or not NC CCI
 
05:17:12.190 --> 05:17:12.200 align:start position:0%
had priced the potential impact of this
 
05:17:15.948 --> 05:17:15.958 align:start position:0%
bill we have not priced it yet um I have
 
05:17:18.270 --> 05:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
talked with uh the folks the actuaries
 
05:17:21.750 --> 05:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
back in boa Ron uh and they could put
 
05:17:23.590 --> 05:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
together a pricing probably for the week
 
05:17:25.910 --> 05:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
of the 17th I don't know how that fits
 
05:17:28.548 --> 05:17:28.558 align:start position:0%
with your schedule uh but that is
 
05:17:29.990 --> 05:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
something that if the committee is
 
05:17:32.070 --> 05:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
interested in doing uh we could
 
05:17:35.310 --> 05:17:35.320 align:start position:0%
certainly do that for you
 
05:17:39.510 --> 05:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
um I did uh just to respond on to I
 
05:17:41.350 --> 05:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
think there was a question from
 
05:17:44.230 --> 05:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
representative avalani regarding the so
 
05:17:45.788 --> 05:17:45.798 align:start position:0%
there's two parts of the bill one is
 
05:17:48.948 --> 05:17:48.958 align:start position:0%
changing the indemnity from 60% to 66
 
05:17:50.868 --> 05:17:50.878 align:start position:0%
and 23 and then there's the question
 
05:17:54.868 --> 05:17:54.878 align:start position:0%
about when that would take uh effect um
 
05:17:59.150 --> 05:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
if as drafted it's 60 days after passage
 
05:18:00.990 --> 05:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
I would anticipate that ncci would have
 
05:18:03.628 --> 05:18:03.638 align:start position:0%
to do an interim filing uh because it
 
05:18:05.750 --> 05:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
would potentially impact the rates that
 
05:18:08.110 --> 05:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
were filed for 2025 which were based
 
05:18:09.270 --> 05:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
upon the
 
05:18:14.070 --> 05:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
60% uh number um the filing uh for
 
05:18:19.150 --> 05:18:19.160 align:start position:0%
January 1 2025 was uh five and 5.6%
 
05:18:21.670 --> 05:18:21.680 align:start position:0%
decrease um so it would have an impact
 
05:18:23.510 --> 05:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
on that I I don't know what that number
 
05:18:26.270 --> 05:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
would be um if the effective dat got
 
05:18:29.310 --> 05:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
moved for example to like January 1 of
 
05:18:32.270 --> 05:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
2026 that would just be part of the next
 
05:18:34.868 --> 05:18:34.878 align:start position:0%
rate filing uh ncci does the rate filing
 
05:18:37.910 --> 05:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
for the voluntary loss cost and also for
 
05:18:39.548 --> 05:18:39.558 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
05:18:42.708 --> 05:18:42.718 align:start position:0%
the residual market usually in August or
 
05:18:44.150 --> 05:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
September and then the insurance
 
05:18:46.670 --> 05:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
department will approve it uh with the
 
05:18:48.548 --> 05:18:48.558 align:start position:0%
ex with the expected date that it would
 
05:18:50.670 --> 05:18:50.680 align:start position:0%
take effect being January 1 of the
 
05:18:53.390 --> 05:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
following year so if if the effective
 
05:18:54.788 --> 05:18:54.798 align:start position:0%
date were moved to something like
 
05:18:56.150 --> 05:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
January 1 of
 
05:18:58.708 --> 05:18:58.718 align:start position:0%
2026 that would be part of the rate
 
05:19:01.990 --> 05:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
filing process calculations for
 
05:19:05.190 --> 05:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
2026 happy to take any questions you
 
05:19:06.788 --> 05:19:06.798 align:start position:0%
have it go
 
05:19:09.230 --> 05:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
ahead Rose
 
05:19:11.910 --> 05:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um the I know the
 
05:19:14.708 --> 05:19:14.718 align:start position:0%
ra isings use you all over in January um
 
05:19:16.830 --> 05:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
the other question is if the the
 
05:19:18.510 --> 05:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
representative Rose was if there are
 
05:19:20.310 --> 05:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
people on the
 
05:19:23.470 --> 05:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
program would they roll into the new
 
05:19:26.030 --> 05:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
thing given that they're the the the
 
05:19:28.990 --> 05:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
employers rates were set at 60% and if
 
05:19:31.590 --> 05:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
they would be upgraded to the 66% come
 
05:19:33.230 --> 05:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
the first or would it be just for new
 
05:19:35.390 --> 05:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
claimants after the
 
05:19:38.150 --> 05:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
first I I think that depends on how you
 
05:19:40.430 --> 05:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
frame it my understanding would be if
 
05:19:42.708 --> 05:19:42.718 align:start position:0%
you H usually the way the legislation
 
05:19:44.390 --> 05:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
works is that it would apply to
 
05:19:47.510 --> 05:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
prospective injuries so a past injury
 
05:19:50.548 --> 05:19:50.558 align:start position:0%
that was under the 60% would still be
 
05:19:53.548 --> 05:19:53.558 align:start position:0%
under that 60% Indemnity benefit that's
 
05:19:56.270 --> 05:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
my understanding uh labor I think is
 
05:19:58.830 --> 05:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
agree agreeing with me on that so I I
 
05:20:00.510 --> 05:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
think that's the answer to that question
 
05:20:02.708 --> 05:20:02.718 align:start position:0%
obviously you know you could amend it
 
05:20:05.270 --> 05:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
however you choose followup for followup
 
05:20:07.590 --> 05:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
sir and then a followup uh the payouts
 
05:20:09.030 --> 05:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
we also mentioned that the payout would
 
05:20:12.830 --> 05:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
that be under the 60% and under the
 
05:20:15.350 --> 05:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
pre-existing policies for the employers
 
05:20:18.628 --> 05:20:18.638 align:start position:0%
or would the would the carryover come
 
05:20:20.548 --> 05:20:20.558 align:start position:0%
into the new policies and they would be
 
05:20:24.070 --> 05:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
entitled to a higher payout under the um
 
05:20:25.830 --> 05:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
not the indemnity part but on the payoff
 
05:20:27.070 --> 05:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
part for an
 
05:20:29.470 --> 05:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
injury uh if I understand your question
 
05:20:32.350 --> 05:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
you're asking if the if the carrier
 
05:20:35.430 --> 05:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
chooses to uh settle the indemnity
 
05:20:37.830 --> 05:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
portion yes I would assume it would be
 
05:20:42.510 --> 05:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
based upon on the existing 60% up until
 
05:20:46.670 --> 05:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:49.910 --> 05:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
effect clarification for clarification
 
05:20:53.230 --> 05:20:53.240 align:start position:0%
so if the carried so get injured at 25
 
05:20:55.510 --> 05:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
at the 60% and the say the payout was
 
05:20:58.910 --> 05:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
25,000 but under the new thing is 66%
 
05:21:01.590 --> 05:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
and the payout would be 30,000 just
 
05:21:03.670 --> 05:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
follow along okay would they be eligible
 
05:21:05.868 --> 05:21:05.878 align:start position:0%
for that 30,000 or would they still be
 
05:21:07.548 --> 05:21:07.558 align:start position:0%
because they're injured in 25 would
 
05:21:09.310 --> 05:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
still be only eligible for
 
05:21:11.590 --> 05:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
25 I think it just depends on what the
 
05:21:13.990 --> 05:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
effective date would be okay if if the
 
05:21:16.030 --> 05:21:16.040 align:start position:0%
injury took place prior to the passage
 
05:21:17.868 --> 05:21:17.878 align:start position:0%
of the bill I think they would still be
 
05:21:21.070 --> 05:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
under the 60% is my understanding thank
 
05:21:24.470 --> 05:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman Rose K thank
 
05:21:26.230 --> 05:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:21:29.150 --> 05:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
question I'd be interested to know I
 
05:21:31.030 --> 05:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
mean once we find out that the dollar
 
05:21:33.990 --> 05:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
amount for the people who are at 60%
 
05:21:36.110 --> 05:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
what that would cost I'd be interested
 
05:21:39.110 --> 05:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
to know uh sort of the two the two
 
05:21:41.628 --> 05:21:41.638 align:start position:0%
figures what it would be going forward
 
05:21:44.948 --> 05:21:44.958 align:start position:0%
in January 26 to to have 66 going
 
05:21:47.628 --> 05:21:47.638 align:start position:0%
forward and what it would cost for the
 
05:21:50.350 --> 05:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
people uh who are at 60 to bring them
 
05:21:54.190 --> 05:21:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:56.788 --> 05:21:56.798 align:start position:0%
2026 would that be hard for you to
 
05:21:58.830 --> 05:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
discern once we had the first part of
 
05:22:01.230 --> 05:22:01.240 align:start position:0%
the big number so I think for purposes
 
05:22:03.230 --> 05:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
of pricing what we' be looking at is
 
05:22:05.868 --> 05:22:05.878 align:start position:0%
going forward what the what the impact
 
05:22:08.948 --> 05:22:08.958 align:start position:0%
to the system would be um if the
 
05:22:11.390 --> 05:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
question is sort of retroactively
 
05:22:14.910 --> 05:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
figuring out uh the impact of changing
 
05:22:19.230 --> 05:22:19.240 align:start position:0%
from 60 to 66 and two3 for existing
 
05:22:21.230 --> 05:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
injuries uh I don't think that's
 
05:22:23.670 --> 05:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
something that we would
 
05:22:28.030 --> 05:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
be uh coming up with uh just because we
 
05:22:30.910 --> 05:22:30.920 align:start position:0%
do it the work that ncci does is really
 
05:22:33.510 --> 05:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
sort of going forward as far as what the
 
05:22:36.830 --> 05:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
rate should be based upon the historical
 
05:22:40.350 --> 05:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
Trends and losses whatnot so I don't
 
05:22:42.510 --> 05:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
know if the the labor department or
 
05:22:44.030 --> 05:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
someone else might be better served for
 
05:22:46.470 --> 05:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
example because we don't know we won't
 
05:22:47.910 --> 05:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
have all the information about someone
 
05:22:49.070 --> 05:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
who may have already settled their
 
05:22:49.080 --> 05:22:50.230 align:start position:0%
who may have already settled their
Indemnity

05:22:50.230 --> 05:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
Indemnity
 
05:22:55.270 --> 05:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:57.830 --> 05:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
much representative Solomon and then
 
05:22:59.830 --> 05:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative avalani Ju Just to be
 
05:23:02.310 --> 05:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
clear when you talk about prospective
 
05:23:06.190 --> 05:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:08.230 --> 05:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
injury yeah I mean that's what I'm
 
05:23:10.708 --> 05:23:10.718 align:start position:0%
thinking it's it it would be essentially
 
05:23:13.270 --> 05:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
the date of the entry that's taking
 
05:23:15.948 --> 05:23:15.958 align:start position:0%
place after this takes the effective
 
05:23:18.708 --> 05:23:18.718 align:start position:0%
date correct thank you and if I can just
 
05:23:21.628 --> 05:23:21.638 align:start position:0%
make one point of clarification so ncci
 
05:23:23.430 --> 05:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
is dealing with what I'll call the
 
05:23:26.270 --> 05:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
voluntary Market it's not picking up
 
05:23:28.430 --> 05:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
self-insured it's not picking up any of
 
05:23:29.708 --> 05:23:29.718 align:start position:0%
the municipalities who might be in
 
05:23:33.548 --> 05:23:33.558 align:start position:0%
pulled risk uh program so it's a piece
 
05:23:34.948 --> 05:23:34.958 align:start position:0%
of the pie it's probably a lot of the
 
05:23:37.430 --> 05:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
pie but it wouldn't be the entire Pie as
 
05:23:39.910 --> 05:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
far as what the impact would be to the
 
05:23:42.590 --> 05:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
system okay represent alalani thank you
 
05:23:44.788 --> 05:23:44.798 align:start position:0%
I was going to say ncci deals mostly
 
05:23:47.030 --> 05:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
with private
 
05:23:49.110 --> 05:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
employers most of your work is for
 
05:23:51.830 --> 05:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
private private insurance
 
05:23:56.708 --> 05:23:56.718 align:start position:0%
policies correct we we uh we would do
 
05:23:58.548 --> 05:23:58.558 align:start position:0%
pricing related to private insurance
 
05:24:01.310 --> 05:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
there are some public employers who
 
05:24:03.350 --> 05:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
might have uh insurance through the
 
05:24:05.190 --> 05:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
private Market I would say in New
 
05:24:06.708 --> 05:24:06.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at least the vast majority do
 
05:24:09.750 --> 05:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
not but there may be a few yep thank you
 
05:24:10.830 --> 05:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
05:24:13.190 --> 05:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
chman all right sir thank you so much
 
05:24:18.548 --> 05:24:18.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:21.190 --> 05:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
you yeah if you could wait till the end
 
05:24:23.830 --> 05:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
of the hearing please that that would be
 
05:24:42.590 --> 05:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:44.990 --> 05:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Christian cerella I'm a
 
05:24:46.830 --> 05:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
chief Property and Casualty actuary at
 
05:24:48.788 --> 05:24:48.798 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire insurance department
 
05:24:50.350 --> 05:24:50.360 align:start position:0%
I'm an associate of the casualty
 
05:24:51.948 --> 05:24:51.958 align:start position:0%
Actuarial society and a member of the
 
05:24:53.628 --> 05:24:53.638 align:start position:0%
American Academy of
 
05:24:56.030 --> 05:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
actuaries the insurance department is
 
05:24:57.788 --> 05:24:57.798 align:start position:0%
not taking a position on this bill
 
05:24:59.910 --> 05:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
because it addresses a change to the
 
05:25:01.750 --> 05:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
benefits awarded Injured Workers in New
 
05:25:03.910 --> 05:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is a policy matter and
 
05:25:05.750 --> 05:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
will not change how we enforce the
 
05:25:07.110 --> 05:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
insurance laws for the state of New
 
05:25:09.270 --> 05:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I am here instead to speak
 
05:25:11.270 --> 05:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
about anticipated consequences of the
 
05:25:13.470 --> 05:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
bill as it may have a small but
 
05:25:14.708 --> 05:25:14.718 align:start position:0%
noticeable effect on the Workers
 
05:25:17.190 --> 05:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
Compensation Insurance Market in our
 
05:25:18.990 --> 05:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
state as you know the Workers
 
05:25:21.470 --> 05:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
Compensation Insurance system in America
 
05:25:23.310 --> 05:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
rests on a balance between protecting
 
05:25:25.070 --> 05:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
employees and their families from
 
05:25:26.750 --> 05:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
debilitating workplace accidents and
 
05:25:28.708 --> 05:25:28.718 align:start position:0%
permitting employers the Peace of Mind
 
05:25:30.788 --> 05:25:30.798 align:start position:0%
in avoiding costly litigation as
 
05:25:32.230 --> 05:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie mentioned
 
05:25:34.510 --> 05:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
earlier as is the case in every other
 
05:25:36.310 --> 05:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction in the US benefits for
 
05:25:38.430 --> 05:25:38.440 align:start position:0%
workers workplace injuries are governed
 
05:25:40.910 --> 05:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
by state law when an employee misses
 
05:25:42.788 --> 05:25:42.798 align:start position:0%
work due to an on the job injury they
 
05:25:44.350 --> 05:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
are compensated a portion of their
 
05:25:46.868 --> 05:25:46.878 align:start position:0%
average weekly wage New Hampshire
 
05:25:48.830 --> 05:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
current New Hampshire law sets the wage
 
05:25:51.110 --> 05:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
wage replacement at 60% of the workers's
 
05:25:53.230 --> 05:25:53.240 align:start position:0%
average weekly wage this bill would
 
05:25:56.628 --> 05:25:56.638 align:start position:0%
increase that benefit to 66 and 23%
 
05:25:58.590 --> 05:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
increasing the wage replacement benefit
 
05:26:00.310 --> 05:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
would necessitate an increase in what
 
05:26:02.670 --> 05:26:02.680 align:start position:0%
workers what employers pay for workers
 
05:26:05.590 --> 05:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
compensation insurance premiums to cover
 
05:26:07.990 --> 05:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
increases to claims costs for insurance
 
05:26:10.350 --> 05:26:10.360 align:start position:0%
Prov providers it is important to
 
05:26:12.150 --> 05:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
understand that the proposed 11%
 
05:26:15.110 --> 05:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
increase in Indemnity benefits would not
 
05:26:17.830 --> 05:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
translate directly to an 11% increase in
 
05:26:19.948 --> 05:26:19.958 align:start position:0%
premium it would cause a smaller
 
05:26:22.190 --> 05:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
relative increase in premiums because
 
05:26:23.830 --> 05:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
this is important wage replacement
 
05:26:26.070 --> 05:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
accounts for a small portion of the
 
05:26:28.110 --> 05:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
overall expenses borne by insurance
 
05:26:30.590 --> 05:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
carriers in New Hampshire medical
 
05:26:32.590 --> 05:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
expenses associated with a workplace
 
05:26:34.510 --> 05:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
injury make up the majority of the loss
 
05:26:35.708 --> 05:26:35.718 align:start position:0%
cost for
 
05:26:37.788 --> 05:26:37.798 align:start position:0%
insurers also it is important to
 
05:26:37.798 --> 05:26:38.868 align:start position:0%
insurers also it is important to
acknowledge

05:26:38.868 --> 05:26:38.878 align:start position:0%
acknowledge
 
05:26:40.990 --> 05:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
that expenses associated with adjusting
 
05:26:43.910 --> 05:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
a claim insurance carrier overhead taxes
 
05:26:46.070 --> 05:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
licenses and fees commissions to their
 
05:26:48.190 --> 05:26:48.200 align:start position:0%
agents and underwriting profit would not
 
05:26:49.990 --> 05:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
be affected by this change further
 
05:26:52.310 --> 05:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
decreasing the relative effect of this
 
05:26:55.750 --> 05:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
change on premium in the end Indemnity
 
05:26:58.190 --> 05:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
benefits for for injured workers make up
 
05:27:00.070 --> 05:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
about a quarter of all
 
05:27:02.470 --> 05:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
expenses all expenses considered in the
 
05:27:04.470 --> 05:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
determination of workers compensation
 
05:27:08.350 --> 05:27:08.360 align:start position:0%
insurance premium um
 
05:27:10.670 --> 05:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
I would expect a change to the benefit
 
05:27:13.230 --> 05:27:13.240 align:start position:0%
as proposed in this bill to result in a
 
05:27:17.628 --> 05:27:17.638 align:start position:0%
in a small single digits um less than 5%
 
05:27:20.070 --> 05:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
increase in overall premium for
 
05:27:21.948 --> 05:27:21.958 align:start position:0%
employers at the same time it is
 
05:27:24.708 --> 05:27:24.718 align:start position:0%
important to remember that loss costs
 
05:27:26.310 --> 05:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
have decreased in New Hampshire for each
 
05:27:29.350 --> 05:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
of the last 12 years and more than 60%
 
05:27:31.628 --> 05:27:31.638 align:start position:0%
cumulatively over that period this means
 
05:27:33.788 --> 05:27:33.798 align:start position:0%
the cost to insurance carriers for
 
05:27:36.150 --> 05:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
workplace injuries relative to payroll
 
05:27:38.750 --> 05:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
has dropped significantly with continued
 
05:27:40.670 --> 05:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
improvements to workplace safety and
 
05:27:42.830 --> 05:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
rapid and effective treatment in this
 
05:27:44.470 --> 05:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
state for Injured Workers there is every
 
05:27:46.788 --> 05:27:46.798 align:start position:0%
reason to expect the effect of an
 
05:27:50.230 --> 05:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
increase in anticipated Indemnity costs
 
05:27:52.548 --> 05:27:52.558 align:start position:0%
proposed in this bill to be mitigated by
 
05:27:54.670 --> 05:27:54.680 align:start position:0%
continued decline in loss frequency and
 
05:27:57.430 --> 05:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
medical expenses in other words if loss
 
05:28:00.470 --> 05:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
costs continue to improve we may not see
 
05:28:03.070 --> 05:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
the increase to premium anticipated from
 
05:28:06.150 --> 05:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
this proposed change to benefits loss
 
05:28:08.310 --> 05:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
costs are reviewed and adjusted annually
 
05:28:10.190 --> 05:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
as Mr fennessy mentioned by the National
 
05:28:12.430 --> 05:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
Council of insurance of compensation
 
05:28:15.470 --> 05:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
insurers their loss costs for the next
 
05:28:17.670 --> 05:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
calendar year are filed and reviewed and
 
05:28:19.948 --> 05:28:19.958 align:start position:0%
approve and approved by our department
 
05:28:22.110 --> 05:28:22.120 align:start position:0%
each summer and then become effective
 
05:28:26.830 --> 05:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
January 1st and as Mr fennessy uh
 
05:28:28.670 --> 05:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
concluded and I speculated there would
 
05:28:30.350 --> 05:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
be there would need to be a a midyear
 
05:28:33.070 --> 05:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
change in that if in fact the uh the
 
05:28:36.910 --> 05:28:36.920 align:start position:0%
bill is is uh passed as as proposed and
 
05:28:38.948 --> 05:28:38.958 align:start position:0%
that that would be a somewhat disruptive
 
05:28:41.868 --> 05:28:41.878 align:start position:0%
to the market and for this reason um the
 
05:28:43.430 --> 05:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
the insurance department does make one
 
05:28:44.990 --> 05:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
suggestion for consideration by the
 
05:28:47.150 --> 05:28:47.160 align:start position:0%
sponsor and this committee um if you
 
05:28:49.910 --> 05:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
want to um mitigate that that effect on
 
05:28:51.510 --> 05:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
the market we recommend changing the
 
05:28:53.670 --> 05:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
effective date of this bill to January 1
 
05:28:56.030 --> 05:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
2026 this would allow ncci to
 
05:28:57.548 --> 05:28:57.558 align:start position:0%
incorporate the effect of the proposed
 
05:28:59.510 --> 05:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
change to benefits on loss costs into
 
05:29:01.590 --> 05:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
their annual rate submission and avoid
 
05:29:03.548 --> 05:29:03.558 align:start position:0%
an out of cycle adjustment in the
 
05:29:06.430 --> 05:29:06.440 align:start position:0%
current calendar year once again aside
 
05:29:08.990 --> 05:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
from the the just mentioned suggestion
 
05:29:10.150 --> 05:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
regarding the effective date of the
 
05:29:11.948 --> 05:29:11.958 align:start position:0%
legislation the insurance department
 
05:29:13.470 --> 05:29:13.480 align:start position:0%
does not take a position on this policy
 
05:29:18.590 --> 05:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:21.590 --> 05:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
questions and representative alalani
 
05:29:23.548 --> 05:29:23.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um how many uh
 
05:29:23.558 --> 05:29:25.310 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um how many uh
workman's

05:29:25.310 --> 05:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
workman's
 
05:29:27.430 --> 05:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
comp insurance companies do we have in
 
05:29:31.070 --> 05:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
the state right now um there are over a
 
05:29:33.788 --> 05:29:33.798 align:start position:0%
hundred licens than writing insurance
 
05:29:35.868 --> 05:29:35.878 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers in the voluntary
 
05:29:37.708 --> 05:29:37.718 align:start position:0%
market and can you explain what the
 
05:29:39.510 --> 05:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
volunt what a voluntary Market is and an
 
05:29:43.910 --> 05:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
involuntary Market is so about in
 
05:29:46.948 --> 05:29:46.958 align:start position:0%
calendar year 20 this is 2025 but I have
 
05:29:50.390 --> 05:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
data from 2023 in 2023 there was about
 
05:29:52.868 --> 05:29:52.878 align:start position:0%
280 or so million dollars worth of
 
05:29:55.030 --> 05:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
written premium in the insurance Workers
 
05:29:56.470 --> 05:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
Compensation Insurance market so that's
 
05:29:58.830 --> 05:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
that private insurance Market that Mr
 
05:30:01.670 --> 05:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
fennessy talked about doesn't include
 
05:30:03.430 --> 05:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
self-insurance large hospitals
 
05:30:05.868 --> 05:30:05.878 align:start position:0%
self-insure large businesses self-insure
 
05:30:09.750 --> 05:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't include pools like uh primex
 
05:30:12.270 --> 05:30:12.280 align:start position:0%
U so for municipalities the state is
 
05:30:13.990 --> 05:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
self-funded State Workers are covered
 
05:30:16.708 --> 05:30:16.718 align:start position:0%
State these are for private employers
 
05:30:19.310 --> 05:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
that need to purchase it in the in the
 
05:30:21.708 --> 05:30:21.718 align:start position:0%
market so the voluntary Market are those
 
05:30:23.830 --> 05:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
that's kind of that free exchange where
 
05:30:25.868 --> 05:30:25.878 align:start position:0%
you call up an agent you ask for quotes
 
05:30:27.190 --> 05:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
you get the quote like you do other
 
05:30:28.868 --> 05:30:28.878 align:start position:0%
types of insurance whether it's property
 
05:30:30.430 --> 05:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
Auto commercial Auto that kind of stuff
 
05:30:34.750 --> 05:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
these are for businesses so of that of
 
05:30:37.190 --> 05:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
that of that type of insurance there is
 
05:30:40.470 --> 05:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
a small p pie of the the economy that
 
05:30:45.230 --> 05:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
can't find a voluntary exchange and so
 
05:30:48.590 --> 05:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
you know about 6% of that $280 million
 
05:30:50.830 --> 05:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
about 6% of that does wind up in what we
 
05:30:53.150 --> 05:30:53.160 align:start position:0%
call the residual Market the assigned
 
05:30:55.590 --> 05:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
risk pool they you know there isn't a
 
05:30:57.070 --> 05:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
carrier out there that is willing to
 
05:30:58.750 --> 05:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
take on that risk for that that
 
05:31:03.070 --> 05:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
workers's comp policy um the rates that
 
05:31:06.230 --> 05:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
the premium that is paid by employers
 
05:31:08.750 --> 05:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
that wind up in the assigned risk pool
 
05:31:10.830 --> 05:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
are not substantially greater than what
 
05:31:12.270 --> 05:31:12.280 align:start position:0%
they would get in the voluntary Market
 
05:31:15.070 --> 05:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
it's just that any um you know any
 
05:31:18.310 --> 05:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
losses any that that occur with that
 
05:31:20.230 --> 05:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
business is then shared over the whole
 
05:31:22.030 --> 05:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
workers compensation Market anybody
 
05:31:24.270 --> 05:31:24.280 align:start position:0%
writing business so when we say the
 
05:31:26.030 --> 05:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
voluntary Market we're talking about the
 
05:31:28.830 --> 05:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
94% of the business that is done in the
 
05:31:30.670 --> 05:31:30.680 align:start position:0%
in the private
 
05:31:34.430 --> 05:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
Market my yes sir for a followup uh so
 
05:31:38.150 --> 05:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
your 5% increase would basically be a W
 
05:31:41.470 --> 05:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
by private businesses for this change
 
05:31:43.910 --> 05:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's a very uh how should I say
 
05:31:46.708 --> 05:31:46.718 align:start position:0%
it ballpark figure back of the envelope
 
05:31:48.230 --> 05:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
I think you know when I looked at it it
 
05:31:49.990 --> 05:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
was going to be around 2 to 4% that
 
05:31:51.430 --> 05:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
would actually trickle all the way down
 
05:31:54.670 --> 05:31:54.680 align:start position:0%
to premium and uh that would then be
 
05:31:56.470 --> 05:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
translated over to premium that would
 
05:32:01.548 --> 05:32:01.558 align:start position:0%
then be paid by employers yeah thank you
 
05:32:04.868 --> 05:32:04.878 align:start position:0%
okay k Mr chair and thank you for taking
 
05:32:07.070 --> 05:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
my question would you have an idea of
 
05:32:10.948 --> 05:32:10.958 align:start position:0%
the average cost to Ure an employee I I
 
05:32:12.350 --> 05:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
know there's different risks you know if
 
05:32:14.830 --> 05:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
you have a roofer y or a secretary it's
 
05:32:16.990 --> 05:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
probably a different rating but is there
 
05:32:19.270 --> 05:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
an average number that employers pay to
 
05:32:21.948 --> 05:32:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:25.150 --> 05:32:25.160 align:start position:0%
comp I I average that would be difficult
 
05:32:26.628 --> 05:32:26.638 align:start position:0%
I can say that there are minimum
 
05:32:30.590 --> 05:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
premiums in in in our state so employers
 
05:32:34.868 --> 05:32:34.878 align:start position:0%
are going to pay at least $800 to $1,000
 
05:32:36.670 --> 05:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
and then depending on the type of
 
05:32:37.830 --> 05:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
business they do the number of employes
 
05:32:39.990 --> 05:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
emploees that they have it's all based
 
05:32:42.150 --> 05:32:42.160 align:start position:0%
on payroll so you know however much
 
05:32:43.470 --> 05:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
they're paying their employees will
 
05:32:46.190 --> 05:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
affect that as you mentioned what their
 
05:32:48.310 --> 05:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
employees are doing on a daily basis is
 
05:32:50.310 --> 05:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
greatly going to affect that but you
 
05:32:52.670 --> 05:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
know employers can pay as little as $600
 
05:32:55.310 --> 05:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
a year and as much as tens and hundreds
 
05:32:58.030 --> 05:32:58.040 align:start position:0%
of thousands of dollars a year represent
 
05:33:00.990 --> 05:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
representative ly thank you Mr chair uh
 
05:33:02.788 --> 05:33:02.798 align:start position:0%
just one question is it is it fair to
 
05:33:04.830 --> 05:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
assume that with the fires the floods
 
05:33:07.390 --> 05:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
the Hurricanes that insurance generally
 
05:33:07.400 --> 05:33:08.390 align:start position:0%
the Hurricanes that insurance generally
speaking

05:33:08.390 --> 05:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
05:33:10.948 --> 05:33:10.958 align:start position:0%
is going to eventually Spike here I've
 
05:33:13.070 --> 05:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
been told as a business owner to buckle
 
05:33:15.910 --> 05:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
up on on liability and everything else
 
05:33:17.830 --> 05:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
that's coming down the pike for the next
 
05:33:20.350 --> 05:33:20.360 align:start position:0%
year and I guess my thought here is
 
05:33:21.990 --> 05:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
everything needs to be taken to into
 
05:33:25.350 --> 05:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
account here comp liability umbrellas
 
05:33:26.868 --> 05:33:26.878 align:start position:0%
everything just want to get your
 
05:33:30.830 --> 05:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:33.390 --> 05:33:33.400 align:start position:0%
that workers compensation each of the
 
05:33:35.150 --> 05:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
lines of business really runs
 
05:33:37.868 --> 05:33:37.878 align:start position:0%
independently of each other so yeah yes
 
05:33:40.708 --> 05:33:40.718 align:start position:0%
on to to your end are the fires out west
 
05:33:42.510 --> 05:33:42.520 align:start position:0%
and the and and you know the Hurricanes
 
05:33:44.868 --> 05:33:44.878 align:start position:0%
down south are they going to affect
 
05:33:46.750 --> 05:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
property insurance business property
 
05:33:46.760 --> 05:33:47.868 align:start position:0%
property insurance business property
insurance

05:33:47.868 --> 05:33:47.878 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
05:33:52.030 --> 05:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely workers comp I would say no
 
05:33:55.310 --> 05:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
because the different markets are priced
 
05:33:58.150 --> 05:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
differently um and because workers
 
05:33:59.990 --> 05:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
compensation Workers Compensation
 
05:34:01.788 --> 05:34:01.798 align:start position:0%
Insurance is unique in the sense that
 
05:34:04.350 --> 05:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
all benefits are are
 
05:34:08.470 --> 05:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
statutorily you know decreed
 
05:34:11.190 --> 05:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
ncci when they're developing their rates
 
05:34:12.670 --> 05:34:12.680 align:start position:0%
you know perspectively they can look
 
05:34:15.510 --> 05:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
back to see you know how much it costs
 
05:34:18.830 --> 05:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
to return carry return workers to to
 
05:34:20.628 --> 05:34:20.638 align:start position:0%
their jobs to return employees to their
 
05:34:24.430 --> 05:34:24.440 align:start position:0%
to their to their jobs and it's not that
 
05:34:26.948 --> 05:34:26.958 align:start position:0%
is not going to be affected by fires
 
05:34:28.990 --> 05:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be affected by
 
05:34:32.750 --> 05:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
hurricanes yeah we follow thank you Mr
 
05:34:35.830 --> 05:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
Chair say all state has a workman's comp
 
05:34:37.708 --> 05:34:37.718 align:start position:0%
division but they also have a home
 
05:34:40.948 --> 05:34:40.958 align:start position:0%
owners division are they not related at
 
05:34:43.430 --> 05:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
some point down the road do you
 
05:34:44.910 --> 05:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
understand what I'm trying to say I I I
 
05:34:46.708 --> 05:34:46.718 align:start position:0%
hear what you're saying
 
05:34:49.030 --> 05:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
and generally speaking that's not the
 
05:34:52.430 --> 05:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
way Insurance Works um they will most
 
05:34:55.708 --> 05:34:55.718 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers will will price their
 
05:34:59.230 --> 05:34:59.240 align:start position:0%
various types of business separately um
 
05:35:00.948 --> 05:35:00.958 align:start position:0%
because the risks are very very
 
05:35:03.350 --> 05:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
different and that I would not consider
 
05:35:05.590 --> 05:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
that to be gener you know doing as you
 
05:35:07.270 --> 05:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
say and and kind of merging the business
 
05:35:08.628 --> 05:35:08.638 align:start position:0%
and saying hey we need a little bit here
 
05:35:11.230 --> 05:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
we need a little bit there to cover that
 
05:35:15.110 --> 05:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
is not kind of accepted Actuarial
 
05:35:18.070 --> 05:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
practice yeah
 
05:35:18.080 --> 05:35:19.670 align:start position:0%
practice yeah
yeah

05:35:19.670 --> 05:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:35:21.708 --> 05:35:21.718 align:start position:0%
avalani thank you Mr chairman do you
 
05:35:24.390 --> 05:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
have the history on why we pay the 60%
 
05:35:26.070 --> 05:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
instead of the 66 and
 
05:35:28.830 --> 05:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
2/3 I I do not I started working at the
 
05:35:30.350 --> 05:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
state about 10 years ago and it's been
 
05:35:32.670 --> 05:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
60% the whole time that I've been
 
05:35:36.628 --> 05:35:36.638 align:start position:0%
here okay I will say it is unique
 
05:35:40.590 --> 05:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
Nationwide that we're the only state we
 
05:35:43.190 --> 05:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
that percent is lowest in New Hampshire
 
05:35:44.670 --> 05:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
lower than every other state in the
 
05:35:47.628 --> 05:35:47.638 align:start position:0%
nation thank you okay represent
 
05:35:51.110 --> 05:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
K and thank you once again so the the
 
05:35:53.150 --> 05:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
impacts the way to the way to keep cost
 
05:35:56.070 --> 05:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
low for workers comp is fewer claims and
 
05:35:58.590 --> 05:35:58.600 align:start position:0%
less expensive claims is that
 
05:36:01.868 --> 05:36:01.878 align:start position:0%
correct right sort of you're talking
 
05:36:04.430 --> 05:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
about the individual employer yeah right
 
05:36:07.190 --> 05:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
so the the the history of the individual
 
05:36:09.788 --> 05:36:09.798 align:start position:0%
empy employer and kind of their loss
 
05:36:11.510 --> 05:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
experience greatly affects what they're
 
05:36:15.708 --> 05:36:15.718 align:start position:0%
paying the next year yes thank
 
05:36:18.708 --> 05:36:18.718 align:start position:0%
you all right so seeing no further
 
05:36:20.948 --> 05:36:20.958 align:start position:0%
questions I would like to call uh Miss

Deputy Commissioner of the New Hampshire
 
05:36:41.030 --> 05:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor I'm here today with
 
05:36:42.510 --> 05:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
um Attorney John garan he is the
 
05:36:44.708 --> 05:36:44.718 align:start position:0%
Department's general counsel um the
 
05:36:46.350 --> 05:36:46.360 align:start position:0%
department is neutral on the bill we
 
05:36:47.948 --> 05:36:47.958 align:start position:0%
have reviewed the language we do believe
 
05:36:49.670 --> 05:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
we understand its stated intent and
 
05:36:51.110 --> 05:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
purpose we believe that we can
 
05:36:53.150 --> 05:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
administer it um relative to the
 
05:36:54.830 --> 05:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
proposed language itself um the
 
05:36:57.470 --> 05:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
department would highlight um one or two
 
05:36:59.830 --> 05:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
technical points um and I'm going to go
 
05:37:01.750 --> 05:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
as slowly as possible tell me to slow
 
05:37:04.110 --> 05:37:04.120 align:start position:0%
down if you need me to um the the
 
05:37:07.868 --> 05:37:07.878 align:start position:0%
language in the bill is amending what is
 
05:37:07.878 --> 05:37:09.110 align:start position:0%
language in the bill is amending what is
currently

05:37:09.110 --> 05:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
currently
 
05:37:12.470 --> 05:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
60% um a compensation rate to Injured
 
05:37:14.868 --> 05:37:14.878 align:start position:0%
Workers that's based on 60% of that
 
05:37:17.270 --> 05:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
Injured Workers average weekly wage
 
05:37:19.788 --> 05:37:19.798 align:start position:0%
that's the current calculation um I
 
05:37:21.910 --> 05:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
think it's important to frame Indemnity
 
05:37:24.390 --> 05:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
payment um in the types that it that it
 
05:37:27.110 --> 05:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
can be paid in individuals who are out
 
05:37:29.030 --> 05:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
of work as the result of a work injury
 
05:37:31.310 --> 05:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
can be totally disabled or partially
 
05:37:33.750 --> 05:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
disabled in the statute there are
 
05:37:35.868 --> 05:37:35.878 align:start position:0%
actually four sections that address
 
05:37:37.948 --> 05:37:37.958 align:start position:0%
payment of total disability
 
05:37:41.150 --> 05:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
and partial disability um section 28 and
 
05:37:44.590 --> 05:37:44.600 align:start position:0%
section 28a address temporary total
 
05:37:46.548 --> 05:37:46.558 align:start position:0%
disability and permanent total
 
05:37:48.670 --> 05:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
disability um as written the bill is
 
05:37:51.510 --> 05:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
currently only amending one of the total
 
05:37:55.430 --> 05:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
sections it's section 28 um so a
 
05:37:56.990 --> 05:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
suggestion would be and we've discussed
 
05:38:00.190 --> 05:38:00.200 align:start position:0%
this with representative McKenzie um to
 
05:38:02.030 --> 05:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
con keep consistent if this change were
 
05:38:04.430 --> 05:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
to go through you um you could amend the
 
05:38:05.830 --> 05:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
language or it may be beneficial to
 
05:38:10.070 --> 05:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
amend the language in 28 1 a 28a so that
 
05:38:13.868 --> 05:38:13.878 align:start position:0%
the 66 and 2/3 is applicable uh across
 
05:38:16.990 --> 05:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
both temporary total disability and
 
05:38:19.270 --> 05:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
permanent total disability and just for
 
05:38:21.548 --> 05:38:21.558 align:start position:0%
context the mathematical calculation for
 
05:38:24.510 --> 05:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
how you reach the compensation rate
 
05:38:28.350 --> 05:38:28.360 align:start position:0%
across uh temporary versus permanent is
 
05:38:30.270 --> 05:38:30.280 align:start position:0%
exactly the same it's simply a medical
 
05:38:32.310 --> 05:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
status that demarcates whether you're
 
05:38:35.110 --> 05:38:35.120 align:start position:0%
temporarily disabled or to uh uh uh
 
05:38:37.070 --> 05:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
permanently disabled and we have the
 
05:38:40.750 --> 05:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
same technical suggestion um for the uh
 
05:38:45.150 --> 05:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
for the amendment to 281a 31 uh 31- a
 
05:38:48.510 --> 05:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
that is changing the uh percentage to 66
 
05:38:51.910 --> 05:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
and 23 but only for permanent partial
 
05:38:54.110 --> 05:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
disability it's not addressing section
 
05:38:57.948 --> 05:38:57.958 align:start position:0%
281 a31 which addresses temporary
 
05:39:00.150 --> 05:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
partial disability um so to keep it
 
05:39:02.230 --> 05:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
consistent if that's the idea and intent
 
05:39:04.948 --> 05:39:04.958 align:start position:0%
there's um an ie could be given towards
 
05:39:06.548 --> 05:39:06.558 align:start position:0%
uh changing those sections as well to
 
05:39:09.468 --> 05:39:09.478 align:start position:0%
reflect the 6 6 and
 
05:39:12.628 --> 05:39:12.638 align:start position:0%
2/3 um and again just like with uh the
 
05:39:14.990 --> 05:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
the total disability benefits the
 
05:39:17.708 --> 05:39:17.718 align:start position:0%
difference between permanent and
 
05:39:19.430 --> 05:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
temporary for partial disability
 
05:39:21.750 --> 05:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
benefits is simply a medical status a
 
05:39:23.948 --> 05:39:23.958 align:start position:0%
doctor has placed an injured worker at
 
05:39:25.468 --> 05:39:25.478 align:start position:0%
maximum medical improvement and
 
05:39:27.150 --> 05:39:27.160 align:start position:0%
determined they're at a certain type of
 
05:39:30.310 --> 05:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
medical end point um in general just by
 
05:39:31.910 --> 05:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
way of benefits Administration what
 
05:39:35.868 --> 05:39:35.878 align:start position:0%
would the 66 and 23% change be doing
 
05:39:37.750 --> 05:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
practically um it's going to change the
 
05:39:39.230 --> 05:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
weekly compensation rate the way that
 
05:39:41.150 --> 05:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
it's calculated for the eligible
 
05:39:43.468 --> 05:39:43.478 align:start position:0%
individuals receiving it um that will
 
05:39:44.948 --> 05:39:44.958 align:start position:0%
also have impact on the way that
 
05:39:46.948 --> 05:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
permanent impairment awards are paid
 
05:39:48.510 --> 05:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
permanent impairment Awards when an
 
05:39:50.628 --> 05:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
injured worker is eligible for one are
 
05:39:52.868 --> 05:39:52.878 align:start position:0%
based off of a prescribed number of
 
05:39:54.910 --> 05:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
weeks as set by Statute for the injured
 
05:39:57.310 --> 05:39:57.320 align:start position:0%
body part based off the individual's
 
05:39:59.430 --> 05:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
compensation rate so if there's a change
 
05:40:00.788 --> 05:40:00.798 align:start position:0%
to the way that you calculate
 
05:40:02.310 --> 05:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
compensation rate for a particular
 
05:40:04.270 --> 05:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
injured worker that will translate over
 
05:40:06.430 --> 05:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
to um payment of permanency Awards as
 
05:40:08.750 --> 05:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
well it will also have impact on Cola
 
05:40:10.070 --> 05:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
adjustments the cost of living
 
05:40:12.190 --> 05:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
adjustments under Section 29 which
 
05:40:14.430 --> 05:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
incorporate the mathematical percentages
 
05:40:16.788 --> 05:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
from section 28 when uh injured worker
 
05:40:18.868 --> 05:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
is eligible for Cola adjustments so
 
05:40:20.350 --> 05:40:20.360 align:start position:0%
those are the benefits that the change
 
05:40:22.708 --> 05:40:22.718 align:start position:0%
would be affecting within the system um
 
05:40:24.628 --> 05:40:24.638 align:start position:0%
the department understands um had heard
 
05:40:26.070 --> 05:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
from representative McKenzie and from a
 
05:40:28.548 --> 05:40:28.558 align:start position:0%
few others there's some questioner about
 
05:40:30.990 --> 05:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
when uh the effective date and who would
 
05:40:33.190 --> 05:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
be impacted or how would this impact
 
05:40:35.670 --> 05:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
existing claims um on review of the
 
05:40:37.390 --> 05:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
proposed language the Department's
 
05:40:38.750 --> 05:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
understanding is this would be a
 
05:40:40.948 --> 05:40:40.958 align:start position:0%
prospective application and the
 
05:40:42.628 --> 05:40:42.638 align:start position:0%
prospective application would more
 
05:40:44.468 --> 05:40:44.478 align:start position:0%
likely than not track to date of
 
05:40:47.190 --> 05:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
injuries that occur on or after the
 
05:40:49.628 --> 05:40:49.638 align:start position:0%
effective date um and that's in general
 
05:40:51.670 --> 05:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh consistent with how the workers
 
05:40:53.868 --> 05:40:53.878 align:start position:0%
compensation system and benefits work
 
05:40:55.468 --> 05:40:55.478 align:start position:0%
and because your average weekly wage and
 
05:40:57.548 --> 05:40:57.558 align:start position:0%
compensation rate really are established
 
05:40:58.830 --> 05:40:58.840 align:start position:0%
at the time that it's determined you
 
05:41:02.030 --> 05:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
have a compensable injury um uh just to
 
05:41:04.830 --> 05:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
kind of address the sort of voluntary
 
05:41:07.270 --> 05:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
insurance market and the self-insured
 
05:41:09.150 --> 05:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
Insurance Market uh whether you are
 
05:41:11.150 --> 05:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
looking at a self-insured employer who's
 
05:41:12.868 --> 05:41:12.878 align:start position:0%
pooling their money or participating as
 
05:41:14.910 --> 05:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
part of a trust or whether or not you're
 
05:41:16.670 --> 05:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
looking at an employer who elects to
 
05:41:18.830 --> 05:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
purchase voluntary coverage an injured
 
05:41:20.868 --> 05:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
worker is an injured worker so were this
 
05:41:22.868 --> 05:41:22.878 align:start position:0%
change to go into effect uh when a
 
05:41:24.708 --> 05:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
compensation rate is calculated for an
 
05:41:27.270 --> 05:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
injured worker it would be using this
 
05:41:29.110 --> 05:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
formula um as put forward in the
 
05:41:31.070 --> 05:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
proposed language regardless of whether
 
05:41:32.948 --> 05:41:32.958 align:start position:0%
or not the insurance carrier is a
 
05:41:34.350 --> 05:41:34.360 align:start position:0%
voluntary Market carrier or a
 
05:41:36.788 --> 05:41:36.798 align:start position:0%
self-insured carrier um and I am happy
 
05:41:38.628 --> 05:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions um should the
 
05:41:45.788 --> 05:41:45.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:49.468 --> 05:41:49.478 align:start position:0%
any represent Sullivan thank
 
05:41:53.070 --> 05:41:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:56.948 --> 05:41:56.958 align:start position:0%
um that uh um effective date in the
 
05:42:00.190 --> 05:42:00.200 align:start position:0%
prospective nature um based on the date
 
05:42:02.310 --> 05:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
of injury um is that something that
 
05:42:05.230 --> 05:42:05.240 align:start position:0%
needs to be written into the uh the the
 
05:42:06.948 --> 05:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
bill and the statute or is it something
 
05:42:08.230 --> 05:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
that the department would deal with
 
05:42:08.240 --> 05:42:09.030 align:start position:0%
that the department would deal with
through

05:42:09.030 --> 05:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:42:11.510 --> 05:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
rulemaking I don't I mean I think if the
 
05:42:13.948 --> 05:42:13.958 align:start position:0%
if there's an intent or or thought from
 
05:42:15.990 --> 05:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
the committee that Clarity needs to be
 
05:42:18.110 --> 05:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
added to the statute it certainly could
 
05:42:20.548 --> 05:42:20.558 align:start position:0%
be added to the statute um if it were
 
05:42:21.788 --> 05:42:21.798 align:start position:0%
something that ultimately ended up
 
05:42:23.430 --> 05:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
needing to be addressed by rule the
 
05:42:25.310 --> 05:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
department could look at that and and do
 
05:42:29.150 --> 05:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
it um in you know to to be clear as to
 
05:42:31.590 --> 05:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
why we don't view it as retroactive I we
 
05:42:33.190 --> 05:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
believe that in order for it to be a
 
05:42:36.270 --> 05:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
retroactive application language to that
 
05:42:37.510 --> 05:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
effect would actually need need to be
 
05:42:40.990 --> 05:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
put into the statute thank
 
05:42:43.868 --> 05:42:43.878 align:start position:0%
you okay uh representative hall and then
 
05:42:43.878 --> 05:42:45.030 align:start position:0%
you okay uh representative hall and then
representative

05:42:45.030 --> 05:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:42:47.590 --> 05:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
amalani uh am I correct in understanding
 
05:42:51.468 --> 05:42:51.478 align:start position:0%
that this increase is completely funded
 
05:42:54.110 --> 05:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
by premiums there's no effect
 
05:42:58.070 --> 05:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
on uh any other there doesn't the money
 
05:43:00.548 --> 05:43:00.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be drawn from any other
 
05:43:03.830 --> 05:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
source um if I understand the question
 
05:43:05.430 --> 05:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh correctly and correct me if I don't
 
05:43:10.468 --> 05:43:10.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:13.230 --> 05:43:13.240 align:start position:0%
absent the money would be coming from or
 
05:43:15.190 --> 05:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
paid through the insurance carriers so
 
05:43:16.788 --> 05:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
if the question is whether or not it
 
05:43:19.150 --> 05:43:19.160 align:start position:0%
would draw from any sort of state fund
 
05:43:21.788 --> 05:43:21.798 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank you um you know that
 
05:43:23.990 --> 05:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
the state is a self-insured you know
 
05:43:27.788 --> 05:43:27.798 align:start position:0%
entity so and we are the state is a um
 
05:43:29.990 --> 05:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
self-insurers itself um so there could
 
05:43:33.468 --> 05:43:33.478 align:start position:0%
be some impact there um I'm not the most
 
05:43:36.110 --> 05:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
well-versed in in sort of the rates and
 
05:43:39.750 --> 05:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
or how um that aspect would work but um
 
05:43:41.350 --> 05:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
you know if the state were to look at
 
05:43:43.190 --> 05:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
claims and determine that some
 
05:43:44.948 --> 05:43:44.958 align:start position:0%
additional monies were needed their
 
05:43:47.750 --> 05:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
potentially could be um some impact but
 
05:43:50.868 --> 05:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
by and large for any in uh insurance
 
05:43:52.510 --> 05:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
policy that's voluntary that's being
 
05:43:54.590 --> 05:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
borne through the voluntary Market not
 
05:43:57.430 --> 05:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
drawing off of any sort of State um or
 
05:43:59.868 --> 05:43:59.878 align:start position:0%
public fund that I'm aware of
 
05:43:59.878 --> 05:44:01.110 align:start position:0%
public fund that I'm aware of
Representative

05:44:01.110 --> 05:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
Representative
 
05:44:03.110 --> 05:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
avalani thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:44:06.070 --> 05:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner um for the payments
 
05:44:10.150 --> 05:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
at 66 and2 should we also look at the
 
05:44:12.708 --> 05:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
duration because it says 262 weeks
 
05:44:14.030 --> 05:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
should should there be a change in the
 
05:44:15.830 --> 05:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
duration of benefits if we are
 
05:44:18.150 --> 05:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
increasing them and the front end we
 
05:44:20.030 --> 05:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
should we decreasing them in the back to
 
05:44:23.430 --> 05:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
mitigate the overall effect of using
 
05:44:25.110 --> 05:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
general funds for self-insured or having
 
05:44:27.230 --> 05:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
an in increase in policies for private
 
05:44:27.240 --> 05:44:28.468 align:start position:0%
an in increase in policies for private
insurers

05:44:28.468 --> 05:44:28.478 align:start position:0%
insurers
 
05:44:30.868 --> 05:44:30.878 align:start position:0%
or you know where I'm going sure yeah no
 
05:44:32.750 --> 05:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
it's an excellent question um I think
 
05:44:35.070 --> 05:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
I'll just sort of note um to be hyper
 
05:44:39.310 --> 05:44:39.320 align:start position:0%
technical about it the 26 62 we uh cap
 
05:44:41.788 --> 05:44:41.798 align:start position:0%
is only applicable to partial benefits
 
05:44:43.788 --> 05:44:43.798 align:start position:0%
so total disability benefits whether
 
05:44:45.350 --> 05:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
they're temporary total disability
 
05:44:47.110 --> 05:44:47.120 align:start position:0%
benefits or permanent totally total
 
05:44:49.468 --> 05:44:49.478 align:start position:0%
disability benefits uh can arguably go
 
05:44:51.868 --> 05:44:51.878 align:start position:0%
on for a person's lifetime uh and there
 
05:44:53.910 --> 05:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
are certainly claims where an individual
 
05:44:55.590 --> 05:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
has received total disability throughout
 
05:44:56.868 --> 05:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
the entirety of their life from their
 
05:44:58.910 --> 05:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
date of injury going forward if an
 
05:45:01.990 --> 05:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
injured worker goes on to or goes into a
 
05:45:04.150 --> 05:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
partial disability status typically
 
05:45:06.070 --> 05:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
marked by that individual returning to
 
05:45:08.590 --> 05:45:08.600 align:start position:0%
work they have some earnings but not uh
 
05:45:10.190 --> 05:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
equaling the earnings that they had at
 
05:45:11.468 --> 05:45:11.478 align:start position:0%
the time of their injury there's a
 
05:45:12.868 --> 05:45:12.878 align:start position:0%
partial benefit that the insurance
 
05:45:15.910 --> 05:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
carrier pays um that's determined by
 
05:45:19.310 --> 05:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
paying this would propose 66 and 23% of
 
05:45:20.548 --> 05:45:20.558 align:start position:0%
the difference between the average
 
05:45:22.548 --> 05:45:22.558 align:start position:0%
weekly wage at the time of injury and
 
05:45:24.430 --> 05:45:24.440 align:start position:0%
the average earnings following the
 
05:45:26.548 --> 05:45:26.558 align:start position:0%
partial return to work um if the
 
05:45:28.590 --> 05:45:28.600 align:start position:0%
individual is on partial disability
 
05:45:30.510 --> 05:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
benefits at at the time that they hit
 
05:45:30.520 --> 05:45:31.230 align:start position:0%
benefits at at the time that they hit
their

05:45:31.230 --> 05:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:45:34.310 --> 05:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
262nd week of payment by operation of
 
05:45:36.270 --> 05:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
law they time out and the insurance
 
05:45:39.030 --> 05:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
carrier can cease making those payments
 
05:45:40.510 --> 05:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
the question as to whether or not
 
05:45:43.110 --> 05:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
there's sense or it's appropriate uh to
 
05:45:45.150 --> 05:45:45.160 align:start position:0%
alter that time frame I would defer to
 
05:45:46.590 --> 05:45:46.600 align:start position:0%
the committee I think that would be more
 
05:45:49.350 --> 05:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
of a a policy determination um certainly
 
05:45:51.190 --> 05:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
if there was an eye or intent towards
 
05:45:52.868 --> 05:45:52.878 align:start position:0%
changing that the department would be
 
05:45:55.230 --> 05:45:55.240 align:start position:0%
able to administer um whatever that
 
05:45:56.628 --> 05:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
change would
 
05:45:59.788 --> 05:45:59.798 align:start position:0%
be thank you
 
05:46:03.190 --> 05:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
okay repr Clair thank you Mr chair thank
 
05:46:04.868 --> 05:46:04.878 align:start position:0%
you Deputy Commissioner how long does a
 
05:46:06.948 --> 05:46:06.958 align:start position:0%
person have to be out to be able toay
 
05:46:09.430 --> 05:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
start claiming or or collecting on the
 
05:46:11.468 --> 05:46:11.478 align:start position:0%
benefit yeah that's an excellent
 
05:46:13.468 --> 05:46:13.478 align:start position:0%
question um when an injured worker goes
 
05:46:15.468 --> 05:46:15.478 align:start position:0%
out of work the statute I want to say
 
05:46:18.270 --> 05:46:18.280 align:start position:0%
it's section 22 sets a grace period so
 
05:46:20.430 --> 05:46:20.440 align:start position:0%
the first 3 days the insurance carrier
 
05:46:22.590 --> 05:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
is not liable to make payment to them
 
05:46:24.590 --> 05:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
unless the period of disability extends
 
05:46:27.110 --> 05:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
for 14 days or longer if the injured
 
05:46:31.030 --> 05:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
worker reaches that um 14th 15th day uh
 
05:46:33.150 --> 05:46:33.160 align:start position:0%
they haven't received payment yet and
 
05:46:34.868 --> 05:46:34.878 align:start position:0%
comp benefits are supposed to be paid on
 
05:46:37.548 --> 05:46:37.558 align:start position:0%
a weekly Bay uh basis so when they hit
 
05:46:40.750 --> 05:46:40.760 align:start position:0%
that 14th or more days uh that they're
 
05:46:43.070 --> 05:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
out of work or or disabled from work the
 
05:46:44.390 --> 05:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier should be going back
 
05:46:46.070 --> 05:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
and retroactively paying those first
 
05:46:48.270 --> 05:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
three days the injured worker goes back
 
05:46:50.310 --> 05:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
to work let's say on day five or six
 
05:46:52.390 --> 05:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
they're only going to get paid for no
 
05:46:53.230 --> 05:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
have to do
 
05:46:56.190 --> 05:46:56.200 align:start position:0%
math the the two days or three days that
 
05:46:57.868 --> 05:46:57.878 align:start position:0%
they were out because that grace period
 
05:46:59.310 --> 05:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
is going to apply for the first three
 
05:47:01.350 --> 05:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
days it's slightly modified for
 
05:47:03.230 --> 05:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
individuals who go back to work on a
 
05:47:04.990 --> 05:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
temporary alternative Duty status I
 
05:47:06.270 --> 05:47:06.280 align:start position:0%
believe the grace period for those
 
05:47:09.510 --> 05:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
individuals five days you're welcome
 
05:47:11.990 --> 05:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
great thank you represent K thank you Mr
 
05:47:15.230 --> 05:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you Deputy so uh if we
 
05:47:17.750 --> 05:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
were to uh add these sections that you
 
05:47:20.430 --> 05:47:20.440 align:start position:0%
recommended to be consistent and move
 
05:47:24.270 --> 05:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
the date out to uh January 1 2026 and
 
05:47:26.270 --> 05:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
only look at this
 
05:47:28.270 --> 05:47:28.280 align:start position:0%
perspectively uh this would be fairly
 
05:47:30.230 --> 05:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
simple to understand the cost and we've
 
05:47:32.868 --> 05:47:32.878 align:start position:0%
heard from ncci that they would be
 
05:47:34.750 --> 05:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
figuring that out and we heard from the
 
05:47:37.190 --> 05:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
actuary that would be one to five not
 
05:47:39.910 --> 05:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily five but there were already
 
05:47:41.788 --> 05:47:41.798 align:start position:0%
reductions because we've been so safe
 
05:47:45.270 --> 05:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
and so good uh would this be a fairly
 
05:47:48.548 --> 05:47:48.558 align:start position:0%
easy lift uh thinking that uh we would
 
05:47:51.350 --> 05:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
have better protections and and that the
 
05:47:54.070 --> 05:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
medical claims the duration is based on
 
05:47:57.430 --> 05:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
the medical condition not what we say it
 
05:47:57.440 --> 05:47:58.230 align:start position:0%
the medical condition not what we say it
should

05:47:58.230 --> 05:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
should
 
05:48:00.990 --> 05:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
be I'll I'll speak you know relative to
 
05:48:02.548 --> 05:48:02.558 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's an easy lift I'll
 
05:48:03.990 --> 05:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
speak from the Department's perspective
 
05:48:05.628 --> 05:48:05.638 align:start position:0%
I don't want to speak for ncci or the
 
05:48:07.468 --> 05:48:07.478 align:start position:0%
department of insurance I think um I'll
 
05:48:09.510 --> 05:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
leave it to them to to determine what's
 
05:48:11.868 --> 05:48:11.878 align:start position:0%
feasible or not feasible for them um you
 
05:48:13.430 --> 05:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
know if this were to go into effect in
 
05:48:15.830 --> 05:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
January of 2026 uh the department would
 
05:48:18.510 --> 05:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
be able to track to that date and and as
 
05:48:21.670 --> 05:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
as um claims reports are coming in for
 
05:48:23.590 --> 05:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
the Department to oversee and or
 
05:48:25.468 --> 05:48:25.478 align:start position:0%
regulate we would be able to keep track
 
05:48:28.868 --> 05:48:28.878 align:start position:0%
of that um again our understanding of
 
05:48:30.788 --> 05:48:30.798 align:start position:0%
the language as drafted is that it's
 
05:48:33.830 --> 05:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
going to be a prospective application uh
 
05:48:36.310 --> 05:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
if the date is 60 days from the date of
 
05:48:38.548 --> 05:48:38.558 align:start position:0%
Passage if it's a more defined date
 
05:48:40.510 --> 05:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
whatever that may be we would be looking
 
05:48:42.430 --> 05:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
to that date and injuries that occur
 
05:48:44.390 --> 05:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
more likely than not occur on or after
 
05:48:47.030 --> 05:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
that date to determine um you know
 
05:48:49.230 --> 05:48:49.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not when an insurance carrier
 
05:48:50.590 --> 05:48:50.600 align:start position:0%
is reporting I've started paying
 
05:48:52.350 --> 05:48:52.360 align:start position:0%
Indemnity benefits to an individual and
 
05:48:54.030 --> 05:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
there is a specific filing that they
 
05:48:55.910 --> 05:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
have to provide to the department they
 
05:48:57.350 --> 05:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
have to provide what's called a memo of
 
05:48:59.910 --> 05:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
payment uh and they have to provide a
 
05:49:02.390 --> 05:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
wage record showing earnings so that the
 
05:49:04.788 --> 05:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
department can vet and verify that they
 
05:49:06.948 --> 05:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
are using um have calculated the average
 
05:49:09.070 --> 05:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
weekly wage correctly and then computed
 
05:49:10.868 --> 05:49:10.878 align:start position:0%
the compensation rate which is what this
 
05:49:13.350 --> 05:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
bill is addressing um accurately we
 
05:49:15.468 --> 05:49:15.478 align:start position:0%
would be checking for injuries on or
 
05:49:17.310 --> 05:49:17.320 align:start position:0%
after whatever the effective date is did
 
05:49:18.948 --> 05:49:18.958 align:start position:0%
you use the appropriate percentage in
 
05:49:20.990 --> 05:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
determining the compensation rate uh the
 
05:49:22.708 --> 05:49:22.718 align:start position:0%
department I mean would need some time
 
05:49:24.590 --> 05:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
to update we provide a variety of
 
05:49:26.390 --> 05:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
resources and tools for insurance
 
05:49:28.150 --> 05:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
carriers to use in order to perform
 
05:49:30.430 --> 05:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
these mathematical exercises we provide
 
05:49:32.110 --> 05:49:32.120 align:start position:0%
trainings to insurance carriers to
 
05:49:34.830 --> 05:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
assist them in accurately um doing these
 
05:49:36.788 --> 05:49:36.798 align:start position:0%
calculations and filing the required
 
05:49:38.190 --> 05:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
documents with the Department we would
 
05:49:39.708 --> 05:49:39.718 align:start position:0%
need some time I think to update those
 
05:49:42.590 --> 05:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
tools to assist um to assist insurance
 
05:49:44.750 --> 05:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
carriers and employers with the change
 
05:49:47.628 --> 05:49:47.638 align:start position:0%
um but I I don't believe it would be an
 
05:49:50.510 --> 05:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
honorous lift for us to do that thank
 
05:49:53.670 --> 05:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
followup please thank you uh and again
 
05:49:57.150 --> 05:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
since the other uh 49 states already
 
05:50:00.910 --> 05:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
have this uh 66 and 2/3 the carriers it
 
05:50:02.868 --> 05:50:02.878 align:start position:0%
would not be a shock to them they would
 
05:50:05.468 --> 05:50:05.478 align:start position:0%
not be all new what do I do now uh in
 
05:50:07.270 --> 05:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
that situation correct
 
05:50:08.788 --> 05:50:08.798 align:start position:0%
that's a good question I I don't know
 
05:50:10.190 --> 05:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
that I can speak for the insurance
 
05:50:12.708 --> 05:50:12.718 align:start position:0%
carriers I think certainly if they're in
 
05:50:14.390 --> 05:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
hopefully if they're informed of the
 
05:50:16.270 --> 05:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
change they're aware of what the
 
05:50:18.030 --> 05:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
calculation is they should be able to
 
05:50:20.230 --> 05:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
make an adjustment um I don't know that
 
05:50:21.830 --> 05:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
the Department's in a position to speak
 
05:50:23.230 --> 05:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
for whether or not it will be difficult
 
05:50:27.788 --> 05:50:27.798 align:start position:0%
or not for them thank you you're welcome
 
05:50:30.670 --> 05:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
okay represent nalani please thank you
 
05:50:32.390 --> 05:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'll ask you ask the uh
 
05:50:33.708 --> 05:50:33.718 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner the same question I
 
05:50:35.868 --> 05:50:35.878 align:start position:0%
asked the man from the insurance
 
05:50:37.948 --> 05:50:37.958 align:start position:0%
department uh do you know why we are at
 
05:50:37.958 --> 05:50:39.150 align:start position:0%
department uh do you know why we are at
the

05:50:39.150 --> 05:50:39.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:50:42.270 --> 05:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
60% yeah I my answer I think is going to
 
05:50:45.310 --> 05:50:45.320 align:start position:0%
Echo um Mr citarella's the change went
 
05:50:47.150 --> 05:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
into effect my recollection is sometime
 
05:50:49.468 --> 05:50:49.478 align:start position:0%
in the 90s um it was well before my time
 
05:50:52.150 --> 05:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
at the department I mean I have spent a
 
05:50:54.670 --> 05:50:54.680 align:start position:0%
fair amount of time um both out of
 
05:50:57.230 --> 05:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
interest and related to my work with the
 
05:50:59.350 --> 05:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
Department looking through legislative
 
05:51:01.830 --> 05:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
history um I wasn't present for any of
 
05:51:03.910 --> 05:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
those clearly any of those meetings or
 
05:51:06.190 --> 05:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
conversations um so I understand the
 
05:51:07.510 --> 05:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
basis of the change as it's been
 
05:51:09.548 --> 05:51:09.558 align:start position:0%
explained to me by other you know by
 
05:51:11.110 --> 05:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
other Representatives or from my
 
05:51:14.070 --> 05:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
engagement um throughout um being at the
 
05:51:15.468 --> 05:51:15.478 align:start position:0%
legislature and from reading the
 
05:51:17.990 --> 05:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
legislative history but do I have direct
 
05:51:21.150 --> 05:51:21.160 align:start position:0%
knowledge of that I do not thank
 
05:51:26.430 --> 05:51:26.440 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no further comments and
 
05:51:29.390 --> 05:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
having no further pin cards uh thank you
 
05:51:33.548 --> 05:51:33.558 align:start position:0%
so much you're welcome um before we
 
05:51:36.030 --> 05:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
adjourn on 744 though I just I want to
 
05:51:37.390 --> 05:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
ask the
 
05:51:39.708 --> 05:51:39.718 align:start position:0%
considered opinion of the committee so
 
05:51:44.350 --> 05:51:44.360 align:start position:0%
the NCI ncci report would provide a more
 
05:51:47.430 --> 05:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
detailed analysis of the financial
 
05:51:50.510 --> 05:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
impact of this is that Mr Fantasy could
 
05:51:52.990 --> 05:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
you come on up
 
05:51:55.590 --> 05:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
please uh is it your opinion that it
 
05:51:58.708 --> 05:51:58.718 align:start position:0%
would be worth waiting for that analysis
 
05:52:01.190 --> 05:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
and and including that in
 
05:52:05.230 --> 05:52:05.240 align:start position:0%
testimony I hear one yes yes in
 
05:52:07.310 --> 05:52:07.320 align:start position:0%
general okay
 
05:52:09.990 --> 05:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh is it possible for you to produce
 
05:52:15.030 --> 05:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
something um with the modifications as
 
05:52:18.310 --> 05:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
as addressed by the
 
05:52:21.070 --> 05:52:21.080 align:start position:0%
17th So when you say the modifications
 
05:52:23.430 --> 05:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
as addressed so we should assume that
 
05:52:27.628 --> 05:52:27.638 align:start position:0%
the effective date would be January 1
 
05:52:30.628 --> 05:52:30.638 align:start position:0%
2026 correct okay and then the other
 
05:52:33.150 --> 05:52:33.160 align:start position:0%
thing and and I would like if uh
 
05:52:35.750 --> 05:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie your thoughts on
 
05:52:39.350 --> 05:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:41.468 --> 05:52:41.478 align:start position:0%
self-insured as part of it rather than
 
05:52:50.750 --> 05:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:52.830 --> 05:52:52.840 align:start position:0%
voluntary are there any thoughts from
 
05:52:54.350 --> 05:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
the committee on
 
05:52:56.310 --> 05:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
that oh that's possible too
 
05:52:58.270 --> 05:52:58.280 align:start position:0%
representative alalani thank you thank
 
05:53:01.670 --> 05:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um so the four sections
 
05:53:05.150 --> 05:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
of the um workman's comp block for the
 
05:53:08.430 --> 05:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
temporary p temporary disability po so
 
05:53:11.868 --> 05:53:11.878 align:start position:0%
we missed two so could you do the four
 
05:53:16.350 --> 05:53:16.360 align:start position:0%
sure on that the um effective date on
 
05:53:18.830 --> 05:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
126 um I think we heard from the
 
05:53:20.190 --> 05:53:20.200 align:start position:0%
insurance department that the
 
05:53:22.590 --> 05:53:22.600 align:start position:0%
self-insured really do essentially be
 
05:53:23.910 --> 05:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
adjusting that that that doesn't really
 
05:53:26.230 --> 05:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
fall within your purview it does not
 
05:53:28.110 --> 05:53:28.120 align:start position:0%
yeah we we they just don't report the
 
05:53:30.830 --> 05:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
claims data to us so we don't have the
 
05:53:32.350 --> 05:53:32.360 align:start position:0%
information to be able to do that sort
 
05:53:34.708 --> 05:53:34.718 align:start position:0%
of calculation okay but that represent
 
05:53:38.110 --> 05:53:38.120 align:start position:0%
that represents 4% of the popul or 6% of
 
05:53:41.070 --> 05:53:41.080 align:start position:0%
the population uh no the 6% that was
 
05:53:42.990 --> 05:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
referred to I think was the residual
 
05:53:45.548 --> 05:53:45.558 align:start position:0%
Market which uh okay it is something we
 
05:53:48.390 --> 05:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
would be able to price okay great so
 
05:53:51.230 --> 05:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
what what I would propose and just a
 
05:53:53.350 --> 05:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
just a sensing of the of the committee
 
05:53:57.150 --> 05:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
is that we recess this bill we reconvene
 
05:53:58.110 --> 05:53:58.120 align:start position:0%
on the
 
05:54:01.628 --> 05:54:01.638 align:start position:0%
18th with an amendment as we just
 
05:54:04.468 --> 05:54:04.478 align:start position:0%
discussed and an analysis from
 
05:54:06.830 --> 05:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
ncci so that we can get a better
 
05:54:08.430 --> 05:54:08.440 align:start position:0%
understanding of aact with the impact is
 
05:54:08.440 --> 05:54:10.788 align:start position:0%
understanding of aact with the impact is
that

05:54:10.788 --> 05:54:10.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:54:14.190 --> 05:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
generally everyone up with that okay
 
05:54:16.708 --> 05:54:16.718 align:start position:0%
more okay please thank you again Mr
 
05:54:19.310 --> 05:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
chairman um could the insurance
 
05:54:22.628 --> 05:54:22.638 align:start position:0%
department come up with a I don't say
 
05:54:24.390 --> 05:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
public sector but the public
 
05:54:27.110 --> 05:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
sector what it might raise the cost of
 
05:54:28.750 --> 05:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
the general fund if the state was to do
 
05:54:30.830 --> 05:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
it um I know primix really doesn't
 
05:54:33.190 --> 05:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
answer to ncci that they would answer to
 
05:54:36.548 --> 05:54:36.558 align:start position:0%
you um could you could J all them to get
 
05:54:41.510 --> 05:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:44.708 --> 05:54:44.718 align:start position:0%
numbers that would be difficult because
 
05:54:46.548 --> 05:54:46.558 align:start position:0%
we don't regulate primx we don't
 
05:54:47.788 --> 05:54:47.798 align:start position:0%
regulate the
 
05:54:50.070 --> 05:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
self-insurance we regulate the voluntary
 
05:54:53.788 --> 05:54:53.798 align:start position:0%
market and and the residual market and
 
05:54:55.750 --> 05:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
so they don't we don't have any
 
05:54:58.150 --> 05:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
authority over them did you ask them for
 
05:55:00.590 --> 05:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
what what this might cost them if we
 
05:55:02.270 --> 05:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
made this change they would might be
 
05:55:02.280 --> 05:55:03.628 align:start position:0%
made this change they would might be
interested

05:55:03.628 --> 05:55:03.638 align:start position:0%
interested
 
05:55:07.030 --> 05:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
in that down the road is that something
 
05:55:08.590 --> 05:55:08.600 align:start position:0%
that you would be able to do or would it
 
05:55:11.190 --> 05:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor representive Albert
 
05:55:13.788 --> 05:55:13.798 align:start position:0%
I didn't want to look over there but
 
05:55:15.750 --> 05:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
they do the hand from the back of the
 
05:55:20.150 --> 05:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:22.830 --> 05:55:22.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you U the Department of Labor
 
05:55:24.390 --> 05:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
is the agency that regulates
 
05:55:26.390 --> 05:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
self-insured entities um you know
 
05:55:28.230 --> 05:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
relative to how their their rates are
 
05:55:29.990 --> 05:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
set or what they charge in premiums
 
05:55:31.670 --> 05:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
that's not within our jurisdiction per
 
05:55:34.150 --> 05:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
se um but I'm happy to try to reach out
 
05:55:36.468 --> 05:55:36.478 align:start position:0%
to administrative Services risk manager
 
05:55:39.190 --> 05:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
M who is the um that's the sector of the
 
05:55:41.510 --> 05:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
state agency that um kind of handles
 
05:55:43.270 --> 05:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
state workers the state's workers
 
05:55:45.948 --> 05:55:45.958 align:start position:0%
compensation claims um to see if they
 
05:55:49.590 --> 05:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
can be of assistance follow for Fallout
 
05:55:53.430 --> 05:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
um I know as would would be helpful in
 
05:55:55.990 --> 05:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
that um at the state level but how do we
 
05:55:57.708 --> 05:55:57.718 align:start position:0%
get down to the county and local level
 
05:55:59.670 --> 05:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
if there's going to be increase I hate
 
05:56:00.910 --> 05:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
to say it because primx I think is the
 
05:56:03.430 --> 05:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
only game in town how would we get at
 
05:56:05.990 --> 05:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
least numbers from them to say okay well
 
05:56:07.868 --> 05:56:07.878 align:start position:0%
this might increase 10% at the local
 
05:56:09.948 --> 05:56:09.958 align:start position:0%
level 5% at the county and then the
 
05:56:12.190 --> 05:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
state might have a 3% increase it it's
 
05:56:14.750 --> 05:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
an excellent question um I'm I'm not
 
05:56:18.230 --> 05:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
sure to be honest uh I don't know I
 
05:56:20.350 --> 05:56:20.360 align:start position:0%
don't know the way or if that data can
 
05:56:23.350 --> 05:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
be captured it's not one of the
 
05:56:25.510 --> 05:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
requirements in order to be self-insured
 
05:56:27.910 --> 05:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
neither the statute the regulations um
 
05:56:31.750 --> 05:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
require that the self-insured entities
 
05:56:34.030 --> 05:56:34.040 align:start position:0%
provide uh provide that information to
 
05:56:35.788 --> 05:56:35.798 align:start position:0%
the department and it's not a piece of
 
05:56:37.708 --> 05:56:37.718 align:start position:0%
information that's contingent upon their
 
05:56:41.030 --> 05:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
being certified to self-insure um I can
 
05:56:43.190 --> 05:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
try to take a look it's but I do want to
 
05:56:44.510 --> 05:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
be clear it's not information that the
 
05:56:46.390 --> 05:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor has so I'm not
 
05:56:48.788 --> 05:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
really certain where where it could or
 
05:56:51.948 --> 05:56:51.958 align:start position:0%
would come from and for a followup um
 
05:56:54.510 --> 05:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
but um primex if there's any injuries at
 
05:56:57.230 --> 05:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
the local County or state level they
 
05:56:58.628 --> 05:56:58.638 align:start position:0%
would have to report to the Department
 
05:57:02.150 --> 05:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
of Labor that is correct so if primex is
 
05:57:04.190 --> 05:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
the um third party administrator for the
 
05:57:06.390 --> 05:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
host of towns municipalities school
 
05:57:08.390 --> 05:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
districts whomever is within their um
 
05:57:10.990 --> 05:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
their group or their pool the injuries
 
05:57:12.830 --> 05:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
would be reported to the department but
 
05:57:14.788 --> 05:57:14.798 align:start position:0%
I believe and tell me if I'm not
 
05:57:15.788 --> 05:57:15.798 align:start position:0%
understanding the question correctly
 
05:57:17.030 --> 05:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
believe you're asking after what would
 
05:57:18.670 --> 05:57:18.680 align:start position:0%
that do to sort of their premium rates
 
05:57:21.670 --> 05:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
or what they're charging um or the c or
 
05:57:23.390 --> 05:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
are you looking for more of the cost of
 
05:57:25.868 --> 05:57:25.878 align:start position:0%
the claims Administration no no just the
 
05:57:27.350 --> 05:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
cost if there's going to be increase at
 
05:57:28.628 --> 05:57:28.638 align:start position:0%
the local level for their insurance
 
05:57:29.948 --> 05:57:29.958 align:start position:0%
policies because they have to pick up
 
05:57:32.670 --> 05:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
this extra 11% increase um we've heard
 
05:57:34.548 --> 05:57:34.558 align:start position:0%
from ncci the insurance there might be a
 
05:57:36.468 --> 05:57:36.478 align:start position:0%
small increase if that going to
 
05:57:38.510 --> 05:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
translate down to uh the state
 
05:57:39.948 --> 05:57:39.958 align:start position:0%
self-insured so that just might be more
 
05:57:41.430 --> 05:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
General funds or if it just if it's
 
05:57:43.390 --> 05:57:43.400 align:start position:0%
Prime X it might be a small increase in
 
05:57:46.350 --> 05:57:46.360 align:start position:0%
their premiums to their municipality I I
 
05:57:47.948 --> 05:57:47.958 align:start position:0%
will see if it's something that we may
 
05:57:50.628 --> 05:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
be able to put together I'm I'm not
 
05:57:52.190 --> 05:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
certain that we have the data I would
 
05:57:53.788 --> 05:57:53.798 align:start position:0%
have to go back to the department and
 
05:57:55.628 --> 05:57:55.638 align:start position:0%
check but I'm happy to see thank you
 
05:57:57.468 --> 05:57:57.478 align:start position:0%
thank appreciate that thank you good
 
05:57:59.350 --> 05:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
question okay so that's the course of
 
05:58:01.868 --> 05:58:01.878 align:start position:0%
action then if you folks could come back

744 the on 540 on 542 yeah no I I think

10 and we're here to talk about 378 FN

able to lose the FN with with the
 
06:03:34.360 --> 06:03:36.030 align:start position:0%
able to lose the FN with with the
amendment

06:03:36.030 --> 06:03:36.040 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:03:38.430 --> 06:03:38.440 align:start position:0%
which I is always a good thing to do
 
06:03:40.468 --> 06:03:40.478 align:start position:0%
I've made several adjustments to you
 
06:03:43.270 --> 06:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
know please this one and that one uh but
 
06:03:45.190 --> 06:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
basically what I've what I'm trying to
 
06:03:48.070 --> 06:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
do is make sure
 
06:03:48.080 --> 06:03:49.590 align:start position:0%
do is make sure
that

06:03:49.590 --> 06:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:03:53.270 --> 06:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
oh uh make sure that the in the event of
 
06:03:56.628 --> 06:03:56.638 align:start position:0%
a situation uh beyond the control of an
 
06:03:58.990 --> 06:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
employee uh who
 
06:04:03.190 --> 06:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
has uh unused vacation time and is
 
06:04:05.350 --> 06:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
denied the opportunity to to take that
 
06:04:07.990 --> 06:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
vacation time that under certain
 
06:04:10.390 --> 06:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
situations limited situations they would
 
06:04:10.400 --> 06:04:11.468 align:start position:0%
situations limited situations they would
be

06:04:11.468 --> 06:04:11.478 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:04:14.390 --> 06:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
paid uh the other situation that's
 
06:04:15.990 --> 06:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
covered in in the event that the
 
06:04:19.110 --> 06:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
business is sold uh It's Not Unusual and
 
06:04:21.788 --> 06:04:21.798 align:start position:0%
I'd say it's rather typical that the if
 
06:04:24.230 --> 06:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
the employee stays on with the new owner
 
06:04:27.110 --> 06:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
they normally carry over you know the
 
06:04:28.948 --> 06:04:28.958 align:start position:0%
the unused time and that's part of the
 
06:04:31.030 --> 06:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
sale agreement so that's another option
 
06:04:32.190 --> 06:04:32.200 align:start position:0%
in that
 
06:04:34.708 --> 06:04:34.718 align:start position:0%
situation uh the sale of the business
 
06:04:36.708 --> 06:04:36.718 align:start position:0%
and the person just walks away and
 
06:04:39.590 --> 06:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't pay because their policy said
 
06:04:42.190 --> 06:04:42.200 align:start position:0%
upon termination uh we don't pay
 
06:04:44.590 --> 06:04:44.600 align:start position:0%
vacation I I think that's a
 
06:04:47.110 --> 06:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
problem so I have
 
06:04:51.030 --> 06:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
included let's see you had the
 
06:04:55.070 --> 06:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
bill you have a couple of examples uh of
 
06:04:55.080 --> 06:04:55.990 align:start position:0%
bill you have a couple of examples uh of
wage

06:04:55.990 --> 06:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
wage
 
06:04:59.708 --> 06:04:59.718 align:start position:0%
claims that uh where the claim it did
 
06:05:02.708 --> 06:05:02.718 align:start position:0%
not Prevail largely because of this uh
 
06:05:06.030 --> 06:05:06.040 align:start position:0%
policy blanket policy and uh I'll just
 
06:05:09.190 --> 06:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
take a look at this most recent one uh a
 
06:05:12.788 --> 06:05:12.798 align:start position:0%
gentleman was a a car salesman and I
 
06:05:14.468 --> 06:05:14.478 align:start position:0%
know we don't necessarily hold Carl
 
06:05:16.430 --> 06:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
salesman in in high esteem but he went
 
06:05:18.788 --> 06:05:18.798 align:start position:0%
he worked and he worked for I think 13
 
06:05:21.230 --> 06:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
years for the for the company and then
 
06:05:22.628 --> 06:05:22.638 align:start position:0%
they closed the
 
06:05:26.670 --> 06:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
dealership and their policy was we don't
 
06:05:29.270 --> 06:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
pay at the at termination he was not
 
06:05:32.670 --> 06:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
fired for cause he didn't uh wasn't any
 
06:05:34.868 --> 06:05:34.878 align:start position:0%
uh any issue like that I I happen to
 
06:05:36.628 --> 06:05:36.638 align:start position:0%
Google his name and I saw these nice
 
06:05:39.070 --> 06:05:39.080 align:start position:0%
reviews customers that Au thought he did
 
06:05:41.628 --> 06:05:41.638 align:start position:0%
a swell job it's just that that was
 
06:05:44.310 --> 06:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
their policy the other thing I want to
 
06:05:48.030 --> 06:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
draw your attention to is that they had
 
06:05:48.040 --> 06:05:49.670 align:start position:0%
draw your attention to is that they had
this

06:05:49.670 --> 06:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:05:53.670 --> 06:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:53.680 --> 06:06:03.910 align:start position:0%
 
the

06:06:03.910 --> 06:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:06.788 --> 06:06:06.798 align:start position:0%
um right no used time will be paid out
 
06:06:08.030 --> 06:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
at the end of employment whether the
 
06:06:09.830 --> 06:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
termination of employment is voluntary
 
06:06:12.110 --> 06:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
or involuntary and whether the unused
 
06:06:15.310 --> 06:06:15.320 align:start position:0%
time is personal sick or or vacation uh
 
06:06:18.430 --> 06:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
this person's acred PTO 3 weeks would
 
06:06:22.150 --> 06:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
have was worth uh $
 
06:06:22.160 --> 06:06:24.390 align:start position:0%
have was worth uh $
571737

06:06:24.390 --> 06:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
571737
 
06:06:26.990 --> 06:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
so it's not small
 
06:06:27.000 --> 06:06:30.670 align:start position:0%
so it's not small
change

06:06:30.670 --> 06:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:33.110 --> 06:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
um he he made the mistake of not
 
06:06:35.230 --> 06:06:35.240 align:start position:0%
bringing documentation and this is part
 
06:06:37.628 --> 06:06:37.638 align:start position:0%
of what I I I hope the department when
 
06:06:39.788 --> 06:06:39.798 align:start position:0%
someone files a claim they say you know
 
06:06:40.990 --> 06:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
this is the sort of thing you need to
 
06:06:42.708 --> 06:06:42.718 align:start position:0%
bring with you and you're going to make
 
06:06:44.270 --> 06:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
your best effort if you're not going to
 
06:06:46.468 --> 06:06:46.478 align:start position:0%
bring a lawyer you should know exactly
 
06:06:49.708 --> 06:06:49.718 align:start position:0%
what evidence you need to bring and um
 
06:06:52.110 --> 06:06:52.120 align:start position:0%
his defense was kind of un his claim was
 
06:06:55.510 --> 06:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
kind of unusual that he felt the policy
 
06:06:57.190 --> 06:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh because the the handbook had said
 
06:07:01.350 --> 06:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
this is not a legal agreement or
 
06:07:04.070 --> 06:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
contract that you know and yet you know
 
06:07:06.468 --> 06:07:06.478 align:start position:0%
he signs the policy every year here so
 
06:07:10.910 --> 06:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
that that that was not effective and
 
06:07:15.230 --> 06:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
um in any case uh he Li he's out 5,700
 
06:07:18.990 --> 06:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
and change uh in my own Community uh an
 
06:07:22.030 --> 06:07:22.040 align:start position:0%
assisted living center uh the business
 
06:07:24.788 --> 06:07:24.798 align:start position:0%
was sold the they had the similar policy
 
06:07:27.510 --> 06:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
it's not paid out of vacation and five
 
06:07:28.990 --> 06:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
people who stayed on with the new
 
06:07:31.310 --> 06:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
employer filed wage
 
06:07:35.548 --> 06:07:35.558 align:start position:0%
claims and they lost uh a total of 20
 
06:07:40.468 --> 06:07:40.478 align:start position:0%
261 and44 so roughly in the range of 300
 
06:07:44.708 --> 06:07:44.718 align:start position:0%
to just under $600 each and we're
 
06:07:47.110 --> 06:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
talking someone working in an assisted
 
06:07:49.990 --> 06:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
living center back in 2014 probably not
 
06:07:54.590 --> 06:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
making a lot of money and and this was
 
06:08:03.070 --> 06:08:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:06.150 --> 06:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh someone I happen to know
 
06:08:08.190 --> 06:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
uh she was a shipper worked at a
 
06:08:11.548 --> 06:08:11.558 align:start position:0%
computer reseller company and they had a
 
06:08:14.708 --> 06:08:14.718 align:start position:0%
very nice policy uh they the the owner
 
06:08:17.670 --> 06:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
included some notes Here in his defense
 
06:08:21.190 --> 06:08:21.200 align:start position:0%
um so the V vacation requests have to be
 
06:08:23.990 --> 06:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
in writing at least two weeks in
 
06:08:30.510 --> 06:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:33.070 --> 06:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
um vacation cannot be carried over to
 
06:08:34.868 --> 06:08:34.878 align:start position:0%
the following year however vacation pay
 
06:08:36.350 --> 06:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
is granted said at the beginning of the
 
06:08:38.548 --> 06:08:38.558 align:start position:0%
following calendar year in L of taking
 
06:08:41.910 --> 06:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
the actual time off uh no more than 10
 
06:08:43.868 --> 06:08:43.878 align:start position:0%
days of vacation can be taken at one
 
06:08:46.150 --> 06:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
time without special management
 
06:08:46.160 --> 06:08:48.390 align:start position:0%
time without special management
approval

06:08:48.390 --> 06:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
approval
 
06:08:50.830 --> 06:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
and uh one day she goes to work and
 
06:08:53.110 --> 06:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
she's and she's laid off so there was no
 
06:08:56.230 --> 06:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take two oh two weeks
 
06:08:58.750 --> 06:08:58.760 align:start position:0%
from now I'd like to take this time off
 
06:09:02.670 --> 06:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
that just wasn't possible so there's
 
06:09:05.510 --> 06:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
there's a situation where you know she
 
06:09:08.708 --> 06:09:08.718 align:start position:0%
had she was out
 
06:09:08.718 --> 06:09:10.468 align:start position:0%
had she was out
uh

06:09:10.468 --> 06:09:10.478 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:09:10.478 --> 06:09:13.750 align:start position:0%
uh
um

06:09:13.750 --> 06:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:19.230 --> 06:09:19.240 align:start position:0%
23508 and no fault of her own uh a good
 
06:09:21.708 --> 06:09:21.718 align:start position:0%
employee who just happened to get laid
 
06:09:24.070 --> 06:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
off without knowing that she really
 
06:09:25.548 --> 06:09:25.558 align:start position:0%
should have been taking all the vacation
 
06:09:27.548 --> 06:09:27.558 align:start position:0%
time you know take a day off every week
 
06:09:29.150 --> 06:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
just in case they lay you off is that
 
06:09:31.590 --> 06:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
the way we want to work in New Hampshire
 
06:09:33.190 --> 06:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
is that that is that what employeers
 
06:09:35.548 --> 06:09:35.558 align:start position:0%
want to do I I don't think so that's not
 
06:09:36.868 --> 06:09:36.878 align:start position:0%
what the employers here telling me that
 
06:09:37.788 --> 06:09:37.798 align:start position:0%
they would
 
06:09:37.798 --> 06:09:39.590 align:start position:0%
they would
do

06:09:39.590 --> 06:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:09:43.390 --> 06:09:43.400 align:start position:0%
um so uh you all have this document
 
06:09:45.468 --> 06:09:45.478 align:start position:0%
which sort of a bit of a
 
06:09:48.830 --> 06:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
history um and we go back to the
 
06:09:50.788 --> 06:09:50.798 align:start position:0%
Department's records of of these events
 
06:09:54.310 --> 06:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
it's not uh it's bad it's bad if it
 
06:09:56.230 --> 06:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
happens to to you but it's bad if it
 
06:09:59.150 --> 06:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
happens to someone else and and so in 20
 
06:09:59.160 --> 06:10:00.190 align:start position:0%
happens to someone else and and so in 20
in

06:10:00.190 --> 06:10:00.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:10:03.350 --> 06:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
2018 um there were wage claims there
 
06:10:06.150 --> 06:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
were 121 wage claim hearing
 
06:10:07.948 --> 06:10:07.958 align:start position:0%
and I I want to add that not every wage
 
06:10:10.390 --> 06:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
claim goes to a hearing sometimes you
 
06:10:13.030 --> 06:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
know they they just settle it or they
 
06:10:17.030 --> 06:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
don't follow through uh but 121 wage
 
06:10:18.788 --> 06:10:18.798 align:start position:0%
claims were posted on the on their
 
06:10:20.628 --> 06:10:20.638 align:start position:0%
website which they don't do anymore and
 
06:10:22.350 --> 06:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
again they they weren't posting every
 
06:10:26.948 --> 06:10:26.958 align:start position:0%
single one but of that 121 29 which is
 
06:10:31.830 --> 06:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
24% involved vacation PTO wages and the
 
06:10:34.990 --> 06:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
next year and 34 of them uh were posted
 
06:10:38.910 --> 06:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
and 9 which is 26% involveed vacation
 
06:10:40.750 --> 06:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
wages in
 
06:10:44.830 --> 06:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
2021 uh 51 wage claims uh 15 of these
 
06:10:44.840 --> 06:10:45.670 align:start position:0%
2021 uh 51 wage claims uh 15 of these
that's

06:10:45.670 --> 06:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's
 
06:10:50.750 --> 06:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
29% 2022 35 wage claims of those only
 
06:10:53.230 --> 06:10:53.240 align:start position:0%
three but that's 8% and if you're in the
 
06:10:57.788 --> 06:10:57.798 align:start position:0%
8% it's important to you um in 2020 the
 
06:11:00.628 --> 06:11:00.638 align:start position:0%
the wage claims were not posted and but
 
06:11:04.190 --> 06:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
there were four 144 that invol and that
 
06:11:08.590 --> 06:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
had PTO as an issue uh of those 61 which
 
06:11:11.350 --> 06:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
is 42% ultimately went to a
 
06:11:13.510 --> 06:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
hearing uh parties may have reached an
 
06:11:14.708 --> 06:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
agreement or
 
06:11:14.718 --> 06:11:16.270 align:start position:0%
agreement or
settled

06:11:16.270 --> 06:11:16.280 align:start position:0%
settled
 
06:11:21.510 --> 06:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
um let's see and and more recently
 
06:11:24.868 --> 06:11:24.878 align:start position:0%
20124 there were 188 wage claim hearings
 
06:11:29.510 --> 06:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
of those eight or 4% involved vacation
 
06:11:32.548 --> 06:11:32.558 align:start position:0%
PTO so it it happens frequently enough
 
06:11:35.030 --> 06:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
so that we should do something about it
 
06:11:36.750 --> 06:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
and if it happens to one of your
 
06:11:39.590 --> 06:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
constituents or one of your family
 
06:11:42.150 --> 06:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
members uh you might say that that's not
 
06:11:45.670 --> 06:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
right that wasn't fair and why would why
 
06:11:48.390 --> 06:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
should the employer not pay what the
 
06:11:51.350 --> 06:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
employee had earned that's the whole
 
06:11:53.830 --> 06:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
premise here that the vacation is
 
06:11:57.150 --> 06:11:57.160 align:start position:0%
earned and when something happens that
 
06:11:59.270 --> 06:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
circumstances that are like and limited
 
06:12:02.070 --> 06:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
as they are in this bill uh it's I think
 
06:12:05.350 --> 06:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
it's the obligation of the employer to
 
06:12:07.350 --> 06:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
in the in the case of the of the uh
 
06:12:09.190 --> 06:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
ownership changing and the employees
 
06:12:11.830 --> 06:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
staying on and make arrangements you
 
06:12:13.190 --> 06:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
know that's going to be reflected in the
 
06:12:15.310 --> 06:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
purchase rights but that's your job make
 
06:12:17.070 --> 06:12:17.080 align:start position:0%
arrangements so that those those
 
06:12:19.750 --> 06:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
vacation hours are transferred or pay
 
06:12:22.190 --> 06:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
them um the other thing that I want to
 
06:12:23.948 --> 06:12:23.958 align:start position:0%
mention I know we're we're terribly
 
06:12:26.590 --> 06:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
interested in protecting the UN
 
06:12:29.510 --> 06:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
Insurance uh the insurance trust fund
 
06:12:31.750 --> 06:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
and when you lose your job you can go
 
06:12:33.468 --> 06:12:33.478 align:start position:0%
down to the unemployment office and they
 
06:12:36.070 --> 06:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
ask you did you get sever or vacation
 
06:12:38.510 --> 06:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
pay and if the answer is yes they want
 
06:12:41.150 --> 06:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
to know how much and you won't claim you
 
06:12:43.670 --> 06:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
won't have a claim any unemployment
 
06:12:46.350 --> 06:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
benefits until that amount is exhausted
 
06:12:50.030 --> 06:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
so we are we are in some sense uh
 
06:12:53.350 --> 06:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
protecting that fund easing the burden
 
06:12:57.070 --> 06:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
on our employers if we pass this bill
 
06:12:59.708 --> 06:12:59.718 align:start position:0%
now let me get to the
 
06:13:03.350 --> 06:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
amendment so
 
06:13:06.788 --> 06:13:06.798 align:start position:0%
um right so we we do add in here not
 
06:13:09.590 --> 06:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
terminated for clause which I I thought
 
06:13:11.230 --> 06:13:11.240 align:start position:0%
should have been fairly obvious but we
 
06:13:14.030 --> 06:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
had it just to make sure we added the 30
 
06:13:17.030 --> 06:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
the maximum of 30 days of unused time
 
06:13:18.910 --> 06:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
payoff that's something that the UNH
 
06:13:21.830 --> 06:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
system has a very generous uh
 
06:13:25.510 --> 06:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
plan uh we exclude sick days because we
 
06:13:27.548 --> 06:13:27.558 align:start position:0%
hope you don't get sick but if you if
 
06:13:29.390 --> 06:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
you were sick you should have taken the
 
06:13:32.430 --> 06:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
time um and we talk about we talked
 
06:13:34.230 --> 06:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
about PR rating this in the past and I
 
06:13:36.430 --> 06:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
know representative bani came to
 
06:13:38.150 --> 06:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
understand what that means so it it's
 
06:13:40.430 --> 06:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
really just a fer system if you don't
 
06:13:41.468 --> 06:13:41.478 align:start position:0%
have the
 
06:13:44.590 --> 06:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
acral and the only other odd thing in
 
06:13:48.110 --> 06:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
here uh is is uh apart from last year's
 
06:13:50.230 --> 06:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
Bill where we had people who have
 
06:13:50.240 --> 06:13:51.590 align:start position:0%
Bill where we had people who have
seasonal

06:13:51.590 --> 06:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
seasonal
 
06:13:55.590 --> 06:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
employees uh construction or uh
 
06:13:57.990 --> 06:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
landscaping and they have an there's a
 
06:13:59.468 --> 06:13:59.478 align:start position:0%
time when the weather changes and
 
06:14:01.510 --> 06:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
there's a layoff and I know from Mr
 
06:14:04.230 --> 06:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
labers that uh if it's going to be 11
 
06:14:06.628 --> 06:14:06.638 align:start position:0%
weeks and the employ writes a note the
 
06:14:08.510 --> 06:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
employee can collect unemployment and
 
06:14:11.030 --> 06:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
not do a not do a job search because
 
06:14:13.708 --> 06:14:13.718 align:start position:0%
they're going back to work I I didn't
 
06:14:15.830 --> 06:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
put that in here because I don't know if
 
06:14:18.190 --> 06:14:18.200 align:start position:0%
the season will be 11 weeks or 12 weeks
 
06:14:20.628 --> 06:14:20.638 align:start position:0%
or if there could be an extension but if
 
06:14:22.708 --> 06:14:22.718 align:start position:0%
there's if they have no reasonable
 
06:14:24.788 --> 06:14:24.798 align:start position:0%
Assurance of coming back to work if they
 
06:14:27.270 --> 06:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
say no I'm not going to bring it back
 
06:14:29.430 --> 06:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
you know when the weather is permitting
 
06:14:33.948 --> 06:14:33.958 align:start position:0%
then you should get your vacation pay um
 
06:14:35.548 --> 06:14:35.558 align:start position:0%
paid to you
 
06:14:37.230 --> 06:14:37.240 align:start position:0%
and go collect unemployment anyway but
 
06:14:38.590 --> 06:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
you should get the vacation pay and that
 
06:14:40.150 --> 06:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
will reduce the unemployment or delay
 
06:14:42.990 --> 06:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
the claim so those are the the odd
 
06:14:44.750 --> 06:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
wrinkles that we have because you can't
 
06:14:47.708 --> 06:14:47.718 align:start position:0%
have one size fits all there's lots of
 
06:14:50.190 --> 06:14:50.200 align:start position:0%
what about what about what if but this
 
06:14:53.350 --> 06:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
is basically uh not we the there's a lot
 
06:14:54.830 --> 06:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
of businesses in New Hampshire that have
 
06:14:57.948 --> 06:14:57.958 align:start position:0%
a license a license to do this or to do
 
06:15:00.150 --> 06:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
that but there's no license to
 
06:15:03.868 --> 06:15:03.878 align:start position:0%
steal and this is wage theft although
 
06:15:07.110 --> 06:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
it's legal right now and I hope you will

you so much for uh accommodating my uh
 
06:15:43.868 --> 06:15:43.878 align:start position:0%
schedule and child care needs uh the
 
06:15:45.628 --> 06:15:45.638 align:start position:0%
department is neutral on this bill
 
06:15:47.990 --> 06:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
though the department has um worked
 
06:15:50.430 --> 06:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
extensively with um representative
 
06:15:53.590 --> 06:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
kahill on prior versions of this bill uh
 
06:15:55.628 --> 06:15:55.638 align:start position:0%
we do have one piece of technical
 
06:15:57.948 --> 06:15:57.958 align:start position:0%
guidance or technical suggestion which
 
06:16:00.788 --> 06:16:00.798 align:start position:0%
is um in the original Bill line
 
06:16:03.230 --> 06:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
19 um uses this phrase reasonable
 
06:16:05.788 --> 06:16:05.798 align:start position:0%
Assurance or no reasonable assurance
 
06:16:08.270 --> 06:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
um of the employee being able to return
 
06:16:12.070 --> 06:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
to the employer uh it's not clear to the
 
06:16:14.628 --> 06:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
department what evidence would be needed
 
06:16:17.510 --> 06:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
to show a reasonable Assurance for
 
06:16:18.548 --> 06:16:18.558 align:start position:0%
instance whether it's got to be in
 
06:16:19.990 --> 06:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
writing whether it doesn't have to be in
 
06:16:23.070 --> 06:16:23.080 align:start position:0%
writing um or what really qualifies as
 
06:16:26.430 --> 06:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable so our suggestion would be to
 
06:16:29.830 --> 06:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
um clarify or or make more specific what
 
06:16:33.868 --> 06:16:33.878 align:start position:0%
would be reasonable um both for so that
 
06:16:35.830 --> 06:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
we have clear guidance when it comes to
 
06:16:38.548 --> 06:16:38.558 align:start position:0%
enforcement um but also setting clear
 
06:16:41.190 --> 06:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
expectations for employers uh and their
 
06:16:43.590 --> 06:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
own practices beyond that I'm happy to
 
06:16:46.670 --> 06:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
take questions uh that's great input any
 
06:16:47.948 --> 06:16:47.958 align:start position:0%
questions or
 
06:16:50.708 --> 06:16:50.718 align:start position:0%
comments representative avalani thank
 
06:16:52.150 --> 06:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
you uh that was going to be a question
 
06:16:55.110 --> 06:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
and on the amendment uh do you have that
 
06:16:57.070 --> 06:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
in front of you I do yes um can you
 
06:16:57.080 --> 06:16:59.350 align:start position:0%
in front of you I do yes um can you
define

06:16:59.350 --> 06:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
define
 
06:17:01.830 --> 06:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
cause what was definition if you were
 
06:17:03.510 --> 06:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
looking at it what would be defined as
 
06:17:09.430 --> 06:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:12.310 --> 06:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
yeah under line seven fourth word over
 
06:17:14.830 --> 06:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
sure um the bill does not independently
 
06:17:16.670 --> 06:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
seem to Define that I mean the the
 
06:17:18.150 --> 06:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
department does not have an independent
 
06:17:22.030 --> 06:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
definition of termination for cause um
 
06:17:23.310 --> 06:17:23.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps there's a definition in the
 
06:17:25.590 --> 06:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
employment security laws but there
 
06:17:28.628 --> 06:17:28.638 align:start position:0%
there's none under our laws so we would
 
06:17:31.468 --> 06:17:31.478 align:start position:0%
um if if the committee wish to Define
 
06:17:33.110 --> 06:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
that as well that would be that would be
 
06:17:35.430 --> 06:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
great thank you thank you Mr
 
06:17:38.788 --> 06:17:38.798 align:start position:0%
all right good point any other
 
06:17:41.030 --> 06:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
questions all right sir I think we made
 
06:17:42.948 --> 06:17:42.958 align:start position:0%
our uh cut off at
 
06:17:44.948 --> 06:17:44.958 align:start position:0%
415 you won't be in trouble when you get
 
06:17:46.948 --> 06:17:46.958 align:start position:0%

06:17:49.310 --> 06:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
kill could you come on back up thank you
 
06:17:53.030 --> 06:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you sir yeah um and do we have any
 
06:17:55.948 --> 06:17:55.958 align:start position:0%
questions from can I can I help with Mr
 
06:17:58.910 --> 06:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
avani's Question As You Wish thank you
 
06:18:02.468 --> 06:18:02.478 align:start position:0%
sir um yes this is the cause is not
 
06:18:05.350 --> 06:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
defined and this is part of why it's a
 
06:18:07.510 --> 06:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
problem to have it but we it's like
 
06:18:09.190 --> 06:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
obscenity you you you can't Define it
 
06:18:11.868 --> 06:18:11.878 align:start position:0%
but you know it when you see it so uh
 
06:18:13.628 --> 06:18:13.638 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Employment
 
06:18:15.590 --> 06:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
Security when this when someone is fired
 
06:18:18.468 --> 06:18:18.478 align:start position:0%
for cause they'll ask them what happened
 
06:18:20.830 --> 06:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
and they can appeal if if it's a
 
06:18:23.670 --> 06:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable person if a reasonable person
 
06:18:26.030 --> 06:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
would find this situation untenable you
 
06:18:29.150 --> 06:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
know you if you quit you quit that I
 
06:18:31.310 --> 06:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
know they have that that consideration I
 
06:18:34.150 --> 06:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
believe it may also apply for unjust
 
06:18:36.430 --> 06:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
firing and there may be some there may
 
06:18:37.990 --> 06:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
be some mechanism either in the
 
06:18:41.750 --> 06:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor or in Employment
 
06:18:45.590 --> 06:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
Security that says you w Really fire it
 
06:18:48.030 --> 06:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
unjustly and uh something else has to
 
06:18:50.390 --> 06:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
happen I will be happy to ask Mr lers
 
06:18:53.350 --> 06:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
and I know we'll have an answer but this
 
06:18:55.110 --> 06:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
this is this is a thing and and
 
06:18:57.830 --> 06:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
certainly people are fired and they're
 
06:18:59.670 --> 06:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
giving the reason and I know people have
 
06:19:02.510 --> 06:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
to be very careful uh that they that
 
06:19:04.510 --> 06:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
they dot their eyes and cross their tees
 
06:19:06.708 --> 06:19:06.718 align:start position:0%
when when they terminate someone uh
 
06:19:08.948 --> 06:19:08.958 align:start position:0%
generally speaking but I think when it
 
06:19:11.708 --> 06:19:11.718 align:start position:0%
does happen and if is if is determined
 
06:19:15.468 --> 06:19:15.478 align:start position:0%
to be um reasonable and that the the
 
06:19:18.590 --> 06:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
just cause then that person would not
 
06:19:21.670 --> 06:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
qualify to receive their unused vacation
 
06:19:24.110 --> 06:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
time and they probably would not qualify
 
06:19:26.390 --> 06:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
for unemployment so I think labors would
 
06:19:29.230 --> 06:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
be the guy to talk to um I'd be happy to
 
06:19:32.548 --> 06:19:32.558 align:start position:0%
add written into the piece about the uh
 
06:19:32.558 --> 06:19:36.990 align:start position:0%
add written into the piece about the uh
assurance

06:19:36.990 --> 06:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:37.000 --> 06:19:38.270 align:start position:0%
 
representative

06:19:38.270 --> 06:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:19:42.070 --> 06:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
solivan in in the world of Labor uh law
 
06:19:45.190 --> 06:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
um it's common contract language under
 
06:19:47.788 --> 06:19:47.798 align:start position:0%
disciplinary Clauses to say someone will
 
06:19:50.468 --> 06:19:50.478 align:start position:0%
not be fired or disciplined without just
 
06:19:54.948 --> 06:19:54.958 align:start position:0%
cause and just cause has a very uh uh
 
06:19:57.990 --> 06:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's very well defined in in labor law
 
06:19:59.708 --> 06:19:59.718 align:start position:0%
um I'm not suggesting you add the word
 
06:20:02.390 --> 06:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
just but I think it's the same spirit
 
06:20:05.230 --> 06:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
that essentially you have to have
 
06:20:07.430 --> 06:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
an explanation as to what this person
 
06:20:10.150 --> 06:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
did to cause you to fire
 
06:20:13.830 --> 06:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
them um yes and I believe that uh you
 
06:20:15.910 --> 06:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
have to have uh I think it might be
 
06:20:17.628 --> 06:20:17.638 align:start position:0%
called a pip or something where you tell
 
06:20:19.868 --> 06:20:19.878 align:start position:0%
someone you warn someone this is what I
 
06:20:22.750 --> 06:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
don't like and if you do it again you
 
06:20:25.350 --> 06:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
know whatever it's twice or three times
 
06:20:27.910 --> 06:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
you're out
 
06:20:30.750 --> 06:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh I haven't been
 
06:20:36.590 --> 06:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
fired so all right any other questions
 
06:20:39.110 --> 06:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
represent labr thank you Mr chair thank
 
06:20:40.788 --> 06:20:40.798 align:start position:0%
you sir for taking my question how did
 
06:20:44.310 --> 06:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
we arrive at the 15 employee number just
 
06:20:46.070 --> 06:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
out of curiosity how do we get there
 
06:20:49.110 --> 06:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
rather than say a um a gross sales of a
 
06:20:52.270 --> 06:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
company um that was provided to me by
 
06:20:56.548 --> 06:20:56.558 align:start position:0%
former Deputy Commissioner Ogden and he
 
06:20:58.750 --> 06:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
said it was not not an unfamiliar number
 
06:21:00.430 --> 06:21:00.440 align:start position:0%
to to small businesses that's a
 
06:21:02.150 --> 06:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
threshold for something else which I
 
06:21:04.708 --> 06:21:04.718 align:start position:0%
don't recall exactly what that was but
 
06:21:06.430 --> 06:21:06.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's another it's we didn't want to
 
06:21:08.830 --> 06:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
give him a new number so it's a number
 
06:21:10.948 --> 06:21:10.958 align:start position:0%
that's already there perhaps Mr avalani
 
06:21:14.948 --> 06:21:14.958 align:start position:0%
is uh could pull this out of his
 
06:21:14.958 --> 06:21:18.270 align:start position:0%
is uh could pull this out of his
pocket

06:21:18.270 --> 06:21:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:21.468 --> 06:21:21.478 align:start position:0%

06:22:49.788 --> 06:22:49.798 align:start position:0%
despite the commendable efforts to
 
06:22:51.750 --> 06:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
address several concerns raised in Prior
 
06:22:54.430 --> 06:22:54.440 align:start position:0%
years while the inclusion of the RSA to
 
06:22:56.590 --> 06:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
clarify due wages when the due wages are
 
06:22:59.190 --> 06:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
owed the removal of sick time from the
 
06:23:00.948 --> 06:23:00.958 align:start position:0%
payout and the consideration of
 
06:23:03.510 --> 06:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
resignation scenarios are improvements
 
06:23:05.070 --> 06:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
significant issues still remain
 
06:23:06.868 --> 06:23:06.878 align:start position:0%
unaddressed that weren't further
 
06:23:09.708 --> 06:23:09.718 align:start position:0%
attention first I strongly oppose the
 
06:23:11.468 --> 06:23:11.478 align:start position:0%
provision requiring employers to pay out
 
06:23:13.670 --> 06:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
unused time for employees that are
 
06:23:16.868 --> 06:23:16.878 align:start position:0%
terminated for perform performance I
 
06:23:18.468 --> 06:23:18.478 align:start position:0%
understand the bill has been modified to
 
06:23:21.350 --> 06:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
eliminate those terminated for cause
 
06:23:23.548 --> 06:23:23.558 align:start position:0%
however that is often viewed differently
 
06:23:26.070 --> 06:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
than those that are uh terminated for
 
06:23:28.548 --> 06:23:28.558 align:start position:0%
performance issues for cause usually
 
06:23:31.030 --> 06:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
implies misconduct gross negligence or
 
06:23:33.350 --> 06:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
theft we would recommend and support a
 
06:23:35.708 --> 06:23:35.718 align:start position:0%
change to include all involuntary
 
06:23:38.070 --> 06:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
terminations except those Illustrated in
 
06:23:40.230 --> 06:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
the bill um which are the sale of the
 
06:23:42.270 --> 06:23:42.280 align:start position:0%
company or a position
 
06:23:44.628 --> 06:23:44.638 align:start position:0%
elimination also known as a
 
06:23:47.510 --> 06:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
layoff in addition this legislation if
 
06:23:49.548 --> 06:23:49.558 align:start position:0%
unchanged to include termination for
 
06:23:51.310 --> 06:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
performance would place an undue
 
06:23:53.070 --> 06:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
hardship on many of the nonprofit
 
06:23:55.590 --> 06:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
organizations nonprofits often provide
 
06:23:58.030 --> 06:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
richer time off policies as a means to
 
06:24:00.868 --> 06:24:00.878 align:start position:0%
attract and retain talent in lie of
 
06:24:03.270 --> 06:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
offering higher salaries if this bill
 
06:24:05.110 --> 06:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
were to pass these organizations would
 
06:24:06.990 --> 06:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
be forced to reassess their generous
 
06:24:09.190 --> 06:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
policies as the financial strain of
 
06:24:12.468 --> 06:24:12.478 align:start position:0%
paying out in the um very benefits that
 
06:24:14.350 --> 06:24:14.360 align:start position:0%
help these organizations compete for
 
06:24:16.510 --> 06:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
talent and ultimately harming
 
06:24:18.948 --> 06:24:18.958 align:start position:0%
employees third the bill does not
 
06:24:20.430 --> 06:24:20.440 align:start position:0%
adequately address the growing
 
06:24:22.910 --> 06:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
prevalence of unlimited or flexible time
 
06:24:25.468 --> 06:24:25.478 align:start position:0%
off policies many companies have adopted
 
06:24:27.110 --> 06:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
these policies which allow employees to
 
06:24:29.230 --> 06:24:29.240 align:start position:0%
take as much time off as they need
 
06:24:32.030 --> 06:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
within reason without the need to acrew
 
06:24:34.510 --> 06:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
or deduct from a time off Bank however
 
06:24:36.310 --> 06:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
this bill provides no guidance on how
 
06:24:38.990 --> 06:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
unused time would be calculated or
 
06:24:41.430 --> 06:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
compensated under such Arrangements when
 
06:24:43.270 --> 06:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
I testified on this matter previously
 
06:24:45.110 --> 06:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
this was a key point of confusion and
 
06:24:47.830 --> 06:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
concern and it remains unresolved to
 
06:24:49.430 --> 06:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
address these issues I recommend the
 
06:24:51.548 --> 06:24:51.558 align:start position:0%
following adjustments to the legislation
 
06:24:53.150 --> 06:24:53.160 align:start position:0%
exclude employees terminated for
 
06:24:54.990 --> 06:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
performance as opposed to reduction in
 
06:24:57.788 --> 06:24:57.798 align:start position:0%
force clear guidelines already exist to
 
06:25:00.430 --> 06:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
distinguish between these scenarios and
 
06:25:01.910 --> 06:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
such an exclusion would ensure that
 
06:25:04.788 --> 06:25:04.798 align:start position:0%
failure to perform is not rewarded
 
06:25:06.670 --> 06:25:06.680 align:start position:0%
exclude nonprofit organizations from
 
06:25:08.468 --> 06:25:08.478 align:start position:0%
these Provisions or create an
 
06:25:10.150 --> 06:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
alternative standard for them to protect
 
06:25:11.830 --> 06:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
their ability to offer competitive
 
06:25:13.390 --> 06:25:13.400 align:start position:0%
competitive benefits without
 
06:25:15.948 --> 06:25:15.958 align:start position:0%
jeopardizing their financial stability
 
06:25:17.990 --> 06:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
and third provide specific guidelines
 
06:25:20.030 --> 06:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
for handling unlimited or flexible time
 
06:25:21.990 --> 06:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
off policies ensuring Clarity and
 
06:25:23.830 --> 06:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
fairness for both the employers and the
 
06:25:26.070 --> 06:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
employee thank you for considering these
 
06:25:27.670 --> 06:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
points while I support the effort to
 
06:25:29.750 --> 06:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
enhance workplace protection it is
 
06:25:31.510 --> 06:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
essential that we avoid creating undue
 
06:25:34.548 --> 06:25:34.558 align:start position:0%
burdens on employers and nonp nonprofits
 
06:25:37.190 --> 06:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
or inadvertently rewarding misconduct I
 
06:25:38.468 --> 06:25:38.478 align:start position:0%
urge you to make the necessary
 
06:25:40.190 --> 06:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
adjustments to ensure this legislation
 
06:25:42.830 --> 06:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
is fair practical and considerate of all
 
06:25:44.788 --> 06:25:44.798 align:start position:0%
stakeholders I also invite anyone
 
06:25:46.708 --> 06:25:46.718 align:start position:0%
working on legislation such as this to
 
06:25:48.510 --> 06:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
reach out and discuss how it may impact
 
06:25:50.310 --> 06:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
employers here in the granite state with
 
06:25:51.788 --> 06:25:51.798 align:start position:0%
one email or phone call you could have
 
06:25:54.910 --> 06:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
access to um how it may impact hundreds
 
06:25:57.548 --> 06:25:57.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time I can take your
 
06:25:59.350 --> 06:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
that's very clear and concise testimony
 
06:26:01.788 --> 06:26:01.798 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
06:26:05.110 --> 06:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
represent McKenzie
 
06:26:07.830 --> 06:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony appreciate
 
06:26:11.830 --> 06:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
it what I'm trying to square
 
06:26:17.430 --> 06:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
is is if I had a a 401k or I had a
 
06:26:20.070 --> 06:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
savings account health savings account
 
06:26:23.590 --> 06:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
and I was terminated with cause MH would
 
06:26:26.030 --> 06:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
you lose that
 
06:26:32.310 --> 06:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
no so followup yes please so then if I
 
06:26:35.190 --> 06:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
have banked certain
 
06:26:38.310 --> 06:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
time and had I not been terminated that
 
06:26:41.110 --> 06:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
time would have been mine so so is it
 
06:26:43.390 --> 06:26:43.400 align:start position:0%
the does the logic follow that that's
 
06:26:45.868 --> 06:26:45.878 align:start position:0%
not their time they have not accumulated
 
06:26:48.030 --> 06:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
that time yeah I can understand how your
 
06:26:51.030 --> 06:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
logic is going um I guess part of the
 
06:26:52.510 --> 06:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
other confusion is if I have a
 
06:26:55.430 --> 06:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
front-loaded time off policy then you're
 
06:26:56.990 --> 06:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
getting paid out on stuff that maybe you
 
06:26:59.390 --> 06:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
haven't quite earned yet but also the
 
06:27:01.670 --> 06:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
benefit that I'm providing you is time
 
06:27:03.910 --> 06:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
away from work the benefit I'm giving
 
06:27:05.628 --> 06:27:05.638 align:start position:0%
you is not the ability to have a free
 
06:27:08.070 --> 06:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
paycheck it's the ability to take time
 
06:27:09.948 --> 06:27:09.958 align:start position:0%
off of work and unfortunately due to
 
06:27:11.270 --> 06:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
your lack of performance you have a lot
 
06:27:13.868 --> 06:27:13.878 align:start position:0%
of time off from work now so I would
 
06:27:16.430 --> 06:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
argue that the benefit is the ability to
 
06:27:19.430 --> 06:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
take a paid day to not come to work it's
 
06:27:21.190 --> 06:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
not the dollar figure that we're
 
06:27:23.628 --> 06:27:23.638 align:start position:0%
associating to those hours for a
 
06:27:27.628 --> 06:27:27.638 align:start position:0%
followup thank you uh I wasn't great in
 
06:27:30.830 --> 06:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
accounting um but let me say but let me
 
06:27:34.230 --> 06:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
ask you this you have a nonprofit
 
06:27:38.708 --> 06:27:38.718 align:start position:0%
who uh should be calculating in their uh
 
06:27:42.150 --> 06:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
liabilities the cost of uh the the
 
06:27:44.230 --> 06:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
accumulated vacation time and all those
 
06:27:47.030 --> 06:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
kinds of things corre so if they if they
 
06:27:48.670 --> 06:27:48.680 align:start position:0%
decide to cut
 
06:27:54.310 --> 06:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
that um cut somebody off um it would it
 
06:27:56.750 --> 06:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
be to their advantage and would that be
 
06:28:00.070 --> 06:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
an incentive in some some ways uh to
 
06:28:02.548 --> 06:28:02.558 align:start position:0%
limit their liability and their exposure
 
06:28:04.750 --> 06:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
for what may be uh
 
06:28:07.910 --> 06:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
their inability to properly track that
 
06:28:09.708 --> 06:28:09.718 align:start position:0%
you so I think what your question is am
 
06:28:10.868 --> 06:28:10.878 align:start position:0%
I going to save money because I'm going
 
06:28:13.030 --> 06:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
to fire you and not pay you out
 
06:28:15.230 --> 06:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
essentially well it was there's a
 
06:28:18.190 --> 06:28:18.200 align:start position:0%
costant did they are they doing proper
 
06:28:21.150 --> 06:28:21.160 align:start position:0%
Accounting in yes so my argument would
 
06:28:22.948 --> 06:28:22.958 align:start position:0%
be and most nonprofits do have the
 
06:28:25.788 --> 06:28:25.798 align:start position:0%
ability to pay their their staff salary
 
06:28:28.788 --> 06:28:28.798 align:start position:0%
so if I have budgeted in my budget for
 
06:28:31.350 --> 06:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
my executive assistant at my nonprofit
 
06:28:34.868 --> 06:28:34.878 align:start position:0%
for $50,000 for the year that 50 ,000
 
06:28:36.830 --> 06:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
that I've budgeted includes two weeks
 
06:28:39.708 --> 06:28:39.718 align:start position:0%
vacation because while she's not working
 
06:28:41.670 --> 06:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
in that position for those two weeks I'm
 
06:28:43.590 --> 06:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
paying her but it's included in that
 
06:28:45.750 --> 06:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
annual amount now if halfway through the
 
06:28:48.390 --> 06:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
year she terms I didn't pay she didn't
 
06:28:49.830 --> 06:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
take her vacation and I had to pay it
 
06:28:51.670 --> 06:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
out but then I'm fortunate enough in
 
06:28:53.230 --> 06:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
this market that I replaced her so as
 
06:28:56.030 --> 06:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
soon as she left I hired someone new my
 
06:28:58.628 --> 06:28:58.638 align:start position:0%
we'll use 52,000 because it's easy my
 
06:29:01.190 --> 06:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
annual cost now just went up to 54,000
 
06:29:02.430 --> 06:29:02.440 align:start position:0%
because the new person's going to have
 
06:29:04.670 --> 06:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
the two weeks as well so it is an
 
06:29:08.830 --> 06:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
accounting problem um and I do think to
 
06:29:13.548 --> 06:29:13.558 align:start position:0%
your point um would someone fire someone
 
06:29:15.750 --> 06:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
so that they didn't have to pay time out
 
06:29:18.750 --> 06:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
I the employment Market is still at the
 
06:29:22.350 --> 06:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
employees Advantage um it is still hard
 
06:29:26.230 --> 06:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
to find good work good help um so I
 
06:29:28.070 --> 06:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
don't think that people are just firing
 
06:29:30.910 --> 06:29:30.920 align:start position:0%
employees so they don't have to pay out
 
06:29:30.920 --> 06:29:31.788 align:start position:0%
employees so they don't have to pay out
what's

06:29:31.788 --> 06:29:31.798 align:start position:0%
what's
 
06:29:35.548 --> 06:29:35.558 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you um any further
 
06:29:38.110 --> 06:29:38.120 align:start position:0%
questions representative avalani thank
 
06:29:40.070 --> 06:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for your
 
06:29:42.590 --> 06:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
testimony um it was
 
06:29:45.150 --> 06:29:45.160 align:start position:0%
um um I have a would you believe
 
06:29:46.910 --> 06:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
question that I believe everything
 
06:29:48.750 --> 06:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
you've just said that employees should
 
06:29:51.070 --> 06:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
only have to pay for 52 weeks of work
 
06:29:52.350 --> 06:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
and not pay out
 
06:29:56.270 --> 06:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:58.990 --> 06:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
you wi it would be you believe but
 
06:30:01.910 --> 06:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
poorly executed just for the record any
 
06:30:04.190 --> 06:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
06:30:05.788 --> 06:30:05.798 align:start position:0%
I could just add one more statement
 
06:30:08.390 --> 06:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
about the the 15 employee question from
 
06:30:10.670 --> 06:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
earlier um the other legislation in New
 
06:30:11.868 --> 06:30:11.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that follows that is your
 
06:30:14.430 --> 06:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
safety manual so at the point of having
 
06:30:18.270 --> 06:30:18.280 align:start position:0%
50 employ 15 15 15 employees you also
 
06:30:19.708 --> 06:30:19.718 align:start position:0%
have to have a safety program and a
 
06:30:22.230 --> 06:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
safety manual so it is already as uh
 
06:30:23.750 --> 06:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative kahill mentioned in the
 
06:30:25.948 --> 06:30:25.958 align:start position:0%
HR world it's already a Mark that we're
 
06:30:27.868 --> 06:30:27.878 align:start position:0%
familiar with so they're not adding in
 
06:30:29.310 --> 06:30:29.320 align:start position:0%
another number that you have to remember
 
06:30:31.670 --> 06:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
oh when I hit this this happens so 15 is
 
06:30:34.190 --> 06:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
already a number a good input thank you
 
06:30:35.390 --> 06:30:35.400 align:start position:0%
all right ma'am thank you so much I
 
06:30:36.788 --> 06:30:36.798 align:start position:0%

representative who gave excellent
 
06:31:33.040 --> 06:31:35.468 align:start position:0%
representative who gave excellent
testimony

06:31:35.468 --> 06:31:35.478 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
06:31:38.990 --> 06:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
and I want to say that the Crux of her
 
06:31:41.510 --> 06:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
testimony is
 
06:31:45.910 --> 06:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
that she is asking this committee not to
 
06:31:48.590 --> 06:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
let the state of New Hampshire get
 
06:31:51.310 --> 06:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
between the employer and the
 
06:31:53.510 --> 06:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
employee that's the bottom line of this
 
06:31:56.310 --> 06:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
bill it's a mandate it's a
 
06:32:00.310 --> 06:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
requirement and under law today first
 
06:32:03.110 --> 06:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
it's been long held public policy that
 
06:32:05.388 --> 06:32:05.398 align:start position:0%
government not mandate to employers what
 
06:32:08.590 --> 06:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
their employee benefits must include but
 
06:32:11.590 --> 06:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
only that the employer give adequate
 
06:32:14.430 --> 06:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
notice of what those benefits
 
06:32:17.310 --> 06:32:17.320 align:start position:0%
are the current law already requires
 
06:32:19.150 --> 06:32:19.160 align:start position:0%
employers to provide written
 
06:32:21.230 --> 06:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
descriptions to employees of what
 
06:32:24.270 --> 06:32:24.280 align:start position:0%
employee benefits will
 
06:32:28.548 --> 06:32:28.558 align:start position:0%
be 378 does not account for employers
 
06:32:31.230 --> 06:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
with use with use it or lose it paid
 
06:32:34.030 --> 06:32:34.040 align:start position:0%
vacation benefits it does not account
 
06:32:36.190 --> 06:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
for employers that provide paid personal
 
06:32:38.430 --> 06:32:38.440 align:start position:0%
time off but do not distinguish between
 
06:32:41.548 --> 06:32:41.558 align:start position:0%
sick days personal time and vacation
 
06:32:43.990 --> 06:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
time does not account for the increasing
 
06:32:46.230 --> 06:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
number of employers as we just heard
 
06:32:48.070 --> 06:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
that allow for paid time off but don't
 
06:32:48.080 --> 06:32:50.110 align:start position:0%
that allow for paid time off but don't
track

06:32:50.110 --> 06:32:50.120 align:start position:0%
track
 
06:32:54.350 --> 06:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
usage 378 will increase employer costs
 
06:32:57.190 --> 06:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
if the employee if if the employee opts
 
06:32:59.190 --> 06:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
to not take vacation which is the
 
06:33:01.070 --> 06:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
example that you just
 
06:33:03.230 --> 06:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
heard so that they can collect that
 
06:33:07.948 --> 06:33:07.958 align:start position:0%
extra pay check and so if House Bill 378
 
06:33:11.230 --> 06:33:11.240 align:start position:0%
were to be enacted employers would be
 
06:33:13.910 --> 06:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
reluctant to design paid time off
 
06:33:16.750 --> 06:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
policies that offer flexibility to
 
06:33:19.830 --> 06:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
employees it would constrict the
 
06:33:22.388 --> 06:33:22.398 align:start position:0%
relationship between the employer and
 
06:33:25.190 --> 06:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
the employee taking that flexibility
 
06:33:28.430 --> 06:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
away with respect to the 15
 
06:33:31.388 --> 06:33:31.398 align:start position:0%
days 15 days is just
 
06:33:34.430 --> 06:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
asking maybe the next year it's 12 days
 
06:33:38.350 --> 06:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
uh 12 employees maybe it's 10 employees
 
06:33:41.830 --> 06:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
and so you you the thresholds like that
 
06:33:44.230 --> 06:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
are never
 
06:33:47.388 --> 06:33:47.398 align:start position:0%
good so in closing Mr
 
06:33:49.910 --> 06:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
chair ask the committee to consider the
 
06:33:51.110 --> 06:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
impact of
 
06:33:54.830 --> 06:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
costs on the employer the relationships
 
06:33:56.868 --> 06:33:56.878 align:start position:0%
between the employees and the
 
06:33:59.708 --> 06:33:59.718 align:start position:0%
employers the flexibility that both
 
06:34:03.350 --> 06:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
parties have not unlike some of the
 
06:34:04.868 --> 06:34:04.878 align:start position:0%
arguments you heard a couple of weeks
 
06:34:09.590 --> 06:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
ago on the small little Bill House Bill
 
06:34:13.948 --> 06:34:13.958 align:start position:0%
238 and let's not let the government be
 
06:34:16.868 --> 06:34:16.878 align:start position:0%
even more invasive into the relationship
 
06:34:19.388 --> 06:34:19.398 align:start position:0%
between employers and employees so with
 
06:34:22.190 --> 06:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
that I ask the committee to find house
 
06:34:25.350 --> 06:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
build 378 an expedient to legislate and
 
06:34:26.910 --> 06:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to try and address any
 
06:34:30.628 --> 06:34:30.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:32.628 --> 06:34:32.638 align:start position:0%
have thank you sir I appreciate your
 
06:34:34.948 --> 06:34:34.958 align:start position:0%
testimony seeing no questions thank you
 
06:34:37.868 --> 06:34:37.878 align:start position:0%
very much thank you very
 
06:34:41.788 --> 06:34:41.798 align:start position:0%
good I'd like to call Alex
 
06:34:46.510 --> 06:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:50.190 --> 06:34:50.200 align:start position:0%
cob Kris Kris gotcha sorry my penmanship
 
06:34:53.150 --> 06:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
isn't great uh thank you Mr chair and
 
06:34:55.510 --> 06:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee my name is
 
06:34:57.990 --> 06:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
Alex kbis I'm here to represent the
 
06:34:59.910 --> 06:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
associated general contractors of New
 
06:35:01.910 --> 06:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where the state's leading
 
06:35:03.788 --> 06:35:03.798 align:start position:0%
commercial construction industry organ
 
06:35:05.990 --> 06:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
organization representing companies in
 
06:35:07.830 --> 06:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
the highway and building divisions of
 
06:35:10.388 --> 06:35:10.398 align:start position:0%
the industry thank you for hosting the
 
06:35:12.830 --> 06:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
annual public hearing on this bill I
 
06:35:14.830 --> 06:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
think it's I know year six or seven I've
 
06:35:17.708 --> 06:35:17.718 align:start position:0%
lost count but we have been and continue
 
06:35:19.670 --> 06:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
to oppose this
 
06:35:22.270 --> 06:35:22.280 align:start position:0%
legislation uh a lot of what I have
 
06:35:23.708 --> 06:35:23.718 align:start position:0%
written down was already mentioned but
 
06:35:25.948 --> 06:35:25.958 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll be very very brief Mr chairman
 
06:35:28.670 --> 06:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
many companies including contractors are
 
06:35:31.788 --> 06:35:31.798 align:start position:0%
shifting away from separate buckets of
 
06:35:34.230 --> 06:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
vacation sick and holiday time
 
06:35:36.708 --> 06:35:36.718 align:start position:0%
instead time off is available whenever
 
06:35:38.868 --> 06:35:38.878 align:start position:0%
the employee wants to use it an employee
 
06:35:41.270 --> 06:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
may never get sick but have a sick child
 
06:35:43.150 --> 06:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
sick relative they may want to take
 
06:35:45.030 --> 06:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
personal time for other reasons they
 
06:35:47.150 --> 06:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
don't want to take vacation so as a
 
06:35:48.788 --> 06:35:48.798 align:start position:0%
result companies have responded by
 
06:35:51.868 --> 06:35:51.878 align:start position:0%
offering more flexible options this bill
 
06:35:53.830 --> 06:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
despite what the sponsor said and I do
 
06:35:55.628 --> 06:35:55.638 align:start position:0%
appreciate his Amendment which which is
 
06:35:57.990 --> 06:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
an quite a decent improvement from the
 
06:35:59.388 --> 06:35:59.398 align:start position:0%
bill is introduced but it still has a
 
06:36:01.270 --> 06:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
lot of problems it does put everyone in
 
06:36:04.190 --> 06:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
the same box and I believe that the bill
 
06:36:05.670 --> 06:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
if you pass it this year you're going to
 
06:36:08.510 --> 06:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
be right back here in 2026 trying to fix
 
06:36:10.230 --> 06:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
all the problems with implementation
 
06:36:12.430 --> 06:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
because it literally is going to affect
 
06:36:15.310 --> 06:36:15.320 align:start position:0%
thousands of employees in the state some
 
06:36:17.590 --> 06:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
of the issues include partial layoffs
 
06:36:19.388 --> 06:36:19.398 align:start position:0%
what happens if an employees hours are
 
06:36:20.990 --> 06:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
reduced and therefore their time off
 
06:36:22.590 --> 06:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
would be reduced how would that be
 
06:36:24.830 --> 06:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
handled how are seasonal employees
 
06:36:27.030 --> 06:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
handled under this bill we we agree with
 
06:36:28.430 --> 06:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor the term
 
06:36:31.388 --> 06:36:31.398 align:start position:0%
reasonable Assurance doesn't work in the
 
06:36:33.788 --> 06:36:33.798 align:start position:0%
Contracting World employees must use
 
06:36:36.990 --> 06:36:37.000 align:start position:0%
their vacation time before applying for
 
06:36:39.030 --> 06:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
unemployment paving companies for
 
06:36:41.628 --> 06:36:41.638 align:start position:0%
example will lay off employees in the
 
06:36:43.670 --> 06:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
cold winter months and there's no
 
06:36:44.750 --> 06:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
assurance that they're going to come
 
06:36:46.150 --> 06:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
back they might come back but they might
 
06:36:49.230 --> 06:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
not come back uh some some employers I
 
06:36:50.670 --> 06:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
talked to some pavers this morning some
 
06:36:52.788 --> 06:36:52.798 align:start position:0%
of them offer time off to the seasonal
 
06:36:55.708 --> 06:36:55.718 align:start position:0%
staff some do not so how is that going
 
06:36:58.430 --> 06:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
to be handled under this bill uh again
 
06:37:00.110 --> 06:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
some employees the company I worked at I
 
06:37:02.548 --> 06:37:02.558 align:start position:0%
came to AGC on July 8th but the company
 
06:37:04.590 --> 06:37:04.600 align:start position:0%
I worked at before that I had unlimited
 
06:37:06.830 --> 06:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
time off we didn't they didn't track it
 
06:37:08.788 --> 06:37:08.798 align:start position:0%
I as long as I got my work done I could
 
06:37:11.150 --> 06:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
take off as much time as I wanted to so
 
06:37:12.670 --> 06:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
how are those situations going to be
 
06:37:14.510 --> 06:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
handled under this bill I agree with
 
06:37:16.590 --> 06:37:16.600 align:start position:0%
with Mr berky this would require anyone
 
06:37:19.110 --> 06:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
who has a use it or lose it policy to to
 
06:37:20.750 --> 06:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
strike that from their handbook and
 
06:37:23.948 --> 06:37:23.958 align:start position:0%
rewrite it and adapt to what this
 
06:37:25.910 --> 06:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
legislation is
 
06:37:28.868 --> 06:37:28.878 align:start position:0%
proposing so the bottom line here is if
 
06:37:30.750 --> 06:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
you pass this bill I believe that your
 
06:37:32.350 --> 06:37:32.360 align:start position:0%
constituents most of them are going to
 
06:37:34.468 --> 06:37:34.478 align:start position:0%
end up with less vacation time employees
 
06:37:36.190 --> 06:37:36.200 align:start position:0%
are just going to respond to limit their
 
06:37:38.830 --> 06:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
exposure and to create less generous
 
06:37:40.868 --> 06:37:40.878 align:start position:0%
vacation packages that's going to be the
 
06:37:44.788 --> 06:37:44.798 align:start position:0%
result of this Bill yes a few people who
 
06:37:46.628 --> 06:37:46.638 align:start position:0%
uh are laid off or their company is sold
 
06:37:48.548 --> 06:37:48.558 align:start position:0%
in those very narrow
 
06:37:50.548 --> 06:37:50.558 align:start position:0%
circumstances they may get some of that
 
06:37:52.868 --> 06:37:52.878 align:start position:0%
time off paid but the the the vast
 
06:37:54.230 --> 06:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
majority of people are going to have
 
06:37:56.150 --> 06:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
less vacation time if this bill is
 
06:37:58.430 --> 06:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
passed in our opinion so with that I
 
06:38:00.628 --> 06:38:00.638 align:start position:0%
would again urge you to kill this bill
 
06:38:03.788 --> 06:38:03.798 align:start position:0%
once again and allow the employer to
 
06:38:05.990 --> 06:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
continue to to be flexible and Nimble
 
06:38:08.030 --> 06:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
and give their employees the flexibility
 
06:38:10.110 --> 06:38:10.120 align:start position:0%
that they want thank you Mr chairman all
 
06:38:12.030 --> 06:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
right thank you for that testimony are
 
06:38:14.070 --> 06:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
there any
 
06:38:17.948 --> 06:38:17.958 align:start position:0%
questions oh representative avalani sure
 
06:38:22.750 --> 06:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
is that a you no it's an easy one um
 
06:38:24.070 --> 06:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
given that
 
06:38:24.080 --> 06:38:25.670 align:start position:0%
given that
you

06:38:25.670 --> 06:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:38:28.548 --> 06:38:28.558 align:start position:0%
the you represent a lot of seasonal
 
06:38:31.150 --> 06:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
businesses um a lot of them do for
 
06:38:33.070 --> 06:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
Paving and Contracting they do take the
 
06:38:35.190 --> 06:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
winters off but then come back in the
 
06:38:38.430 --> 06:38:38.440 align:start position:0%
summer um would your long-term employees
 
06:38:40.230 --> 06:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
that do come back would they be forced
 
06:38:42.468 --> 06:38:42.478 align:start position:0%
to take all of their pay or be paid out
 
06:38:45.150 --> 06:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
for all of their acred time prior to
 
06:38:46.990 --> 06:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
coming back with the with the way this
 
06:38:49.510 --> 06:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:51.548 --> 06:38:51.558 align:start position:0%
structured again I think it depends on
 
06:38:53.868 --> 06:38:53.878 align:start position:0%
that term reasonable assurance and how
 
06:38:55.910 --> 06:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
how the do is going to interpret and
 
06:38:57.910 --> 06:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
enforce that provision so I think it's
 
06:38:59.788 --> 06:38:59.798 align:start position:0%
it's a question that we have under this
 
06:39:02.150 --> 06:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
bill I think you rais a good point and I
 
06:39:03.910 --> 06:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
I don't think the way it's constructed
 
06:39:05.590 --> 06:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
now in the legislation I think it
 
06:39:07.830 --> 06:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
creates confusion and we need to clarify
 
06:39:09.670 --> 06:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
it hopefully you won't pass the bill but
 
06:39:11.350 --> 06:39:11.360 align:start position:0%
if you were I think it need would need
 
06:39:13.430 --> 06:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
to be further defined thank you thank
 
06:39:14.708 --> 06:39:14.718 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
06:39:18.468 --> 06:39:18.478 align:start position:0%
chairman all right any further
 
06:39:20.910 --> 06:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
questions all right seeing no further
 
06:39:22.310 --> 06:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
06:39:22.320 --> 06:39:23.868 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
you're

06:39:23.868 --> 06:39:23.878 align:start position:0%
you're
 
06:39:31.990 --> 06:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:34.788 --> 06:39:34.798 align:start position:0%
please uh Miss chair and members thank
 
06:39:36.388 --> 06:39:36.398 align:start position:0%
you again for the opportunity to testify
 
06:39:37.948 --> 06:39:37.958 align:start position:0%
my name is John Reynolds I'm the state
 
06:39:39.430 --> 06:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
director for the national Federation of
 
06:39:41.230 --> 06:39:41.240 align:start position:0%
Independent Business in New Hampshire we
 
06:39:43.548 --> 06:39:43.558 align:start position:0%
represent over 1,700 small businesses
 
06:39:45.670 --> 06:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
across the state in every
 
06:39:48.110 --> 06:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
sector a lot of what I wanted to say has
 
06:39:50.030 --> 06:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
already been said uh much better than I
 
06:39:52.110 --> 06:39:52.120 align:start position:0%
could say it so um I do want to say I
 
06:39:53.350 --> 06:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate representative K Hill's
 
06:39:54.750 --> 06:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
willingness to have conversations about
 
06:39:56.070 --> 06:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
the bill and explain where he's coming
 
06:39:58.190 --> 06:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
from and uh agree that the amendment
 
06:39:59.350 --> 06:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
moves it a little bit in the right
 
06:40:02.310 --> 06:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
direction uh but ultimately we continue
 
06:40:05.388 --> 06:40:05.398 align:start position:0%
to oppose the bill because as Mr berky
 
06:40:07.110 --> 06:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh aptly pointed out it removes
 
06:40:09.910 --> 06:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
flexibility for employers and employees
 
06:40:13.270 --> 06:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
and when an employer has a policy that
 
06:40:14.990 --> 06:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
says that they are not going to be paid
 
06:40:16.788 --> 06:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
out that that vacation's not going to be
 
06:40:18.628 --> 06:40:18.638 align:start position:0%
paid out but maybe it's rolled over from
 
06:40:21.310 --> 06:40:21.320 align:start position:0%
year to year or they're uh giving you a
 
06:40:23.830 --> 06:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
little bit extra vacation
 
06:40:26.548 --> 06:40:26.558 align:start position:0%
right an employee is not being denied
 
06:40:28.708 --> 06:40:28.718 align:start position:0%
value when it's not paid out that value
 
06:40:31.150 --> 06:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
is being put back in somewhere else in
 
06:40:34.150 --> 06:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
the compensation package most likely or
 
06:40:35.590 --> 06:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
put up put back into the business
 
06:40:37.510 --> 06:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and ultimately small
 
06:40:39.190 --> 06:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
employers have to live within their
 
06:40:40.868 --> 06:40:40.878 align:start position:0%
means this bill doesn't make their
 
06:40:42.788 --> 06:40:42.798 align:start position:0%
compensation budget bigger it just
 
06:40:45.468 --> 06:40:45.478 align:start position:0%
divides tells the it it takes a chunk of
 
06:40:47.750 --> 06:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
the compensation budget and tells the
 
06:40:49.910 --> 06:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
employer how they have to use it which
 
06:40:51.948 --> 06:40:51.958 align:start position:0%
removes flexibility to offer more
 
06:40:54.190 --> 06:40:54.200 align:start position:0%
vacation time or offer more carryover or
 
06:40:55.910 --> 06:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
offer some other benefit that their
 
06:40:58.548 --> 06:40:58.558 align:start position:0%
employees want and that's what small
 
06:41:00.270 --> 06:41:00.280 align:start position:0%
employers want to do they want to create
 
06:41:03.310 --> 06:41:03.320 align:start position:0%
compensation packages that that help
 
06:41:07.310 --> 06:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
help keep and attract employees
 
06:41:09.910 --> 06:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
um so with that I'll just leave it there
 
06:41:11.910 --> 06:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
and uh and have to answer any questions
 
06:41:14.468 --> 06:41:14.478 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate your testimony
 
06:41:17.868 --> 06:41:17.878 align:start position:0%

it seeing no further questions and no
further

06:41:28.830 --> 06:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
