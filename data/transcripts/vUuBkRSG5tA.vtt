00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
us retaining the bill it sends the
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
message uh to anybody who notices that

this bill is not dead that it's still go
 
00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:02.959 align:start position:0%
live and and at any moment if if we see
 
00:09:05.069 --> 00:09:05.079 align:start position:0%
there's a problem then we can dust it
 
00:09:08.829 --> 00:09:08.839 align:start position:0%
off and and pass it if if it's necessary
 
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:11.320 align:start position:0%

second okay
 
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
biodegradable H 5 56 does anybody here
 
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519 align:start position:0%
want to speak for this
 
00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
bill where are all these
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
sponsors say he sent me a letter that's
 
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:57.160 align:start position:0%
right he sent me an email and was hoping
 
00:09:59.069 --> 00:09:59.079 align:start position:0%
he said this is It's really perfectly
 
00:09:59.079 --> 00:10:00.230 align:start position:0%
he said this is It's really perfectly
really

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
the common sense and all that but
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
there's no how do we enforce it that's
 
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
the thing I I spoke to him about it and
 
00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
we couldn't figure out how he said well
 
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
the assumption is somebody from one of
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
the uh industry standards would would
 
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
would pick up on it and and vot for it
 
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
right and I don't think that's the way
 
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:21.640 align:start position:0%
you write a bill well I I I would say
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
this issue and the way and and the way
 
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
if you really were to try to solve it is
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
the same thing um we did with
 
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
the pasas and which is that you you you
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
have to report in you know you file a
 
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
report to that that clearing house and
 
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
in that Clearing House you've got to
 
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
explain what's in it and so that you can
 
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
why you can claim that it's truly what
 
00:10:51.629 --> 00:10:51.639 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is composting food
 
00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:53.480 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how you would have I
 
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
thought you was talking about the
 
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
packaging that the well that's true it
 
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
would be the pack there was a packaging
 
00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:00.839 align:start position:0%
says that it's biodegradable
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
package talking who the heck knows
 
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's biodegradable or
 
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
not and that's the thing that's that's
 
00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
the enforceability so that was say the
 
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:11.560 align:start position:0%
Pas is a great example and remember this
 
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
started out with Mercury okay is that
 
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
these these Clearing Houses where you
 
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
document what you're doing and and then
 
00:11:22.269 --> 00:11:22.279 align:start position:0%
then you're then you get your your
 
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
certification going forward that that
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
you you filed that so obviously um the
 
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
issue of packaging bio integr packaging
 
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh is not as as important as P or
 
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
Mercury Mr chair yes um my question
 
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
is in regards to this particular uh area
 
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
is is that a is is there a
 
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
national um no that's the problem so
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
we're doing it state by state he he yeah
 
00:11:57.839 --> 00:11:59.350 align:start position:0%
we're doing it state by state he he yeah
absolutely

00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
and it's it's you know States if states
 
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
are passing it it's purely feel-good I
 
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
mean one of the things of you learning
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
more and more is that a lot of States
 
00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:09.839 align:start position:0%
they just pass stuff and and I guess the
 
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
assumption is that somebody just drops a
 
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
dime some you know and brings it to all
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
places the Attorney General's office and
 
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
so you had some states that the AG's
 
00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.150 align:start position:0%
so you had some states that the AG's
office

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
are evidently have lawyers with nothing
 
00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
better to do and take cases up like the
 
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't have that resource
 
00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
here in the state well no that's my my
 
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
point I would think it' be a federal man
 
00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
yeah it should be
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
but I mean I mean right now the only
 
00:12:47.189 --> 00:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
people we the FDA you know looks at
 
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
what's inside the package but I don't
 
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
believe they have any regulations on
 
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:55.240 align:start position:0%
outside the package do anybody know who
 
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
anybody here from we don't have anybody
 
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
from EG here okay
 
00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
motion Herbert do you want to make the
 
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.910 align:start position:0%
 
perfect

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
yes okay any discussion on the motion
 
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
all those in favor raise her hand you're
 
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
you're here saie okay
 
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
yeah okay two three four five six seven8
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
nine right
 
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:50.839 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we had to keep just shy of
 
00:13:50.839 --> 00:13:53.590 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we had to keep just shy of
a

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:57.949 --> 00:13:57.959 align:start position:0%
quorum okay uh next 721 gold is legal
 
00:13:57.959 --> 00:13:59.670 align:start position:0%
quorum okay uh next 721 gold is legal
tender

00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
tender
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
to so I'll move to retain
 
00:14:11.949 --> 00:14:11.959 align:start position:0%
uh the bill needs a little bit of work
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
to make it
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh you know something that is an
 
00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
imperative to pass uh we suffer from not
 
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
having a sales tax or an income tax
 
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
suffer and so if we did that would make
 
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:29.720 align:start position:0%
it more uh you know it make yeah more
 
00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
relevant to passing but uh so really So
 
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
when you buy gold in states that have
 
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:36.680 align:start position:0%
sales tax you actually pay the sales tax
 
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
on the purchase of that gold you
 
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
do we we do have some rules on we do
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
have some rules on barter
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
believe away that how about coin if you
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
buy uh you know old used old coins I
 
00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
believe it's just treated as a normal
 
00:14:54.749 --> 00:14:54.759 align:start position:0%
sale yeah so it's it's a sales so you
 
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
still pay sales tax yeah you know it
 
00:14:59.870 --> 00:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
could be 5 six 8% you got you got one of
 
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
those half pennies which I was just
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
reading about I stuff from Littleton
 
00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
Coin and it says out of state there's a
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
sales tax right on the bill right
 
00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:13.160 align:start position:0%
unbelievable okay so so reluctantly move
 
00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.350 align:start position:0%
unbelievable okay so so reluctantly move
to

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:14.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
retain no I realized you're reluctant
 
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
yeah and we you know the issue is we got
 
00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to how how to make
 
00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
sense of it so that you know I mean
 
00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:25.240 align:start position:0%
because the end of the day it's going to
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
the exemption list would be could be
 
00:15:29.069 --> 00:15:29.079 align:start position:0%
very long and that's problematic
 
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you Mr chair
 
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
um ever since we had the uh public
 
00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:37.399 align:start position:0%
hearing on this bill I've been thinking
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
of trying to walk into some place like
 
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:41.720 align:start position:0%
Target with a bag of gold coins and
 
00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:48.839 align:start position:0%
reasonable Keith you want to
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
respond I mean there there are uh gold
 
00:15:53.069 --> 00:15:53.079 align:start position:0%
back credit cards there's there's ways
 
00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:55.399 align:start position:0%
to use gold to purchase things that are
 
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
modern you know like you don't have to
 
00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
be a pirate with a sack of gold to go
 
00:16:01.069 --> 00:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
into Target you can use a a credit card
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
that's back by gold I still don't think
 
00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.150 align:start position:0%
that's back by gold I still don't think
it's

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:07.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable but that you know that credit
 
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
card thing that we were talking about we
 
00:16:10.749 --> 00:16:10.759 align:start position:0%
investigated that credit card kind of a
 
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
scheme last year and the losses that you
 
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
take and the overhead that you pay for
 
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
makes it I if you look at it carefully
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
you're taking such a hit on what the
 
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
value of that gold is that I would
 
00:16:26.189 --> 00:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
rather go into a deli with a lump of
 
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:29.240 align:start position:0%
gold than buy one of those credit cards
 
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
well I mean
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
obviously if you if you own gold bars or
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
you have these own you know you don't
 
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
actually have them at home right you
 
00:16:39.309 --> 00:16:39.319 align:start position:0%
have it's somewhere else is stored and
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
but you don't know where you have it or
 
00:16:44.189 --> 00:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
even if they bought gold with it you
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
literally don't know yeah
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
well don't they send you a picture of
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:55.949 --> 00:16:55.959 align:start position:0%
BL doesn't have like a Serial I buy gold
 
00:16:58.269 --> 00:16:58.279 align:start position:0%
all the time all I just remember is that
 
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
Indiana would had the the Nazi uh you
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
know signal stamped on the gold bar
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's say if they did melt it down that
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
that gold bar still would exist
 
00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.630 align:start position:0%
that gold bar still would exist
right

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
what gold bar with stamps on
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
it what we saying did Nazi had the Nazi
 
00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:22.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
Jones right exactly Mr sh one more
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
comment yes I think by retaining this
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
bill we could send a message that we
 
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
would like to know if there is gold in
 
00:17:35.789 --> 00:17:35.799 align:start position:0%
Fort Knox that we're interested in that
 
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
we want to know what's it what's really
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
stashed away it could be on a credit
 
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
card in there huh haven't you seen gold
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
finger I I do one one of my favorite
 
00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.029 align:start position:0%
finger I I do one one of my favorite
Bond

00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
Bond
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
movies okay
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
actually yeah but he throws he throws a
 
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
gold barn on the golf course right on
 
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
chairman I have a
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
question yes so do you have any kind of
 
00:18:08.669 --> 00:18:08.679 align:start position:0%
uh legal framework that how much we can
 
00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:11.919 align:start position:0%
buy the gold in a year or at a time at
 
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
this point we have no regulations on it
 
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
okay and and I'm not sure what time when
 
00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
you came in the room but represent Ammon
 
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
pointed out that this this issue is
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
actually um more Forefront in a state
 
00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:28.280 align:start position:0%
that has a sales tax okay but because we
 
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
don't have a sales
 
00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
tax uh except we might charge a sales
 
00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
tax on trees here in New
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so he has to say I am opposed
 
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 123 and I will speak to it
 
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
tomorrow um but second anyway so
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon and second by
 
00:18:50.039 --> 00:18:51.110 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon and second by
representative

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
pus moves to retain any more discussion
 
00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
motion seeing none all those in favor
 
00:18:59.710 --> 00:18:59.720 align:start position:0%
raise your hand
 
00:19:06.669 --> 00:19:06.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
liquor okay all right we got nine okay
 
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.390 align:start position:0%
liquor okay all right we got nine okay
Nine's

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
zip okay tokens study study
 
00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
here's my
 
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.510 align:start position:0%
 
all

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
right yeah so this is it's uh replaces
 
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
the entire bill um so I'll just go over
 
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
the the differences uh rep Spears had
 
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
some suggestions I Incorporated some of
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
them but not all of them
 
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
um I'll just go through it uh line 17 on
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
the first
 
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
page so the the the recommendations that
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
the commission would make I added uh
 
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
legal regulatory so letter B there legal
 
00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
regulatory financial and technological
 
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
considerations for state level
 
00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.870 align:start position:0%
considerations for state level
regulatory

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
regulatory
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
framework uh line 23 I added we're
 
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
looking at what they're doing at the
 
00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:02.039 align:start position:0%
federal level because that's very
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
relevant right now
 
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
um we also added in blockchainbased
 
00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:11.240 align:start position:0%
trust so exploring this idea of uh
 
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
creating a blockchainbased trust that
 
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
came out of 302 we decided to punt it
 
00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
put it in the study
 
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
commission uh I added line 26 I added
 
00:21:24.029 --> 00:21:24.039 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection as one of the
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
considerations because there's there's
 
00:21:31.269 --> 00:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
uh thoughts around the energy use of
 
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
blockchain um and we'll see that in uh
 
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:37.480 align:start position:0%
blockchains that can support stable
 
00:21:40.029 --> 00:21:40.039 align:start position:0%
tokens they have to be smart contract
 
00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
blockchains Mo most of those are using
 
00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:44.039 align:start position:0%
proof of stake which uses less
 
00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
none let's see and then the
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
members uh in talking to you yesterday
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
chair hunt I added uh House of
 
00:22:00.029 --> 00:22:00.039 align:start position:0%
Representatives that's suppos to
 
00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
say that change did not get in there
 
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
that was supposed to be line 31 was
 
00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:07.559 align:start position:0%
supposed to be the Commerce Committee I
 
00:22:09.269 --> 00:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
don't know why that changed make that's
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
fine all right it's still yeah the the
 
00:22:15.149 --> 00:22:15.159 align:start position:0%
speaker makes three of members
 
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
appointment yeah I mean there could be
 
00:22:17.159 --> 00:22:18.909 align:start position:0%
appointment yeah I mean there could be
somebody

00:22:18.909 --> 00:22:18.919 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
else in the house that's that's fine
 
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
that's broad enough okay yeah he'll he
 
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
he he'll bring it to me and ask for my
 
00:22:27.549 --> 00:22:27.559 align:start position:0%
recommendations okay all right uh let's
 
00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
see uh I added on page two line three
 
00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State or design because it
 
00:22:35.269 --> 00:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
could it could touch on Securities
 
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
laws uh attorney general design that
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
could be uh it could touch on consumer
 
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
protection as actually one of the
 
00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
charges instead of one representative
 
00:22:47.549 --> 00:22:47.559 align:start position:0%
line five page two I made it two
 
00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:50.679 align:start position:0%
representatives from the blockchain
 
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
industry I I thought they there' be
 
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
enough to fill those
 
00:23:00.909 --> 00:23:00.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
the the repeal date on line 27 we pushed
 
00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
it out a year it was November 1st 2025
 
00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
so now it's 2026 and then on line 20 I
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
changed the report date to to match the
 
00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.990 align:start position:0%
changed the report date to to match the
repal

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
repal
 
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
date I think that's you know it's
 
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:20.200 align:start position:0%
basically the same bill just a little
 
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
little more detail yeah good some bones
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
I like I like having lots of charges
 
00:23:26.669 --> 00:23:26.679 align:start position:0%
because one of my my complaints a lot of
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
commissions they have like one sentence
 
00:23:28.559 --> 00:23:29.789 align:start position:0%
commissions they have like one sentence
since

00:23:29.789 --> 00:23:29.799 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
like useless I mean these are three big
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
topics to get through in one year it's
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
going interes this will keep them busy
 
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
yeah okay Mr chair yes just to get it
 
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
into the record the uh I'm I'm a little
 
00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:48.200 align:start position:0%
not confused but I'm I'm a little uh I
 
00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
find it interesting that all the states
 
00:23:53.549 --> 00:23:53.559 align:start position:0%
are a number of the states are doing
 
00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
basically the same effort that
 
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon is interested in
 
00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.110 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon is interested in
right

00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
and and now uh if I understand things
 
00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:07.640 align:start position:0%
Trump president Trump has an interest
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
specifically in he's got one right in
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
these in this this this concept I'm just
 
00:24:14.559 --> 00:24:15.950 align:start position:0%
these in this this this concept I'm just
wondering

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
is to me it seems as though this is
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
going to be a mess if it's not organized
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
and it sounds to me like even though Mr
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
Ammon might have it all figured out
 
00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
there's other states may not do the same
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
thing and and I I find it worrisome that
 
00:24:37.789 --> 00:24:37.799 align:start position:0%
it would go into let with the one state
 
00:24:40.269 --> 00:24:40.279 align:start position:0%
would uh be
 
00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:44.200 align:start position:0%
um putting it out and and adopting it
 
00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
for uh uh you know
 
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
National use I would I would prefer a
 
00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
federal uh effort standard yes yeah and
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
so I just want to get it into the record
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
because this is very very complicated it
 
00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
there have some problems and uh it's
 
00:25:08.669 --> 00:25:08.679 align:start position:0%
going to be a mess if if we get inv I
 
00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
look at the first charge which says the
 
00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.470 align:start position:0%
look at the first charge which says the
current

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:25:16.389 --> 00:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
landscape okay landscape would include
 
00:25:21.149 --> 00:25:21.159 align:start position:0%
States and federal this is on line 18
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
onea first directive what's going on out
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
there and to me that that's both state
 
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
and Federal yeah line 23 as
 
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
well okay and and uh so I I feel and
 
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:37.480 align:start position:0%
actually then Federalist specifically
 
00:25:41.149 --> 00:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
say stated in 23 so so there it's all
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
there it's just that um what we're
 
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
trying to do is create a One-Stop
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
shopping where in state here in New
 
00:25:50.909 --> 00:25:50.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have a group of people who
 
00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
are going to be experts on this subject
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
so if and when something does come
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
forward we we have group of people can
 
00:26:00.389 --> 00:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
come in and help explain it to us okay
 
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:02.440 align:start position:0%
yeah just for the record I would like to
 
00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
be assured that we're not the only uh
 
00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
dog in this fight and uh uh and we have
 
00:26:12.669 --> 00:26:12.679 align:start position:0%
there will be different opinions even on
 
00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
the on the pro side but I mean I'm
 
00:26:18.669 --> 00:26:18.679 align:start position:0%
totally con I'm I'm sure that that and
 
00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons why you create
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
a committee like this is so they can
 
00:26:23.789 --> 00:26:23.799 align:start position:0%
thrash that
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
out and just for the record okay there
 
00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:29.320 align:start position:0%
is a pending Federal legislation that
 
00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
that may get passed while this
 
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
commission is is meeting right and then
 
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
the question will be what room does this
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
do the states have to innovate yeah
 
00:26:40.389 --> 00:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
where where are we after that right but
 
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
and and how much are they taking on
 
00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
versus how much they're delegating would
 
00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
could be delegating to the states
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
anyways absolutely and taking in
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
consideration that you know the way New
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire runs his laws like the fact
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
that we don't have a sales tax might
 
00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
have an impact
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
so okay is the question clear the yes
 
00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chair my question to
 
00:27:10.669 --> 00:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
uh I mean is U so right now we are just
 
00:27:12.669 --> 00:27:12.679 align:start position:0%
creating the committee we are deciding
 
00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
the committee who will be the
 
00:27:16.389 --> 00:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
participant and all and then you will be
 
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
that committee is going to basically
 
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
forms a guideline and that will well
 
00:27:23.389 --> 00:27:23.399 align:start position:0%
they no they will give us a report and
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
suggested legislation and then we have a
 
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
chance to review that right exactly okay
 
00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
all right thank you yeah this is this
 
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
is okay so representative em and second
 
00:27:37.549 --> 00:27:37.559 align:start position:0%
represent I just want to get moves ought
 
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
to pass on the amendment
 
00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.350 align:start position:0%
to pass on the amendment
number

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
943 yes represent spe how long did the
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
last commission take about was it a year
 
00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
or a year and a half yeah it lasted a
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
year but okay so if we allocating a year
 
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
we're okay I think so I mean it's going
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
to be a heavy lift but yeah speaker
 
00:28:00.909 --> 00:28:00.919 align:start position:0%
doesn't like study committees anyway
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
so we don't want to go too far out so I
 
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
I looked that uh we we're look I looked
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
to see if we could repeal some of the
 
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
obsolete study commissions and I didn't
 
00:28:13.149 --> 00:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
see any that uh cross with commerce's
 
00:28:14.909 --> 00:28:14.919 align:start position:0%
business oh good that's you did ask me
 
00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:16.559 align:start position:0%
about that yeah I said to him if there's
 
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
any because we've been we have been
 
00:28:21.789 --> 00:28:21.799 align:start position:0%
pretty good about not passing study
 
00:28:21.799 --> 00:28:24.029 align:start position:0%
pretty good about not passing study
committees

00:28:24.029 --> 00:28:24.039 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:31.149 --> 00:28:31.159 align:start position:0%
all right the question is on the
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
amendment all those in favor please
 
00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:39.720 align:start position:0%

to1 I don't I don't like this
 
00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
configuration I like the old committee

00:29:12.909 --> 00:29:12.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:12.919 --> 00:29:15.909 align:start position:0%
 
one

00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
retain representative
 
00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:28.559 align:start position:0%
Cole um again this is we just want us to
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
say that we we are aware that there's
 
00:29:33.549 --> 00:29:33.559 align:start position:0%
potential problems going on out there
 
00:29:35.669 --> 00:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
we're sensitive to it and we want
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
everyone to know that uh if if something
 
00:29:41.909 --> 00:29:41.919 align:start position:0%
really did come up that was clearly
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed then we do have a
 
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle to address it with but otherwise
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise we're just retaining it to
 
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:53.720 align:start position:0%
send a message that we we know this is a
 
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
problem but at this point we we have we
 
00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
don't have the exact language of how we
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
want to zero in on the problem yes one
 
00:30:02.789 --> 00:30:02.799 align:start position:0%
of the problems that we had is when this
 
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:05.240 align:start position:0%
bill came up is that just about every
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
organization that's out there banking
 
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
everybody yeah were against it and so
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
even is that a problem or is that
 
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
expected but so if if in fact the uh we
 
00:30:20.509 --> 00:30:20.519 align:start position:0%
were to drag it out you know because
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
something happened in the future it's
 
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't be that same bill because there
 
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
was so many organizations against it I
 
00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:29.240 align:start position:0%
would say if there were to address it it
 
00:30:30.909 --> 00:30:30.919 align:start position:0%
would be we wouldn't want to narrow it
 
00:30:34.269 --> 00:30:34.279 align:start position:0%
to the problem we that that we got okay
 
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
because it was very wi it was a you know
 
00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:40.120 align:start position:0%
a wi sweep of everything so we want to
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
be if if we're going to solve a problem
 
00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
we want to we want to know exactly which
 
00:30:46.029 --> 00:30:46.039 align:start position:0%
problem we're solving and that we're
 
00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
going to pass something that's
 
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
enforcable uh to address the problem so
 
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
we would be prepared to modify the devil
 
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
out of it absolutely it will it will be
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
put on a huge
 
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
diet I would prefer to
 
00:31:02.669 --> 00:31:02.679 align:start position:0%
this just get rid of it no because we we
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
want people to know that we that we're
 
00:31:06.669 --> 00:31:06.679 align:start position:0%
paying attention to this problem I have
 
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
learned from personal experience retain
 
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.190 align:start position:0%
learned from personal experience retain
is

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.830 align:start position:0%
 
better

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
yes I'm still paying there's one bill
 
00:31:19.389 --> 00:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
one bill that you wouldn't listen to me
 
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
when I said let's retain it and you guys
 
00:31:24.669 --> 00:31:24.679 align:start position:0%
but if you had said something I did I
 
00:31:27.549 --> 00:31:27.559 align:start position:0%
told you you that your Democrats would
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
be all over you like a wet rag no you
 
00:31:35.549 --> 00:31:35.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
later but anyway retain is better I well
 
00:31:41.669 --> 00:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
always say that my notes said retain on
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
my notes I always had retain and it's
 
00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
you guys inist I was too wound up and
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
Medicare representative Ammon thank you
 
00:31:59.549 --> 00:31:59.559 align:start position:0%
I I just wanted to say say the sponsors
 
00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
of this bill are not imagining a problem
 
00:32:04.269 --> 00:32:04.279 align:start position:0%
that doesn't exist this is actually a
 
00:32:06.909 --> 00:32:06.919 align:start position:0%
problem um I don't know if the state
 
00:32:08.669 --> 00:32:08.679 align:start position:0%
level is the appropriate level of
 
00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
government to deal with it but it's
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
being handled at the federal level
 
00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
there's pressure being put on Banks and
 
00:32:15.909 --> 00:32:15.919 align:start position:0%
I have in front of me this is a headline
 
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
from two days ago Fox Business JP Morgan
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
Chase makes moves to prevent religious
 
00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:24.519 align:start position:0%
political de banking so the the the
 
00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
banks even the big banks are getting
 
00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
pressure to address this issue you were
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
I mean even the the president's wife
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
Melania Trump was debanked that's what
 
00:32:35.549 --> 00:32:35.559 align:start position:0%
we take well that's just one example
 
00:32:37.509 --> 00:32:37.519 align:start position:0%
it's just one I mean it's a fact you
 
00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:39.519 align:start position:0%
don't have to react emotionally to it
 
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
you know yeah but anyway so I think
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
prain is a good way to approach this
 
00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:47.720 align:start position:0%
because it's it keeps the conversation
 
00:32:50.629 --> 00:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
going and our state is looking at the
 
00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
issue I mean you know where I stand on
 
00:32:54.549 --> 00:32:54.559 align:start position:0%
this I had a version of last year but I
 
00:32:57.549 --> 00:32:57.559 align:start position:0%
do think I'm still confused why the
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
government needs to I'm not saying hey
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to fight it like the last
 
00:33:04.509 --> 00:33:04.519 align:start position:0%
one but but um when we say that there's
 
00:33:06.389 --> 00:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
a problem it feels like somebody didn't
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
get something they wanted versus some
 
00:33:12.389 --> 00:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
objective objective flaw in the system
 
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
that needs to be fixed and I don't think
 
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
I don't think many of the people on this
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
committee or the people in the in the
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
audience were particularly convinced
 
00:33:23.789 --> 00:33:23.799 align:start position:0%
that there is a problem as much as they
 
00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:26.440 align:start position:0%
don't like outcomes and they want to
 
00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:29.240 align:start position:0%
ensure that those outcomes don't occur I
 
00:33:31.149 --> 00:33:31.159 align:start position:0%
think I think the the market does a
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
pretty good job of dealing with these
 
00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
sorts of problems if some bank is going
 
00:33:37.269 --> 00:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
to discriminated against you because of
 
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
your political beliefs or whatever you
 
00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
own guns or you want to don't want to
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
invest in an oil company then that is
 
00:33:48.629 --> 00:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
that bank's prerogative and I think
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
another bank can fill in to fill that
 
00:33:52.509 --> 00:33:52.519 align:start position:0%
void and I think that most of these
 
00:33:55.149 --> 00:33:55.159 align:start position:0%
problems to the extent that there's ex
 
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
to the extent that there is some sort of
 
00:33:58.509 --> 00:33:58.519 align:start position:0%
real discrimination going against things
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
that people cannot control obviously
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
that should be addressed but I don't
 
00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
know that this bill is even attempting
 
00:34:06.629 --> 00:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
to solve those sorts of problems I think
 
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
by and large those problems are taken
 
00:34:10.589 --> 00:34:10.599 align:start position:0%
care of by current laws that's my
 
00:34:12.829 --> 00:34:12.839 align:start position:0%
understanding anyways yeah but I I would
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
have to say that if it become to my
 
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
attention that something came up in the
 
00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire then absolutely I would rely
 
00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
on Kei and you to help me research it
 
00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
and see whether there's any truth behind
 
00:34:30.349 --> 00:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
it can I just respond um so this isn't a
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
problem of the free market it's a
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
problem of Regulation that's unclear
 
00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
that the banks need to respond to and
 
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
they they're taking a very cautious
 
00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
approach like any question about a
 
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
particular individual uh what's been
 
00:34:46.109 --> 00:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
happening is they get debanked they have
 
00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
to get a new bank account um and and
 
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
they they lose access to their funds for
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
a period of time and it's well
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
documented there's it's called operation
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
chokepoint and operation chokepoint 2.0
 
00:34:59.069 --> 00:34:59.079 align:start position:0%
you can you can look that up I mean
 
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
those were real efforts by the federal
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
government to crowd out or to uh
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
restrict access to the financial system
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
of particular Industries including the
 
00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
the marijuana industry so I mean it's
 
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
not a partisan thing this is you said
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
you mentioned guns uh Cannabis shops and
 
00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:19.880 align:start position:0%
and others right that uh got swept up
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
into this so it's a real thing but I
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
don't think the state we don't have the
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
authority to to address it
 
00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:29.480 align:start position:0%
representative Gibs
 
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I would support
 
00:35:36.109 --> 00:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
what representative Sullivan said um and
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
also I should point out that
 
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
discrimination based on factors that
 
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
cannot be controlled are pretty well
 
00:35:44.589 --> 00:35:44.599 align:start position:0%
taken care of by the federal Equal
 
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
Credit Opportunity Act so I don't think
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
we have to be concerned about those um
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
but this bill is a generalized attempt
 
00:35:56.309 --> 00:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
to prevent the banks from uh and
 
00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
insurance companies too it has Insurance
 
00:35:58.990 --> 00:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
in it
 
00:36:02.829 --> 00:36:02.839 align:start position:0%
also it has Insurance in it also prevent
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
Banks and insurance companies from
 
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
considering um elements that are
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
elements of the record of the applicant
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
for a loan for instance uh that cannot
 
00:36:15.309 --> 00:36:15.319 align:start position:0%
be Quantified but are nevertheless
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
relevant to uh the issue of whether uh a
 
00:36:22.589 --> 00:36:22.599 align:start position:0%
business is going to succeed or fail and
 
00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:25.839 align:start position:0%
is therefore likely qualified for a loan
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
so um I think that is something that we
 
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
can leave to the market and as
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan said One Bank
 
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
might um consider such a factor and
 
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
reject an applicant because of that but
 
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
another bank might accept the the
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
applicant I think that is something we
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
could leave to the market and I would
 
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
prefer to see this um uh voted itl as
 
00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:51.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
you I agree well right right now we're
 
00:36:55.589 --> 00:36:55.599 align:start position:0%
we're in subcommittee so obviously would
 
00:36:57.309 --> 00:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
you're preparing for when we exec this
 
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
bill next week um yes um I'm just giving
 
00:37:02.349 --> 00:37:02.359 align:start position:0%
you my opinion I I'm not on the
 
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so it's not up to me I know
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
that okay I I would just like to Second
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
the the the idea that we don't want to
 
00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:11.960 align:start position:0%
tread on the free market and this bill
 
00:37:14.349 --> 00:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
could potentially do that by causing
 
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
more uncertainty causing a bigger
 
00:37:18.309 --> 00:37:18.319 align:start position:0%
problem than it intends to fix so right
 
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
I I'm in agreement with there so see we
 
00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
we find some things we can agree on and
 
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
then that's what we'll work from going
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
forward every so often we do yes but it
 
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
does mean we'll talk about it again in
 
00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
September and and uh see see where where
 
00:37:35.109 --> 00:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
we can find we can agree on but right
 
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
now we're kind out of out of time okay
 
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.510 align:start position:0%
now we're kind out of out of time okay
so

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
um I I I think I made the motion to
 
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
retain you change it from Co to you and
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
and Cole was my second was or did Cole
 
00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
did make oh yeah that's right that we
 
00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
had that's correct okay any uh any more
 
00:37:59.790 --> 00:37:59.800 align:start position:0%
discussion on retaining 359 seeing none
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
all those sub committee
 
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:07.240 align:start position:0%
agree four five six seven eight n nine
 
00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.790 align:start position:0%
agree four five six seven eight n nine

zip
 
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
perfect okay nine
 
00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:29.069 --> 00:38:29.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
I I got it right
 
00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.870 align:start position:0%
I I got it right
here

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:33.880 align:start position:0%

the Secretary of State's office uh what
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
you have before you is an amendment to
 
00:38:58.470 --> 00:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
House Bill 406 uh this amendment
 
00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:00.839 align:start position:0%
replaces the bill in its entirety um
 
00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
it's a I'm sorry you still passing that
 
00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:22.230 align:start position:0%
it's a I'm sorry you still passing that
out

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:25.160 align:start position:0%
okay okay now what you all have before
 
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
you is an amendment to House Bill 406 uh
 
00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment replaces the bill in its
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
entirety uh the amendment uh was drafted
 
00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:34.520 align:start position:0%
uh with the consultation of the business
 
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
industry Association to address concerns
 
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
that they had with the initial bill uh
 
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment Narrows the scope of the
 
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
bill and I'll just give you a quick
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
summary of what it now includes um we've
 
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
basically taken out um the the
 
00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:48.200 align:start position:0%
provisions that were proposed in the St
 
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
that would allow us to um uh to validate
 
00:39:54.069 --> 00:39:54.079 align:start position:0%
data that was submitted in a filing
 
00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
prior to its approval what we've done
 
00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
now is narrowed the scope of our
 
00:39:59.109 --> 00:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
Authority to review after either we
 
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
receive a written complaint from a
 
00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
consumer or from a business that their
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
identity has been stolen or information
 
00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
has been used uh to uh create an entity
 
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
that they're unaware of that they have
 
00:40:11.069 --> 00:40:11.079 align:start position:0%
the capacity to file a for a sworn
 
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
statement with us and that would allow
 
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
us to then um uh remove that that
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
fraudulent or authorized filing from the
 
00:40:20.069 --> 00:40:20.079 align:start position:0%
record um so we've got remaining in the
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
remaining bill here first is to it does
 
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
create minimum requirements for persons
 
00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:25.960 align:start position:0%
who are acting as a registered agent if
 
00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:27.400 align:start position:0%
they're an individual they'll need to be
 
00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
18 years of age and be a resident of the
 
00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire and have a
 
00:40:32.589 --> 00:40:32.599 align:start position:0%
physical address in the
 
00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
state um the bill also closes a known
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
loophole we have in the current law
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
where people um will use a commercial
 
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
post office provider like the UPS store
 
00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
for example as the registered agent
 
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
address and obviously that person is not
 
00:40:47.309 --> 00:40:47.319 align:start position:0%
physically there there's only a a post
 
00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
office box there right so what we've
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
done here is specified that you can use
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
that commercial address or that Virtual
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
Office address for your business or
 
00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
mailing address but for a registered
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
agent address again that person has to
 
00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
be physically located at that location
 
00:41:03.309 --> 00:41:03.319 align:start position:0%
to use that address as their registered
 
00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
office um it also provides a means for
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
redress for persons or businesses who've
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
had their address or business details
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
used without their permission allows us
 
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
to remove or cancel filings found to be
 
00:41:16.109 --> 00:41:16.119 align:start position:0%

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
provide for a penalty current law um in
 
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
the business Corporation act indicates
 
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
it's a misdemeanor um to file a
 
00:41:24.109 --> 00:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
fraudulent filing and it creates that
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
penalty for persons who provide false
 
00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:27.960 align:start position:0%

00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
filing with the secretary of state so
 
00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
that's basically the the intent the
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
intent and the scope of the bill um as I
 
00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
said the the um the amendment Narrows
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
what we originally were proposing and we
 
00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:39.640 align:start position:0%
believe some of the concerns we
 
00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
discussed in our in our pre at the
 
00:41:44.349 --> 00:41:44.359 align:start position:0%
hearing about uh providing security for
 
00:41:46.349 --> 00:41:46.359 align:start position:0%
folks who are filing and creating
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
businesses online that um we're
 
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
continuing to to do that using utilizing
 
00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
technology and we're as I mentioned
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
we're preparing to issue an RFP to
 
00:41:56.309 --> 00:41:56.319 align:start position:0%

00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
filing system um and some of those are
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
enhancements we anticipate we'll be
 
00:42:02.349 --> 00:42:02.359 align:start position:0%
we'll be part of that uh so happy to
 
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you would have
 
00:42:07.309 --> 00:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:11.000 align:start position:0%
amendment okay uh representative amens
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
first thank you for your testimony um
 
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
just looking at line 16 on the first
 
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
page it
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
says no no business entity required to
 
00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
maintain a registered office in the
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
state shall designate the address of a
 
00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
commercial post office so which
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
businesses are required to maintain a
 
00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
registered office and I'm thinking that
 
00:42:34.549 --> 00:42:34.559 align:start position:0%
there's you know there's a lot of work
 
00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
from home businesses that don't have a
 
00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:38.440 align:start position:0%
you know a central office that the it's
 
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
sort of like a virtual staff um which
 
00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:43.079 align:start position:0%
business are required to maintain an
 
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
office that they couldn't use a
 
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
thirdparty post office box um all
 
00:42:49.309 --> 00:42:49.319 align:start position:0%
business entities in New Hampshire are
 
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
required to have a registered office
 
00:42:52.549 --> 00:42:52.559 align:start position:0%
with the exception of domestic
 
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
nonprofits um and the folks who register
 
00:42:56.109 --> 00:42:56.119 align:start position:0%
as a trade name that don't form a
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
business but just Reg or DBA they're not
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
required to have a a registered office
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
address so um limited Partnerships
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
limited liability Partnerships
 
00:43:06.589 --> 00:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
corporations llc's and now also Dows
 
00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
would also be another entity that would
 
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
be required to have a um a registered
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
agent um under this under the statute so
 
00:43:14.589 --> 00:43:14.599 align:start position:0%
registered agent versus registered
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
office so a doubt would be okay I don't
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
know the difference so I'm just yeah the
 
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
registered agent being that individual
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
in the registered office being the
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
address of that individual okay um a
 
00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
person that that's that's creating a
 
00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
business and it's homebased if they want
 
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
to serice with their own agent they can
 
00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:29.480 align:start position:0%
list their resident address as their
 
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
registered officer they're allowed to do
 
00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:32.680 align:start position:0%
that it just in a situation where they
 
00:43:34.589 --> 00:43:34.599 align:start position:0%
may not want to have their reg the
 
00:43:36.549 --> 00:43:36.559 align:start position:0%
resident address on the public record
 
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
that they may choose to use their
 
00:43:41.309 --> 00:43:41.319 align:start position:0%
attorney a CPA or or a third party to
 
00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:43.880 align:start position:0%
act as their agent in those
 
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
cases question representative Herbert um
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
I'm interested in in um understanding
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
why this
 
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
legislation came up at this point in
 
00:43:59.549 --> 00:43:59.559 align:start position:0%
time sure um actually the the this is an
 
00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
issue that um many states are battling
 
00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
with right now people either forming
 
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
what we calling synthetic entities
 
00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
businesses that have been created
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
utilizing the the data from existing
 
00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
businesses to make it appear that they
 
00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
already are in business um or situations
 
00:44:15.309 --> 00:44:15.319 align:start position:0%
where people's address is being used
 
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
we're finding more and more times that
 
00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:18.440 align:start position:0%
people are creating an business entity
 
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
and using somebody else's address as
 
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
their as their physical address um uh
 
00:44:24.589 --> 00:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
and as a result of that we see we had a
 
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
couple of situations a couple of
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
businesses one in in do one in Portsmith
 
00:44:30.549 --> 00:44:30.559 align:start position:0%
um Happ to be restaurants that were um
 
00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
where people where were someone um
 
00:44:34.589 --> 00:44:34.599 align:start position:0%
filing online were able to create
 
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
business entities with very similar
 
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
names using their address and and uh and
 
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
other details so they actually when they
 
00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
received in the mail a a bank statement
 
00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
from Chase Bank that someone had opened
 
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
up a bank account um utilizing that that
 
00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
name and address and and that they were
 
00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:49.960 align:start position:0%
trying to obviously trally either
 
00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
attempt to obtain credit or other
 
00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
fraudulent activities using that that
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
business detail we had to in order to
 
00:44:58.670 --> 00:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
work with those businesses to get these
 
00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
these these fraudulent businesses off
 
00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.079 align:start position:0%
the Record we really didn't have a means
 
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
to do that so that was why we originally
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
brought the bill to the to the committee
 
00:45:09.549 --> 00:45:09.559 align:start position:0%
this year just so I understand uh the
 
00:45:12.589 --> 00:45:12.599 align:start position:0%
example you gave was the synthetic
 
00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
somebody was a fraud correct but but
 
00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
they were trying to establish a a line
 
00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
of credit somewhere
 
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
and I is this like the drug business
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
that uh is dominant there or is um what
 
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
I've learned from talking to folks like
 
00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
den and Brad street and other folks who
 
00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
are who have expertise in this area um
 
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
it's present for any number reasons it
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
could be something as simple as someone
 
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
again wanting to create a bank account
 
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
go and say open a bank account and put
 
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
$100 in it and then let this LLC sit up
 
00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
there for a couple of years so that it
 
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:48.079 align:start position:0%
begins to develop a history so that they
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
looks like it's a legitimate business or
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
um maybe something as simple as going
 
00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
online and changing the name of the
 
00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
person who's the member or manager of
 
00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:57.640 align:start position:0%
that business well that's the one I was
 
00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:01.240 align:start position:0%
most worried okay was that when I log in
 
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
because you know I have to every year
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
now and I and I'm treasur of a
 
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
historical society and and you know so
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
I'm two Treasure of two different
 
00:46:12.109 --> 00:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
entities let alone I have a couple of
 
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
names I reserve let alone my business
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
and what scared me was that that anybody
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
could get access into my account and
 
00:46:23.549 --> 00:46:23.559 align:start position:0%
change the addresses and change that
 
00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
who's who's the
 
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
members and then go to the bank and
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
claim that that you know because the
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
bank says show us you know let's pull up
 
00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
your your your state web page and they
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
go online and they'll get it they'll get
 
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
that information and they're getting
 
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
fraudulent information correct because
 
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
you allow them these people to get into
 
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:45.720 align:start position:0%

00:47:22.349 --> 00:47:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
know what we anticipate with our next
 
00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:26.119 align:start position:0%
system is we'll have an authentic
 
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:27.640 align:start position:0%
company authorization code where
 
00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
someone's going to have to have that
 
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:30.200 align:start position:0%
code in order to be able to go ahead and
 
00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
file that and that fortunately won't
 
00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
require legislative action for us to be
 
00:47:37.109 --> 00:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
able to put that in place representative
 
00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you
 
00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:43.160 align:start position:0%
um do I understand correctly that the
 
00:47:44.589 --> 00:47:44.599 align:start position:0%
main difference between this and the
 
00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
original bill is that the secretary of
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
state would investigate on the basis of
 
00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
a complaint rather than verifying every
 
00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
time correct um where did I I'm sorry I
 
00:47:58.910 --> 00:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
just scan it quickly but where does it
 
00:48:01.549 --> 00:48:01.559 align:start position:0%
say that the secretary would investigate
 
00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
I see it says the secretary of state
 
00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
will take the following actions and then
 
00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
there is the opportunity for complaints
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
but I don't see where it says the
 
00:48:14.069 --> 00:48:14.079 align:start position:0%
secretary would investigate on the basis
 
00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
of the complaint um what would I
 
00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
anticipate happening we say if the
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
information they're provided with their
 
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
sworn statement you know or ability for
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
us to validate those facts that we can
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
take action without taking any further
 
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
action but typically a sworn statement
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
would require a police report will allow
 
00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:31.880 align:start position:0%
we obviously will'll rely on the the um
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
actions of the of the police department
 
00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
to take any further action but the fact
 
00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
that they've they've reported it as a
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
crime and then provided us with a
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
statement indicating so would be enough
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
for us to take the action so we don't
 
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
anticipate doing any um say um deep
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
investigations by any threat we don't
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
have investigative staff or
 
00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
investigative Authority so it would
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
really be our actions would be based on
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
that in the worst case scenario would be
 
00:48:55.309 --> 00:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
is we remove a document based on that
 
00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
sword statement and then someone comes
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
back and says that person lied right and
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
we can put the that put that document
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
back on the record um and they can
 
00:49:07.589 --> 00:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
always um obviously can always U um
 
00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
uh petition to to have us review any any
 
00:49:12.589 --> 00:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
rejection of a document that we that we
 
00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:14.079 align:start position:0%
already haven't filed the provision and
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
already in the law to do that right this
 
00:49:17.789 --> 00:49:17.799 align:start position:0%
is this is
 
00:49:21.069 --> 00:49:21.079 align:start position:0%
a130 powers and then the next year was
 
00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:25.079 align:start position:0%
a139 so there's there's 30 I'm sure 31
 
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
or 32 talks about how you begin yes
 
00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
that's in the existing so that's already
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
ination law law yes sir you follow
 
00:49:36.789 --> 00:49:36.799 align:start position:0%
that okay yes R Sal thank you thank you
 
00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:39.640 align:start position:0%
chair for taking my question uh right
 
00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
now what I understood is if we need to
 
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
have a registered agent physically in
 
00:49:47.309 --> 00:49:47.319 align:start position:0%
the state and the office can be a PO Box
 
00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:50.200 align:start position:0%
is that correct um no this say if they
 
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
are currently now is that that there has
 
00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:53.960 align:start position:0%
to be a physical street address but what
 
00:49:55.309 --> 00:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
folks are doing is they providing the
 
00:49:58.430 --> 00:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
street address of that local um business
 
00:50:00.349 --> 00:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
that provides the PO boxes so they're
 
00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:01.480 align:start position:0%
they're for example if they're using
 
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
Staples as their as their Virtual Office
 
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
they're providing 76 Ford Eddie Plaza as
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
the street address for the registered
 
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
office and we're indicating that if we
 
00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
know that they're not physically there
 
00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:13.160 align:start position:0%
they don't go to that office on a
 
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
regular basis they're they're not
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
physically there that that address would
 
00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:18.559 align:start position:0%
not be be used to be able to use to be
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
the registered office so my followup
 
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
question is how we are going to do the
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
compliance on this do you have any kind
 
00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:27.720 align:start position:0%
of edits in the system or you're going
 
00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:29.720 align:start position:0%
to do it manually that somebody's not
 
00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:33.640 align:start position:0%
following this guideline um we obviously
 
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
we do know who the known commercial Pro
 
00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
box office providers are in the state
 
00:50:39.549 --> 00:50:39.559 align:start position:0%
already I mean as far as where the local
 
00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
UPS Stores or the Val office so we have
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
that information we can put that into
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
our system so that if those dresses come
 
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
up that we will flag them for us for
 
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
review okay thank you I have followes
 
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you just so I get it uh
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
what what division what department are
 
00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
you in the corporation division of the
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
secretary of state Secretary of State
 
00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
yeah now and the Attorney General's
 
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
office uh is separate uh from your your
 
00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
uh business or your authority authority
 
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm my question is at what point does
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
it go uh become a legal matter that I
 
00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
think like the Attorney General would be
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
uh interested in Prosecuting I mean is
 
00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:30.680 align:start position:0%
it your your responsibility to prosecute
 
00:51:33.789 --> 00:51:33.799 align:start position:0%
these things it's not currently we we
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
can make referrals either to the to the
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh the county attorney or to the reg
 
00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
attorney general um if with a violation
 
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
of the statute but it's up to them then
 
00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
I'll be determined whether it's
 
00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:43.640 align:start position:0%
something they want to further
 
00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:45.400 align:start position:0%
investigate or or pursue but you would
 
00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation yes sir yes so uh
 
00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
thanks to frm Scandal um the the
 
00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:54.640 align:start position:0%

960 no no yeah yeah they've been House
 
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
number we're moving at the speed of
 
00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:03.150 align:start position:0%
number we're moving at the speed of
light

00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:06.789 align:start position:0%

Mark oh excuse
 
00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
me that was a Fran slip I just said that
 
00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
there I don't know if you saw he me when
 
00:53:19.109 --> 00:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
I said sorry my my brain was a little
 
00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
delayed there on this question um how
 
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
since you you said you know all the post
 
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
office providers the private post office
 
00:53:28.109 --> 00:53:28.119 align:start position:0%
box providers do you have an idea of how
 
00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
much this bill would impact existing
 
00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:32.920 align:start position:0%
businesses um you know have you done any
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
queries on to see you know how many
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
businesses are would not be in
 
00:53:40.829 --> 00:53:40.839 align:start position:0%
compliance that are currently um
 
00:53:42.910 --> 00:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
actually but not that any queries on
 
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
that um I don't anticipate it it would
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
be a large one we often catch these at
 
00:53:49.150 --> 00:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
the time of the um right now where we
 
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
would we would bounce them back
 
00:53:52.990 --> 00:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
typically indicate and to verify is that
 
00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:55.000 align:start position:0%
person at that physical address and they
 
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
would normally go ahead and make that
 
00:53:58.670 --> 00:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
correction before and then be submitted
 
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
for filing so I think that the the
 
00:54:02.589 --> 00:54:02.599 align:start position:0%
number of file business that would be
 
00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:05.240 align:start position:0%
impacted by it would be um there would
 
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
not be a dramatically would not be a
 
00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
large number but perhaps be piing you
 
00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
know making a educated guest it would be
 
00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.349 --> 00:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
certainly okay do you get get the r heat
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
or no we don't have one he's going to
 
00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
get one but I can write everything down
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
okay all right so uh representative
 
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
melier moves uh second from represent
 
00:54:30.789 --> 00:54:30.799 align:start position:0%
hunt moves out to pass on
 
00:54:30.799 --> 00:54:32.630 align:start position:0%

960
 
00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
H any discussion on the
 
00:54:38.549 --> 00:54:38.559 align:start position:0%
question seeing none all those in favor
 
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
raise their
 
00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
hand are you R
 
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
okay two that's all right
 
00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
three about about nine because Cole's

00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:02.440 align:start position:0%
myself okay the motion is ought to pass
 
00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
as amended any discussion on that
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
hand four eight seven eight
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
okay I know I'm I'm a bad counter
 
00:55:22.109 --> 00:55:22.119 align:start position:0%
because when we did it the exact session
 
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
okay all right next up 427 amending the
 
00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:43.400 align:start position:0%
UCC is that you JD is that your bill
 
00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:47.510 align:start position:0%
UCC is that you JD is that your bill
back

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:53.839 align:start position:0%
up I was just having a conversation with
 
00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
another chairman and I said um when
 
00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
you're executing a bill or you're doing
 
00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
a bill you actually want to know
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
everybody in the audience and know why
 
00:56:06.829 --> 00:56:06.839 align:start position:0%
they're there because it might give you
 
00:56:09.309 --> 00:56:09.319 align:start position:0%
a hint and who really cares about that
 
00:56:12.549 --> 00:56:12.559 align:start position:0%
bill and I see you hovering back there
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
so I know this must be yours so my
 
00:56:17.589 --> 00:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
memory was this was a uh you're
 
00:56:20.829 --> 00:56:20.839 align:start position:0%
remending the UCC over this theory about
 
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
soundness of money of the of and and um
 
00:56:30.829 --> 00:56:30.839 align:start position:0%
our UCC guy is telling us that this is
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
not something that's coming from
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
Chicago and we normally when it comes to
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
the rsas and what's over there
 
00:56:41.549 --> 00:56:41.559 align:start position:0%
everything is is comes from Chicago
 
00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
because the whole point of the UCC is to
 
00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
is to be
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
uniform so we we sort of have a problem
 
00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
with your bill because it we he we
 
00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
haven't got the Chicago blessing on it
 
00:56:58.670 --> 00:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
and and uh uh let alone that we did have
 
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
a lot of give or take there to try to
 
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
understand what you were trying to do so
 
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
um what what should we do with this bill
 
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
we can't really pass it we we can retain
 
00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
it you know if you want to keep this
 
00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:13.960 align:start position:0%
conversation going is there any hope
 
00:57:15.789 --> 00:57:15.799 align:start position:0%
that this that Chicago is ever going to
 
00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
buy into what you're working on in terms
 
00:57:20.349 --> 00:57:20.359 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
bill well I I I don't know whether
 
00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
Chicago is going to take this up unless
 
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
the stat say that it needs to be taken
 
00:57:32.029 --> 00:57:32.039 align:start position:0%
up I mean essentially just for the
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
committee what what what happened
 
00:57:39.549 --> 00:57:39.559 align:start position:0%
starting in the 90s and as the uh UCC
 
00:57:42.109 --> 00:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
was amended sections eight and sections
 
00:57:47.029 --> 00:57:47.039 align:start position:0%
n uh and uh our representative Mr Mooney
 
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
was the Godfather of this entire uh op
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
operation here change of the law
 
00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
basically taking
 
00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
ownership physical ownership of your
 
00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:03.640 align:start position:0%
property and turning it into a security
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
entitlement which effectively had all
 
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
the same uh indicaa of ownership except
 
00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:12.200 align:start position:0%
if the
 
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
intermediaries one of the intermediaries
 
00:58:18.069 --> 00:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
in the process goes insolvent if they go
 
00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:21.400 align:start position:0%
insolvent then all of a sudden you do
 
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
not have ownership anymore your your
 
00:58:28.990 --> 00:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
security is is in is in a giant pile of
 
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
Securities held by the various
 
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
intermediaries and the and the that the
 
00:58:37.029 --> 00:58:37.039 align:start position:0%
top of the of the chain the banks take
 
00:58:37.039 --> 00:58:38.029 align:start position:0%
top of the of the chain the banks take
that

00:58:38.029 --> 00:58:38.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:41.240 align:start position:0%
asset you can look at the Layman uh
 
00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
Brothers uh case that happened uh and
 
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
you have uh members that had assets
 
00:58:52.349 --> 00:58:52.359 align:start position:0%
there they're they're still fighting to
 
00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
to get them back and that's the problem
 
00:58:57.150 --> 00:58:57.160 align:start position:0%
this this is not a problem until you
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
have an insolvency when you do you are
 
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
out your property that is fundamentally
 
00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
wrong that's a fraud on New
 
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh owners of stocks and bonds
 
00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
it's a fraud on New Hampshire pensioners
 
00:59:16.109 --> 00:59:16.119 align:start position:0%
who who rely on pension systems it' be a
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
fraud on the New Hampshire treasury in
 
00:59:18.559 --> 00:59:19.510 align:start position:0%
fraud on the New Hampshire treasury in
my

00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:59:23.349 --> 00:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
opinion and so this issue has been
 
00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
recognized by people in the states it
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
was it went under the radar for years
 
00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
and years and years it's now been
 
00:59:32.029 --> 00:59:32.039 align:start position:0%
recognized and multiple states have
 
00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
taken up the issue of this needs to get
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
fixed and the way to fix it is to repeal
 
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
these sections that maybe will force the
 
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh the uh
 
00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
uh ulc to uh uh you know take the issue
 
00:59:51.309 --> 00:59:51.319 align:start position:0%
up and fix it but this issue needs to be
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
fixed what states have passed this
 
00:59:56.349 --> 00:59:56.359 align:start position:0%
there's no states that have passed it
 
00:59:58.750 --> 00:59:58.760 align:start position:0%
yet it's in progress in in several
 
01:00:00.910 --> 01:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
States okay so retaining it would be
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
okay retaining it would be find out
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
other stat keep it alive yes um but uh I
 
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
I would commend New Hampshire to be
 
01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
first in the nation to take care of its
 
01:00:14.309 --> 01:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
citizens uh being the first in nation
 
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
and amending the UCC is probably not
 
01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
something I'm too excited about but
 
01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:20.559 align:start position:0%
representative spear has a question
 
01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
before we uh take a vote on this uh Mr
 
01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
Moody gave us a uh paper that had talks
 
01:00:28.349 --> 01:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
about some of these issues and I think
 
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
I'd like to hear what he has to say yes
 
01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
that I I certainly was going to invite
 
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
him up represent Amon I just I have a
 
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
a logistics or a technical question yeah
 
01:00:41.789 --> 01:00:41.799 align:start position:0%
is it possible to amend a bill to to
 
01:00:44.589 --> 01:00:44.599 align:start position:0%
turn it into a resolution or is that is
 
01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
that not allowed not allowed okay we
 
01:00:49.549 --> 01:00:49.559 align:start position:0%
tried that in Science and Tech didn't
 
01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
work didn't work out that that answers
 
01:00:53.789 --> 01:00:53.799 align:start position:0%
my question well needs to say I I've
 
01:00:59.069 --> 01:00:59.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:59.079 --> 01:01:00.270 align:start position:0%
 
I

01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:00.280 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:01.910 align:start position:0%
I
wouldn't

01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
01:01:03.789 --> 01:01:03.799 align:start position:0%
okay uh because I don't think
 
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
resolutions are worth the paper they're
 
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
printed on I mean who's who who actually
 
01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:08.680 align:start position:0%
pays any attention to a resolution well
 
01:01:10.829 --> 01:01:10.839 align:start position:0%
so my thinking is uh Mr Mooney is our
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
state representative one of two
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
positions to the ulc and if maybe we had
 
01:01:17.789 --> 01:01:17.799 align:start position:0%
some language to sort of direct him in a
 
01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
certain direction that got passed by the
 
01:01:22.109 --> 01:01:22.119 align:start position:0%
house memory his testimony was that he
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
he he wasn't buying into the whole thing
 
01:01:26.069 --> 01:01:26.079 align:start position:0%
so well it it's the will of the house
 
01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about right
 
01:01:31.309 --> 01:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
right okay anybody any other questions
 
01:01:34.109 --> 01:01:34.119 align:start position:0%
for JD I I would just say that if you're
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
going to have Mr Mooney go to Chicago
 
01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:37.960 align:start position:0%
you're having the fox guard the hen
 
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
house I I that's that's a major problem
 
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
since he created it well he and all the
 
01:01:47.069 --> 01:01:47.079 align:start position:0%
other people in the US I understand but
 
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
he was the
 
01:01:48.319 --> 01:01:50.269 align:start position:0%
he was the
drafter

01:01:50.269 --> 01:01:50.279 align:start position:0%
drafter
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
okay so you're telling us we shouldn't
 
01:01:55.309 --> 01:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
bother listening to him no I'm saying
 
01:01:56.789 --> 01:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
you need
 
01:01:59.269 --> 01:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
understand that that's he's
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
the problem got it okay but then there's
 
01:02:06.510 --> 01:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
also the other side dare I say that this
 
01:02:08.109 --> 01:02:08.119 align:start position:0%
bill was brought together by somebody
 
01:02:11.069 --> 01:02:11.079 align:start position:0%
who's making money on a book so we we
 
01:02:14.029 --> 01:02:14.039 align:start position:0%
can't the calling the kettle black he's
 
01:02:17.349 --> 01:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
not making any money on the book he his
 
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
book is online for
 
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
okay any R there we we what is good
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
about this we get two sides which I
 
01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
always like when I hear two sides that
 
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
that makes it easier for me so thank you
 
01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:49.589 align:start position:0%
that makes it easier for me so thank you
all

01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
right chairman Vice chairman members of
 
01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:53.750 align:start position:0%
right chairman Vice chairman members of
the

01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
committee I guess I
 
01:02:58.470 --> 01:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
have something to agree with the
 
01:03:02.109 --> 01:03:02.119 align:start position:0%
previous speaker there indeed is a an
 
01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
ongoing fraud on New Hampshire and you
 
01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:06.839 align:start position:0%
just heard
 
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
it I don't say that lightly but let me
 
01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:11.630 align:start position:0%
it I don't say that lightly but let me
just

01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
say this claim that the
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
1994 amendments to article
 
01:03:26.789 --> 01:03:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
every complaint that's made about those
 
01:03:33.029 --> 01:03:33.039 align:start position:0%
amendments existed before those
 
01:03:36.309 --> 01:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
amendments in
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
Spades the idea of this security
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
entitlement somehow watering
 
01:03:45.549 --> 01:03:45.559 align:start position:0%
down the rights that existed before
 
01:03:50.269 --> 01:03:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
wrong the security entitlement
 
01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
represents the property right and all
 
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
the rights that
 
01:03:59.589 --> 01:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
an investor would have against its
 
01:04:03.789 --> 01:04:03.799 align:start position:0%
intermediary the broker or the bank or
 
01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
whoever under the law or under the
 
01:04:08.029 --> 01:04:08.039 align:start position:0%
contract it's the entire package it was
 
01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
just a drafting
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
mechanism those property rights are
 
01:04:16.349 --> 01:04:16.359 align:start position:0%
actually enhanced under that law not
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
diminished at
 
01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
all the investor under that
 
01:04:25.069 --> 01:04:25.079 align:start position:0%
law has a right if they act without
 
01:04:25.079 --> 01:04:26.230 align:start position:0%
law has a right if they act without
knowledge

01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
of some adverse
 
01:04:31.630 --> 01:04:31.640 align:start position:0%
claim to immunity from anybody suing
 
01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
them over their rights in the underlying
 
01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
Securities that they get by virtue of
 
01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
the credit to their account and you know
 
01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:45.400 align:start position:0%
I won't try to present all the evidence
 
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
today because there's several points to
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
make but I think it would be a huge
 
01:04:52.349 --> 01:04:52.359 align:start position:0%
mistake to uh retain this bill there's
 
01:04:55.390 --> 01:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
nothing uh four states have considered
 
01:04:58.589 --> 01:04:58.599 align:start position:0%
it so far this year for a vote North and
 
01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
South Dakota Tennessee and Y moming all
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
of them voted
 
01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:07.240 align:start position:0%
down uh the bill in Mississippi died
 
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
without even a hearing and we're told
 
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
with some assurance that in Oklahoma
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
it's not even going to get a
 
01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
hearing uh in four other States
 
01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire there has been
 
01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
but no vote so I would hope that New
 
01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would not be the first state
 
01:05:30.549 --> 01:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
that would buy into Mr web's fantasy
 
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
great taking conspiracy theory that
 
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
really has no basis in
 
01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
fact turning to what we just
 
01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
heard the idea that the person that has
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
a Securities account and gets a credit
 
01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
gives up his
 
01:05:49.589 --> 01:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
property is just not
 
01:05:52.109 --> 01:05:52.119 align:start position:0%
right the only way that property would
 
01:05:54.109 --> 01:05:54.119 align:start position:0%
go away in an
 
01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:58.990 --> 01:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.910 align:start position:0%
there's a
default

01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
default
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
on a
 
01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
loan that
 
01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:08.430 align:start position:0%
loan that
the

01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:12.029 --> 01:06:12.039 align:start position:0%
investor has taken out otherwise it
 
01:06:14.269 --> 01:06:14.279 align:start position:0%
retains all of its
 
01:06:17.549 --> 01:06:17.559 align:start position:0%
claims to the extent investors have
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
consented as they do in any margin
 
01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
account they agree that the intermediary
 
01:06:27.309 --> 01:06:27.319 align:start position:0%
can for example pledge their
 
01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
Securities I me can anybody believe when
 
01:06:32.549 --> 01:06:32.559 align:start position:0%
you consent to your securities being
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
pledged that you're saying oh but of
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
course my rights are superior to the
 
01:06:39.269 --> 01:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
lender not
 
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
likely inconceivable in
 
01:06:46.589 --> 01:06:46.599 align:start position:0%
fact now the lender to the intermediary
 
01:06:50.309 --> 01:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
which is the priority here can only
 
01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
obtain the value of the Securities to
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
secure the
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
debt and the debt of the inter mediary
 
01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:57.190 align:start position:0%
debt and the debt of the inter mediary
cannot

01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
01:07:01.829 --> 01:07:01.839 align:start position:0%
exceed all of the debts of its customers
 
01:07:04.829 --> 01:07:04.839 align:start position:0%
so when you wash it out all they can do
 
01:07:09.069 --> 01:07:09.079 align:start position:0%
is satisfy that debt but the excess
 
01:07:11.950 --> 01:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
value over the secuity pledge to secure
 
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
that debt would of course come back the
 
01:07:17.789 --> 01:07:17.799 align:start position:0%
only way that could Advantage is if both
 
01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:19.880 align:start position:0%
the intermediaries and solvent and the
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
lender insolvent so the lender can't
 
01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
even give back the excess collateral
 
01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:26.150 align:start position:0%
even give back the excess collateral
cushion

01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
cushion
 
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
and for
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
this fantasy Theory to take place it
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
would take hundreds or thousands of
 
01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
intermediaries to be insolvent and their
 
01:07:36.789 --> 01:07:36.799 align:start position:0%
lendage to be insolvent it just can't
 
01:07:39.549 --> 01:07:39.559 align:start position:0%
happen the arithmetic doesn't work so
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
this theory is not there the idea that
 
01:07:45.269 --> 01:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
this was something that was
 
01:07:49.349 --> 01:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
created uh in 1994 is just
 
01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
absurd yes my scholarship was
 
01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
responsible for the core of those
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
changes although there were a lot of
 
01:08:01.349 --> 01:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
changes made of course in the drafting
 
01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
committee I was an American Bar
 
01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:07.990 align:start position:0%
committee I was an American Bar
Association

01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
advisor but I had to fight a lot of the
 
01:08:15.789 --> 01:08:15.799 align:start position:0%
financial industry to come up with this
 
01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
idea because when you have intermediated
 
01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
bul normal property rules don't apply
 
01:08:28.349 --> 01:08:28.359 align:start position:0%
very well the first in time first in
 
01:08:30.669 --> 01:08:30.679 align:start position:0%
right so we came up with a system where
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
the rights of
 
01:08:35.789 --> 01:08:35.799 align:start position:0%
the investor are going to be greater
 
01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
protected with this protection from
 
01:08:39.789 --> 01:08:39.799 align:start position:0%
being sued all they had to give up with
 
01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
the idea that
 
01:08:44.749 --> 01:08:44.759 align:start position:0%
somehow if they somehow could trace
 
01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
their Securities which are settled in
 
01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
fungible bulks and netted out which is
 
01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:50.309 align:start position:0%
fungible bulks and netted out which is
very

01:08:50.309 --> 01:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:08:53.070 --> 01:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
unlikely that somehow if in the
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
insolvency the trustee didn't go after
 
01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
customer assets which they virtually
 
01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:58.749 align:start position:0%
customer assets which they virtually
always

01:08:58.749 --> 01:08:58.759 align:start position:0%
always
 
01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
would that the customer would not be
 
01:09:04.269 --> 01:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
able to sue in most
 
01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
circumstances but the point is that just
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
means the customer can't sue the
 
01:09:12.829 --> 01:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
customer of another firm the customer
 
01:09:15.149 --> 01:09:15.159 align:start position:0%
only has rights against the firm that it
 
01:09:18.189 --> 01:09:18.199 align:start position:0%
selected and nobody can take those
 
01:09:22.590 --> 01:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
assets away from it because it has uh
 
01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
immunity uh finally
 
01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh this could have an adverse impact in
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
particular on intermediaries and their
 
01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
credit opportunities other than broker
 
01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
dealers for the broker dealers where
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
most people have their Securities
 
01:09:42.309 --> 01:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
accounts secured creditors of the broker
 
01:09:43.829 --> 01:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
dealers have had
 
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
priority in Liquidation in in insolvency
 
01:09:50.309 --> 01:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
for many years it's been cified in the
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy code and in the Securities
 
01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
investor protection act beginning in
 
01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
1938 there's no change here this is a
 
01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
this is a solution in search of a
 
01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
problem that just does not exist and the
 
01:10:05.470 --> 01:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
idea that all of the organizations that
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
represent consumers that represent
 
01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:09.640 align:start position:0%
investors that were involved in this
 
01:10:12.270 --> 01:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
process have been sitting there being
 
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
unaware of this they've got a a video
 
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
out that says somehow this was secret
 
01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
there's nothing secret about it I CED in
 
01:10:26.910 --> 01:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
the paper I distributed the website of
 
01:10:29.149 --> 01:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
of where you can look up and find out
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
about customer protections and what
 
01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:32.310 align:start position:0%
about customer protections and what
happens

01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
happens
 
01:10:36.189 --> 01:10:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
just I'm sorry to have to be so emphatic
 
01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
but I've never in any sort of
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
forum uh had to confront a situation
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
where people would just stand up and
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
flat out say things that are inaccurate
 
01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
to try to persuade a legislative body so
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
questions welcome to the legislative
 
01:11:06.189 --> 01:11:06.199 align:start position:0%
process well I've been R it a little bit
 
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
represent Hammond thank you Mr Moody for
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
your testimony um during the public
 
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
hearing you know I heard both sides and
 
01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
that's what we do here it's a you know
 
01:11:17.229 --> 01:11:17.239 align:start position:0%
there's some debate that happens um it
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
seemed that one side was talking about
 
01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
the normal course of business and the
 
01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:23.080 align:start position:0%
other side was talking about a
 
01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:25.480 align:start position:0%
catastroph a catastrophic situation
 
01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
where you know it's a it's a 2008
 
01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
collapse um if you focus on that extreme
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
scenario you know they've they happen
 
01:11:37.629 --> 01:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
periodically every couple of decades
 
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
um is there any truth in the in the
 
01:11:43.229 --> 01:11:43.239 align:start position:0%
scenario where lots of firms become ins
 
01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
solvent that investors are sort of cut
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
off from tracing their ownership to a
 
01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
particular security because they're held
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
in this the fungible bulk that that's my
 
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
question sure I don't think there is any
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
truth in it we've had those
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
catastrophes in the past and the system
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
has worked very well it certainly worked
 
01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
very well in 2008 if you just
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
do the
 
01:12:12.910 --> 01:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
arithmetic on the Securities that are
 
01:12:15.629 --> 01:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
pledged you don't lose ownership of
 
01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
something I mean it only secures a debt
 
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
the property transfer is to the extent
 
01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
of the value of the borrowings so that's
 
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
all that would be at risk and of course
 
01:12:29.790 --> 01:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
that would be offset that's already been
 
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
transferred and uh broker dealers can
 
01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
only use that of course for uh customer
 
01:12:41.189 --> 01:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
purposes uh so this would definitely be
 
01:12:41.199 --> 01:12:42.590 align:start position:0%
purposes uh so this would definitely be
a

01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
problem one of the main
 
01:12:50.110 --> 01:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
reasons that the 1994 amendments came
 
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
about triggered in first by some
 
01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
government securities dealers failures
 
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
those dealers were not regulated broker
 
01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
dealers and then concern about
 
01:13:05.629 --> 01:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
crisis the entire Financial economy of
 
01:13:10.270 --> 01:13:10.280 align:start position:0%
this country depends on
 
01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
collateral virtually all of the
 
01:13:15.189 --> 01:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
investment markets whether it's real
 
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
estate Finance depends on collateral and
 
01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
the problem was that due to some
 
01:13:24.830 --> 01:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
arguments made there was concern with
 
01:13:27.550 --> 01:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
these unregulated intermediaries that
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
the collateral wouldn't stand
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
up and that's what this was about I
 
01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
didn't think the amendments were talking
 
01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
about 8511 were necessary because things
 
01:13:40.629 --> 01:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
were working just fine but some members
 
01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
of the drafting committee wanted to set
 
01:13:46.629 --> 01:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
a new rule that says customers come
 
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
first but of course to pledge their
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
Securities the customer has to
 
01:13:54.550 --> 01:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
consent and then we had to offset that
 
01:13:57.229 --> 01:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
with the private ority rule that would
 
01:13:59.430 --> 01:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
not be inconsistent with what we saw
 
01:14:01.669 --> 01:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
with the broker dealers and which has
 
01:14:04.950 --> 01:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
always been the rule for secured credit
 
01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:05.750 align:start position:0%
always been the rule for secured credit
and

01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
insolvency so I don't think there is any
 
01:14:12.110 --> 01:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
any basis for that when you uh when you
 
01:14:15.550 --> 01:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:20.629 --> 01:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
numbers okay R up okay represent spear
 
01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh Leman Brothers was brought up could
 
01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
you explain what went on there or what
 
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
to well since it had nothing to do with
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
these priority
 
01:14:34.629 --> 01:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
rules which weren't applied and which
 
01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
were not involved in the case that they
 
01:14:40.149 --> 01:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
keep raising I can't explain it that's
 
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
why I've pointed out that it's
 
01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
false I mean I can't explain and you
 
01:14:47.790 --> 01:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
know I'm not I'm just an itinerate
 
01:14:49.709 --> 01:14:49.719 align:start position:0%
retired law professor I can't explain
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
why someone wants to make false claims
 
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
but you know I'm maybe I'm learning
 
01:14:55.629 --> 01:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
something about
 
01:14:58.430 --> 01:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
that too but in that case involves some
 
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
Safe Harbor rules under the bankruptcy
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
code which
 
01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
protect transferees and certain
 
01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
Securities transactions from having
 
01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
their transactions avoided in a
 
01:15:15.950 --> 01:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy and that was involved in a
 
01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
chapter 11 bankruptcy of the parent not
 
01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
the broker
 
01:15:25.070 --> 01:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
dealer uh uh so those rules didn't apply
 
01:15:29.229 --> 01:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
I've written highly critically of those
 
01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
rules that we need the Safe Harbor rules
 
01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
but not as broad as they are and I've
 
01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
criticized them for being as broad as
 
01:15:38.669 --> 01:15:38.679 align:start position:0%
they are but that's beside the point
 
01:15:41.070 --> 01:15:41.080 align:start position:0%
these priority rules weren't weren't
 
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
case okay I have a question
 
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert this is uh super
 
01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
complicated yes and and uh I I was a
 
01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
broker when uh uh two of the biggest
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
crashes happened I had nothing to do
 
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
with it but the fact of the matter is
 
01:16:04.270 --> 01:16:04.280 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is do you people
 
01:16:07.550 --> 01:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
went bankrupt the dealers uh Leman is
 
01:16:10.510 --> 01:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
the last example I guess but there was a
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
savings and loan crisis before that
 
01:16:16.590 --> 01:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
where a bunch of broker dealers went uh
 
01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
bankrupt I I would like to have my
 
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
question is is if this is not germine in
 
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
other words it's been the way this is
 
01:16:31.470 --> 01:16:31.480 align:start position:0%
how it works and I understand that and
 
01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
if somebody is trying to change it I I'm
 
01:16:37.870 --> 01:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
having difficulty understanding uh how I
 
01:16:39.709 --> 01:16:39.719 align:start position:0%
mean if you went and and and bought a
 
01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
lot of Securities through a a legitimate
 
01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:45.400 align:start position:0%
broker dealer and then a catastrophe
 
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
happens which is happens more often than
 
01:16:50.629 --> 01:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
you would imagine uh that you can
 
01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
somehow go back and uh grab you grab the
 
01:16:54.719 --> 01:16:55.590 align:start position:0%
somehow go back and uh grab you grab the
uh

01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:59.390 --> 01:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
assets you know your money you can't I
 
01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
mean it's it's gone the collateral was
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
levered to the point where it didn't it
 
01:17:08.350 --> 01:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
didn't have they didn't have enough
 
01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:09.390 align:start position:0%
didn't have they didn't have enough
money

01:17:09.390 --> 01:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
to uh you know send the money back to
 
01:17:15.870 --> 01:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
the whoever had bought the Securities so
 
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't understand what we're
 
01:17:20.709 --> 01:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
trying to change here because okay
 
01:17:23.110 --> 01:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
that's your question that the my you
 
01:17:25.229 --> 01:17:25.239 align:start position:0%
know that's a that's a statement that's
 
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
so would you believe yeah okay worked
 
01:17:30.070 --> 01:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
very well that under the Securities
 
01:17:33.550 --> 01:17:33.560 align:start position:0%
investor protection act losses of
 
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
customers uh over the covered amount
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
have been you know teeny
 
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
teeny tiny and those losses are
 
01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
protected for individual
 
01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
investors per per each account up to
 
01:17:53.310 --> 01:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
500,000 in losses so if we imagined a
 
01:17:56.669 --> 01:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
loss A shortfall in customer Securities
 
01:17:59.669 --> 01:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
of unheard of proportions say
 
01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
10% for you not to be covered you would
 
01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
have to have 5 million in your account
 
01:18:07.390 --> 01:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
but if the losses are more
 
01:18:11.709 --> 01:18:11.719 align:start position:0%
likely in the 1% or less range of a of a
 
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
shortfall in those few cases where there
 
01:18:16.990 --> 01:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
have been shortfalls it would be many
 
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
many times that that you would have to
 
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
lose to to uh in your accounts to to uh
 
01:18:28.830 --> 01:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
not be be covered of your loss so it's
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
it's worked very well this is something
 
01:18:34.110 --> 01:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
that's come up in crypto and I site the
 
01:18:36.669 --> 01:18:36.679 align:start position:0%
chief Council of coinbase one of the
 
01:18:39.310 --> 01:18:39.320 align:start position:0%
largest exchanges which also acts as
 
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
custodian he tweeted not long ago that
 
01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
article 8 is the pillar of commercial
 
01:18:49.149 --> 01:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
law because it protects the customers
 
01:18:50.510 --> 01:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
and they get it rather than the
 
01:18:52.750 --> 01:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
creditors on the other hand coinbase
 
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
does have for certain kinds of
 
01:18:59.310 --> 01:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
investors some margin Arrangements which
 
01:19:01.310 --> 01:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
would allow them to reh hypothecate if
 
01:19:04.030 --> 01:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
they needed to fund the margin loans
 
01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
those uh that's not governed by CPA just
 
01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
like Banks aren't governed by CPA and
 
01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
these amendments would affect that the
 
01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
pending genius act in the Senate on
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
on uh stable coins uh provides in there
 
01:19:24.870 --> 01:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
that in a custody arrangement
 
01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
the custodian can reh
 
01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
hypothecate Assets in order to have the
 
01:19:33.790 --> 01:19:33.800 align:start position:0%
flexibility to maintain the one to one
 
01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
dollar per
 
01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
unit ratio so in in the world of
 
01:19:41.950 --> 01:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
custodians that are not broker
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
dealers uh these amendments would
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
definitely uh chill uh or eliminate the
 
01:19:53.950 --> 01:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
uh credit to the uh intermediary because
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
they would the only time this matters is
 
01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:57.350 align:start position:0%
they would the only time this matters is
in

01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
insolvency uh and if in
 
01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
insolvency uh you're you're not
 
01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:12.149 --> 01:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
Keith I
 
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
mean I like the idea of retaining the
 
01:20:17.390 --> 01:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
bill because uh you know obviously other
 
01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
states are looking at this but I I don't
 
01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
see passing it at this point so my
 
01:20:27.229 --> 01:20:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:30.669 --> 01:20:30.679 align:start position:0%
okay represent Amon moose retain second
 
01:20:32.629 --> 01:20:32.639 align:start position:0%
by representative hunt any discussion on
 
01:20:36.530 --> 01:20:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:39.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

01:20:39.070 --> 01:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
retain we have we have so many bills
 
01:20:44.950 --> 01:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
that we're just hanging out there yeah
 
01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
it's fine
 
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh I know they value of retaining though
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
I think we've we've kind of learned that
 
01:20:53.709 --> 01:20:53.719 align:start position:0%
lesson that retaining is yeah I have
 
01:21:00.030 --> 01:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:00.950 align:start position:0%
 
thank

01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
W uh most of this is way above my head
 
01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
but what what would the ramifications be
 
01:21:14.510 --> 01:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
of OTP in it if it's if
 
01:21:17.350 --> 01:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
it's no we don't do that but it's saying
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
it's that it's a very rare occasion so
 
01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
because it undermines the the whole UCC
 
01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
structure way the UC
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
law and the fundamental element of UCC
 
01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:33.189 align:start position:0%
law and the fundamental element of UCC
is

01:21:33.189 --> 01:21:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
universality because this
 
01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
that that all the states are playing by
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:44.189 --> 01:21:44.199 align:start position:0%
book okay so the motion is to retain um
 
01:21:47.550 --> 01:21:47.560 align:start position:0%
all those in favor raise their hand one
 
01:21:52.590 --> 01:21:52.600 align:start position:0%

but this was as the bill as
 
01:26:36.270 --> 01:26:36.280 align:start position:0%
introduced um a question yes my
 
01:26:38.830 --> 01:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
understanding is that all the marketing

was done by the provider Metropolitan
 
01:26:44.590 --> 01:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
that's uh what we're expecting to happen
 
01:26:48.390 --> 01:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
going forward right all
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
right by the insurance company yeah have
 
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
they agreed to that uh have we have they
 
01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
agreed to do the marketing they'll take
 
01:26:58.189 --> 01:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
over the marketing but they've been
 
01:27:02.590 --> 01:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
doing it already no no we have I heard I
 
01:27:05.950 --> 01:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
I yeah where are we did they agree to it
 
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm waiting for having someone come
 
01:27:13.109 --> 01:27:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:15.149 --> 01:27:15.159 align:start position:0%
commissioners of
 
01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
one oh three Commissioners three Three
 
01:27:21.709 --> 01:27:21.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:24.629 --> 01:27:24.639 align:start position:0%
three it's brought out the Heavy Hitters
 
01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
sorry to make you guys wait all the way
 
01:27:28.950 --> 01:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
to the end end here but I'm sure you
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's been a few years since I covered
 
01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
the UCC in law school so this was a
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
right it was kind of fun to relive UCC
 
01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
it was as riveting today as it was back
 
01:27:42.189 --> 01:27:42.199 align:start position:0%
then so just as a reminder um DJ beton
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
Court insurance department Rich labers
 
01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner over at Employment
 
01:27:47.870 --> 01:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
Security Cassie Keane Deputy
 
01:27:51.950 --> 01:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
Commissioner over at Das so it is
 
01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
certainly I think going to be the
 
01:27:55.990 --> 01:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
intention for us to have a conversation
 
01:27:59.030 --> 01:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
with MetLife to take on some of the
 
01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
marketing um the current marketing is
 
01:28:05.070 --> 01:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
being conducted via a separate contract
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
with a marketing firm if I understand
 
01:28:10.270 --> 01:28:10.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment correctly that would go
 
01:28:12.310 --> 01:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
away yeah you you did get a copy of the
 
01:28:14.669 --> 01:28:14.679 align:start position:0%
amendment right you guys okay so that
 
01:28:17.350 --> 01:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
piece of it would fall away and so you'd
 
01:28:19.750 --> 01:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
be left with the program so how much
 
01:28:22.229 --> 01:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
money did we just save the state here
 
01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
how much was that contract for I want to
 
01:28:26.550 --> 01:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
know what Kudos I need to get
 
01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
when I I think in our in our um budget
 
01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
request pending now before division one
 
01:28:37.030 --> 01:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
we had reduced uh the marketing to
 
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
200,000 so I but our contract was for
 
01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
more than that um and contracts are
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
subject to funding appropriated by the
 
01:28:47.709 --> 01:28:47.719 align:start position:0%
legislature so that's why there's a
 
01:28:50.510 --> 01:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
disconnect between the two okay but so
 
01:28:52.109 --> 01:28:52.119 align:start position:0%
in terms of taking these out how how
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
much money we're saving just 200 per
 
01:28:57.550 --> 01:28:57.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal year oh per fiscal year so it's
 
01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
really 400 yes what was the what was the
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
previous spend and what was the previous
 
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
expenditure um I thought it was like a
 
01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:06.280 align:start position:0%
Million number we have spent over a
 
01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars to implement um we began
 
01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
implementing in 2223 so give me a moment
 
01:29:19.070 --> 01:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:21.390 --> 01:29:21.400 align:start position:0%
chair this is a combin well she's
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
thinking I I have a a combined down was
 
01:29:28.430 --> 01:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
1.7 1.7 I have a rolled up number I'm
 
01:29:30.990 --> 01:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
sorry to say it includes a consultant
 
01:29:37.870 --> 01:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:41.070 --> 01:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
1.3 in 24
 
01:29:46.030 --> 01:29:46.040 align:start position:0%
we in one we spent 1.3 in fiscal year 23
 
01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
combined between the marketing and the
 
01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
consultant and I mentioned to you before
 
01:29:55.510 --> 01:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
that we have a tiny um contract with a
 
01:29:59.870 --> 01:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
company to provide the website that we
 
01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
have okay so it's a rolled up number I'm
 
01:30:07.070 --> 01:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
sorry this is why I'm not on finance
 
01:30:10.629 --> 01:30:10.639 align:start position:0%
because numbers numbers are very fun I
 
01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
can explain fible fible but let me help
 
01:30:16.709 --> 01:30:16.719 align:start position:0%
explain well because somehow you somehow
 
01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
in the hearing we had
 
01:30:23.109 --> 01:30:23.119 align:start position:0%
1.7 I think that's a 24 number um okay
 
01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
see well that was
 
01:30:27.229 --> 01:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
was pass last year okay I'm sorry so it
 
01:30:30.510 --> 01:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
was um I think sounds weird to you to
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
only 200 so two things are going on
 
01:30:35.470 --> 01:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
we've already implemented so we've
 
01:30:37.750 --> 01:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
stepped down our spending the other
 
01:30:40.669 --> 01:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
thing is that we're before division one
 
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
in a time of of fiscal restraint right
 
01:30:47.070 --> 01:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
correct so we're cutting our budget in
 
01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
response to the governor's directions
 
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
and now we're working with division one
 
01:30:56.189 --> 01:30:56.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:58.750 --> 01:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
okay keep going with
 
01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
it representative BRS thanks thanks and
 
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and recognizing
 
01:31:06.550 --> 01:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
that there's zero chance of the the
 
01:31:08.669 --> 01:31:08.679 align:start position:0%
budget getting bigger in terms of the
 
01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
marketing how is that going to impact
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
the program I mean just is that
 
01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:13.669 align:start position:0%
the program I mean just is that
problematic

01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
or well I think the thing about Paid
 
01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
Family Medical Leave is that um getting
 
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
the word out to people that the product
 
01:31:25.390 --> 01:31:25.400 align:start position:0%
exists is the most important thing right
 
01:31:27.550 --> 01:31:27.560 align:start position:0%
so that's what we focused our efforts on
 
01:31:29.629 --> 01:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
is getting to large employers getting to
 
01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
small employers getting to individuals
 
01:31:36.270 --> 01:31:36.280 align:start position:0%
so if marketing is repealed and it's a
 
01:31:39.229 --> 01:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
responsibility today in the law for the
 
01:31:41.109 --> 01:31:41.119 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative services
 
01:31:43.390 --> 01:31:43.400 align:start position:0%
and Rich's Department Employment
 
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
Security we will no longer be doing
 
01:31:47.790 --> 01:31:47.800 align:start position:0%
marketing yeah as commissioner beton
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
Court said it's now met life's turn to
 
01:31:54.830 --> 01:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
pick up the ball sounds good and the one
 
01:31:56.669 --> 01:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
good thing about this kind of a product
 
01:31:59.350 --> 01:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
is it's not like people come and go um
 
01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
you know once you've bought into it once
 
01:32:02.270 --> 01:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
you're starting to pay into it you're
 
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
not going to you're not going to back
 
01:32:06.149 --> 01:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
out so we we have that critical mass now
 
01:32:07.709 --> 01:32:07.719 align:start position:0%
not only with the state employees but
 
01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
with private companies um and so so and
 
01:32:12.750 --> 01:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I might just add I
 
01:32:14.669 --> 01:32:14.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that there's some
 
01:32:17.590 --> 01:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
anxiety around what
 
01:32:20.109 --> 01:32:20.119 align:start position:0%
impact removing the advertising might
 
01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:22.719 align:start position:0%
have to the program I think two things I
 
01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
think as Cassie just me mentioned I
 
01:32:28.470 --> 01:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
think metti should take on some of those
 
01:32:30.990 --> 01:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities someone who gets to see
 
01:32:32.750 --> 01:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
exactly how much these companies make
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
every year I can assure you they can
 
01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
afford it take it on it's within their
 
01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
best interest I think to do so to ensure
 
01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
that this program is successful but I
 
01:32:46.350 --> 01:32:46.360 align:start position:0%
would also say that three years in now
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
we are starting at least in the
 
01:32:49.709 --> 01:32:49.719 align:start position:0%
conversations that I'm having I won't
 
01:32:51.669 --> 01:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
speak for cassia Rich we are starting to
 
01:32:55.229 --> 01:32:55.239 align:start position:0%
see organic growth we're starting to
 
01:32:57.790 --> 01:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
hear from people who enrolled because
 
01:33:00.510 --> 01:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
they know of a family member or a friend
 
01:33:02.229 --> 01:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
or another member of the community that
 
01:33:03.950 --> 01:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
they've had a conversation with that's
 
01:33:07.629 --> 01:33:07.639 align:start position:0%
had a good experience with this product
 
01:33:09.229 --> 01:33:09.239 align:start position:0%
and so that's Peak their interest to
 
01:33:10.750 --> 01:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
pursue it for themselves or for their
 
01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
businesses so will it have an impact
 
01:33:17.470 --> 01:33:17.480 align:start position:0%
sure now again does that mean we can't
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
account for that I think we I think we
 
01:33:21.950 --> 01:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
can and I think that some of it at this
 
01:33:23.830 --> 01:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
point has its own momentum in that
 
01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
organic growth is going to kick in and
 
01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
result in the program's growth over the
 
01:33:32.030 --> 01:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
next several years and Beyond it's
 
01:33:35.550 --> 01:33:35.560 align:start position:0%
repres thank you um just looking at the
 
01:33:38.189 --> 01:33:38.199 align:start position:0%
effective date 60 days after Passage
 
01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
would it make sense to delay it to
 
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
January 1 of next year is there any
 
01:33:44.750 --> 01:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
benefit um and uh second part of the
 
01:33:47.790 --> 01:33:47.800 align:start position:0%
question would be let's say this passes
 
01:33:49.830 --> 01:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and there's contracts that
 
01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
still need to be paid There's No
 
01:33:54.990 --> 01:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
Interruption um anticipated CH cass's
 
01:33:58.109 --> 01:33:58.119 align:start position:0%
got that one so
 
01:34:04.830 --> 01:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
um I think it makes sense to um either
 
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
so what I'm thinking about is the budget
 
01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
process right right so when when I'm
 
01:34:10.510 --> 01:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
going to assume when they just normally
 
01:34:13.629 --> 01:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
flip this over to flip the into the
 
01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
first hb1 and
 
01:34:18.030 --> 01:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
hb2 well I think what they're going to
 
01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
do in in the accounting unit for paid
 
01:34:23.550 --> 01:34:23.560 align:start position:0%
family medical leave in the dis budget
 
01:34:25.870 --> 01:34:25.880 align:start position:0%
is is zero it out okay they're just
 
01:34:27.870 --> 01:34:27.880 align:start position:0%
going to zero it out right right that's
 
01:34:30.270 --> 01:34:30.280 align:start position:0%
the operations expense what I mean by
 
01:34:32.229 --> 01:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
that is as I've talked to you folks it's
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
a it's our consultant it's our marketing
 
01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
it's the website Etc it's not the state
 
01:34:40.229 --> 01:34:40.239 align:start position:0%
employee benefit expense that's being
 
01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
debated okay so once the once the
 
01:34:45.310 --> 01:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
contract's unfunded I'm going to notice
 
01:34:47.709 --> 01:34:47.719 align:start position:0%
our contractors that the contract is
 
01:34:49.830 --> 01:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
been unfunded and there's a provision in
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
all state contracts that say that
 
01:34:57.109 --> 01:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
they're dependent on funding so um I I
 
01:34:58.629 --> 01:34:58.639 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:35:01.149 --> 01:35:01.159 align:start position:0%
um I would either leave the effective
 
01:35:03.790 --> 01:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
date the way it is or upon passage is
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
what I would
 
01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
recommend and I would say out of those
 
01:35:09.030 --> 01:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
list of things the only thing that would
 
01:35:11.550 --> 01:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
give me any uh great concern and again I
 
01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
have a different perspective than Cassie
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
because she's more intimately involved
 
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
in these pieces but uh losing the
 
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
website I think would be a a real
 
01:35:22.270 --> 01:35:22.280 align:start position:0%
challenge I think it would be so not
 
01:35:25.629 --> 01:35:25.639 align:start position:0%
great at all um
 
01:35:28.229 --> 01:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
not ideal far less than ideal I I'll put
 
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
it to you that way but if that was truly
 
01:35:34.669 --> 01:35:34.679 align:start position:0%
something that the various Finance
 
01:35:37.510 --> 01:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
committees felt was appropriate I think
 
01:35:39.669 --> 01:35:39.679 align:start position:0%
I'd probably get to work to see how we
 
01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
might be able to help with that okay all
 
01:35:44.430 --> 01:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
right so we'll just leave it like this
 
01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
then representative Gibbs thank you and
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming in to testify um so
 
01:35:56.310 --> 01:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
this amendment would repeal the future
 
01:35:58.470 --> 01:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
marketing a lot of the marketing has
 
01:36:00.910 --> 01:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
already been done and the benefit will
 
01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:04.790 align:start position:0%
already been done and the benefit will
remain

01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:08.310 --> 01:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:11.149 --> 01:36:11.159 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:36:13.310 --> 01:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
oh one more question repres helping
 
01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
thank you chair uh how much is the cost
 
01:36:18.270 --> 01:36:18.280 align:start position:0%
of the website it shouldn't be that much
 
01:36:20.669 --> 01:36:20.679 align:start position:0%
and we really need something to tell
 
01:36:22.669 --> 01:36:22.679 align:start position:0%
everybody we cannot just call everybody
 
01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
and say that we have this PL send the
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
flyer it it it's quite minimal again
 
01:36:30.629 --> 01:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
it's it's again you stand it up right
 
01:36:32.990 --> 01:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's the work is done now now we have to
 
01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
just refresh it from time to time so
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
it's it's like less than $100,000 our
 
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
current contract amount and um when when
 
01:36:43.510 --> 01:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner beton Court said he'd be
 
01:36:45.790 --> 01:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
happy to help I'm thinking maybe he'd
 
01:36:48.709 --> 01:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
help maybe commissioner goule might help
 
01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
so that we could keep it standing do
 
01:36:54.030 --> 01:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
people um sign up through the web page
 
01:36:56.189 --> 01:36:56.199 align:start position:0%
yes we have so that's it's critical to
 
01:36:58.510 --> 01:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
keep it I mean obviously that's the
 
01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
portal representative H and you and I
 
01:37:02.350 --> 01:37:02.360 align:start position:0%
have had this conversation we're in
 
01:37:03.990 --> 01:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
agreement that you know one of the
 
01:37:05.310 --> 01:37:05.320 align:start position:0%
things that always gives us great
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
anxiety when the topic comes up about
 
01:37:09.310 --> 01:37:09.320 align:start position:0%
whether or not we should move to some
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
sort of a state-based exchange for the
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
individual Market is we've been in the
 
01:37:15.790 --> 01:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
federal exchange for so long now that
 
01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
the citizens of our state have gotten
 
01:37:20.550 --> 01:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
comfortable and used to and familiar
 
01:37:22.990 --> 01:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
with the current system it would
 
01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
potentially be quite disruptive to move
 
01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
away from that and so it's not to your
 
01:37:29.550 --> 01:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
point it's not just a website per se
 
01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
it's also the conduit by which they go
 
01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
and get the coverage and so that's why
 
01:37:36.629 --> 01:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
that particular piece is of such
 
01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
concern and it was great because if
 
01:37:40.669 --> 01:37:40.679 align:start position:0%
there was a problem it was theirs not
 
01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
ours that too and there was a problem
 
01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
when they first started it most
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
importantly they have to pay for it well
 
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
but then that was the whole argument of
 
01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
the bill was going if we switch to
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
estate that's right we could potentially
 
01:37:58.310 --> 01:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
save a million or two but okay have no
 
01:38:02.030 --> 01:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
more questions so the motion
 
01:38:06.430 --> 01:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh who I guess who wants to take
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
is anybody want to write the BL or
 
01:38:09.189 --> 01:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
otherwise I'll do
 
01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
it um okay so uh you want to do Anon
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
okay uh it this is that we'll be writing
 
01:38:21.030 --> 01:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
doing this next
 
01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
Wednesday okay but but we want you to
 
01:38:25.750 --> 01:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
have it written ahead of
 
01:38:28.510 --> 01:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
time any okay all right so
 
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
representative am and by represent pusc
 
01:38:34.589 --> 01:38:34.599 align:start position:0%

01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:37.440 align:start position:0%

go and we're done look at that who
 
01:39:04.109 --> 01:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
thought who think we could actually do

Bild don't all chip over
yourself

03:28:04.269 --> 03:28:04.279 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
03:28:07.670 --> 03:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
okay don't you come on up here
 
03:28:20.189 --> 03:28:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:24.349 --> 03:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
good morning afternoon how are you
 
03:28:28.189 --> 03:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
great it's nice to see you all um so we
 
03:28:29.750 --> 03:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
already submitted this this is for our
 
03:28:31.389 --> 03:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
work session correct correct so just
 
03:28:33.590 --> 03:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
jogas what what's what was the problem
 
03:28:35.429 --> 03:28:35.439 align:start position:0%
you want us to solve okay so this is
 
03:28:37.229 --> 03:28:37.239 align:start position:0%
about you know trying to find those
 
03:28:38.790 --> 03:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
bottlenecks we all know I think we've
 
03:28:40.790 --> 03:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
heard from most of our constituents who
 
03:28:43.070 --> 03:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
try to get mental health care about the
 
03:28:44.990 --> 03:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
lack of mental health care in the state
 
03:28:47.309 --> 03:28:47.319 align:start position:0%
um certainly and one of those parts is
 
03:28:50.590 --> 03:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
um not is uh the in access to
 
03:28:52.429 --> 03:28:52.439 align:start position:0%
credentialing getting that through not
 
03:28:54.429 --> 03:28:54.439 align:start position:0%
making it easier to get credentialed but
 
03:28:56.910 --> 03:28:56.920 align:start position:0%
certainly finding the the areas that are
 
03:28:59.349 --> 03:28:59.359 align:start position:0%
causing some stricture in getting
 
03:29:00.710 --> 03:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
credentialed and this was just one of
 
03:29:01.910 --> 03:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
the areas
 
03:29:05.750 --> 03:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
so sorry this tell us tell us a give us
 
03:29:10.870 --> 03:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
a a a story of a problem what what are
 
03:29:12.269 --> 03:29:12.279 align:start position:0%
we what is the problem we're trying to
 
03:29:15.229 --> 03:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
fix here so um I'll go back to my
 
03:29:17.110 --> 03:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
original so it's the current the current
 
03:29:18.630 --> 03:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
Law requires Health carriers to
 
03:29:20.389 --> 03:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
credential primary care physicians
 
03:29:22.309 --> 03:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
within 30 days of receiving an
 
03:29:24.790 --> 03:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
application in this bill would extend
 
03:29:26.550 --> 03:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
that requirement to mental health care
 
03:29:28.309 --> 03:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
providers so we already have something
 
03:29:30.110 --> 03:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
on statute where we said we understand
 
03:29:31.710 --> 03:29:31.720 align:start position:0%
that Health Care Providers can be within
 
03:29:34.750 --> 03:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
30 days but currently trying to remember
 
03:29:36.910 --> 03:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
how long it can take for mental health
 
03:29:38.269 --> 03:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
care providers but it's certainly not
 
03:29:39.910 --> 03:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
within those 30 days so we're wanting
 
03:29:42.389 --> 03:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
this to shrink this down to within 30
 
03:29:44.389 --> 03:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
days like it is for the other Healthcare
 
03:29:48.229 --> 03:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
practices so you want to mandate that
 
03:29:50.870 --> 03:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh because we we have this network
 
03:29:53.990 --> 03:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
adequacy statute that requires that
 
03:29:56.389 --> 03:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
health insurance companies have an
 
03:29:58.429 --> 03:29:58.439 align:start position:0%
adequate Network which often we've heard
 
03:30:00.550 --> 03:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
complaints that when it came to mental
 
03:30:03.990 --> 03:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
health that it wasn't well covered or
 
03:30:07.030 --> 03:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
there was some there but you're saying
 
03:30:10.389 --> 03:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
is that that the insurance company is
 
03:30:12.030 --> 03:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
dragging it feet and getting
 
03:30:14.269 --> 03:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
conventionally done for mental
 
03:30:19.229 --> 03:30:19.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:21.710 --> 03:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
sorry let me I'm just reading to make
 
03:30:28.110 --> 03:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
sure um so yes this is yes okay so yes
 
03:30:30.030 --> 03:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
great sorry thank you very much so we're
 
03:30:32.550 --> 03:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
all set perfect thanks don't go far stay
 
03:30:33.870 --> 03:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
right here in front don't go in the back
 
03:30:35.790 --> 03:30:35.800 align:start position:0%
of the room here stay close all right
 
03:30:37.150 --> 03:30:37.160 align:start position:0%
and if you really want to you can pull
 
03:30:38.830 --> 03:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
up a seat and have a
 
03:30:40.950 --> 03:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
microphone yeah because this is a work
 
03:30:43.309 --> 03:30:43.319 align:start position:0%
session um so I was now going to have
 
03:30:45.990 --> 03:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
the insurance department to tell us
 
03:30:47.790 --> 03:30:47.800 align:start position:0%
their interpretation of what this bill
 
03:30:52.630 --> 03:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:54.910 --> 03:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman members of
 
03:30:57.349 --> 03:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
the committee so depending on how
 
03:30:59.070 --> 03:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
efficient you want to be I can speak to
 
03:31:03.269 --> 03:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
both 507 and 706 let's just stick to one
 
03:31:06.670 --> 03:31:06.680 align:start position:0%
one at a time that's perfectly fine so I
 
03:31:09.030 --> 03:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
had originally testified on a house bill
 
03:31:12.750 --> 03:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
506 and my view was that section one of
 
03:31:17.349 --> 03:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
that bill 507 I'm sorry 507 so section
 
03:31:19.389 --> 03:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
one of House Bill
 
03:31:22.229 --> 03:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
507 is something that we support I
 
03:31:24.229 --> 03:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
supported as commissioner I think that
 
03:31:26.550 --> 03:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
is good to move forward I think anything
 
03:31:30.990 --> 03:31:31.000 align:start position:0%
that we can do to ease the pipeline of
 
03:31:33.670 --> 03:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
mental health providers into the system
 
03:31:35.870 --> 03:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
is something worthwhile we obviously
 
03:31:38.429 --> 03:31:38.439 align:start position:0%
have the demand and the need for it
 
03:31:39.910 --> 03:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
throughout the state so if there's
 
03:31:42.349 --> 03:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
something that we can do to ease that
 
03:31:44.189 --> 03:31:44.199 align:start position:0%
process that's something that we're in
 
03:31:46.469 --> 03:31:46.479 align:start position:0%
favor of going from
 
03:31:48.910 --> 03:31:48.920 align:start position:0%
uh 45 days which is what mental health
 
03:31:50.870 --> 03:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
providers are currently operating under
 
03:31:52.950 --> 03:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of being credentialed once
 
03:31:55.950 --> 03:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
there's a clean incomplete application
 
03:31:58.269 --> 03:31:58.279 align:start position:0%
to 30 I don't think is terribly
 
03:32:01.309 --> 03:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
disruptive to uh the industry and again
 
03:32:02.950 --> 03:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
could potentially be very helpful to
 
03:32:05.750 --> 03:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
getting more uh practitioners out there
 
03:32:08.469 --> 03:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
being able to serve the public the
 
03:32:11.030 --> 03:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
second half of the bill is something
 
03:32:13.110 --> 03:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
that we as a department want to continue
 
03:32:14.429 --> 03:32:14.439 align:start position:0%
to have a
 
03:32:18.110 --> 03:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
dialogue with the stakeholders on
 
03:32:20.110 --> 03:32:20.120 align:start position:0%
because what it seeks to do is to
 
03:32:23.110 --> 03:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
retroactively allow those individuals
 
03:32:24.910 --> 03:32:24.920 align:start position:0%
who are going through the credentialing
 
03:32:28.309 --> 03:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
process to be able to retroactively bill
 
03:32:30.670 --> 03:32:30.680 align:start position:0%
that seems straightforward the problem
 
03:32:34.870 --> 03:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
is that the way it practically works is
 
03:32:37.870 --> 03:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
that either credentialing happens first
 
03:32:41.070 --> 03:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
and then Contracting to get in network
 
03:32:44.389 --> 03:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
or the credentialing and the Contracting
 
03:32:47.189 --> 03:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
processes take place Sim simultaneously
 
03:32:50.110 --> 03:32:50.120 align:start position:0%
so the issue that comes up is all right
 
03:32:53.110 --> 03:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
you're credentialed within the 30 days
 
03:32:55.830 --> 03:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
you're good to go there but you have not
 
03:32:59.750 --> 03:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
yet reached agreement or come to terms
 
03:33:02.950 --> 03:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
on what your in network contracted rates
 
03:33:05.110 --> 03:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
are going to be so what do you
 
03:33:08.550 --> 03:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
retroactively build to and that's where
 
03:33:10.189 --> 03:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
there's still a little bit more work
 
03:33:12.349 --> 03:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done I'm not saying
 
03:33:14.269 --> 03:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
that there's not a good solution that
 
03:33:16.070 --> 03:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
could be brought to bear to deal with
 
03:33:18.469 --> 03:33:18.479 align:start position:0%
that issue it's just an issue that I
 
03:33:20.469 --> 03:33:20.479 align:start position:0%
think needs a little bit more discussion
 
03:33:22.110 --> 03:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
a little bit more attention a little bit
 
03:33:25.070 --> 03:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
more thinking through all of that which
 
03:33:26.870 --> 03:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
I'm committing to the committee and to
 
03:33:29.630 --> 03:33:29.640 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders that we will do over
 
03:33:33.030 --> 03:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
the course of the next year and very uh
 
03:33:35.150 --> 03:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
potentially very well likely there may
 
03:33:37.229 --> 03:33:37.239 align:start position:0%
be supplemental legislation to come
 
03:33:39.590 --> 03:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
before you all uh next year once we're
 
03:33:41.990 --> 03:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
fully hash that out so those are my
 
03:33:44.630 --> 03:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
thoughts on House Bill 507 okay
 
03:33:47.309 --> 03:33:47.319 align:start position:0%
represent spear this is this is not an
 
03:33:49.349 --> 03:33:49.359 align:start position:0%
early bill this bill is due on March
 
03:33:51.670 --> 03:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
20th correct is there a time to do
 
03:33:54.429 --> 03:33:54.439 align:start position:0%
something before March
 
03:33:56.870 --> 03:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
20th your rules are your rules it's got
 
03:33:59.030 --> 03:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
an FN so I don't know if it's an early
 
03:34:01.750 --> 03:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
bill or not not really I mean I've seen
 
03:34:04.229 --> 03:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
you do stuff
 
03:34:06.710 --> 03:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
overnight oh
 
03:34:11.150 --> 03:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
jeez okay I'm staying out of this so so
 
03:34:13.550 --> 03:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
here here yeah to just jog everybody's
 
03:34:17.389 --> 03:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
memory um so technically this bill has
 
03:34:20.710 --> 03:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
to be out of committee next Thursday a
 
03:34:22.870 --> 03:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
week from Thursday right is that correct
 
03:34:26.150 --> 03:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
my Mathes right about the
 
03:34:29.990 --> 03:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
20th did they
 
03:34:32.910 --> 03:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
12th so what that means is everything we
 
03:34:32.920 --> 03:34:34.229 align:start position:0%
12th so what that means is everything we
do

03:34:34.229 --> 03:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:34:36.790 --> 03:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
today uh if we want to amend it we have
 
03:34:38.150 --> 03:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
to figure out what the amendment's going
 
03:34:41.429 --> 03:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
to look like and we will take it up on
 
03:34:43.830 --> 03:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
Tuesday next
 
03:34:48.550 --> 03:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
week and then come Wednesday we'll
 
03:34:51.550 --> 03:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
execute so any amendments we do we want
 
03:34:54.469 --> 03:34:54.479 align:start position:0%
to make sure they're short and sweet and
 
03:34:57.870 --> 03:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
easy and I'm missing my researcher at
 
03:35:01.349 --> 03:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
the moment so and I I don't even have a
 
03:35:03.790 --> 03:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
copy of I have a copy of the bill so I
 
03:35:03.800 --> 03:35:04.550 align:start position:0%
copy of I have a copy of the bill so I
can

03:35:04.550 --> 03:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:35:07.070 --> 03:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
see so the most important part of the
 
03:35:09.030 --> 03:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
bill is getting them credentialed in 30
 
03:35:11.750 --> 03:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
days so my feeling is an easy Amendment
 
03:35:13.590 --> 03:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
would be to just take out section two
 
03:35:16.790 --> 03:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
there you go now see we that's why we
 
03:35:19.510 --> 03:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
have you in a seat with a
 
03:35:21.990 --> 03:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
microphone are you okay with that I
 
03:35:23.910 --> 03:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
think that would work um I would need to
 
03:35:25.309 --> 03:35:25.319 align:start position:0%
make sure but I think that's definitely
 
03:35:27.189 --> 03:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
doable okay all right thank you all
 
03:35:29.550 --> 03:35:29.560 align:start position:0%
right representative Burrows thanks I
 
03:35:31.229 --> 03:35:31.239 align:start position:0%
just have a quick question what's and I
 
03:35:32.670 --> 03:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
know we probably covered this what's the
 
03:35:35.110 --> 03:35:35.120 align:start position:0%
definition of a clean application so all
 
03:35:37.229 --> 03:35:37.239 align:start position:0%
of the information that the
 
03:35:39.990 --> 03:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
credentialing application calls for is
 
03:35:43.030 --> 03:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
fully completed all of the sections have
 
03:35:45.710 --> 03:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
the supporting documentation needed
 
03:35:48.349 --> 03:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
everything is in its proper order okay
 
03:35:50.510 --> 03:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
so that would include let's say and this
 
03:35:53.389 --> 03:35:53.399 align:start position:0%
happens somebody has a criminal record
 
03:35:55.229 --> 03:35:55.239 align:start position:0%
that would have been that's part of you
 
03:35:57.830 --> 03:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
know you that is absolutely one of the
 
03:36:04.309 --> 03:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:08.630 --> 03:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:12.389 --> 03:36:12.399 align:start position:0%
else I was going to get him up okay so
 
03:36:14.389 --> 03:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
uh the suggestion is that we just uh
 
03:36:18.429 --> 03:36:18.439 align:start position:0%
remove paragraph 2 to and leave the
 
03:36:20.870 --> 03:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
effective date to take 60 days after
 
03:36:25.710 --> 03:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:27.830 --> 03:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
fine maybe
 
03:36:32.590 --> 03:36:32.600 align:start position:0%
not you want to have a January 1
 
03:36:36.150 --> 03:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
okay I knew that was coming I just knew
 
03:36:37.349 --> 03:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
that was gonna
 
03:36:43.030 --> 03:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:46.630 --> 03:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
so all right
 
03:36:49.429 --> 03:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
all right so we
 
03:36:49.439 --> 03:36:52.630 align:start position:0%
all right so we
delete

03:36:52.630 --> 03:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:57.070 --> 03:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:57.080 --> 03:36:59.750 align:start position:0%
 
two

03:36:59.750 --> 03:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
two
 
03:37:02.189 --> 03:37:02.199 align:start position:0%
two uh
 
03:37:07.950 --> 03:37:07.960 align:start position:0%

1 20 26
 
03:37:18.269 --> 03:37:18.279 align:start position:0%
okay is that everyone in the room
 
03:37:19.830 --> 03:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
anybody have any other comments other
 
03:37:22.309 --> 03:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
than those two
 
03:37:24.429 --> 03:37:24.439 align:start position:0%
changes then we're all set thank you
 
03:37:24.439 --> 03:37:26.429 align:start position:0%
changes then we're all set thank you
very

03:37:26.429 --> 03:37:26.439 align:start position:0%
very
 
03:37:26.439 --> 03:37:28.229 align:start position:0%
very

03:37:53.309 --> 03:37:53.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:55.670 --> 03:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
um I guess I mean in terms of taking a
 
03:37:59.070 --> 03:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
straw vote right so I is there anybody
 
03:38:02.429 --> 03:38:02.439 align:start position:0%
have a problem with those those changes
 
03:38:05.790 --> 03:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
on but I'm back on 507 so we you just
 
03:38:08.790 --> 03:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
say we discussed a potential Amendment
 
03:38:11.630 --> 03:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
and and moving section two and changing
 
03:38:15.790 --> 03:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:17.950 --> 03:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
okay so speak now for more anybody have
 
03:38:23.950 --> 03:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:31.229 --> 03:38:31.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:34.389 --> 03:38:34.399 align:start position:0%
275 all
 
03:38:34.399 --> 03:38:36.269 align:start position:0%
275 all
right

03:38:36.269 --> 03:38:36.279 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:38:39.229 --> 03:38:39.239 align:start position:0%
uh is this your
 
03:38:43.110 --> 03:38:43.120 align:start position:0%
bill I I know you might find it hard to
 
03:38:46.550 --> 03:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
believe but I would lose my mind if I
 
03:38:51.550 --> 03:38:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:54.550 --> 03:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
numbers 7-Eleven I can do
 
03:38:57.150 --> 03:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
7-Eleven I can sell all health insurance
 
03:39:00.150 --> 03:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
goes goes back to 7-Eleven but after
 
03:39:03.229 --> 03:39:03.239 align:start position:0%
that boy if I start I like I can't
 
03:39:05.750 --> 03:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
remember build numbers so I my cheat
 
03:39:07.750 --> 03:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
sheet just so you know my little cheat
 
03:39:12.189 --> 03:39:12.199 align:start position:0%
sheet I pull out every Bill two key or
 
03:39:15.550 --> 03:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
three key words and that's how I run on
 
03:39:18.309 --> 03:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
it so this one is uh health insurance
 
03:39:18.319 --> 03:39:19.670 align:start position:0%
it so this one is uh health insurance
credential

03:39:19.670 --> 03:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
credential
 
03:39:22.070 --> 03:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
requirements which it just felt like I
 
03:39:25.030 --> 03:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
just did mental health credentialing
 
03:39:26.550 --> 03:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
well and now we're doing another
 
03:39:29.389 --> 03:39:29.399 align:start position:0%
credentialing bill so unlike uh mental
 
03:39:30.750 --> 03:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
health I think if more mental health
 
03:39:32.910 --> 03:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
workers return phone calls we'd have
 
03:39:36.070 --> 03:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
less problems but that's on a side note
 
03:39:39.990 --> 03:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
um we spoke about House Bill 275 I think
 
03:39:42.710 --> 03:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
it was last Thursday during or after
 
03:39:45.750 --> 03:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
Chambers or in on break and I I provided
 
03:39:47.750 --> 03:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
you with a letter from one doctor I have
 
03:39:50.750 --> 03:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
two more coming you had said where are
 
03:39:53.710 --> 03:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
the doctors in this and this one doctor
 
03:39:55.990 --> 03:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
who happens to be a colonel in the the
 
03:39:57.910 --> 03:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire National Guard but also
 
03:40:01.150 --> 03:40:01.160 align:start position:0%
an active physician gave a rather nice
 
03:40:03.510 --> 03:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
layout on the fact that he's got no time
 
03:40:05.189 --> 03:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
for this training that these uh
 
03:40:07.510 --> 03:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
insurance companies want him to do okay
 
03:40:09.750 --> 03:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
it takes away time with patience but it
 
03:40:12.710 --> 03:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
also increases the cost uh for his
 
03:40:15.750 --> 03:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
practice depending on how broad the
 
03:40:20.469 --> 03:40:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:23.469 --> 03:40:23.479 align:start position:0%
want so what was he trying to be and
 
03:40:26.830 --> 03:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
what and what was the uh course they
 
03:40:29.670 --> 03:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
wanted him to take well the one was with
 
03:40:32.110 --> 03:40:32.120 align:start position:0%
my dentist and I got an inquiry but the
 
03:40:34.750 --> 03:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
dentist they wanted all four locations
 
03:40:36.870 --> 03:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
that they have before they would be uh
 
03:40:40.670 --> 03:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
considered uh uh C certify certification
 
03:40:42.910 --> 03:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
with the insurance company to have all
 
03:40:45.750 --> 03:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
of their staff being trained on LGBT EQ
 
03:40:45.760 --> 03:40:47.309 align:start position:0%
of their staff being trained on LGBT EQ
plus

03:40:47.309 --> 03:40:47.319 align:start position:0%
plus
 
03:40:50.550 --> 03:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
training now I think everybody's teeth
 
03:40:52.349 --> 03:40:52.359 align:start position:0%
my dad was a dentist everybody's teeth
 
03:40:54.229 --> 03:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
are the same unless they fall out or
 
03:40:55.870 --> 03:40:55.880 align:start position:0%
there's a problem so I don't get that
 
03:40:59.110 --> 03:40:59.120 align:start position:0%
but anyway the the insurance company
 
03:41:02.110 --> 03:41:02.120 align:start position:0%
probably required it for their ESG score
 
03:41:04.590 --> 03:41:04.600 align:start position:0%
but it really goes further than
 
03:41:07.030 --> 03:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
that is if there's other training that
 
03:41:09.510 --> 03:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
these people have to have they have to
 
03:41:11.710 --> 03:41:11.720 align:start position:0%
pay for it if the insurance company want
 
03:41:15.830 --> 03:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
them to do it and uh they go through um
 
03:41:18.110 --> 03:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
undergrad they go through medical school
 
03:41:20.150 --> 03:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
they do residency they have to be board
 
03:41:22.349 --> 03:41:22.359 align:start position:0%
certified which all have courses and
 
03:41:24.349 --> 03:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
requirements and costs associated with
 
03:41:26.550 --> 03:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
it so now the insurance companies comes
 
03:41:28.349 --> 03:41:28.359 align:start position:0%
back and says well we want you to take
 
03:41:31.590 --> 03:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
this course well and and I know you
 
03:41:33.349 --> 03:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
folks are very concerned about the costs
 
03:41:36.110 --> 03:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
that insurance companies occur but if
 
03:41:38.550 --> 03:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
they want this course to be taken I view
 
03:41:41.510 --> 03:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
it as a cost of doing business and to
 
03:41:43.550 --> 03:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
and and actually to go one step further
 
03:41:44.950 --> 03:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
it's probably less expensive for the
 
03:41:47.389 --> 03:41:47.399 align:start position:0%
cons consumer because they'll be more
 
03:41:50.189 --> 03:41:50.199 align:start position:0%
insures to pass this cost that they want
 
03:41:52.229 --> 03:41:52.239 align:start position:0%
instead of just being on a physician or
 
03:41:54.189 --> 03:41:54.199 align:start position:0%
a dentist or any other health care
 
03:41:57.309 --> 03:41:57.319 align:start position:0%
provider so it's more than just the the
 
03:41:59.389 --> 03:41:59.399 align:start position:0%
example that I gave you it deals with
 
03:42:01.550 --> 03:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
the fact that these people don't have
 
03:42:03.229 --> 03:42:03.239 align:start position:0%
the time in the day how long does it
 
03:42:04.790 --> 03:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
take to get a doctor's appointment these
 
03:42:08.070 --> 03:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
days I mean I'm I'm five weeks out to
 
03:42:10.229 --> 03:42:10.239 align:start position:0%
get my back treated so I could walk
 
03:42:12.830 --> 03:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
without pain for the last two years five
 
03:42:14.910 --> 03:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
weeks for a procedure that's less than
 
03:42:18.870 --> 03:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
an hour hour so let's send the doctor to
 
03:42:21.229 --> 03:42:21.239 align:start position:0%
some training that may or may not have
 
03:42:23.189 --> 03:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
anything to do with his practice of
 
03:42:24.950 --> 03:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
medicine or
 
03:42:27.870 --> 03:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
Dentistry just because they want it fine
 
03:42:31.550 --> 03:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
pay for it that's all it's that
 
03:42:34.149 --> 03:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
simple nothing's that simple but yes
 
03:42:36.309 --> 03:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
representa spear one of the com one of
 
03:42:38.309 --> 03:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
the comments that we have is that the
 
03:42:41.269 --> 03:42:41.279 align:start position:0%
RSA that this thing is is in may not be
 
03:42:44.070 --> 03:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
the right RSA did we ever find out what
 
03:42:47.750 --> 03:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:51.349 --> 03:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
it Mr chairman can I uh add to that this
 
03:42:53.070 --> 03:42:53.080 align:start position:0%
is not a hearing this is a conversation
 
03:42:55.630 --> 03:42:55.640 align:start position:0%
oh okay well I talked I remembered that
 
03:42:57.469 --> 03:42:57.479 align:start position:0%
too officer representative and I went
 
03:42:59.550 --> 03:42:59.560 align:start position:0%
back down to OS and I talked to the
 
03:43:01.389 --> 03:43:01.399 align:start position:0%
person who drafted the bill and I
 
03:43:02.750 --> 03:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
thought she did a very good job in
 
03:43:05.429 --> 03:43:05.439 align:start position:0%
locating the credential uh she said no
 
03:43:07.349 --> 03:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
this whenever you credential a doctor It
 
03:43:09.870 --> 03:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
Gos into that statute I said okay well
 
03:43:11.550 --> 03:43:11.560 align:start position:0%
there was some concern in the committee
 
03:43:13.110 --> 03:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
but she reassured me that that's she
 
03:43:14.750 --> 03:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
said that's that's the right statute to
 
03:43:17.550 --> 03:43:17.560 align:start position:0%
where it go so um that was what their
 
03:43:19.510 --> 03:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
concern was and I think there was
 
03:43:22.070 --> 03:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
another concern about Obamacare and I
 
03:43:24.269 --> 03:43:24.279 align:start position:0%
think I sent all of you the example I
 
03:43:26.110 --> 03:43:26.120 align:start position:0%
gave you was adult Dentistry which
 
03:43:27.910 --> 03:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't fall under the Affordable Care
 
03:43:31.630 --> 03:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
Act pedi uh Pediatric Dentistry does but
 
03:43:33.590 --> 03:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
this really I don't really see this
 
03:43:35.389 --> 03:43:35.399 align:start position:0%
being Germaine if the insurance
 
03:43:38.349 --> 03:43:38.359 align:start position:0%
companies have to follow a specific
 
03:43:42.790 --> 03:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:45.630 --> 03:43:45.640 align:start position:0%
business or they could just simply say
 
03:43:48.349 --> 03:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
no we you you're not eligible to be in
 
03:43:50.750 --> 03:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
our Network and have a nice day and go
 
03:43:52.910 --> 03:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
find some other insurance but but again
 
03:43:56.149 --> 03:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman the patient then is the one
 
03:43:58.510 --> 03:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
who is yeah if you were if you're with
 
03:43:59.990 --> 03:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
an insurance company you change
 
03:44:03.349 --> 03:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
insurance and then there's a potential
 
03:44:05.389 --> 03:44:05.399 align:start position:0%
procedure being done and you're changing
 
03:44:06.830 --> 03:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and that new one
 
03:44:08.870 --> 03:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover them what do you do oh you
 
03:44:10.269 --> 03:44:10.279 align:start position:0%
got to get off the operating table
 
03:44:12.030 --> 03:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
because your insurance company wants me
 
03:44:14.670 --> 03:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
to have this training and okay I'm just
 
03:44:16.389 --> 03:44:16.399 align:start position:0%
saying hypothetically that's not that's
 
03:44:19.429 --> 03:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
not a good hypothetical no if
 
03:44:23.269 --> 03:44:23.279 align:start position:0%
if so I guess the the issue and maybe we
 
03:44:25.510 --> 03:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
can have the providers but but when I
 
03:44:29.229 --> 03:44:29.239 align:start position:0%
read this statute regardless of what you
 
03:44:30.790 --> 03:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
dropped in I'm just reading the actual
 
03:44:33.269 --> 03:44:33.279 align:start position:0%
statute sure it they have the health
 
03:44:35.469 --> 03:44:35.479 align:start position:0%
carriers credentialing verification
 
03:44:37.710 --> 03:44:37.720 align:start position:0%
standards so that means they require it
 
03:44:41.590 --> 03:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
of everyone not just this one doctor yes
 
03:44:43.550 --> 03:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
correct and standards and to prevent
 
03:44:45.269 --> 03:44:45.279 align:start position:0%
Health Care from utilizing separate
 
03:44:46.550 --> 03:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
additional criteria in selecting
 
03:44:48.429 --> 03:44:48.439 align:start position:0%
Healthcare professionals with whom it
 
03:44:51.750 --> 03:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
contracts so it has to have a standard
 
03:44:55.429 --> 03:44:55.439 align:start position:0%
set of criteria correct rules MH and
 
03:44:58.030 --> 03:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
that's they require that of everyone
 
03:44:58.040 --> 03:45:00.070 align:start position:0%
that's they require that of everyone
MH

03:45:00.070 --> 03:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
MH
 
03:45:02.110 --> 03:45:02.120 align:start position:0%
so if
 
03:45:06.670 --> 03:45:06.680 align:start position:0%
if XYZ health insurance company has a
 
03:45:06.680 --> 03:45:08.229 align:start position:0%
if XYZ health insurance company has a
requirement

03:45:08.229 --> 03:45:08.239 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
03:45:11.389 --> 03:45:11.399 align:start position:0%
that this other practice doesn't have
 
03:45:13.950 --> 03:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
you they either get it
 
03:45:17.510 --> 03:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
done or they just don't get take that
 
03:45:19.710 --> 03:45:19.720 align:start position:0%
insurance anymore well the implication
 
03:45:21.149 --> 03:45:21.159 align:start position:0%
here is they wouldn't take not you take
 
03:45:23.070 --> 03:45:23.080 align:start position:0%
it anymore you haven't been able to take
 
03:45:24.429 --> 03:45:24.439 align:start position:0%
it because you haven't been credential
 
03:45:26.189 --> 03:45:26.199 align:start position:0%
to to begin with right but the
 
03:45:28.349 --> 03:45:28.359 align:start position:0%
credentialing from this point for would
 
03:45:30.149 --> 03:45:30.159 align:start position:0%
be something over and above the normal
 
03:45:31.950 --> 03:45:31.960 align:start position:0%
credentialing process for example I
 
03:45:34.030 --> 03:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
don't see that I what I read in here is
 
03:45:35.630 --> 03:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
that that that they can they have to
 
03:45:35.640 --> 03:45:36.429 align:start position:0%
that that that they can they have to
have

03:45:36.429 --> 03:45:36.439 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:45:40.269 --> 03:45:40.279 align:start position:0%
standards and and that's it sure think
 
03:45:43.349 --> 03:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
anander sure it also says that the
 
03:45:45.269 --> 03:45:45.279 align:start position:0%
carrier will be responsible for paying
 
03:45:47.950 --> 03:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
for it that's that's the bold face
 
03:45:49.710 --> 03:45:49.720 align:start position:0%
that's the that's his that's that's the
 
03:45:51.910 --> 03:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
new I'm I'm looking at the in the
 
03:45:54.670 --> 03:45:54.680 align:start position:0%
regular print that's the the current law
 
03:45:56.510 --> 03:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
and the current law I just don't
 
03:45:58.590 --> 03:45:58.600 align:start position:0%
understand you know what the problem
 
03:46:02.790 --> 03:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
being is if if he's now chosen your
 
03:46:06.110 --> 03:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
physician this dentist EV or a physician
 
03:46:10.389 --> 03:46:10.399 align:start position:0%
okay or a physician yeah and that um and
 
03:46:13.189 --> 03:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
it's not the the physician's practice
 
03:46:15.590 --> 03:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
has never been in had this insurance
 
03:46:18.070 --> 03:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
company before no that's not true well
 
03:46:20.469 --> 03:46:20.479 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm saying is so did did
 
03:46:24.149 --> 03:46:24.159 align:start position:0%
that the company changed their standard
 
03:46:26.189 --> 03:46:26.199 align:start position:0%
their criteria CR they changed their
 
03:46:28.309 --> 03:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
criteria y so on the in the middle of
 
03:46:30.670 --> 03:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
the game they they said oh by the way we
 
03:46:33.710 --> 03:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
now require this correct and you're
 
03:46:35.349 --> 03:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
saying that's fine but they should pay
 
03:46:37.349 --> 03:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
for it exactly and the representative
 
03:46:38.790 --> 03:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
over here said her hands up and I don't
 
03:46:41.309 --> 03:46:41.319 align:start position:0%
want to interrupt her yes okay
 
03:46:41.319 --> 03:46:42.630 align:start position:0%
want to interrupt her yes okay
representative

03:46:42.630 --> 03:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:46:44.910 --> 03:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you um was there any
 
03:46:47.110 --> 03:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
anything further you wanted to say okay
 
03:46:49.189 --> 03:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:46:53.429 --> 03:46:53.439 align:start position:0%
um okay this bill um requires that if
 
03:46:56.149 --> 03:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
there's additional uh credentials
 
03:46:58.389 --> 03:46:58.399 align:start position:0%
required by the insurance company
 
03:47:01.070 --> 03:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
presumably something beyond their
 
03:47:03.630 --> 03:47:03.640 align:start position:0%
standard credentials or beyond what they
 
03:47:06.510 --> 03:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
required when the physician originally
 
03:47:09.189 --> 03:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
signed up with the insurance company um
 
03:47:10.630 --> 03:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
the insurance company would have to pay
 
03:47:13.389 --> 03:47:13.399 align:start position:0%
for it correct so that would solve your
 
03:47:18.550 --> 03:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
payment problem but but it it appears um
 
03:47:21.910 --> 03:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
that it would not solve the time problem
 
03:47:24.189 --> 03:47:24.199 align:start position:0%
the time needed for all for the
 
03:47:25.910 --> 03:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
physician and all the physician's
 
03:47:28.070 --> 03:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
employees who attend the training
 
03:47:29.870 --> 03:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
correct so could you elaborate on that a
 
03:47:32.510 --> 03:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
little bit well my fa my late father was
 
03:47:34.630 --> 03:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
an orthodontist so I know what it's like
 
03:47:38.510 --> 03:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
for a professional and their time um and
 
03:47:41.030 --> 03:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
I'm lucky because my physician a lots me
 
03:47:45.189 --> 03:47:45.199 align:start position:0%
time even calls me back so um but uh
 
03:47:47.550 --> 03:47:47.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's a hard one to I mean that's
 
03:47:49.269 --> 03:47:49.279 align:start position:0%
one of the decisions like going back to
 
03:47:51.269 --> 03:47:51.279 align:start position:0%
the dentist they had four locations they
 
03:47:54.550 --> 03:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
would had to train all four locations
 
03:47:57.030 --> 03:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
and the the impact of their business
 
03:48:00.070 --> 03:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
would be hard to Fathom I mean so are
 
03:48:01.870 --> 03:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
you recommending an amendment to this
 
03:48:04.469 --> 03:48:04.479 align:start position:0%
bill to cover the time issues I'm not
 
03:48:06.309 --> 03:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying is that that let the
 
03:48:07.830 --> 03:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
insurance companies paid for whatever
 
03:48:10.750 --> 03:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
the cost of the the education
 
03:48:16.030 --> 03:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
is thank you thank you may may I ask
 
03:48:18.510 --> 03:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
the nature of these trainings that they
 
03:48:20.510 --> 03:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
require can can you elaborate on the
 
03:48:21.590 --> 03:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
nature of these training that they
 
03:48:24.550 --> 03:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
require you besides the standard well I
 
03:48:26.870 --> 03:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
I just used the example of what my
 
03:48:29.389 --> 03:48:29.399 align:start position:0%
dentist had been through but I'm sure
 
03:48:31.149 --> 03:48:31.159 align:start position:0%
there's other demands placed on healthc
 
03:48:33.950 --> 03:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
care providers too and and if you read
 
03:48:37.269 --> 03:48:37.279 align:start position:0%
the letter from uh Dr Kelly I mean it
 
03:48:38.630 --> 03:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
basically says that he doesn't have
 
03:48:41.229 --> 03:48:41.239 align:start position:0%
enough time to do this but if it's
 
03:48:43.269 --> 03:48:43.279 align:start position:0%
required for him to do it from is it
 
03:48:45.269 --> 03:48:45.279 align:start position:0%
mostly administrative in nature most
 
03:48:47.990 --> 03:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh requiring to adhere to protocol or
 
03:48:49.110 --> 03:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
what what what's the nature of these
 
03:48:50.990 --> 03:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
training they require when I asked him
 
03:48:52.870 --> 03:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
about additional training he said that
 
03:48:54.790 --> 03:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
when they become board certified
 
03:48:56.070 --> 03:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
addition there's some additional
 
03:48:58.229 --> 03:48:58.239 align:start position:0%
training but that's part of his ability
 
03:49:00.269 --> 03:49:00.279 align:start position:0%
to become a physician in whatever
 
03:49:03.349 --> 03:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
specialty is okay like Cardiology or or
 
03:49:05.110 --> 03:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
you know neurology or whatever the case
 
03:49:08.189 --> 03:49:08.199 align:start position:0%
may be um I just don't want an insurance
 
03:49:09.670 --> 03:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
company to tell our healthc care
 
03:49:10.710 --> 03:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
providers that they have to have
 
03:49:13.189 --> 03:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
training before and insured like any of
 
03:49:16.309 --> 03:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
us can go go to your doctor your dentist
 
03:49:18.349 --> 03:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
or whatever because they want that
 
03:49:20.630 --> 03:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
coverage you know and it's funny too is
 
03:49:23.469 --> 03:49:23.479 align:start position:0%
I remember Mr chairman is you hate
 
03:49:25.469 --> 03:49:25.479 align:start position:0%
putting additional requirements on
 
03:49:27.590 --> 03:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
insurance companies because it then puts
 
03:49:29.670 --> 03:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
more cost to everybody else that gets
 
03:49:32.349 --> 03:49:32.359 align:start position:0%
Insurance well this is the opposite this
 
03:49:34.149 --> 03:49:34.159 align:start position:0%
is the insurance companies doing
 
03:49:37.110 --> 03:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
mandates trying to tell the doctors what
 
03:49:40.349 --> 03:49:40.359 align:start position:0%
to do so and let the doctors pay for it
 
03:49:42.229 --> 03:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
instead of them that's exactly what's
 
03:49:43.830 --> 03:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
happening it's the exact opposite what
 
03:49:46.110 --> 03:49:46.120 align:start position:0%
you don't like to see so what's the
 
03:49:47.149 --> 03:49:47.159 align:start position:0%
reasoning I mean there must some
 
03:49:48.830 --> 03:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
reasoning the insurance company gives to
 
03:49:50.910 --> 03:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
you what is the reasoning behind the
 
03:49:52.429 --> 03:49:52.439 align:start position:0%
insurance company then they Pro they ask
 
03:49:55.110 --> 03:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
you to adhere to those additional
 
03:49:57.670 --> 03:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
trainings ad I'm sorry adhere to what is
 
03:49:59.110 --> 03:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
the reasoning Behind These additional
 
03:50:00.389 --> 03:50:00.399 align:start position:0%
training that the insurance company
 
03:50:03.149 --> 03:50:03.159 align:start position:0%
tells you to do it I can't speak for the
 
03:50:05.149 --> 03:50:05.159 align:start position:0%
insurance company like the one the one
 
03:50:06.950 --> 03:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
with a dentist must have been for their
 
03:50:09.550 --> 03:50:09.560 align:start position:0%
ESG score to make sure that they are you
 
03:50:12.950 --> 03:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
know capable and Avail doing what they
 
03:50:16.590 --> 03:50:16.600 align:start position:0%
think is is socially right
 
03:50:18.189 --> 03:50:18.199 align:start position:0%
can we get the insurance companies to
 
03:50:19.710 --> 03:50:19.720 align:start position:0%
tell us a little bit about what kind of
 
03:50:23.830 --> 03:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:26.830 --> 03:50:26.840 align:start position:0%
require just just generically to respond
 
03:50:28.469 --> 03:50:28.479 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter what kind of training
 
03:50:31.950 --> 03:50:31.960 align:start position:0%
it is it just just wait wait wait wait
 
03:50:33.950 --> 03:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
wait in other words to to be a physician
 
03:50:35.149 --> 03:50:35.159 align:start position:0%
in this state there's certain
 
03:50:37.269 --> 03:50:37.279 align:start position:0%
requirements there there's undergrad
 
03:50:39.149 --> 03:50:39.159 align:start position:0%
there's medical school there's
 
03:50:44.070 --> 03:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
residency is Pixie Dust um protol that's
 
03:50:47.110 --> 03:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
a doorbell that's a doorbell yeah the
 
03:50:49.429 --> 03:50:49.439 align:start position:0%
the uh so so there there's a host of
 
03:50:51.790 --> 03:50:51.800 align:start position:0%
Education that these people go through
 
03:50:54.110 --> 03:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
um but the point that I'm trying to make
 
03:50:56.590 --> 03:50:56.600 align:start position:0%
is is regardless of what the educational
 
03:50:58.269 --> 03:50:58.279 align:start position:0%
requirement they have if they're
 
03:51:01.349 --> 03:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
requiring a certified physician or a
 
03:51:03.790 --> 03:51:03.800 align:start position:0%
dentist that has gone through oplc by
 
03:51:07.110 --> 03:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
the way which is its own challenge um
 
03:51:10.510 --> 03:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
then U then if they want it they should
 
03:51:13.349 --> 03:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
pay for it that's it we got it you've
 
03:51:16.030 --> 03:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
said it three times so we got it have a
 
03:51:18.389 --> 03:51:18.399 align:start position:0%
seat over here please well you want to
 
03:51:19.870 --> 03:51:19.880 align:start position:0%
ask you're going to ask a question go
 
03:51:24.030 --> 03:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
ahead is it your position that um if the
 
03:51:25.990 --> 03:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
insurance companies are are required to
 
03:51:29.590 --> 03:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
pay for the training that that might um
 
03:51:32.189 --> 03:51:32.199 align:start position:0%
discourage them from making additional
 
03:51:34.790 --> 03:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
requirements that might not be directly
 
03:51:37.630 --> 03:51:37.640 align:start position:0%
relevant to the practice of medicine or
 
03:51:40.229 --> 03:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
Dentistry one would hope that yes that
 
03:51:41.950 --> 03:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
that would be a great way of putting it
 
03:51:45.469 --> 03:51:45.479 align:start position:0%
yes thank you oh thank you okay John can
 
03:51:47.349 --> 03:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
I just say something quick yes yes thank
 
03:51:50.229 --> 03:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
you you know we can't vote on something
 
03:51:51.550 --> 03:51:51.560 align:start position:0%
like this unless we know what the
 
03:51:54.990 --> 03:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
training is about any I agree no no but
 
03:51:56.910 --> 03:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
but that that that's not good enough to
 
03:51:59.750 --> 03:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
say any I need to know what it
 
03:52:03.950 --> 03:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
is yeah okay so let me let me humor you
 
03:52:05.309 --> 03:52:05.319 align:start position:0%
before we get too far we get the
 
03:52:09.030 --> 03:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
insurance companies is as I further read
 
03:52:09.040 --> 03:52:10.429 align:start position:0%
insurance companies is as I further read
this

03:52:10.429 --> 03:52:10.439 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:52:13.630 --> 03:52:13.640 align:start position:0%
paragraph I will start with the very
 
03:52:16.870 --> 03:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
first phas phrase and I say this only
 
03:52:18.670 --> 03:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
because Jack you were saying how about
 
03:52:21.870 --> 03:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
what I don't like okay with this
 
03:52:24.030 --> 03:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
paragraph if I read it
 
03:52:28.309 --> 03:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
correctly is is uh saying is the health
 
03:52:30.189 --> 03:52:30.199 align:start position:0%
insurance company has the right to say
 
03:52:33.990 --> 03:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
we don't want you as a
 
03:52:38.710 --> 03:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
physician okay and that if just because
 
03:52:41.830 --> 03:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
they have met the standards in their
 
03:52:45.550 --> 03:52:45.560 align:start position:0%
plan doesn't mean they have to take you
 
03:52:47.790 --> 03:52:47.800 align:start position:0%
in that's what I read the first sentence
 
03:52:50.790 --> 03:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
to say there it has a very famous word
 
03:52:54.229 --> 03:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
for us in this committee
 
03:52:57.630 --> 03:52:57.640 align:start position:0%
solely and solely is a very important
 
03:53:02.070 --> 03:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
insurance criteria because it means that
 
03:53:04.750 --> 03:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
that just because one thing may be true
 
03:53:06.950 --> 03:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
it does not mean the whole thing can't
 
03:53:09.950 --> 03:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
be true well I I so I can see why
 
03:53:12.269 --> 03:53:12.279 align:start position:0%
someone would say that adding this
 
03:53:14.790 --> 03:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
little sentence on here onto something
 
03:53:16.349 --> 03:53:16.359 align:start position:0%
about whether they're willing to accept
 
03:53:19.870 --> 03:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
you or not into their their practice is
 
03:53:22.269 --> 03:53:22.279 align:start position:0%
problematic well then I go over here and
 
03:53:25.110 --> 03:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
I look at the FIS the uh fiscal note
 
03:53:27.910 --> 03:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
here and the department says oh by the
 
03:53:27.920 --> 03:53:29.990 align:start position:0%
here and the department says oh by the
way

03:53:29.990 --> 03:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
way
 
03:53:30.000 --> 03:53:31.550 align:start position:0%
way
any

03:53:31.550 --> 03:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:53:34.429 --> 03:53:34.439 align:start position:0%
any additional Health Care uh additional
 
03:53:37.389 --> 03:53:37.399 align:start position:0%
program or certification it says well
 
03:53:41.110 --> 03:53:41.120 align:start position:0%
how who's to Define that who knows what
 
03:53:44.990 --> 03:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
which one is any okay and as you just
 
03:53:48.429 --> 03:53:48.439 align:start position:0%
had with with representative Burrows
 
03:53:51.070 --> 03:53:51.080 align:start position:0%
well you know come on are they asking
 
03:53:52.950 --> 03:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
something that's like oh and above
 
03:53:55.070 --> 03:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
totally inappropriate are they asking
 
03:53:56.469 --> 03:53:56.479 align:start position:0%
something that really is a new
 
03:53:58.630 --> 03:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
credential that they now require of all
 
03:54:01.790 --> 03:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
their patients other Physicians
 
03:54:02.830 --> 03:54:02.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully I'll be able remember the
 
03:54:04.309 --> 03:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
three question let me share a word with
 
03:54:06.389 --> 03:54:06.399 align:start position:0%
you that we have on the labor committee
 
03:54:07.590 --> 03:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
it's called
 
03:54:09.309 --> 03:54:09.319 align:start position:0%
discrimination in other words these
 
03:54:12.269 --> 03:54:12.279 align:start position:0%
people are licensed by the state okay
 
03:54:14.389 --> 03:54:14.399 align:start position:0%
they go through it education process
 
03:54:16.630 --> 03:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
they go through residency and ultimately
 
03:54:19.750 --> 03:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
the oplc provides them with a license to
 
03:54:21.550 --> 03:54:21.560 align:start position:0%
become a physician a dentist or whatever
 
03:54:24.950 --> 03:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
the case so they're all qualified okay
 
03:54:26.790 --> 03:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
so if what you're saying is true is that
 
03:54:28.429 --> 03:54:28.439 align:start position:0%
then the insurance companies are picking
 
03:54:30.349 --> 03:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
and choosing who they're having on their
 
03:54:32.550 --> 03:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
plan someone could argue the fact that
 
03:54:34.790 --> 03:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
because they didn't want to take that
 
03:54:36.149 --> 03:54:36.159 align:start position:0%
course that they are discriminating
 
03:54:38.670 --> 03:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
against however this bill says well if
 
03:54:40.469 --> 03:54:40.479 align:start position:0%
they want them to take their course then
 
03:54:43.149 --> 03:54:43.159 align:start position:0%
they will pay for it okay okay so hate
 
03:54:45.389 --> 03:54:45.399 align:start position:0%
to tell you this but health insurance is
 
03:54:46.550 --> 03:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
all about
 
03:54:49.469 --> 03:54:49.479 align:start position:0%
discriminating okay the Managed Care
 
03:54:52.710 --> 03:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
model was built around who was going to
 
03:54:55.070 --> 03:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
be in the network and who is not correct
 
03:54:56.670 --> 03:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
that you could direct that you're going
 
03:54:58.510 --> 03:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
to set up the
 
03:55:02.189 --> 03:55:02.199 align:start position:0%
premiums the payments to that provider
 
03:55:04.030 --> 03:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
based upon the amount of volume you're
 
03:55:06.750 --> 03:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
going to send that patient that doctor
 
03:55:09.229 --> 03:55:09.239 align:start position:0%
okay and so yes there's absolutely just
 
03:55:12.710 --> 03:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
we hear it all the time that some uh
 
03:55:16.349 --> 03:55:16.359 align:start position:0%
position some providers can't get in the
 
03:55:19.550 --> 03:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
network chairman can I make a comment
 
03:55:23.110 --> 03:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
can I can I make a comment on the so as
 
03:55:26.349 --> 03:55:26.359 align:start position:0%
with any profession as the time goes by
 
03:55:28.910 --> 03:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
the requirements and protocols do evolve
 
03:55:31.229 --> 03:55:31.239 align:start position:0%
and keep changing so unless we know the
 
03:55:33.349 --> 03:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
details of what kind of training this
 
03:55:35.630 --> 03:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
insurance company are mandating and
 
03:55:38.550 --> 03:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
what's the reason behind that uh I don't
 
03:55:40.870 --> 03:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
think we have enough information to to
 
03:55:42.630 --> 03:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
even go further that who should pick up
 
03:55:45.309 --> 03:55:45.319 align:start position:0%
the tab or it shouldn't because it have
 
03:55:47.710 --> 03:55:47.720 align:start position:0%
because it might be required for
 
03:55:50.269 --> 03:55:50.279 align:start position:0%
conducting business in a in a in a in a
 
03:55:52.110 --> 03:55:52.120 align:start position:0%
current environment that they they
 
03:55:55.070 --> 03:55:55.080 align:start position:0%
required so that would be my comment I
 
03:55:58.710 --> 03:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
03:56:01.309 --> 03:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
yes I don't know
 
03:56:06.070 --> 03:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
if the requirement for various extra
 
03:56:08.469 --> 03:56:08.479 align:start position:0%
over and above training especially some
 
03:56:10.349 --> 03:56:10.359 align:start position:0%
of the training that's been mentioned
 
03:56:12.590 --> 03:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
ever came from the state of New
 
03:56:15.030 --> 03:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as opposed to the federal
 
03:56:16.510 --> 03:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
government down on
 
03:56:19.070 --> 03:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
Medicare we have no regulations that we
 
03:56:21.030 --> 03:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
can do on Medicare requirements or
 
03:56:22.750 --> 03:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
anything like that
 
03:56:26.750 --> 03:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
so we has New Hampshire can we find out
 
03:56:28.429 --> 03:56:28.439 align:start position:0%
that has New Hampshire ever put anything
 
03:56:33.550 --> 03:56:33.560 align:start position:0%
like this on anybody okay so
 
03:56:38.189 --> 03:56:38.199 align:start position:0%
um yeah so before I go uh uh
 
03:56:41.030 --> 03:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
DJ you guys recommend retaining this
 
03:56:43.030 --> 03:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
bill is that is do I have my notes
 
03:56:46.229 --> 03:56:46.239 align:start position:0%
correct on this no different different
 
03:56:48.110 --> 03:56:48.120 align:start position:0%
belill okay this is a different Bel but
 
03:56:50.189 --> 03:56:50.199 align:start position:0%
I can speak quickly on okay all right
 
03:56:52.189 --> 03:56:52.199 align:start position:0%
this is the legal council this is the
 
03:56:53.710 --> 03:56:53.720 align:start position:0%
legal council for the insurance
 
03:56:56.070 --> 03:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
department okay so Michelle Heaton
 
03:56:58.469 --> 03:56:58.479 align:start position:0%
director of life and health um when we
 
03:57:01.110 --> 03:57:01.120 align:start position:0%
had testified on us on this previously
 
03:57:02.870 --> 03:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
we raised the concern that the way it's
 
03:57:05.710 --> 03:57:05.720 align:start position:0%
drafted is extremely Broad and it could
 
03:57:07.510 --> 03:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
include anything from any kind of
 
03:57:10.229 --> 03:57:10.239 align:start position:0%
continuing education we also pointed out
 
03:57:13.990 --> 03:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
that um it has always been the process
 
03:57:16.309 --> 03:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
that the carrier determines what their
 
03:57:18.070 --> 03:57:18.080 align:start position:0%
credentialing standards are those are
 
03:57:21.030 --> 03:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
all usually above licensing requirements
 
03:57:23.389 --> 03:57:23.399 align:start position:0%
which is the bare minimum so it's up to
 
03:57:25.670 --> 03:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
them to figure out what they wanted each
 
03:57:27.070 --> 03:57:27.080 align:start position:0%
company can choose their own and they
 
03:57:28.510 --> 03:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
can apply whatever they want and I think
 
03:57:31.389 --> 03:57:31.399 align:start position:0%
in T I would just um punt it over to the
 
03:57:33.389 --> 03:57:33.399 align:start position:0%
carriers now but I believe in testimony
 
03:57:35.389 --> 03:57:35.399 align:start position:0%
we did hear some testimony particularly
 
03:57:37.990 --> 03:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
from Sabrina if she's here about this
 
03:57:41.590 --> 03:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
particular issue and um the example that
 
03:57:43.950 --> 03:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
was I do remember that okay so rever G
 
03:57:45.510 --> 03:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
giv do you have a question for the
 
03:57:46.950 --> 03:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
insurance department or would you want
 
03:57:49.349 --> 03:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
to make it to an insurance company more
 
03:57:51.510 --> 03:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
a question for you actually Mr chair
 
03:57:56.349 --> 03:57:56.359 align:start position:0%
okay um okay I understand the um idea of
 
03:57:58.910 --> 03:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
hearing from the insurance company about
 
03:58:01.229 --> 03:58:01.239 align:start position:0%
what kind of training or whatever they
 
03:58:04.469 --> 03:58:04.479 align:start position:0%
require but they're all as was just said
 
03:58:06.349 --> 03:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
they're all private companies and they
 
03:58:09.830 --> 03:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
can all decide for themselves right and
 
03:58:11.670 --> 03:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
very I mean I'm sure they're not all
 
03:58:13.630 --> 03:58:13.640 align:start position:0%
identical so are we going to call them
 
03:58:16.950 --> 03:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
all in how can we handle that uh well we
 
03:58:20.670 --> 03:58:20.680 align:start position:0%
only have three but so but uh uh at this
 
03:58:22.590 --> 03:58:22.600 align:start position:0%
point um there are more than willing to
 
03:58:24.389 --> 03:58:24.399 align:start position:0%
tell you why they don't like this bill
 
03:58:26.790 --> 03:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
so I guess what I want to weed out is
 
03:58:26.800 --> 03:58:27.830 align:start position:0%
so I guess what I want to weed out is
other

03:58:27.830 --> 03:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:58:30.910 --> 03:58:30.920 align:start position:0%
than the sponsor is there anybody in the
 
03:58:32.670 --> 03:58:32.680 align:start position:0%
committee that's really interested in
 
03:58:34.590 --> 03:58:34.600 align:start position:0%
knowing whether we should keep going
 
03:58:36.269 --> 03:58:36.279 align:start position:0%
down this path of this bill and learning
 
03:58:40.710 --> 03:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
more about it or are we ready to uh kill
 
03:58:46.750 --> 03:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
it um represent can I raise a what if so
 
03:58:50.269 --> 03:58:50.279 align:start position:0%
what if a a new procedure uh for I don't
 
03:58:53.630 --> 03:58:53.640 align:start position:0%
know for treating the heart came uh came
 
03:58:57.229 --> 03:58:57.239 align:start position:0%
on y wouldn't an insurance company
 
03:59:00.790 --> 03:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
say wouldn't it be allowed to say to a
 
03:59:03.510 --> 03:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
physician um in order for you to do this
 
03:59:05.349 --> 03:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
procedure we want to make sure that
 
03:59:08.110 --> 03:59:08.120 align:start position:0%
you've got this additional training
 
03:59:10.149 --> 03:59:10.159 align:start position:0%
would that be unfair for the insurance
 
03:59:12.149 --> 03:59:12.159 align:start position:0%
company to ask that what most insurance
 
03:59:13.590 --> 03:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
company would say is we're not going to
 
03:59:15.030 --> 03:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
pay for it
 
03:59:17.670 --> 03:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
to new procedures however if you have an
 
03:59:19.110 --> 03:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
issue with Mr chairman if you have an
 
03:59:22.349 --> 03:59:22.359 align:start position:0%
issue with the uh language of the the
 
03:59:24.349 --> 03:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
bill itself so where it could be
 
03:59:27.110 --> 03:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
incorporated in the existing credential
 
03:59:28.510 --> 03:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
I'd be more than happy to talk to you
 
03:59:30.590 --> 03:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
about that and say we can but um you're
 
03:59:31.950 --> 03:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
going to have to save that for another
 
03:59:34.750 --> 03:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
year because basically the issue the
 
03:59:37.349 --> 03:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
issue here is this the language of this
 
03:59:38.830 --> 03:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
amendment the way you've written the way
 
03:59:40.950 --> 03:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
the Bill's written right um when you
 
03:59:44.469 --> 03:59:44.479 align:start position:0%
start if you get Beyond any additional
 
03:59:45.750 --> 03:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
and then you're going to try to figure
 
03:59:47.950 --> 03:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
out some language about what was the
 
03:59:50.110 --> 03:59:50.120 align:start position:0%
rationale for the insurance company to
 
03:59:52.830 --> 03:59:52.840 align:start position:0%
add for this different credentialing
 
03:59:55.110 --> 03:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
standard I think one of the what I'm
 
03:59:56.670 --> 03:59:56.680 align:start position:0%
just hearing from all the committee
 
03:59:58.910 --> 03:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
members is that the insurance companies
 
04:00:01.950 --> 04:00:01.960 align:start position:0%
are are free to set their standards and
 
04:00:03.269 --> 04:00:03.279 align:start position:0%
set what they want to make their
 
04:00:05.870 --> 04:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
requirements to be and so therefore why
 
04:00:07.990 --> 04:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
would you step why would we step into
 
04:00:10.950 --> 04:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out referee which ones
 
04:00:12.469 --> 04:00:12.479 align:start position:0%
they should pay
 
04:00:15.750 --> 04:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
for uh or which ones they they just say
 
04:00:17.630 --> 04:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
they think you should have it because
 
04:00:19.229 --> 04:00:19.239 align:start position:0%
the doctors only have so much time in
 
04:00:21.630 --> 04:00:21.640 align:start position:0%
the day that is not a good excuse I'm
 
04:00:24.030 --> 04:00:24.040 align:start position:0%
sorry so when all Physicians have to do
 
04:00:26.110 --> 04:00:26.120 align:start position:0%
continue education I got that okay and
 
04:00:27.750 --> 04:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
it's usually for betterment of their
 
04:00:30.469 --> 04:00:30.479 align:start position:0%
their practice but I'm just saying it at
 
04:00:32.110 --> 04:00:32.120 align:start position:0%
what point in time do we say enough is
 
04:00:34.189 --> 04:00:34.199 align:start position:0%
enough too because I don't want to wait
 
04:00:35.429 --> 04:00:35.439 align:start position:0%
for a
 
04:00:38.950 --> 04:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
doctor I it's not us to say uncle it's
 
04:00:41.550 --> 04:00:41.560 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies to decide what
 
04:00:43.189 --> 04:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
they think is appropriate and what is
 
04:00:43.199 --> 04:00:46.630 align:start position:0%
they think is appropriate and what is
not

04:00:46.630 --> 04:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:48.630 --> 04:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
oh yes yes
 
04:00:51.790 --> 04:00:51.800 align:start position:0%
okay that's a good excuse at least it
 
04:00:53.750 --> 04:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
was your name and not some slang word
 
04:00:55.630 --> 04:00:55.640 align:start position:0%
that I've heard my
 
04:00:58.309 --> 04:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
name thank you um Sabrina Dunlap senior
 
04:00:59.469 --> 04:00:59.479 align:start position:0%
director of government relations for
 
04:01:01.670 --> 04:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
Anthem I just wanted to refresh memories
 
04:01:03.309 --> 04:01:03.319 align:start position:0%
because this was a while ago the
 
04:01:05.070 --> 04:01:05.080 align:start position:0%
anecdote that was used when the bill was
 
04:01:07.670 --> 04:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
introduced involved uh an Anthem
 
04:01:10.070 --> 04:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage plan and a contractor
 
04:01:13.070 --> 04:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
that we contracted with who administered
 
04:01:15.229 --> 04:01:15.239 align:start position:0%
a basic training that was required under
 
04:01:17.510 --> 04:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
federal law they were following CMS
 
04:01:19.309 --> 04:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
guidelines so I just want to be very
 
04:01:21.870 --> 04:01:21.880 align:start position:0%
clear that that's what was discussed
 
04:01:23.910 --> 04:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
originally with the hearing that was the
 
04:01:26.950 --> 04:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
basis for the bill apparently um and so
 
04:01:28.269 --> 04:01:28.279 align:start position:0%
I just want to be clear we're sort of
 
04:01:30.510 --> 04:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
talking about one thing over here but
 
04:01:32.790 --> 04:01:32.800 align:start position:0%
the bill was based on not even an
 
04:01:35.070 --> 04:01:35.080 align:start position:0%
insurance company it was a contractor
 
04:01:36.429 --> 04:01:36.439 align:start position:0%
that we used in the Medicare Advantage
 
04:01:38.429 --> 04:01:38.439 align:start position:0%
space in the dental space that was
 
04:01:41.469 --> 04:01:41.479 align:start position:0%
simply following CMS rules and it was
 
04:01:43.349 --> 04:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
around culturally and linguistically
 
04:01:45.870 --> 04:01:45.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate services to make people feel
 
04:01:47.590 --> 04:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
more comfortable in the office something
 
04:01:49.870 --> 04:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
like that so I just wanted to level set
 
04:01:52.070 --> 04:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
that that's what we were talking
 
04:01:55.030 --> 04:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
about thank you for the opportunity to
 
04:01:57.710 --> 04:01:57.720 align:start position:0%

04:03:12.189 --> 04:03:12.199 align:start position:0%
question before
 
04:03:17.790 --> 04:03:17.800 align:start position:0%

Cole's Cole's missing yeah okay so it's
 
04:03:22.950 --> 04:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
six six zip so what is your question
 
04:03:25.070 --> 04:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
well I mean the question was that uh so
 
04:03:27.070 --> 04:03:27.080 align:start position:0%
we are iing it because we don't have
 
04:03:30.550 --> 04:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
enough information about the reason why
 
04:03:33.670 --> 04:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
insurance companies ask that the those
 
04:03:36.070 --> 04:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
details do if we don't really need to
 
04:03:39.750 --> 04:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
know that okay we don't know there at
 
04:03:42.070 --> 04:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
the end of the day that these
 
04:03:44.950 --> 04:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
requirements in in the cas that started
 
04:03:47.349 --> 04:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
the bill was obviously a CMS requirement
 
04:03:49.630 --> 04:03:49.640 align:start position:0%
it was Federal requirement but that you
 
04:03:53.910 --> 04:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
know if there is a um uh additional
 
04:03:55.429 --> 04:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
requirements some insurance company is
 
04:03:57.670 --> 04:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
going to come up with something then
 
04:04:00.229 --> 04:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
then that's their right they mandate
 
04:04:01.790 --> 04:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
basically they can they can have their
 
04:04:04.110 --> 04:04:04.120 align:start position:0%
standards and we would assume that they
 
04:04:05.630 --> 04:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
do their standards
 
04:04:08.149 --> 04:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
intentionally so that they can maintain
 
04:04:08.159 --> 04:04:08.990 align:start position:0%
intentionally so that they can maintain
their

04:04:08.990 --> 04:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:04:13.469 --> 04:04:13.479 align:start position:0%
status okay okay all right so we need
 
04:04:20.229 --> 04:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:24.030 --> 04:04:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:27.590 --> 04:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
me itl okay next one
 
04:04:31.710 --> 04:04:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:36.189 --> 04:04:36.199 align:start position:0%
audits two we is that one we just
 
04:04:39.269 --> 04:04:39.279 align:start position:0%

04:05:40.269 --> 04:05:40.279 align:start position:0%
to retain any more legislation my
 
04:05:42.110 --> 04:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
suggestion would be though to make an
 
04:05:44.750 --> 04:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
exception for this bill and I will give
 
04:05:48.670 --> 04:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
you my reasons so because we've had to
 
04:05:50.110 --> 04:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
be involved with so many pieces of
 
04:05:51.830 --> 04:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
legislation this session both House and
 
04:05:55.070 --> 04:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
Senate I did not have the opportunity to
 
04:05:57.229 --> 04:05:57.239 align:start position:0%
touch base with the stakeholders who
 
04:06:00.349 --> 04:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
have prompted House Bill 706 to be
 
04:06:03.389 --> 04:06:03.399 align:start position:0%
brought forward until just this past
 
04:06:07.149 --> 04:06:07.159 align:start position:0%
Monday I was initially confused as to
 
04:06:09.990 --> 04:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
what the bill was seeking to address
 
04:06:12.830 --> 04:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
because when I think of audits we
 
04:06:14.910 --> 04:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
frequently hear from providers who tell
 
04:06:18.469 --> 04:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
us that they really struggle both
 
04:06:20.590 --> 04:06:20.600 align:start position:0%
operationally and from a financial
 
04:06:24.070 --> 04:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
standpoint to deal with audits of claims
 
04:06:26.670 --> 04:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
some of which stretch back several
 
04:06:29.110 --> 04:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
months but typically it's the case that
 
04:06:31.870 --> 04:06:31.880 align:start position:0%
the audits happen and again what we hear
 
04:06:34.030 --> 04:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
most frequently are complaints about the
 
04:06:36.990 --> 04:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
audits that happen post payment so the
 
04:06:39.070 --> 04:06:39.080 align:start position:0%
service has been rendered the payment
 
04:06:41.389 --> 04:06:41.399 align:start position:0%
has been delivered and then some period
 
04:06:43.710 --> 04:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
after that there's an audit and some
 
04:06:45.309 --> 04:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's actually a clawback of
 
04:06:46.710 --> 04:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
the funds that have already been paid
 
04:06:48.990 --> 04:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
associated with that and the provider
 
04:06:50.950 --> 04:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
struggle to work through that
 
04:06:54.630 --> 04:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
process so conceptually when I read this
 
04:06:57.830 --> 04:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
bill for the first time and saw audits I
 
04:07:00.030 --> 04:07:00.040 align:start position:0%
was thinking to myself I've not really
 
04:07:02.590 --> 04:07:02.600 align:start position:0%
heard of there being a predominant
 
04:07:04.710 --> 04:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
problem where the service has been
 
04:07:06.750 --> 04:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
rendered but you're in that interregnum
 
04:07:08.269 --> 04:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
period between the service being
 
04:07:10.429 --> 04:07:10.439 align:start position:0%
rendered and then the payment being
 
04:07:13.189 --> 04:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
received I got further clarification as
 
04:07:15.630 --> 04:07:15.640 align:start position:0%
to what the bill is actually trying to
 
04:07:18.510 --> 04:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
address as I said earlier this week and
 
04:07:21.790 --> 04:07:21.800 align:start position:0%
what it appears to be speaking to are
 
04:07:26.109 --> 04:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
the practices of some carriers that are
 
04:07:29.269 --> 04:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
innovating around the prepayment review
 
04:07:32.070 --> 04:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
process that as I understand it is truly
 
04:07:34.149 --> 04:07:34.159 align:start position:0%
the pain point that the providers are
 
04:07:37.630 --> 04:07:37.640 align:start position:0%
trying to address through this bill so
 
04:07:39.309 --> 04:07:39.319 align:start position:0%
prepayment review and I'm going to
 
04:07:41.990 --> 04:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
grossly simplify this and the carriers
 
04:07:43.670 --> 04:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
can or my team can get into further the
 
04:07:46.109 --> 04:07:46.119 align:start position:0%
detail if you would like the prepayment
 
04:07:48.870 --> 04:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
review process is when the carrier sees
 
04:07:50.469 --> 04:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
that there's a particular provider who's
 
04:07:52.550 --> 04:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
an outlier for some reason they're
 
04:07:54.710 --> 04:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
really billing a code much more
 
04:07:57.550 --> 04:07:57.560 align:start position:0%
frequently over and above similarly
 
04:07:59.750 --> 04:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
situated providers and they want to
 
04:08:02.189 --> 04:08:02.199 align:start position:0%
understand why and so there'll be a
 
04:08:04.389 --> 04:08:04.399 align:start position:0%
little bit of an investigation that will
 
04:08:05.670 --> 04:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
go through that but they'll put them on
 
04:08:08.469 --> 04:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
prepayment review which says that it's
 
04:08:11.870 --> 04:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
almost a quasi but not quite prior
 
04:08:14.349 --> 04:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
authorization type process which says
 
04:08:16.149 --> 04:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
before we're going to agree to pay you
 
04:08:18.550 --> 04:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
we need to understand exactly what it is
 
04:08:20.389 --> 04:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
you're doing what it is you plan to
 
04:08:20.399 --> 04:08:21.550 align:start position:0%
you're doing what it is you plan to
build

04:08:21.550 --> 04:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
build
 
04:08:25.510 --> 04:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
for uh and there you know in its most
 
04:08:28.750 --> 04:08:28.760 align:start position:0%
extreme form it's a fraud prevention
 
04:08:31.429 --> 04:08:31.439 align:start position:0%
measure to ensure that providers are not
 
04:08:34.550 --> 04:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
billing inappropriately either through
 
04:08:36.710 --> 04:08:36.720 align:start position:0%
innocent mistake or they just need
 
04:08:39.269 --> 04:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
further education but also to ensure
 
04:08:41.750 --> 04:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
that providers are not abusing the
 
04:08:44.790 --> 04:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
system my understanding is that again
 
04:08:48.389 --> 04:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
there's been some Innovation with that
 
04:08:51.389 --> 04:08:51.399 align:start position:0%
prepayment review process and it's
 
04:08:53.830 --> 04:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
manifested itself in a place where
 
04:08:55.710 --> 04:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
providers aren't really able to
 
04:08:57.109 --> 04:08:57.119 align:start position:0%
understand why they're in prepayment
 
04:08:58.750 --> 04:08:58.760 align:start position:0%
review they don't know how to get out of
 
04:09:02.590 --> 04:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
it it's being applied seemingly um
 
04:09:04.590 --> 04:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
predominantly in areas where there are
 
04:09:06.630 --> 04:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Services being rendered
 
04:09:09.710 --> 04:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
that are not subject to any sort of a
 
04:09:12.910 --> 04:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
prior authorization review process due
 
04:09:16.429 --> 04:09:16.439 align:start position:0%
to Pia predominantly and so there are
 
04:09:18.070 --> 04:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
some issues that again have just been
 
04:09:20.510 --> 04:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
brought to our attention recently I'd
 
04:09:23.590 --> 04:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
like the opportunity to understand more
 
04:09:25.910 --> 04:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
hear from more providers exactly what's
 
04:09:28.990 --> 04:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
playing out here and that may very well
 
04:09:31.750 --> 04:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
result in this bill being brought
 
04:09:33.990 --> 04:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
forward in a different fashion we may
 
04:09:36.429 --> 04:09:36.439 align:start position:0%
need to put some safeguards around that
 
04:09:39.149 --> 04:09:39.159 align:start position:0%
process I just don't know yet I I need a
 
04:09:40.910 --> 04:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
little bit more information I need to
 
04:09:44.149 --> 04:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
hear from a few more providers uh as to
 
04:09:46.070 --> 04:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
what their experience is if there's a
 
04:09:48.109 --> 04:09:48.119 align:start position:0%
similar experience that they're having
 
04:09:50.469 --> 04:09:50.479 align:start position:0%
if there's a trend that's beginning to
 
04:09:53.550 --> 04:09:53.560 align:start position:0%
develop so respectfully if you're
 
04:09:56.030 --> 04:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
willing it would be I think beneficial
 
04:09:57.590 --> 04:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
for the Department to work with those
 
04:09:59.149 --> 04:09:59.159 align:start position:0%
stakeholders throughout the course of
 
04:10:01.309 --> 04:10:01.319 align:start position:0%
the summer and fall and be able to
 
04:10:03.790 --> 04:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
report back to you in September uh what
 
04:10:07.030 --> 04:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:10.030 --> 04:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
out so they're uh requesting that we
 
04:10:11.910 --> 04:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
retain the bill so they can come back
 
04:10:14.269 --> 04:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
with something that that seems to
 
04:10:15.830 --> 04:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
address the issue ises that sound okay
 
04:10:19.229 --> 04:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
with you represent gr okay anybody have
 
04:10:21.309 --> 04:10:21.319 align:start position:0%
a problem with retaining this
 
04:10:21.319 --> 04:10:23.109 align:start position:0%
a problem with retaining this
bill

04:10:23.109 --> 04:10:23.119 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:10:27.030 --> 04:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh we can do that right now uh so
 
04:10:29.710 --> 04:10:29.720 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee all those in favor of
 
04:10:33.149 --> 04:10:33.159 align:start position:0%
retaining uh hb76 please raise your hand
 
04:10:40.229 --> 04:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:44.309 --> 04:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:49.149 --> 04:10:49.159 align:start position:0%
anyone 70 7
 
04:10:53.710 --> 04:10:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:53.720 --> 04:10:57.309 align:start position:0%
 
275

04:10:57.309 --> 04:10:57.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:02.309 --> 04:11:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:04.550 --> 04:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
room still
 
04:11:07.990 --> 04:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
is there was one two
 
04:11:19.269 --> 04:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:24.910 --> 04:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:24.920 --> 04:11:27.590 align:start position:0%
 
it

04:11:27.590 --> 04:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:11:33.750 --> 04:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:33.760 --> 04:11:35.670 align:start position:0%
 
Burrows

04:11:35.670 --> 04:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
Burrows
 
04:11:38.349 --> 04:11:38.359 align:start position:0%
okay on
 
04:11:48.309 --> 04:11:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:48.319 --> 04:11:50.389 align:start position:0%
 
oh

04:11:50.389 --> 04:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:11:54.309 --> 04:11:54.319 align:start position:0%
okay all right this is this is my my
 
04:11:56.750 --> 04:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
ambulance bill right I got the right
 
04:11:59.349 --> 04:11:59.359 align:start position:0%
Bill okay so this is the one we want to
 
04:12:00.670 --> 04:12:00.680 align:start position:0%
pass because this is the one the
 
04:12:02.309 --> 04:12:02.319 align:start position:0%
department has done all the hard work on
 
04:12:05.710 --> 04:12:05.720 align:start position:0%
it and we've had some mates and you want
 
04:12:07.790 --> 04:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
to make the motion I want
 
04:12:14.070 --> 04:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:16.550 --> 04:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
I participated in the
 
04:12:19.710 --> 04:12:19.720 align:start position:0%
um ambulance in the uh in the
 
04:12:22.990 --> 04:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:27.229 --> 04:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
yesterday and other than coming away
 
04:12:32.030 --> 04:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
depressed what I saw and what I
 
04:12:35.510 --> 04:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
heard was a
 
04:12:38.670 --> 04:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
problem in understanding the scope of
 
04:12:42.349 --> 04:12:42.359 align:start position:0%
what this committee can do so there is
 
04:12:44.510 --> 04:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
Ambulance Service provided to Medicare
 
04:12:47.070 --> 04:12:47.080 align:start position:0%
patients orisa
 
04:12:49.670 --> 04:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
patients Medicaid
 
04:12:53.870 --> 04:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
patients and patients under uh what do
 
04:12:56.910 --> 04:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
we call it um fully insured
 
04:12:59.510 --> 04:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
market and this committee only has
 
04:13:02.149 --> 04:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
control over what is legislated and
 
04:13:05.830 --> 04:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
regulated for the fully insured Market
 
04:13:13.710 --> 04:13:13.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:15.590 --> 04:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
and I think there
 
04:13:19.309 --> 04:13:19.319 align:start position:0%
was so so we can't fix the whole problem
 
04:13:22.349 --> 04:13:22.359 align:start position:0%
all we can fix or at least work on is
 
04:13:28.349 --> 04:13:28.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:28.359 --> 04:13:30.670 align:start position:0%
 
market

04:13:30.670 --> 04:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
market
 
04:13:33.590 --> 04:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
and and while I and while that's the
 
04:13:36.149 --> 04:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
smallest piece of this whole thing
 
04:13:38.670 --> 04:13:38.680 align:start position:0%
that's all we've
 
04:13:42.229 --> 04:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
got and so we expect to see more bills
 
04:13:45.070 --> 04:13:45.080 align:start position:0%
coming maybe we can do a bill for
 
04:13:47.870 --> 04:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid we can't control anything with
 
04:13:47.880 --> 04:13:49.670 align:start position:0%
Medicaid we can't control anything with
Medicaid

04:13:49.670 --> 04:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
04:13:51.870 --> 04:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
talk well then I I don't know what we
 
04:13:54.750 --> 04:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
can do I want to make a comment too yeah
 
04:13:56.670 --> 04:13:56.680 align:start position:0%
well that's not totally correct we
 
04:13:58.550 --> 04:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
they're I thought we can I make a
 
04:14:01.109 --> 04:14:01.119 align:start position:0%
comment we do regulate the supplements
 
04:14:04.030 --> 04:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
can I can I make a comment sha so I
 
04:14:06.630 --> 04:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
think we discussed in detail last time
 
04:14:08.630 --> 04:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
about 36 what we didn't discuss at all
 
04:14:12.309 --> 04:14:12.319 align:start position:0%
was 725 and both those bills are going
 
04:14:14.309 --> 04:14:14.319 align:start position:0%
to address the needs for ambulance
 
04:14:18.429 --> 04:14:18.439 align:start position:0%
services so I would suggest that I mean
 
04:14:21.309 --> 04:14:21.319 align:start position:0%
we should discuss this together and uh I
 
04:14:22.830 --> 04:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
don't think you can pass both you have
 
04:14:24.389 --> 04:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
to you have to pick one over another
 
04:14:25.950 --> 04:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
correct so I should we discussed that in
 
04:14:28.269 --> 04:14:28.279 align:start position:0%
conjunction to each other not like in in
 
04:14:31.670 --> 04:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
in Silo so should we do it together
 
04:14:34.309 --> 04:14:34.319 align:start position:0%
rather than voting on 36 then
 
04:14:37.229 --> 04:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
725 I we generally try to avoid doing
 
04:14:39.950 --> 04:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
that but if you want to discuss the
 
04:14:41.870 --> 04:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
differences between the two we certainly
 
04:14:43.950 --> 04:14:43.960 align:start position:0%
can talk about that represent miles has
 
04:14:47.710 --> 04:14:47.720 align:start position:0%
a point of view on that doesn't she
 
04:14:53.189 --> 04:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
now thank you Mr chairman um I do have I
 
04:14:57.030 --> 04:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
do have grave concerns about 316 because
 
04:14:59.990 --> 04:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
it it not only prevents them from
 
04:15:02.349 --> 04:15:02.359 align:start position:0%
balanced billing but it also doesn't
 
04:15:04.510 --> 04:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
give them the amount of money that they
 
04:15:07.670 --> 04:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
verbalized would be adequate and so I
 
04:15:10.429 --> 04:15:10.439 align:start position:0%
think that could cause more harm than
 
04:15:15.109 --> 04:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:21.469 --> 04:15:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:24.309 --> 04:15:24.319 align:start position:0%
316 I'm I'm not sure I just I'm very
 
04:15:26.910 --> 04:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
concerned that tell us about 725 what
 
04:15:28.950 --> 04:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
why do you think 725 is the already
 
04:15:32.309 --> 04:15:32.319 align:start position:0%
answer I think it is based on what the
 
04:15:36.349 --> 04:15:36.359 align:start position:0%
EMS Chiefs and bureaus have all come and
 
04:15:39.030 --> 04:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
testified about I think that's what they
 
04:15:43.870 --> 04:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
have decided is adequate at this Point
 
04:15:46.070 --> 04:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
yeah and I would agree with that's
 
04:15:47.670 --> 04:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
that's what that's the point where I
 
04:15:49.670 --> 04:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention that we should discuss
 
04:15:51.510 --> 04:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
this together that way we know what's
 
04:15:52.990 --> 04:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
the difference the only difference Bas
 
04:15:55.469 --> 04:15:55.479 align:start position:0%
these two is 315 is giving you less than
 
04:15:58.469 --> 04:15:58.479 align:start position:0%
200% 725 is giving you 3 25% which is
 
04:16:02.229 --> 04:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
what the ambulance uh companies uh they
 
04:16:04.469 --> 04:16:04.479 align:start position:0%
their feel is adequate and also the fire
 
04:16:07.670 --> 04:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
CH understand that
 
04:16:13.469 --> 04:16:13.479 align:start position:0%
325 is basically expecting the uh the
 
04:16:17.790 --> 04:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
12% who have private insurance to make
 
04:16:22.429 --> 04:16:22.439 align:start position:0%
up that the the 12% was the three 316
 
04:16:24.349 --> 04:16:24.359 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount that it should be
 
04:16:26.790 --> 04:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate for that group to be paying
 
04:16:29.910 --> 04:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
but that 3 725 says we're going to
 
04:16:33.149 --> 04:16:33.159 align:start position:0%
disregard that we don't care we think
 
04:16:35.750 --> 04:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
people who have private insurance should
 
04:16:39.910 --> 04:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
pay to make up for what we don't get
 
04:16:42.229 --> 04:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
from Medicare and Medicaid which are the
 
04:16:42.239 --> 04:16:43.429 align:start position:0%
from Medicare and Medicaid which are the
80%

04:16:43.429 --> 04:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
80%
 
04:16:45.349 --> 04:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
of the users of the ambulance can we
 
04:16:46.910 --> 04:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
step back a little can we step back a
 
04:16:49.189 --> 04:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
little before we go to the uh premium
 
04:16:52.269 --> 04:16:52.279 align:start position:0%
part of it uh so I mean I I know
 
04:16:54.910 --> 04:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
chairman you like small short stories so
 
04:16:57.309 --> 04:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
let just give you a small story is that
 
04:17:00.189 --> 04:17:00.199 align:start position:0%
suppose somebody is in a ER and the
 
04:17:02.630 --> 04:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
doctor prescribes that person needs you
 
04:17:05.550 --> 04:17:05.560 align:start position:0%
know 325 mL of oxygen to get back on
 
04:17:09.469 --> 04:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
feet while then the hospital gives only
 
04:17:12.429 --> 04:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
200% of oxygen while it could be a
 
04:17:14.429 --> 04:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
little bit helpful but it's not going to
 
04:17:18.070 --> 04:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
achieve the goal what the doctor that's
 
04:17:20.429 --> 04:17:20.439 align:start position:0%
the reason why hospitals are highly
 
04:17:23.030 --> 04:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
subsidized by the state to make so that
 
04:17:25.389 --> 04:17:25.399 align:start position:0%
was just that just an example in this
 
04:17:28.550 --> 04:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
case repeatedly the ambulance department
 
04:17:30.710 --> 04:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
and also the fire chiefs they have test
 
04:17:32.590 --> 04:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
they have given testimony they have
 
04:17:35.149 --> 04:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
expressed that in order for them to
 
04:17:38.950 --> 04:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
operate productively or operate uh
 
04:17:42.630 --> 04:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
properly they probably would need 3 25%
 
04:17:46.070 --> 04:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
of of the Medicaid uh Medicare need not
 
04:17:48.510 --> 04:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
200% while 200% might give them
 
04:17:51.109 --> 04:17:51.119 align:start position:0%
something but that might not be adequate
 
04:17:52.990 --> 04:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
uh for them to operate now coming back
 
04:17:54.990 --> 04:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
to your point of Premium I heard last
 
04:17:59.469 --> 04:17:59.479 align:start position:0%
time that uh uh the bill 316 is going to
 
04:18:02.990 --> 04:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
raise $4 to for the insurance person per
 
04:18:07.030 --> 04:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
per year while $725 will increase to $7
 
04:18:09.950 --> 04:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
that's a differ $3 per year per person
 
04:18:12.950 --> 04:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
for a family of four people that's $12
 
04:18:17.149 --> 04:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
for the year which is a dollar per month
 
04:18:19.750 --> 04:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
now I don't think dollar per month $4
 
04:18:19.760 --> 04:18:21.030 align:start position:0%
now I don't think dollar per month $4
per

04:18:21.030 --> 04:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
per
 
04:18:23.429 --> 04:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
person so that if you're a family of
 
04:18:26.309 --> 04:18:26.319 align:start position:0%
four it's now $16 yes that okay so I'm
 
04:18:29.830 --> 04:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
mean dollar something per month so you
 
04:18:31.710 --> 04:18:31.720 align:start position:0%
know I don't think that's a big jump in
 
04:18:35.670 --> 04:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
premium a dollar something per month to
 
04:18:38.429 --> 04:18:38.439 align:start position:0%
uh to negate this and the second thing I
 
04:18:40.469 --> 04:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
would like to say is that in general
 
04:18:43.389 --> 04:18:43.399 align:start position:0%
insurance companies they make amount of
 
04:18:45.830 --> 04:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
profit okay another thing that you need
 
04:18:49.950 --> 04:18:49.960 align:start position:0%
to know that under the Affordable Care
 
04:18:53.389 --> 04:18:53.399 align:start position:0%
Act insurance company's
 
04:18:55.590 --> 04:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
profitability is
 
04:18:58.429 --> 04:18:58.439 align:start position:0%
capped and that it is
 
04:19:00.309 --> 04:19:00.319 align:start position:0%
limited to
 
04:19:03.830 --> 04:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
10% so that means they they can and they
 
04:19:06.030 --> 04:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
sh a premium when they charge in a
 
04:19:09.590 --> 04:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
premium 90% of that premium is
 
04:19:11.670 --> 04:19:11.680 align:start position:0%
predetermined by a three-year average of
 
04:19:14.990 --> 04:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
look back on what they paid out to
 
04:19:19.469 --> 04:19:19.479 align:start position:0%
Providers the remaining 10% covers all
 
04:19:22.550 --> 04:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
their costs marketing their people their
 
04:19:25.149 --> 04:19:25.159 align:start position:0%
personnel the paper pushing all the
 
04:19:28.149 --> 04:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats and then maybe somewhere in
 
04:19:31.149 --> 04:19:31.159 align:start position:0%
there they can find a profit that is
 
04:19:33.550 --> 04:19:33.560 align:start position:0%
under law okay so even if the insurance
 
04:19:35.710 --> 04:19:35.720 align:start position:0%
company is going to pass on all the
 
04:19:38.590 --> 04:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
expense to the to its members as you
 
04:19:41.429 --> 04:19:41.439 align:start position:0%
rightly said in before that the proposal
 
04:19:43.510 --> 04:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
that you are proposing 360 is going to
 
04:19:47.309 --> 04:19:47.319 align:start position:0%
raise $4 versus 725 bill is going to
 
04:19:50.670 --> 04:19:50.680 align:start position:0%
increase $7 it's a differ of $3 per
 
04:19:53.630 --> 04:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
person and that's for for a family of
 
04:19:57.189 --> 04:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
four that's $12 per for the dollar a
 
04:19:59.149 --> 04:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
month this is ambulance now so do you
 
04:20:02.750 --> 04:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
think we should be charging all these
 
04:20:05.109 --> 04:20:05.119 align:start position:0%
same people who have insurance shouldn't
 
04:20:06.990 --> 04:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
we may have them be charging to make up
 
04:20:08.950 --> 04:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
for the fact that the doctors are not
 
04:20:11.389 --> 04:20:11.399 align:start position:0%
are getting underpaid or the hospitals
 
04:20:13.389 --> 04:20:13.399 align:start position:0%
are being underpaid how where are you
 
04:20:14.830 --> 04:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
going to stop why are you just picking
 
04:20:17.189 --> 04:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
ambulance out of the blue and say ooh
 
04:20:19.189 --> 04:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
that's the one that they need to pay
 
04:20:21.630 --> 04:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid for why don't you
 
04:20:23.349 --> 04:20:23.359 align:start position:0%
just choose everything just why don't we
 
04:20:24.590 --> 04:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
just make all the people with private
 
04:20:26.229 --> 04:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
insurance just pay for all the health
 
04:20:27.670 --> 04:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
insurance costs because Medicare
 
04:20:29.109 --> 04:20:29.119 align:start position:0%
Medicaid won't pay for it yeah let me
 
04:20:31.269 --> 04:20:31.279 align:start position:0%
respond to that so I mean one thing is
 
04:20:33.229 --> 04:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
that you know first of all we're
 
04:20:34.790 --> 04:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
addressing the ambulance need but coming
 
04:20:37.510 --> 04:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
to your point when the medical
 
04:20:40.670 --> 04:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
facility uh sends a bill they usually
 
04:20:45.790 --> 04:20:45.800 align:start position:0%
get 60% of of what they bill from the
 
04:20:47.349 --> 04:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
from the insurance company they don't
 
04:20:50.389 --> 04:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
get 20% Which is Medicare rate as per
 
04:20:53.429 --> 04:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
the ambulance bill they get about 60% of
 
04:20:55.070 --> 04:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
the bill paid by the insurance so
 
04:20:56.870 --> 04:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
insurance companies are already paying
 
04:21:00.030 --> 04:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
about 60% of the doctor's Bill to them
 
04:21:02.870 --> 04:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
in general they they don't pay 20% you
 
04:21:04.950 --> 04:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
know they never pay 20% of the bill to
 
04:21:07.030 --> 04:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
the doctors or to the hospitals but if
 
04:21:09.189 --> 04:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
they are paying 20% of the bill to
 
04:21:10.630 --> 04:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
ambulance servic as we agree they're
 
04:21:14.070 --> 04:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
already paying the largest portion than
 
04:21:17.030 --> 04:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
anybody else they're paying more than
 
04:21:20.790 --> 04:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
Medicare more than Medicaid more than uh
 
04:21:22.950 --> 04:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
even orisa but how much is more when you
 
04:21:25.790 --> 04:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
say more what you just said 60 no I said
 
04:21:28.229 --> 04:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
60% for the doctors and hospitals we
 
04:21:30.030 --> 04:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
talking about ambulance if the ambulance
 
04:21:33.910 --> 04:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
is asking that give me 0% can I of the
 
04:21:36.149 --> 04:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
bill I think you made your point all
 
04:21:38.469 --> 04:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
right that representative Gibbs has her
 
04:21:43.429 --> 04:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
hand up next thank you um okay uh we
 
04:21:46.429 --> 04:21:46.439 align:start position:0%
can't touch orisa or Medicare those are
 
04:21:49.790 --> 04:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
entirely Federal Medicaid assuming we
 
04:21:52.269 --> 04:21:52.279 align:start position:0%
could touch anything um we could touch
 
04:21:54.590 --> 04:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
only the state portion but that's really
 
04:21:57.030 --> 04:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
going to be controlled by the governor
 
04:21:59.189 --> 04:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
um and the finance committee so there's
 
04:22:00.790 --> 04:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
probably very little that the Commerce
 
04:22:02.189 --> 04:22:02.199 align:start position:0%
and we have no money right to do about
 
04:22:03.990 --> 04:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
it yeah
 
04:22:08.189 --> 04:22:08.199 align:start position:0%
um so um during the public hearing I
 
04:22:10.670 --> 04:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
found the ambulance providers believable
 
04:22:12.910 --> 04:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
um and as I believe I said said during
 
04:22:16.830 --> 04:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
the public hearing uh therefore I prefer
 
04:22:16.840 --> 04:22:17.790 align:start position:0%
the public hearing uh therefore I prefer
um

04:22:17.790 --> 04:22:17.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:23.830 --> 04:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
725 um however um if uh the provisions
 
04:22:23.840 --> 04:22:24.670 align:start position:0%
725 um however um if uh the provisions
of

04:22:24.670 --> 04:22:24.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:22:28.469 --> 04:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
316 are um uh the consensus of the
 
04:22:30.030 --> 04:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
committee and if that is what is most
 
04:22:32.670 --> 04:22:32.680 align:start position:0%
likely to pass I would would be willing
 
04:22:37.870 --> 04:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
to go along with that um I did uh listen
 
04:22:40.149 --> 04:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
to the Consulting company's
 
04:22:44.429 --> 04:22:44.439 align:start position:0%
presentation um uh on M is one that um
 
04:22:46.309 --> 04:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
representative spear was talking about
 
04:22:49.189 --> 04:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
yes uh and and that's where 316 comes
 
04:22:52.349 --> 04:22:52.359 align:start position:0%
from and honestly I was not impressed um
 
04:22:54.750 --> 04:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
it was all numbers no evaluation no
 
04:22:58.109 --> 04:22:58.119 align:start position:0%
analysis no reason why they made the
 
04:23:00.630 --> 04:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
conclusions that they did so I I was
 
04:23:02.910 --> 04:23:02.920 align:start position:0%
just not impressed by it I understand
 
04:23:05.830 --> 04:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
were you there or you you listen to you
 
04:23:08.550 --> 04:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
sorry you did it virtually uh virtually
 
04:23:11.469 --> 04:23:11.479 align:start position:0%
yes okay they they did explain exactly
 
04:23:13.269 --> 04:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
why they put the number that they paint
 
04:23:16.109 --> 04:23:16.119 align:start position:0%
in I I was very I was completely
 
04:23:17.710 --> 04:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
opposite I mean yes I was listening on
 
04:23:20.590 --> 04:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
the phone but they see they delve deep
 
04:23:24.269 --> 04:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
into and and how they did the exclusions
 
04:23:26.510 --> 04:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
and how they did the numbers and yes I
 
04:23:28.109 --> 04:23:28.119 align:start position:0%
thought I thought they did a very good
 
04:23:30.070 --> 04:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
presentation so I'm sorry you you were
 
04:23:32.189 --> 04:23:32.199 align:start position:0%
not impressed their explanation was all
 
04:23:34.189 --> 04:23:34.199 align:start position:0%
numbers okay well that was what the
 
04:23:36.389 --> 04:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
whole what I was hoping to hear for was
 
04:23:39.870 --> 04:23:39.880 align:start position:0%
something articulated as in we we
 
04:23:42.590 --> 04:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
decided on this number because after for
 
04:23:45.229 --> 04:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
considering factor a factor B and factor
 
04:23:48.109 --> 04:23:48.119 align:start position:0%
C we also considered this other number
 
04:23:50.510 --> 04:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
but we decided against it because there
 
04:23:52.309 --> 04:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
was nothing like that no that's we
 
04:23:55.550 --> 04:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
didn't want that we told them we want to
 
04:23:58.429 --> 04:23:58.439 align:start position:0%
know what it does it really cost for
 
04:24:00.790 --> 04:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
private insurance companies to so that
 
04:24:02.550 --> 04:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
they're that for these ambulance
 
04:24:05.870 --> 04:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
companies what should be in a vacuum you
 
04:24:07.149 --> 04:24:07.159 align:start position:0%
could say as in a vacuum we're saying
 
04:24:08.750 --> 04:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
we're taking the Medicare and beend the
 
04:24:11.429 --> 04:24:11.439 align:start position:0%
you know just the the clients who are
 
04:24:14.550 --> 04:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
actually there what would the number be
 
04:24:16.550 --> 04:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
and it came in at
 
04:24:21.309 --> 04:24:21.319 align:start position:0%
202 what three% over Medicare so and and
 
04:24:23.109 --> 04:24:23.119 align:start position:0%
the Medicare number was only that's only
 
04:24:24.670 --> 04:24:24.680 align:start position:0%
that's a moving Target number obviously
 
04:24:27.309 --> 04:24:27.319 align:start position:0%
because Medicare number was FL so but
 
04:24:28.910 --> 04:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
they just did that to give us some
 
04:24:31.950 --> 04:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
mathematical you know combination how to
 
04:24:34.790 --> 04:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know do it because because of the
 
04:24:36.910 --> 04:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
other bill was
 
04:24:40.750 --> 04:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
325 over Medicare and that number was as
 
04:24:44.790 --> 04:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
it seemed was literally as you just said
 
04:24:47.349 --> 04:24:47.359 align:start position:0%
out of the air okay there was no
 
04:24:48.910 --> 04:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
rationale to the
 
04:24:54.189 --> 04:24:54.199 align:start position:0%
325 okay your this bill the 315 was B 16
 
04:24:57.670 --> 04:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
was built on being rational exactly what
 
04:25:00.189 --> 04:25:00.199 align:start position:0%
it really insurance company should be
 
04:25:02.750 --> 04:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursing it as far as as far as I was
 
04:25:05.750 --> 04:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
concerned um the providers did provide a
 
04:25:05.760 --> 04:25:07.510 align:start position:0%
concerned um the providers did provide a
rationale

04:25:07.510 --> 04:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
rationale
 
04:25:10.550 --> 04:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
um and the consulting
 
04:25:13.030 --> 04:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
company provided numbers
 
04:25:16.469 --> 04:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
got it okay okay okay they did not
 
04:25:19.030 --> 04:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
articulate for you you wanted a little
 
04:25:21.910 --> 04:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
more articulation rather the numbers um
 
04:25:24.510 --> 04:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
okay what I'm look can I finish what I'm
 
04:25:26.830 --> 04:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
considering doing in the committee but
 
04:25:29.710 --> 04:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
not in the full house um would be voting
 
04:25:33.670 --> 04:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
in favor of both 316 and 725 so that the
 
04:25:36.469 --> 04:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
full house um can give full
 
04:25:38.910 --> 04:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
consideration to
 
04:25:41.510 --> 04:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
both there is no doubt that all bills
 
04:25:42.750 --> 04:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
can come to the
 
04:25:45.990 --> 04:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
floor uh but if I have my brothers what
 
04:25:48.590 --> 04:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
I would like to be seeing is that that
 
04:25:53.070 --> 04:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
316 is going to be ought to pass and and
 
04:25:55.990 --> 04:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
7 so 25 would be inexpedient to
 
04:25:57.790 --> 04:25:57.800 align:start position:0%
legislate and yes you can get up on the
 
04:26:01.229 --> 04:26:01.239 align:start position:0%
floor and fight to overt term that I
 
04:26:03.349 --> 04:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
understand that um and we have discussed
 
04:26:05.469 --> 04:26:05.479 align:start position:0%
this before and as I said I was willing
 
04:26:06.990 --> 04:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
to go along with
 
04:26:10.109 --> 04:26:10.119 align:start position:0%
316 um but I'm still not entirely
 
04:26:12.030 --> 04:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
comfortable got it yeah representative
 
04:26:12.040 --> 04:26:13.030 align:start position:0%
comfortable got it yeah representative
miles

04:26:13.030 --> 04:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
miles
 
04:26:17.229 --> 04:26:17.239 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so in the meeting on Monday
 
04:26:19.630 --> 04:26:19.640 align:start position:0%
um the one thing that I did notice was
 
04:26:22.750 --> 04:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
that uh in fact uh representative Gibbs
 
04:26:25.389 --> 04:26:25.399 align:start position:0%
you mentioned uh they did not take into
 
04:26:27.790 --> 04:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
account the three highest outliers in
 
04:26:32.630 --> 04:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
their accounting um and then
 
04:26:36.070 --> 04:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
separately um insurance companies pay
 
04:26:39.389 --> 04:26:39.399 align:start position:0%
for a lot of things that don't do much
 
04:26:41.870 --> 04:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
for the majority of their clients they
 
04:26:46.510 --> 04:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
do something good for a few whereas this
 
04:26:51.630 --> 04:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
would help the greater good and so 725
 
04:26:54.830 --> 04:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
would help the greater good and so I
 
04:27:01.670 --> 04:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:04.070 --> 04:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
316 it would prevent them from balance
 
04:27:06.630 --> 04:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
billing and they cited in Monday's
 
04:27:08.910 --> 04:27:08.920 align:start position:0%
conference that what would happen if we
 
04:27:11.389 --> 04:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
did this would be that they would
 
04:27:13.189 --> 04:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
automatically have to start billing a
 
04:27:17.189 --> 04:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
minimum of $500 to each uh ambulance
 
04:27:19.389 --> 04:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
ride or or
 
04:27:22.189 --> 04:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
whatnot for Trans for transport is that
 
04:27:24.550 --> 04:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
that's what I heard
 
04:27:27.269 --> 04:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
in but it was cited something like
 
04:27:29.429 --> 04:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
something along those lines was cited no
 
04:27:32.109 --> 04:27:32.119 align:start position:0%
only to the insured only to the insured
 
04:27:33.830 --> 04:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
Medicare patients would not be hit with
 
04:27:35.670 --> 04:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
the same billing right it was only for
 
04:27:37.109 --> 04:27:37.119 align:start position:0%
the insured all talking about for
 
04:27:41.070 --> 04:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
insured yeah so in in any case I just
 
04:27:43.389 --> 04:27:43.399 align:start position:0%
think 316 is going to handcuff them more
 
04:27:46.630 --> 04:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
than they're handcuffed now so does
 
04:27:49.510 --> 04:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
725 take away balance billing it takes
 
04:27:51.070 --> 04:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
away balance billing but it also
 
04:27:53.269 --> 04:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
provides them with more Revenue right
 
04:27:54.670 --> 04:27:54.680 align:start position:0%
but it does take away balance billing
 
04:27:57.469 --> 04:27:57.479 align:start position:0%
also that's the only difference is that
 
04:28:00.109 --> 04:28:00.119 align:start position:0%
amount right and it just it they're
 
04:28:01.510 --> 04:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
they're the same in the sense that they
 
04:28:03.309 --> 04:28:03.319 align:start position:0%
both both take away balanced billing yes
 
04:28:06.790 --> 04:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
right but in in but in 725 they're just
 
04:28:09.590 --> 04:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
making the that they're getting
 
04:28:12.910 --> 04:28:12.920 align:start position:0%
the the the smallest GR small group who
 
04:28:16.189 --> 04:28:16.199 align:start position:0%
uses it pay pay the Lion Share that's
 
04:28:17.670 --> 04:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
Insurance they're getting that's
 
04:28:20.670 --> 04:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
Insurance oh how about that's Medicare
 
04:28:22.870 --> 04:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid let's let's put the blame where
 
04:28:25.229 --> 04:28:25.239 align:start position:0%
it we've listened to them over and over
 
04:28:28.349 --> 04:28:28.359 align:start position:0%
and over they've asked for something and
 
04:28:30.030 --> 04:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
it's our job to do the best for the
 
04:28:33.309 --> 04:28:33.319 align:start position:0%
community and to our constituents okay
 
04:28:33.319 --> 04:28:34.630 align:start position:0%
community and to our constituents okay
representative

04:28:34.630 --> 04:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:28:36.670 --> 04:28:36.680 align:start position:0%
speaker at the very beginning of the
 
04:28:39.030 --> 04:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
meeting uh the insurance department came
 
04:28:41.030 --> 04:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
up and made a discussion as to where the
 
04:28:42.750 --> 04:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
data came from
 
04:28:44.590 --> 04:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
and they talked about how they got it
 
04:28:49.109 --> 04:28:49.119 align:start position:0%
from the data that was submitted by the
 
04:28:51.670 --> 04:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
carriers every dollar was accounted for
 
04:28:53.950 --> 04:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
it all came from the carriers it wasn't
 
04:28:55.590 --> 04:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
like they came up with numbers out of
 
04:28:57.750 --> 04:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
the air they took the carriers I mean
 
04:29:01.429 --> 04:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
the um provids numbers they added an
 
04:29:04.630 --> 04:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
inflation rate they did a a bunch of
 
04:29:08.710 --> 04:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
analysis on on based on uh what kind of
 
04:29:11.429 --> 04:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
service was provided it was an analysis
 
04:29:14.990 --> 04:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
of what the folks sent in it wasn't made
 
04:29:17.469 --> 04:29:17.479 align:start position:0%
up was all their numbers so the numbers
 
04:29:20.189 --> 04:29:20.199 align:start position:0%
were a very good representation of what
 
04:29:22.469 --> 04:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
it cost to provide the service
 
04:29:25.870 --> 04:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's only 8.7% of the
 
04:29:28.389 --> 04:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
market and there's nothing we can do
 
04:29:30.109 --> 04:29:30.119 align:start position:0%
about that we don't regulate any other
 
04:29:32.550 --> 04:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
part of the market they did they did a
 
04:29:34.670 --> 04:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
very good job with the numbers I'm not
 
04:29:36.710 --> 04:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
arguing about that at all they explained
 
04:29:39.229 --> 04:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
where the numbers came from the problem
 
04:29:41.469 --> 04:29:41.479 align:start position:0%
that I had with it was that they never
 
04:29:44.269 --> 04:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
articul culated their reasoning and
 
04:29:45.950 --> 04:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
that's what I was looking for it was
 
04:29:48.229 --> 04:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
real numbers it was numbers that were
 
04:29:49.830 --> 04:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
they submitted they didn't have to
 
04:29:51.550 --> 04:29:51.560 align:start position:0%
articulate their reason this was the
 
04:29:53.630 --> 04:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
numbers they were handed by the
 
04:29:58.429 --> 04:29:58.439 align:start position:0%
providers no one in EMS has supported
 
04:30:01.389 --> 04:30:01.399 align:start position:0%
that they've all come they've all asked
 
04:30:01.399 --> 04:30:02.389 align:start position:0%
that they've all come they've all asked
for

04:30:02.389 --> 04:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:30:06.229 --> 04:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
325 to be adequate and is all they're
 
04:30:08.990 --> 04:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
asking for and then we can all move on
 
04:30:10.910 --> 04:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
no what they're asking for is to to
 
04:30:13.030 --> 04:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
cover an area that we have no
 
04:30:15.590 --> 04:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility for we don't deal with we
 
04:30:18.030 --> 04:30:18.040 align:start position:0%
have a responsibility cover can I make a
 
04:30:21.309 --> 04:30:21.319 align:start position:0%
comment see let me I just want to throw
 
04:30:25.030 --> 04:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
one little piece in here okay I uh I
 
04:30:28.429 --> 04:30:28.439 align:start position:0%
went in my town meeting yesterday we
 
04:30:30.950 --> 04:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
have Senate Bill too and my town of
 
04:30:34.550 --> 04:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
ringe voted
 
04:30:37.389 --> 04:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
$36,000 for our ambulance shared
 
04:30:39.990 --> 04:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
Ambulance Service Jeffrey family Jeffrey
 
04:30:44.109 --> 04:30:44.119 align:start position:0%
and ringe ambulance service so when you
 
04:30:48.870 --> 04:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
say that they want that number okay I
 
04:30:52.830 --> 04:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
believe that they are getting the money
 
04:30:54.910 --> 04:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
now okay because otherwise they would
 
04:30:56.189 --> 04:30:56.199 align:start position:0%
have been out of business right they
 
04:30:57.710 --> 04:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
would have gone out of business because
 
04:30:59.309 --> 04:30:59.319 align:start position:0%
this issue's been around since I've been
 
04:31:03.070 --> 04:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
here but the that they're all getting
 
04:31:06.710 --> 04:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
money from the towns that they serve and
 
04:31:09.229 --> 04:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
they are just like a fire department
 
04:31:12.710 --> 04:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
okay can I so if you're not
 
04:31:15.550 --> 04:31:15.560 align:start position:0%
if you are able not to build the town
 
04:31:17.670 --> 04:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
and you they're scrambling if you can
 
04:31:20.229 --> 04:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
get away without doing it all on balance
 
04:31:22.950 --> 04:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
billing then I bet you you rather keep
 
04:31:25.189 --> 04:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
balance billing and that's what I think
 
04:31:27.710 --> 04:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
the problem here is is that the balance
 
04:31:31.109 --> 04:31:31.119 align:start position:0%
billing is a very dangerous thing here
 
04:31:33.670 --> 04:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
and that is that it has been around from
 
04:31:37.070 --> 04:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
day one it's always been it it it's
 
04:31:39.950 --> 04:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
something they use and I truly believe
 
04:31:42.750 --> 04:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
they don't want to lose it at all so if
 
04:31:47.469 --> 04:31:47.479 align:start position:0%
we send this bill 316 over to to the
 
04:31:50.389 --> 04:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
Senate and the Senate wants us send us
 
04:31:54.189 --> 04:31:54.199 align:start position:0%
basically 725 is the bill they have
 
04:31:56.149 --> 04:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
right apprentice's Bill looks like or
 
04:31:58.429 --> 04:31:58.439 align:start position:0%
your husband's bill look looks like
 
04:32:01.469 --> 04:32:01.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't it look like that okay if that's
 
04:32:03.269 --> 04:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
where we're going to get down to it then
 
04:32:05.469 --> 04:32:05.479 align:start position:0%
balance billing will be the hot issue
 
04:32:07.830 --> 04:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
and frankly it should be the ambulance
 
04:32:10.750 --> 04:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
can choose the ambulance can choose to
 
04:32:12.550 --> 04:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
continue to operate the way have they
 
04:32:16.830 --> 04:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
have now or they can choose this model
 
04:32:18.990 --> 04:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
that we're suggesting the 725 that that
 
04:32:21.389 --> 04:32:21.399 align:start position:0%
also removes balance billing right that
 
04:32:23.389 --> 04:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
both it it theoretically it removes
 
04:32:25.189 --> 04:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
balance billing yeah so both the bills
 
04:32:26.870 --> 04:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
they both the bills are addressing to
 
04:32:28.630 --> 04:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
remove balance billing so both are
 
04:32:31.590 --> 04:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
similar that bill look like what does
 
04:32:34.269 --> 04:32:34.279 align:start position:0%
the Senate bill look like okay so here's
 
04:32:37.750 --> 04:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
the thing is that what we charge the
 
04:32:39.750 --> 04:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
insurance department with doing is
 
04:32:42.870 --> 04:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
coming up with a rational
 
04:32:45.070 --> 04:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it doesn't fill the stories
 
04:32:47.710 --> 04:32:47.720 align:start position:0%
for representative gids but it a
 
04:32:51.429 --> 04:32:51.439 align:start position:0%
rational numeric calculation on what
 
04:32:54.550 --> 04:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
insurance companies should be paying and
 
04:32:57.389 --> 04:32:57.399 align:start position:0%
yes it absolutely is a mandate on them
 
04:32:58.910 --> 04:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely they're going to be raising
 
04:33:02.229 --> 04:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
their their rates already with this new
 
04:33:05.551 --> 04:33:05.561 align:start position:0%
number okay the question was if we're
 
04:33:08.949 --> 04:33:08.959 align:start position:0%
going to do this how do we make sure
 
04:33:12.869 --> 04:33:12.879 align:start position:0%
that it's fair to those have that
 
04:33:14.789 --> 04:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
insurance because you certainly don't
 
04:33:16.629 --> 04:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
want to say is for everyone says well
 
04:33:18.189 --> 04:33:18.199 align:start position:0%
screw it I don't want to I don't want to
 
04:33:20.789 --> 04:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
buy insurance anymore I want to go on
 
04:33:22.830 --> 04:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
you know you know Medicaid or I want to
 
04:33:25.470 --> 04:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
go I want to do something else simply
 
04:33:28.310 --> 04:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
because the legislature decided in its
 
04:33:31.629 --> 04:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
wisdom that we're going to frontload and
 
04:33:34.429 --> 04:33:34.439 align:start position:0%
make just people with small employer
 
04:33:37.670 --> 04:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
insurance pay the Lion Share but we
 
04:33:39.189 --> 04:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
already discussed only a dollar
 
04:33:41.510 --> 04:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
difference between both the bills per
 
04:33:41.520 --> 04:33:42.269 align:start position:0%
difference between both the bills per
month

04:33:42.269 --> 04:33:42.279 align:start position:0%
month
 
04:33:44.949 --> 04:33:44.959 align:start position:0%
so that I'm saying is that's why the
 
04:33:49.590 --> 04:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
203 is the best Bill to put forward
 
04:33:51.949 --> 04:33:51.959 align:start position:0%
because it's definitely increase it's
 
04:33:54.551 --> 04:33:54.561 align:start position:0%
definitely you know it's definitely an
 
04:33:57.310 --> 04:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
in going to be a mandate it will raise
 
04:33:59.990 --> 04:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
premiums but the end of the day it's
 
04:34:02.709 --> 04:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
rational and we built into that model
 
04:34:05.551 --> 04:34:05.561 align:start position:0%
that every two years they will be able
 
04:34:07.990 --> 04:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to redo the numbers and
 
04:34:09.789 --> 04:34:09.799 align:start position:0%
maybe they'll be more forthcoming with
 
04:34:11.470 --> 04:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
their new numbers or something I don't
 
04:34:13.629 --> 04:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
know maybe there will be a change but I
 
04:34:15.310 --> 04:34:15.320 align:start position:0%
will guarantee you I'll bet you it'll be
 
04:34:17.470 --> 04:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
a higher than 203 I'll bet you it will
 
04:34:20.109 --> 04:34:20.119 align:start position:0%
go up okay so chairman can I let me hear
 
04:34:24.869 --> 04:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
from you u f analysis on both 31 316 how
 
04:34:28.590 --> 04:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
much is raes premium you said around $4
 
04:34:32.189 --> 04:34:32.199 align:start position:0%
two what it was no the the hb31 316 what
 
04:34:33.910 --> 04:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
what was the per member do we have a per
 
04:34:33.920 --> 04:34:34.789 align:start position:0%
what was the per member do we have a per
member

04:34:34.789 --> 04:34:34.799 align:start position:0%
member
 
04:34:37.629 --> 04:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
analysis I think the way it mentioned
 
04:34:37.639 --> 04:34:38.390 align:start position:0%
analysis I think the way it mentioned
was

04:34:38.390 --> 04:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:34:41.189 --> 04:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
$4 okay if I may I feel like I need to
 
04:34:43.789 --> 04:34:43.799 align:start position:0%
correct to this when we're talking about
 
04:34:45.869 --> 04:34:45.879 align:start position:0%
increases in premium and we do our
 
04:34:49.510 --> 04:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
mandate study there is a a cost
 
04:34:51.750 --> 04:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
associated with an increase in overall
 
04:34:54.551 --> 04:34:54.561 align:start position:0%
health care costs and that's usually a
 
04:34:58.070 --> 04:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
round dollar amount we then express it
 
04:35:00.789 --> 04:35:00.799 align:start position:0%
as per member per month right but it it
 
04:35:03.709 --> 04:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
would be incorrect to assume that any
 
04:35:06.590 --> 04:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
increase in costs is going to result in
 
04:35:09.750 --> 04:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
that exact per member per month increase
 
04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
how rates are developed is a much more
 
04:35:15.189 --> 04:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
intricate process and this is not an
 
04:35:17.310 --> 04:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
even thing so it doesn't mean everyone's
 
04:35:20.390 --> 04:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
rates go up a dollar per month per
 
04:35:24.750 --> 04:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
member it can impact different groups
 
04:35:26.670 --> 04:35:26.680 align:start position:0%
differently every carrier has its own
 
04:35:29.709 --> 04:35:29.719 align:start position:0%
rating process based on their experience
 
04:35:32.429 --> 04:35:32.439 align:start position:0%
and what they are experiencing for
 
04:35:34.869 --> 04:35:34.879 align:start position:0%
claims for this it could have a greater
 
04:35:37.869 --> 04:35:37.879 align:start position:0%
impact to certain groups over others so
 
04:35:39.670 --> 04:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
I would just caution you when we're
 
04:35:41.390 --> 04:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
talking per member per month that is a
 
04:35:43.629 --> 04:35:43.639 align:start position:0%
bit of a misn number so if you look at
 
04:35:46.750 --> 04:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
the fiscal notes for each one of these
 
04:35:49.590 --> 04:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry I don't think it got put
 
04:35:52.709 --> 04:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
in correctly I'll have to pull it up
 
04:35:54.949 --> 04:35:54.959 align:start position:0%
give me one second I can pull up we did
 
04:35:58.150 --> 04:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
use the sa so the actuary firm that did
 
04:36:01.349 --> 04:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
the cost study analysis they have used
 
04:36:04.470 --> 04:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
that same methodology to do um analysis
 
04:36:06.551 --> 04:36:06.561 align:start position:0%
for all of these bills so they are
 
04:36:08.349 --> 04:36:08.359 align:start position:0%
comparable in that respect when we're
 
04:36:10.109 --> 04:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
talking ballparks obviously these are
 
04:36:11.789 --> 04:36:11.799 align:start position:0%
all estimates so if you give me one one
 
04:36:14.910 --> 04:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
second I can pull up the exact analysis
 
04:37:07.349 --> 04:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:08.870 --> 04:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
so for 316
 
04:37:08.880 --> 04:37:15.629 align:start position:0%
so for 316
[Music]

04:37:15.629 --> 04:37:15.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:17.590 --> 04:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
I believe like the total impact was
 
04:37:35.470 --> 04:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:48.189 --> 04:37:48.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:51.070 --> 04:37:51.080 align:start position:0%
so yeah for 316 the estimate is that the
 
04:37:54.230 --> 04:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
total um cost associated with these
 
04:37:57.830 --> 04:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
services will increase by 4.3 million
 
04:37:59.990 --> 04:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay that total cost needs to be
 
04:38:02.590 --> 04:38:02.600 align:start position:0%
absorbed in insurance premiums in some
 
04:38:06.949 --> 04:38:06.959 align:start position:0%
way okay so for the other one which is
 
04:38:06.959 --> 04:38:38.789 align:start position:0%
way okay so for the other one which is
725

04:38:38.789 --> 04:38:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:43.269 --> 04:38:43.279 align:start position:0%
yes so for 7:25 it's it's estimated that
 
04:38:46.830 --> 04:38:46.840 align:start position:0%
um it will cause a total increase in
 
04:38:50.029 --> 04:38:50.039 align:start position:0%
costs by around 15 million yeah I see
 
04:38:52.830 --> 04:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
that here on the fiscal note so so you
 
04:38:54.910 --> 04:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
go from 4 million to 15 million yeah so
 
04:38:57.230 --> 04:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
let uh so can I can I make a couple of
 
04:38:59.869 --> 04:38:59.879 align:start position:0%
comments first of all the reason why we
 
04:39:03.470 --> 04:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
even discussing both 316 and 725 is that
 
04:39:05.709 --> 04:39:05.719 align:start position:0%
fundamentally all of us feel that
 
04:39:08.189 --> 04:39:08.199 align:start position:0%
ambulance services they need help and
 
04:39:11.390 --> 04:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
it's a very important life saving
 
04:39:14.029 --> 04:39:14.039 align:start position:0%
service that we need to help to continue
 
04:39:16.269 --> 04:39:16.279 align:start position:0%
that's one fact second thing both these
 
04:39:18.189 --> 04:39:18.199 align:start position:0%
bills are going to increase the premium
 
04:39:20.230 --> 04:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
so we are here for increase in in
 
04:39:22.709 --> 04:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
premiums the third thing is that the
 
04:39:24.910 --> 04:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
number that we are reading newshire
 
04:39:26.910 --> 04:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
Association of Fire Chiefs last time
 
04:39:29.269 --> 04:39:29.279 align:start position:0%
they presented this written testimony
 
04:39:30.269 --> 04:39:30.279 align:start position:0%
they are coming I don't know how they
 
04:39:32.310 --> 04:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
come with number but they come 36 cents
 
04:39:35.029 --> 04:39:35.039 align:start position:0%
per member versus 50 cents per
 
04:39:38.390 --> 04:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
member now we just heard 4.3 million to
 
04:39:42.030 --> 04:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
15 million now if you just go by linear
 
04:39:43.550 --> 04:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
you know computational
 
04:39:45.948 --> 04:39:45.958 align:start position:0%
analysis you providing
 
04:39:50.750 --> 04:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
200% help than Medicare cost that's 4.3
 
04:39:54.948 --> 04:39:54.958 align:start position:0%
million 725 is only 35% which is like
 
04:39:59.070 --> 04:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
100 just extra 35% more help than what
 
04:40:01.708 --> 04:40:01.718 align:start position:0%
you're proposing so you are increasing
 
04:40:05.830 --> 04:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
725 increases only 35% more help to
 
04:40:07.750 --> 04:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
Ambulance Service than your previous
 
04:40:10.510 --> 04:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
Bill 316 how the cost is going to become
 
04:40:13.750 --> 04:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
four 4 fold by by only
 
04:40:16.030 --> 04:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
increasing do you follow I'm
 
04:40:19.550 --> 04:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
saying the the the 316 that you
 
04:40:23.190 --> 04:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
proposing that pay only 200% of the
 
04:40:25.590 --> 04:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
Medicare rate to Ambulance Service
 
04:40:27.350 --> 04:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
that's going to increase 4.3 million
 
04:40:29.190 --> 04:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
according to what just
 
04:40:31.990 --> 04:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
heard now instead of
 
04:40:35.910 --> 04:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
giving 200% money you are now giving 3
 
04:40:40.390 --> 04:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
25% money 3 25% money is only less than
 
04:40:44.070 --> 04:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
35% additional cost on top of 200% that
 
04:40:45.868 --> 04:40:45.878 align:start position:0%
you're already giving so you're
 
04:40:48.030 --> 04:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
increasing a pay out of
 
04:40:51.070 --> 04:40:51.080 align:start position:0%
35% by the second Bill how that cost
 
04:40:51.080 --> 04:40:52.110 align:start position:0%
35% by the second Bill how that cost
increases

04:40:52.110 --> 04:40:52.120 align:start position:0%
increases
 
04:40:54.430 --> 04:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
fourfold that I don't understand it
 
04:40:57.708 --> 04:40:57.718 align:start position:0%
should be in linear because you follow
 
04:41:01.270 --> 04:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
I'm saying I got $5 I give $7 how $5
 
04:41:04.430 --> 04:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
will amount to 4.3 million versus $7
 
04:41:06.670 --> 04:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
which is second bill will amount 15
 
04:41:09.470 --> 04:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
million I don't understand where the
 
04:41:11.788 --> 04:41:11.798 align:start position:0%
disconnect is I mean is a
 
04:41:13.390 --> 04:41:13.400 align:start position:0%
I think I understand what you're saying
 
04:41:16.470 --> 04:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
and part of um the estimates for this
 
04:41:19.550 --> 04:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
impact is that you're talk we're
 
04:41:21.590 --> 04:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
talking when we're saying a percentage
 
04:41:24.550 --> 04:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
of Medicare the Medicare rates it's not
 
04:41:26.670 --> 04:41:26.680 align:start position:0%
one rate there are depending on the
 
04:41:28.590 --> 04:41:28.600 align:start position:0%
billing code there are a number of
 
04:41:30.750 --> 04:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
different rates and each one of those
 
04:41:33.190 --> 04:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
rates has a different amount associated
 
04:41:37.270 --> 04:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
with it so the an Actuarial analysis is
 
04:41:40.550 --> 04:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
using claims data to say you know
 
04:41:42.670 --> 04:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
generally of all the ambulance claims
 
04:41:45.070 --> 04:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
you know 40% of it is for this specific
 
04:41:47.788 --> 04:41:47.798 align:start position:0%
code and this amount of money so that's
 
04:41:50.110 --> 04:41:50.120 align:start position:0%
why it's totaling all of that so it's
 
04:41:52.150 --> 04:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
not linear because each code has a
 
04:41:54.670 --> 04:41:54.680 align:start position:0%
different um amount Associated I know
 
04:41:57.230 --> 04:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
but the same code applies to 200% also
 
04:42:00.670 --> 04:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
see in one case chairman wants to give
 
04:42:03.948 --> 04:42:03.958 align:start position:0%
200% for the same codes is costing is
 
04:42:08.628 --> 04:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
costing 4.3 million extra I want to give
 
04:42:12.190 --> 04:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
315 3 25% which which is only 30%
 
04:42:14.550 --> 04:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
increase of what he is proposing for the
 
04:42:17.150 --> 04:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
same codes for the same billing Cod for
 
04:42:19.270 --> 04:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
the same Services it's not like I'm
 
04:42:22.070 --> 04:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
changing service here but you know just
 
04:42:25.470 --> 04:42:25.480 align:start position:0%
a simple you know if you think simply
 
04:42:29.430 --> 04:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
how ad just the increase of extra oneir
 
04:42:31.910 --> 04:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
I mean it's one3 more 3 25% almost one3
 
04:42:34.470 --> 04:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
more than 200% right you agree with that
 
04:42:36.830 --> 04:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
right yeah so I'm giving one3 more for
 
04:42:39.310 --> 04:42:39.320 align:start position:0%
the same Services how that will cost you
 
04:42:41.550 --> 04:42:41.560 align:start position:0%
four times more than what you pay for
 
04:42:44.470 --> 04:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
200% I mean I don't see I'm sure you
 
04:42:45.670 --> 04:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
have done all the analysis and all the
 
04:42:48.510 --> 04:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
numbers but these numbers just don't you
 
04:42:51.590 --> 04:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
know make sense and I I can see where
 
04:42:53.430 --> 04:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
you're coming from but it's it's not
 
04:42:56.190 --> 04:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
that easy to um evaluate this and that's
 
04:42:58.708 --> 04:42:58.718 align:start position:0%
why we could put on a spreadsheet
 
04:43:00.470 --> 04:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
there's a way we can do a spreadsheet to
 
04:43:04.430 --> 04:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
somehow show how how that occurred how
 
04:43:06.990 --> 04:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
how with some calculations but I mean
 
04:43:09.390 --> 04:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
that's why we contract with actuaries to
 
04:43:12.310 --> 04:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
do these whole analyses and the more
 
04:43:15.030 --> 04:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
more actual analysis we ask for the more
 
04:43:16.990 --> 04:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
it cost the department money we try to
 
04:43:19.230 --> 04:43:19.240 align:start position:0%
use it sparingly okay with the analysis
 
04:43:21.110 --> 04:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
the same what you've done what is the
 
04:43:23.310 --> 04:43:23.320 align:start position:0%
per what is the per person or per family
 
04:43:25.350 --> 04:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
cost increase in both the cases do you
 
04:43:26.830 --> 04:43:26.840 align:start position:0%
have that number we don't know that
 
04:43:29.310 --> 04:43:29.320 align:start position:0%
because it that goes back to the
 
04:43:32.030 --> 04:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
intricacies of rate making we're saying
 
04:43:34.310 --> 04:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
overall healthcare costs are going to
 
04:43:36.550 --> 04:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
increase by this million doll amount
 
04:43:37.868 --> 04:43:37.878 align:start position:0%
whatever which plug in whichever
 
04:43:39.670 --> 04:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
Millions you want four 15 which one do
 
04:43:42.150 --> 04:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
you want to those the carriers then have
 
04:43:44.110 --> 04:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
different makeups so every carrier has a
 
04:43:45.470 --> 04:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
different book of business with
 
04:43:46.910 --> 04:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
different people and different types of
 
04:43:50.310 --> 04:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
plans and they need to adjust for how
 
04:43:52.670 --> 04:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
that's going to impact their plans I
 
04:43:54.868 --> 04:43:54.878 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot that goes into this
 
04:43:56.310 --> 04:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
and it's not just what carriers are
 
04:43:59.670 --> 04:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
going to pay it's also what um their
 
04:44:01.550 --> 04:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
contracts with the the covered people
 
04:44:03.990 --> 04:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
are going to pay because depending on
 
04:44:06.830 --> 04:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
whether you have a bronze silver gold
 
04:44:09.150 --> 04:44:09.160 align:start position:0%
Platinum level plan that's going to
 
04:44:11.510 --> 04:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
impact your cost sharing so when we're
 
04:44:13.470 --> 04:44:13.480 align:start position:0%
upping the rates for something it's not
 
04:44:14.708 --> 04:44:14.718 align:start position:0%
just the amount that the carriers are
 
04:44:16.430 --> 04:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
now responsible for paying it's also
 
04:44:18.310 --> 04:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
increasing the amount the consumers
 
04:44:20.110 --> 04:44:20.120 align:start position:0%
through their cost sharing will also be
 
04:44:22.470 --> 04:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
required to pay so can can I
 
04:44:25.390 --> 04:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
ask can you just you know
 
04:44:28.150 --> 04:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
say yes you would like to see more
 
04:44:30.190 --> 04:44:30.200 align:start position:0%
something more linear like more level
 
04:44:32.990 --> 04:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
more rational that that because the
 
04:44:34.350 --> 04:44:34.360 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
04:44:41.430 --> 04:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
207 203 and 325 only looks like $120
 
04:44:44.550 --> 04:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
more why why is it showing up as four
 
04:44:47.670 --> 04:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
times more and also have I got it stated
 
04:44:49.628 --> 04:44:49.638 align:start position:0%
correctly yes that's the question I have
 
04:44:51.150 --> 04:44:51.160 align:start position:0%
I mean anybody can same question so
 
04:44:53.150 --> 04:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
here's the problem here's the
 
04:44:57.430 --> 04:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
problem we have to pass a bill okay and
 
04:44:59.110 --> 04:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
the best we can do is ask the
 
04:45:01.830 --> 04:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
Departments to give us some numbers now
 
04:45:04.190 --> 04:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
if the numbers don't seem rational to
 
04:45:07.788 --> 04:45:07.798 align:start position:0%
you not to me to anybody to anybody to
 
04:45:11.270 --> 04:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
anybody then we can do nothing and that
 
04:45:14.830 --> 04:45:14.840 align:start position:0%
is really what has happened in my entire
 
04:45:17.470 --> 04:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
40 years on this
 
04:45:20.110 --> 04:45:20.120 align:start position:0%
committee where ambulance has always
 
04:45:21.150 --> 04:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
been a
 
04:45:25.590 --> 04:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
problem and we ended up doing well we we
 
04:45:27.190 --> 04:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
did direct
 
04:45:30.868 --> 04:45:30.878 align:start position:0%
pay we didn't do much okay we've never
 
04:45:33.390 --> 04:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
we we haven't really done anything so
 
04:45:35.510 --> 04:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
therefore at the end of the day you have
 
04:45:37.628 --> 04:45:37.638 align:start position:0%
to make a decision that you could say is
 
04:45:39.990 --> 04:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem rational that let's just
 
04:45:42.390 --> 04:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
go with a higher number and and see what
 
04:45:44.350 --> 04:45:44.360 align:start position:0%
happens gentlemen
 
04:45:46.788 --> 04:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
I at some point in time we've got to we
 
04:45:48.550 --> 04:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
got to pick we got to pick our poison
 
04:45:50.470 --> 04:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
here could we hear one more time from
 
04:45:52.470 --> 04:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
the gentleman from EMS that's been
 
04:45:55.110 --> 04:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
having his hand up for a while um sir
 
04:46:01.430 --> 04:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:03.910 --> 04:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
here okay I have a couple of questions
 
04:46:05.590 --> 04:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
and a couple of comments who who do you
 
04:46:10.190 --> 04:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
have questions to um okay um uh first
 
04:46:15.510 --> 04:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
one is um for you um for the Department
 
04:46:18.550 --> 04:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
um your mic is not on I think oh I'm
 
04:46:23.150 --> 04:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you um were you saying that
 
04:46:27.030 --> 04:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
the variables that you mentioned um and
 
04:46:29.270 --> 04:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
I I understand there are a lot of them
 
04:46:31.948 --> 04:46:31.958 align:start position:0%
um that that was all taken into account
 
04:46:35.510 --> 04:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
in figuring the 4 million and the 15
 
04:46:38.788 --> 04:46:38.798 align:start position:0%
million yes the actuary that we contract
 
04:46:41.510 --> 04:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
with did the analysis to estimate that
 
04:46:44.590 --> 04:46:44.600 align:start position:0%
given the suggested rates or the rates
 
04:46:46.670 --> 04:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
in whatever is being proposed in each
 
04:46:49.990 --> 04:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal note given that rate what would
 
04:46:52.470 --> 04:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
that do to overall health care costs so
 
04:46:54.548 --> 04:46:54.558 align:start position:0%
they have I don't know exactly
 
04:46:57.510 --> 04:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
everything that they did but they did of
 
04:46:59.708 --> 04:46:59.718 align:start position:0%
it and gave us the numbers thank you
 
04:47:01.230 --> 04:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
thank you okay I want to get away from
 
04:47:04.350 --> 04:47:04.360 align:start position:0%
the numbers for a minute okay um I have
 
04:47:06.830 --> 04:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
a couple of comments um there were three
 
04:47:10.030 --> 04:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
things that made me feel better um about
 
04:47:14.590 --> 04:47:14.600 align:start position:0%
316 to 725 one is the fact that 725
 
04:47:17.868 --> 04:47:17.878 align:start position:0%
would clearly raise the premiums higher
 
04:47:21.150 --> 04:47:21.160 align:start position:0%
than 316 would um correct okay the
 
04:47:23.708 --> 04:47:23.718 align:start position:0%
difference between the amount of payment
 
04:47:26.670 --> 04:47:26.680 align:start position:0%
to the providers would makes that clear
 
04:47:29.990 --> 04:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
um the second is that under 316 there's
 
04:47:32.390 --> 04:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
a review by the insurance department
 
04:47:34.430 --> 04:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
every two years correct so they can take
 
04:47:36.948 --> 04:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
into account what's happened between now
 
04:47:39.948 --> 04:47:39.958 align:start position:0%
and then and uh come up with the new
 
04:47:41.910 --> 04:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
figure and they can do that into the
 
04:47:43.628 --> 04:47:43.638 align:start position:0%
future that wasn't in
 
04:47:47.430 --> 04:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
725 um and then your argument Mr chair
 
04:47:51.390 --> 04:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
about um trying to have this one small
 
04:47:54.628 --> 04:47:54.638 align:start position:0%
part of the whole Market that we can
 
04:47:57.030 --> 04:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
control make up for all the federal
 
04:48:01.030 --> 04:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
underpayments I understood that um okay
 
04:48:03.110 --> 04:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh the one thing that I feel strongly
 
04:48:07.070 --> 04:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
about is getting rid of balance billing
 
04:48:09.948 --> 04:48:09.958 align:start position:0%
and um I didn't quite understand what
 
04:48:13.390 --> 04:48:13.400 align:start position:0%
you said earlier Mr chair um what were
 
04:48:17.628 --> 04:48:17.638 align:start position:0%
you thinking that um the Senate it when
 
04:48:19.788 --> 04:48:19.798 align:start position:0%
the Senate gets these bills that they
 
04:48:23.430 --> 04:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
might amend um whichever one we pass to
 
04:48:25.270 --> 04:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
put balance billing back in so that it
 
04:48:26.190 --> 04:48:26.200 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:48:29.310 --> 04:48:29.320 align:start position:0%
allowed um I was suggesting that I have
 
04:48:32.788 --> 04:48:32.798 align:start position:0%
a sneaking suspicion that uh some
 
04:48:35.230 --> 04:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
ambulance companies don't want to let go
 
04:48:36.430 --> 04:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
of balance
 
04:48:39.230 --> 04:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
billing and that that it is the it's the
 
04:48:41.750 --> 04:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
devil they know and and the devil they
 
04:48:43.590 --> 04:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
they built their books around and
 
04:48:45.830 --> 04:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
they've been operating all these years
 
04:48:49.750 --> 04:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
so I was suggesting that um that if we
 
04:48:53.910 --> 04:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
sent over 316 to the Senate that if that
 
04:48:56.110 --> 04:48:56.120 align:start position:0%
they could make that a choice so that
 
04:48:57.868 --> 04:48:57.878 align:start position:0%
would relevant to both the the ambulance
 
04:48:59.270 --> 04:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
company can choose which way they want
 
04:49:01.830 --> 04:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
to go so that that is a possibility that
 
04:49:03.590 --> 04:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
the Senate will put balance billing back
 
04:49:06.590 --> 04:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
in I assuming that the Senate is going
 
04:49:08.868 --> 04:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
to send us back a bill that's going to
 
04:49:11.670 --> 04:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
look very much like 725
 
04:49:13.110 --> 04:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
that is my
 
04:49:16.030 --> 04:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
suspicion okay um but with balance
 
04:49:18.110 --> 04:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
billing or without it and I was just
 
04:49:20.548 --> 04:49:20.558 align:start position:0%
saying is because that's way I am
 
04:49:26.030 --> 04:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes is a compromise is is uh that
 
04:49:26.040 --> 04:49:27.788 align:start position:0%
sometimes is a compromise is is uh that
uh

04:49:27.788 --> 04:49:27.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:49:31.070 --> 04:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
because it's funny all along this issue
 
04:49:34.270 --> 04:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
really comes down to the fact that that
 
04:49:36.390 --> 04:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
most of these ambulance companies the
 
04:49:37.830 --> 04:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
reason why they do the balance bilding
 
04:49:39.788 --> 04:49:39.798 align:start position:0%
is because they don't want to uh take
 
04:49:42.510 --> 04:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
the contract price from the insurance
 
04:49:45.030 --> 04:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
company because they think it's too low
 
04:49:47.788 --> 04:49:47.798 align:start position:0%
I got that part and so therefore if that
 
04:49:49.310 --> 04:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
is really if we're going to get down to
 
04:49:52.868 --> 04:49:52.878 align:start position:0%
where your choice is is that if you that
 
04:49:54.590 --> 04:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
we're we're going to give you offer you
 
04:49:58.230 --> 04:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
a choice that is going to quad know two
 
04:50:00.868 --> 04:50:00.878 align:start position:0%
200 times more than what Medicare was
 
04:50:02.510 --> 04:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
paying which obviously I'm sure I don't
 
04:50:03.868 --> 04:50:03.878 align:start position:0%
know where the insurance companies came
 
04:50:06.030 --> 04:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
in but let's say they were around more
 
04:50:08.868 --> 04:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
like a 100 times over Medicare so we're
 
04:50:11.190 --> 04:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
doubling doubling the potential check
 
04:50:13.070 --> 04:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
but that that if they don't if they
 
04:50:14.470 --> 04:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
still don't think that that's going to
 
04:50:16.590 --> 04:50:16.600 align:start position:0%
be good because we took away balanced
 
04:50:19.030 --> 04:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
billing then they should have the option
 
04:50:20.830 --> 04:50:20.840 align:start position:0%
to stick with the balance billing and
 
04:50:22.910 --> 04:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
stick with the way they've always
 
04:50:24.708 --> 04:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
operated and that that would be a
 
04:50:26.750 --> 04:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
potential compromise what what I'm
 
04:50:30.190 --> 04:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
suggesting is that we should be fair to
 
04:50:32.670 --> 04:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies customers and
 
04:50:35.948 --> 04:50:35.958 align:start position:0%
the providers but one thing more than
 
04:50:38.548 --> 04:50:38.558 align:start position:0%
that that we should avoid driving the
 
04:50:42.110 --> 04:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
customers slash patients crazy and the
 
04:50:44.750 --> 04:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
balance billing drives them crazy and I
 
04:50:46.590 --> 04:50:46.600 align:start position:0%
don't think that's appropriate and and
 
04:50:48.830 --> 04:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
and the reality is that you know the
 
04:50:51.390 --> 04:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
federal government understood greed and
 
04:50:53.070 --> 04:50:53.080 align:start position:0%
they fixed balance billing for
 
04:50:53.080 --> 04:50:54.628 align:start position:0%
they fixed balance billing for
everything

04:50:54.628 --> 04:50:54.638 align:start position:0%
everything
 
04:50:57.948 --> 04:50:57.958 align:start position:0%
except ambulances and so it's up to us
 
04:50:59.190 --> 04:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
to fix
 
04:51:02.230 --> 04:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
it okay thank you Mr
 
04:51:05.350 --> 04:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
chairman so first of all I I want to lay
 
04:51:07.788 --> 04:51:07.798 align:start position:0%
a couple things aside the New Hampshire
 
04:51:09.190 --> 04:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
you wanted to introduce yourself sure my
 
04:51:10.830 --> 04:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
name is Michael sear I'm the chief of
 
04:51:13.548 --> 04:51:13.558 align:start position:0%
the Tilton norfield fire district a
 
04:51:15.788 --> 04:51:15.798 align:start position:0%
small uh fire district protecting about
 
04:51:15.798 --> 04:51:17.070 align:start position:0%
small uh fire district protecting about
10,000

04:51:17.070 --> 04:51:17.080 align:start position:0%
10,000
 
04:51:20.470 --> 04:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
people um and we run a combination fire
 
04:51:22.230 --> 04:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
department which means we have full-time
 
04:51:24.190 --> 04:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
people it's mostly full-time people but
 
04:51:26.948 --> 04:51:26.958 align:start position:0%
we have some uh um part-time people
 
04:51:28.868 --> 04:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
called call Firefighters as well that
 
04:51:32.948 --> 04:51:32.958 align:start position:0%
respond with us um we do about 2200 runs
 
04:51:36.948 --> 04:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
a year and about uh 70% of those runs
 
04:51:40.830 --> 04:51:40.840 align:start position:0%
are ems in nature so the simple way of
 
04:51:43.548 --> 04:51:43.558 align:start position:0%
looking at it is my operating budget say
 
04:51:44.510 --> 04:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
it's $1
 
04:51:47.430 --> 04:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
million 70% of that operating budget is
 
04:51:49.470 --> 04:51:49.480 align:start position:0%
going to be dedicated to EMS because
 
04:51:52.310 --> 04:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
that's what we do 70% of the time the
 
04:51:54.948 --> 04:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
other 30% of the time is dedicated to
 
04:51:57.750 --> 04:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
something else that's a very simplistic
 
04:51:59.390 --> 04:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
way of putting it but it's it's it's
 
04:52:00.948 --> 04:52:00.958 align:start position:0%
really very accurate when you get into
 
04:52:03.750 --> 04:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
the numbers um and I don't I don't need
 
04:52:06.270 --> 04:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
an actual company to come in and
 
04:52:08.470 --> 04:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
determine to me what the cost of my
 
04:52:10.788 --> 04:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
service is it's very plain to me it's
 
04:52:12.830 --> 04:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
very plain to my fire Commissioners the
 
04:52:14.310 --> 04:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
board of fire Commissioners who I answer
 
04:52:17.470 --> 04:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
to um what the cost of service
 
04:52:21.390 --> 04:52:21.400 align:start position:0%
is at the same time so we develop a rate
 
04:52:23.350 --> 04:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
and our rates are adjusted annually due
 
04:52:25.548 --> 04:52:25.558 align:start position:0%
to what are cost our cost of service is
 
04:52:28.910 --> 04:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
for that the year two years prior
 
04:52:32.030 --> 04:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
because uh because of our audit and uh
 
04:52:34.070 --> 04:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
Gathering numbers everything our rates
 
04:52:37.470 --> 04:52:37.480 align:start position:0%
are set on what happened like my 2025
 
04:52:39.548 --> 04:52:39.558 align:start position:0%
rates are because of what happened in
 
04:52:39.558 --> 04:52:41.070 align:start position:0%
rates are because of what happened in
2023

04:52:41.070 --> 04:52:41.080 align:start position:0%
2023
 
04:52:43.350 --> 04:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
so we use our we have an auditing firm
 
04:52:45.310 --> 04:52:45.320 align:start position:0%
come in every year to make sure we're
 
04:52:47.110 --> 04:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
doing everything appropriately looking
 
04:52:48.788 --> 04:52:48.798 align:start position:0%
at the budget making sure the numbers
 
04:52:51.070 --> 04:52:51.080 align:start position:0%
are exact the number of transports the
 
04:52:54.070 --> 04:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
types of transports the non- transports
 
04:52:56.030 --> 04:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
so we look at all of that we look at the
 
04:52:57.868 --> 04:52:57.878 align:start position:0%
depreciation of the vehicles the
 
04:52:59.750 --> 04:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
equipment the depreciation of the
 
04:53:01.670 --> 04:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
buildings which in my case my building
 
04:53:04.190 --> 04:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
has no more depreciation because it's uh
 
04:53:07.230 --> 04:53:07.240 align:start position:0%
was built in 1867 so you can't
 
04:53:09.190 --> 04:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
depreciate we're really not taking
 
04:53:10.708 --> 04:53:10.718 align:start position:0%
testimony here you got you got to to
 
04:53:13.750 --> 04:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
your point so the point
 
04:53:19.270 --> 04:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
is the taxpayers of my fire district are
 
04:53:21.750 --> 04:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
supplementing Medicare and Medicaid
 
04:53:25.750 --> 04:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
right now but they're also supplementing
 
04:53:28.190 --> 04:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
if 316 passes they will also be
 
04:53:31.070 --> 04:53:31.080 align:start position:0%
supplementing private insurance so you
 
04:53:34.070 --> 04:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
say the 200 203 is too low it's way too
 
04:53:37.230 --> 04:53:37.240 align:start position:0%
low I I think 375 is too so you think
 
04:53:38.990 --> 04:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
the actual areial we spent all this
 
04:53:41.670 --> 04:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
money doing is number numbers are wrong
 
04:53:43.628 --> 04:53:43.638 align:start position:0%
their n their numbers are there's a lot
 
04:53:45.590 --> 04:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
of problems with that study from my
 
04:53:47.310 --> 04:53:47.320 align:start position:0%
point of view
 
04:53:50.548 --> 04:53:50.558 align:start position:0%
they eliminated the 12 highest cost
 
04:53:52.750 --> 04:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
providers in that service but didn't
 
04:53:55.548 --> 04:53:55.558 align:start position:0%
eliminate the 12 lowest cost providers
 
04:53:57.788 --> 04:53:57.798 align:start position:0%
in the service in their study because D
 
04:53:59.910 --> 04:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
bellur looked funny because it had a
 
04:54:02.430 --> 04:54:02.440 align:start position:0%
long tail from what I understand and I
 
04:54:03.990 --> 04:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
didn't attend that part of the meeting
 
04:54:06.030 --> 04:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
because I had another meeting on trying
 
04:54:07.910 --> 04:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
to replace the fire station so I saw
 
04:54:09.708 --> 04:54:09.718 align:start position:0%
some of so you would rather us just go
 
04:54:12.150 --> 04:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
out and do another study again not pass
 
04:54:14.350 --> 04:54:14.360 align:start position:0%
anything no well I'd rather you do let
 
04:54:16.510 --> 04:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
me do what I want doing now and make the
 
04:54:19.628 --> 04:54:19.638 align:start position:0%
insurance this is my I but at the same
 
04:54:22.230 --> 04:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
time I do not want to be balanced
 
04:54:23.628 --> 04:54:23.638 align:start position:0%
billing balance billing is an
 
04:54:25.708 --> 04:54:25.718 align:start position:0%
administrative headache but it's a
 
04:54:29.070 --> 04:54:29.080 align:start position:0%
reality of what we have to do to um be
 
04:54:30.430 --> 04:54:30.440 align:start position:0%
accountable to my tax what's the mix
 
04:54:31.868 --> 04:54:31.878 align:start position:0%
between balance billing and what you
 
04:54:34.070 --> 04:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
charge your taxpayers I'm s I'm sorry I
 
04:54:36.030 --> 04:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
didn't hear your question well how much
 
04:54:38.110 --> 04:54:38.120 align:start position:0%
terms of the dollar amounts that you're
 
04:54:40.830 --> 04:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
getting from your tax like I I we spent
 
04:54:43.708 --> 04:54:43.718 align:start position:0%
$336,000 in my town budget so I assume
 
04:54:46.270 --> 04:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
Jaffrey is going to be about the same so
 
04:54:48.948 --> 04:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
so as compared to tilon in sounds like
 
04:54:52.190 --> 04:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
you were two towns also yes okay so so
 
04:54:53.788 --> 04:54:53.798 align:start position:0%
you're very much similar to our
 
04:54:56.910 --> 04:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
situation so we're a fire district so uh
 
04:54:58.430 --> 04:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
the ambulance service is part of the
 
04:55:00.430 --> 04:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
fire department right so you had to
 
04:55:03.110 --> 04:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
segment that off somehow so my operating
 
04:55:05.310 --> 04:55:05.320 align:start position:0%
budget uh well the proposed operating
 
04:55:07.990 --> 04:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
budget last year uh no it was the past
 
04:55:12.070 --> 04:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
operating budget was 3.55 5
 
04:55:15.510 --> 04:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
million 7% of that for me to get compare
 
04:55:18.270 --> 04:55:18.280 align:start position:0%
mine to you I have to add back my fire
 
04:55:21.510 --> 04:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
department and and and amb and uh
 
04:55:23.590 --> 04:55:23.600 align:start position:0%
jaffre's fire department to get the
 
04:55:25.510 --> 04:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
number that to match up the way you guys
 
04:55:26.990 --> 04:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
do your number you could do it that way
 
04:55:29.350 --> 04:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
or you could subtract that 70% of my
 
04:55:32.190 --> 04:55:32.200 align:start position:0%
business is EMS so you take my 3.55
 
04:55:36.190 --> 04:55:36.200 align:start position:0%
million and just use 70% of that as your
 
04:55:38.310 --> 04:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
cost but for EMS but that's a number you
 
04:55:41.110 --> 04:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
just picked out of the air 70% no that's
 
04:55:44.590 --> 04:55:44.600 align:start position:0%
what my EMS services
 
04:55:49.590 --> 04:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
are okay so okay 70% of my business is
 
04:55:52.708 --> 04:55:52.718 align:start position:0%
EMS got it that's based on your records
 
04:55:55.230 --> 04:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
excuse me that's based on your records
 
04:55:58.150 --> 04:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am thank you okay all right we
 
04:56:00.070 --> 04:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
got we got to try to get to a solution
 
04:56:04.750 --> 04:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
here um the the other thing is uh I I
 
04:56:07.350 --> 04:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
was just thinking that maybe I would not
 
04:56:10.350 --> 04:56:10.360 align:start position:0%
want to kill 725 that I would want to
 
04:56:12.670 --> 04:56:12.680 align:start position:0%
retain that in case case this whole
 
04:56:14.830 --> 04:56:14.840 align:start position:0%
thing implodes when we get to committee
 
04:56:16.948 --> 04:56:16.958 align:start position:0%
a conference that at least we have
 
04:56:18.948 --> 04:56:18.958 align:start position:0%
another bill we can introduce for next
 
04:56:20.788 --> 04:56:20.798 align:start position:0%
year and chairman you mentioned uh you
 
04:56:23.230 --> 04:56:23.240 align:start position:0%
just you just mentioned before that uh I
 
04:56:24.628 --> 04:56:24.638 align:start position:0%
don't know where you got the comment
 
04:56:27.030 --> 04:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
from but you did mention that I know
 
04:56:28.830 --> 04:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
that Senate might be more willing to
 
04:56:33.270 --> 04:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
pass 725 vers 316 so and you have done
 
04:56:35.990 --> 04:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
quite good du deligence on 316 so why
 
04:56:37.868 --> 04:56:37.878 align:start position:0%
don't you combine those two I mean the
 
04:56:38.990 --> 04:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
only difference you can't combine it
 
04:56:40.910 --> 04:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
because they're both opposite no but but
 
04:56:42.948 --> 04:56:42.958 align:start position:0%
combining what I meant is that in 316
 
04:56:44.628 --> 04:56:44.638 align:start position:0%
you have done very good due diligence to
 
04:56:46.830 --> 04:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
put audit every two years and all those
 
04:56:48.910 --> 04:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
good things right the only difference in
 
04:56:52.310 --> 04:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
the number is 200% versus 3 325 see
 
04:56:54.470 --> 04:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
that's the funny thing about 316 the
 
04:56:57.868 --> 04:56:57.878 align:start position:0%
200% is not in the bill the bill the
 
04:57:00.190 --> 04:57:00.200 align:start position:0%
bill is based upon the
 
04:57:02.868 --> 04:57:02.878 align:start position:0%
report so that's not even they not so
 
04:57:04.590 --> 04:57:04.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's not even known then so
 
04:57:07.070 --> 04:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's based upon the analysis
 
04:57:09.628 --> 04:57:09.638 align:start position:0%
and and the calculated analysis so I
 
04:57:11.948 --> 04:57:11.958 align:start position:0%
that's just just stick with at this
 
04:57:14.390 --> 04:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
point I now we will not make the motion
 
04:57:17.230 --> 04:57:17.240 align:start position:0%
of inexpedient on 725 um I would like to
 
04:57:19.510 --> 04:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
make that motion to be retained so we
 
04:57:22.030 --> 04:57:22.040 align:start position:0%
retain that bill for both and and then
 
04:57:24.708 --> 04:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
for 316 obviously I'm I'm hoping for an
 
04:57:27.110 --> 04:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
not to pass and I realize that some of
 
04:57:29.990 --> 04:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
you might want to vote
 
04:57:32.350 --> 04:57:32.360 align:start position:0%
now yeah I
 
04:57:38.510 --> 04:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:41.230 --> 04:57:41.240 align:start position:0%
comments no no I mean something is
 
04:57:43.788 --> 04:57:43.798 align:start position:0%
better than nothing
 
04:57:43.798 --> 04:57:46.430 align:start position:0%
better than nothing
okay

04:57:46.430 --> 04:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:57:52.190 --> 04:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
okay all right so um I move on um on
 
04:57:57.788 --> 04:57:57.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:00.030 --> 04:58:00.040 align:start position:0%
retain that mean we'll we'll discuss
 
04:58:01.788 --> 04:58:01.798 align:start position:0%
this again in January means we'll
 
04:58:04.310 --> 04:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
discuss it in September after we' seen
 
04:58:07.430 --> 04:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
what happened what happens to 316 yeah
 
04:58:08.990 --> 04:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
why don't you let both the bills go
 
04:58:12.190 --> 04:58:12.200 align:start position:0%
together at the same time you're no no
 
04:58:13.350 --> 04:58:13.360 align:start position:0%
we're not going to retain we're going to
 
04:58:16.548 --> 04:58:16.558 align:start position:0%
pass something no both let we don't pass
 
04:58:18.708 --> 04:58:18.718 align:start position:0%
to no you you you have a you have you
 
04:58:21.430 --> 04:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
choose a policy and you stick to it okay
 
04:58:24.310 --> 04:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
so our the bill we want to go with is I
 
04:58:26.590 --> 04:58:26.600 align:start position:0%
would like to retain
 
04:58:26.600 --> 04:58:28.270 align:start position:0%
would like to retain
725

04:58:28.270 --> 04:58:28.280 align:start position:0%
725
 
04:58:32.110 --> 04:58:32.120 align:start position:0%
um are we ready is is the question
 
04:58:34.788 --> 04:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
clear okay all those in favor of
 
04:58:34.798 --> 04:58:35.788 align:start position:0%
clear okay all those in favor of
retaining

04:58:35.788 --> 04:58:35.798 align:start position:0%
retaining
 
04:58:43.070 --> 04:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
725 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven eight
 
04:58:47.990 --> 04:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:50.110 --> 04:58:50.120 align:start position:0%
right because Brian's here so it's got
 
04:58:54.830 --> 04:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:00.510 --> 04:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
retain okay so that no it's really not
 
04:59:02.470 --> 04:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
it's really not the problem is I can't
 
04:59:06.910 --> 04:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
see people that's my problem okay so uh
 
04:59:09.110 --> 04:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
and that was hunt and second by
 
04:59:11.868 --> 04:59:11.878 align:start position:0%
representative burrow
 
04:59:11.878 --> 04:59:13.150 align:start position:0%
representative burrow
okay

04:59:13.150 --> 04:59:13.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:59:13.160 --> 04:59:14.910 align:start position:0%
okay
now

04:59:14.910 --> 04:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:59:17.070 --> 04:59:17.080 align:start position:0%
316 um I will
 
04:59:17.080 --> 04:59:20.830 align:start position:0%
316 um I will
move

04:59:20.830 --> 04:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:24.910 --> 04:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
call oh okay that's fine y okay
 
04:59:30.270 --> 04:59:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:32.830 --> 04:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
pass second by representative
 
04:59:35.830 --> 04:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
Burrows any discussion on the motion of
 
04:59:37.670 --> 04:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
ought to
 
04:59:41.310 --> 04:59:41.320 align:start position:0%
pass all those in favor raise raise your
 
04:59:43.788 --> 04:59:43.798 align:start position:0%
hand but we can have something right

four no we don't
 
04:59:52.868 --> 04:59:52.878 align:start position:0%

mistake okay so the most
 
05:00:15.548 --> 05:00:15.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:19.310 --> 05:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
be okay so what was the the vote is uh

05:00:50.958 --> 05:00:54.310 align:start position:0%
 
transparency

05:00:54.310 --> 05:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:08.548 --> 05:01:08.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:10.788 --> 05:01:10.798 align:start position:0%
right all right what do we want to do
 
05:01:12.628 --> 05:01:12.638 align:start position:0%
with this
 
05:01:12.638 --> 05:01:36.230 align:start position:0%
with this
one

05:01:36.230 --> 05:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:40.390 --> 05:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
705 okay so when did we just got this I
 
05:01:43.390 --> 05:01:43.400 align:start position:0%

Hees okay so what are we doing with this
 
05:01:57.110 --> 05:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
this is what we would recommend and we
 
05:01:58.150 --> 05:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
understand it's approved by
 
05:02:02.390 --> 05:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon yes and um if you
 
05:02:04.830 --> 05:02:04.840 align:start position:0%
would like me to explain the amendment
 
05:02:07.948 --> 05:02:07.958 align:start position:0%
okay so but but I obviously I have it
 
05:02:10.708 --> 05:02:10.718 align:start position:0%
who's for who wrote this the
 
05:02:14.350 --> 05:02:14.360 align:start position:0%
yeah we did okay okay going to pass okay
 
05:02:36.990 --> 05:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:37.000 --> 05:02:38.510 align:start position:0%
 
it

05:02:38.510 --> 05:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:02:59.750 --> 05:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:01.708 --> 05:03:01.718 align:start position:0%
okay as you will
 
05:03:05.548 --> 05:03:05.558 align:start position:0%
recall this bill originally was uh for
 
05:03:08.270 --> 05:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
the purpose of taking the Federal
 
05:03:12.110 --> 05:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
Regulation on transparency and coverage
 
05:03:14.788 --> 05:03:14.798 align:start position:0%
which requires Health carriers to post
 
05:03:17.430 --> 05:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
their negotiated rates with healthc care
 
05:03:21.628 --> 05:03:21.638 align:start position:0%
providers and put it in state law and
 
05:03:21.638 --> 05:03:22.390 align:start position:0%
providers and put it in state law and
the

05:03:22.390 --> 05:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:03:25.190 --> 05:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
other uh special thing that the bill
 
05:03:28.990 --> 05:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
does did originally was to require that
 
05:03:32.230 --> 05:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
the information be put in a uniform
 
05:03:35.390 --> 05:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
format so that uh the department would
 
05:03:37.910 --> 05:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
have access to the information in a
 
05:03:41.470 --> 05:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
uniform format and could put out
 
05:03:43.270 --> 05:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
information to the public allowing
 
05:03:46.590 --> 05:03:46.600 align:start position:0%
people to make comparisons between
 
05:03:50.190 --> 05:03:50.200 align:start position:0%
prices um what happened and there was a
 
05:03:54.070 --> 05:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
push back from Health carriers on having
 
05:03:57.910 --> 05:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
to put the data that they now post in a
 
05:03:57.920 --> 05:03:59.110 align:start position:0%
to put the data that they now post in a
uniform

05:03:59.110 --> 05:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
uniform
 
05:04:02.390 --> 05:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
format what has happened since then is
 
05:04:05.910 --> 05:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
um that the president has issued an
 
05:04:08.830 --> 05:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
executive order this was it's only about
 
05:04:10.948 --> 05:04:10.958 align:start position:0%
2 weeks old
 
05:04:15.350 --> 05:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
requiring that very same thing that the
 
05:04:18.470 --> 05:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
um the price information be put in a
 
05:04:21.070 --> 05:04:21.080 align:start position:0%
uniform format and that the three
 
05:04:23.350 --> 05:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
federal agencies that are responsible
 
05:04:26.948 --> 05:04:26.958 align:start position:0%
for writing the regulation revise their
 
05:04:31.110 --> 05:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
guidance to require the uniform format
 
05:04:34.470 --> 05:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
so that people can make that those
 
05:04:37.948 --> 05:04:37.958 align:start position:0%
comparisons so this amendment recognizes
 
05:04:40.910 --> 05:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
the existence of the Federal Executive
 
05:04:44.190 --> 05:04:44.200 align:start position:0%
Order and the fact that it requires the
 
05:04:47.030 --> 05:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
agencies to amend their guidance within
 
05:04:50.708 --> 05:04:50.718 align:start position:0%
90 days and it says that the um
 
05:04:50.718 --> 05:04:51.868 align:start position:0%
90 days and it says that the um
Insurance

05:04:51.868 --> 05:04:51.878 align:start position:0%
Insurance
 
05:04:54.910 --> 05:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
Department's standard for uniform format
 
05:04:56.590 --> 05:04:56.600 align:start position:0%
has to be consistent with the new
 
05:04:56.600 --> 05:04:58.430 align:start position:0%
has to be consistent with the new
federal

05:04:58.430 --> 05:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
federal
 
05:04:58.440 --> 05:05:01.708 align:start position:0%
federal
guidance

05:05:01.708 --> 05:05:01.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:04.590 --> 05:05:04.600 align:start position:0%
so yes so this is not official Amendment
 
05:05:08.628 --> 05:05:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:12.070 --> 05:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
yes which is what I I Char was my charge
 
05:05:13.830 --> 05:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
was that I I really didn't want to
 
05:05:16.150 --> 05:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
reinvent the wheel so that that what we
 
05:05:21.590 --> 05:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:28.430 --> 05:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:30.788 --> 05:05:30.798 align:start position:0%
Tuesday because by next Tuesday we'll
 
05:05:37.110 --> 05:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:40.110 --> 05:05:40.120 align:start position:0%
up okay any other questions to the
 
05:05:40.120 --> 05:05:42.150 align:start position:0%
up okay any other questions to the
committee

05:05:42.150 --> 05:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:05:47.150 --> 05:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
members get off easy Alex thank
 
05:05:50.948 --> 05:05:50.958 align:start position:0%
you okay so um I assume we're all okay
 
05:05:53.830 --> 05:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
with with this and and we'll have that
 
05:05:53.840 --> 05:05:56.270 align:start position:0%
with with this and and we'll have that
Amendment

05:05:56.270 --> 05:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
05:06:02.788 --> 05:06:02.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:04.868 --> 05:06:04.878 align:start position:0%
transparency oh
 
05:06:07.270 --> 05:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
right um I passed out a few of you that
 
05:06:12.590 --> 05:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:15.750 --> 05:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
rest if you already if you already have
 
05:06:17.230 --> 05:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
one uh please don't take another one
 
05:06:18.590 --> 05:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
because I think I have just enough for
 
05:06:20.510 --> 05:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
for everybody but representing Harvard
 
05:06:22.230 --> 05:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
Pilgrim Healthcare uh again the state's
 
05:06:23.590 --> 05:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
not for profit health insurance company
 
05:06:26.430 --> 05:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
and we had some strong objections to uh
 
05:06:29.030 --> 05:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
the bill in part because and and the
 
05:06:30.470 --> 05:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
department is right the the overall
 
05:06:32.990 --> 05:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
situation is the feds have required uh
 
05:06:36.030 --> 05:06:36.040 align:start position:0%
data reporting um and that did not go
 
05:06:38.350 --> 05:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
well because they did not specify
 
05:06:39.590 --> 05:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
exactly how it was supposed to be
 
05:06:41.070 --> 05:06:41.080 align:start position:0%
reported so everybody's doing something
 
05:06:43.990 --> 05:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
different so the data is fairly useless
 
05:06:46.270 --> 05:06:46.280 align:start position:0%
for the stated purpose of allowing
 
05:06:48.270 --> 05:06:48.280 align:start position:0%
people to compare uh and see what's
 
05:06:52.548 --> 05:06:52.558 align:start position:0%
going on um so uh our L one of our big
 
05:06:54.070 --> 05:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
concerns certainly was the amount of
 
05:06:56.230 --> 05:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
time and effort it took and money to
 
05:06:57.910 --> 05:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
contract with companies to actually do
 
05:07:00.430 --> 05:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
this thing for the federal side uh why
 
05:07:03.190 --> 05:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
do we would want to recreate that and go
 
05:07:05.310 --> 05:07:05.320 align:start position:0%
through that whole process again when
 
05:07:06.830 --> 05:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
why can't they just fix it on the
 
05:07:09.548 --> 05:07:09.558 align:start position:0%
federal side and make it so that the
 
05:07:11.590 --> 05:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
stuff is transparent so that's a copy of
 
05:07:13.110 --> 05:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
the third page I think of the
 
05:07:15.948 --> 05:07:15.958 align:start position:0%
president's executive order um and the I
 
05:07:17.190 --> 05:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
think I put a little stars on the
 
05:07:18.628 --> 05:07:18.638 align:start position:0%
sections that are they're applicable
 
05:07:20.750 --> 05:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
basically the president has told the uh
 
05:07:23.350 --> 05:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
three cabinet secretaries uh get
 
05:07:25.350 --> 05:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
together in 90 days figures out how to
 
05:07:27.230 --> 05:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
fix us uh and especially I think
 
05:07:29.190 --> 05:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
paragraph sub paragraph B there says
 
05:07:32.110 --> 05:07:32.120 align:start position:0%
find a standardized way uh so people can
 
05:07:34.708 --> 05:07:34.718 align:start position:0%
do what we want them to do so if the
 
05:07:36.030 --> 05:07:36.040 align:start position:0%
federal data is there it basically
 
05:07:37.788 --> 05:07:37.798 align:start position:0%
requires us to to post on our website or
 
05:07:39.150 --> 05:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
put a link it's a huge file I think I
 
05:07:40.110 --> 05:07:40.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned the other day how many
 
05:07:42.150 --> 05:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
hundreds of megabytes it was uh but we
 
05:07:44.868 --> 05:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
put a link to it on our um website as
 
05:07:47.350 --> 05:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
all carriers will have to so rather than
 
05:07:49.868 --> 05:07:49.878 align:start position:0%
have us do something to create something
 
05:07:52.510 --> 05:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
special for the Department why can't the
 
05:07:54.708 --> 05:07:54.718 align:start position:0%
department just use that data assuming
 
05:07:56.510 --> 05:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
that everybody's going to be using the
 
05:07:58.708 --> 05:07:58.718 align:start position:0%
same format from now on so uh our
 
05:07:59.948 --> 05:07:59.958 align:start position:0%
suggestion is I know you don't want to
 
05:08:01.470 --> 05:08:01.480 align:start position:0%
retain bills I was thinking retain the
 
05:08:03.628 --> 05:08:03.638 align:start position:0%
bill uh see what happens after 90 days
 
05:08:06.708 --> 05:08:06.718 align:start position:0%
see what recommendations they have um
 
05:08:09.750 --> 05:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
rather than go through all this really a
 
05:08:13.270 --> 05:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
lot of extra work and um you know we
 
05:08:14.788 --> 05:08:14.798 align:start position:0%
basically Harvard Pilgrim has to
 
05:08:17.708 --> 05:08:17.718 align:start position:0%
contract uh these Services out so it's
 
05:08:18.868 --> 05:08:18.878 align:start position:0%
not like we have people sitting around
 
05:08:20.670 --> 05:08:20.680 align:start position:0%
in this non- Excel spreadsheet now this
 
05:08:22.310 --> 05:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
is this is a lot of work and I think at
 
05:08:23.990 --> 05:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
the public hearing somebody said well
 
05:08:25.150 --> 05:08:25.160 align:start position:0%
they have people called software
 
05:08:26.750 --> 05:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
engineers and I would say yes I know I'm
 
05:08:29.030 --> 05:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
one I have a degree in computer science
 
05:08:30.948 --> 05:08:30.958 align:start position:0%
I started a software company grew it to
 
05:08:33.430 --> 05:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
the Inc 500 list sold thousands of
 
05:08:35.310 --> 05:08:35.320 align:start position:0%
copies of software all over the country
 
05:08:38.548 --> 05:08:38.558 align:start position:0%
um this is not a trivial matter and so
 
05:08:40.868 --> 05:08:40.878 align:start position:0%
we think get the federal system fixed so
 
05:08:41.990 --> 05:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have to reinvent the wheel at
 
05:08:45.510 --> 05:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
the state side thank
 
05:08:45.520 --> 05:08:47.350 align:start position:0%
the state side thank
you

05:08:47.350 --> 05:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:08:51.510 --> 05:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative Gibbs thank you um
 
05:08:55.390 --> 05:08:55.400 align:start position:0%
relative to the uh executive order um
 
05:08:58.948 --> 05:08:58.958 align:start position:0%
can this be done in 90 days well it's uh
 
05:09:00.390 --> 05:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
we'll see that's I think the directive
 
05:09:02.190 --> 05:09:02.200 align:start position:0%
is come back to me within 90 days and
 
05:09:05.110 --> 05:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
say okay how do we fix this uh how do we
 
05:09:06.510 --> 05:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
fix this at the federal level this all
 
05:09:07.990 --> 05:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
started with an executive order from I
 
05:09:09.868 --> 05:09:09.878 align:start position:0%
believe President Trump the first time
 
05:09:11.310 --> 05:09:11.320 align:start position:0%
that put all this together and clearly
 
05:09:12.548 --> 05:09:12.558 align:start position:0%
it wasn't specific enough so he's
 
05:09:14.670 --> 05:09:14.680 align:start position:0%
basically saying to his people go back
 
05:09:16.070 --> 05:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
figure out how to fix it and come back
 
05:09:18.110 --> 05:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
and tell me and then we'll fix it so
 
05:09:19.910 --> 05:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
okay but the problem with retaining
 
05:09:23.510 --> 05:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
means we would not have anything P we
 
05:09:25.430 --> 05:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
can't pass anything until
 
05:09:28.948 --> 05:09:28.958 align:start position:0%
January right so would we get in trouble
 
05:09:31.590 --> 05:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
if there was a federal plan and we
 
05:09:35.110 --> 05:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
didn't have a state plan until next June
 
05:09:36.390 --> 05:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement to have a state
 
05:09:38.390 --> 05:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
plan at all the feds require the
 
05:09:40.948 --> 05:09:40.958 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier to provide this data
 
05:09:43.070 --> 05:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
so why why are we passing legislation
 
05:09:44.430 --> 05:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
why why well yeah I mean we would not be
 
05:09:45.830 --> 05:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
disappointed if the bill got killed but
 
05:09:47.548 --> 05:09:47.558 align:start position:0%
we you know we appreciate we we do
 
05:09:49.150 --> 05:09:49.160 align:start position:0%
understand and agree in concept what the
 
05:09:51.310 --> 05:09:51.320 align:start position:0%
department is looking to do is is get
 
05:09:53.270 --> 05:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
data you're you're you're you're making
 
05:09:56.190 --> 05:09:56.200 align:start position:0%
it too easy for me what why I guess let
 
05:09:57.750 --> 05:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
me ask the department is there a
 
05:09:59.670 --> 05:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
rational reason why we need to have a
 
05:10:01.910 --> 05:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
state law well it's
 
05:10:04.230 --> 05:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
important I I should have had you over
 
05:10:04.240 --> 05:10:04.948 align:start position:0%
important I I should have had you over
here

05:10:04.948 --> 05:10:04.958 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:10:08.628 --> 05:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
Alex okay um it's important that the
 
05:10:10.830 --> 05:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
carriers have a legal obligation to
 
05:10:14.270 --> 05:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
provide us accurate data but that's a
 
05:10:17.190 --> 05:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
federal is this but if this is a federal
 
05:10:20.030 --> 05:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
right law it's a federal La they have
 
05:10:21.830 --> 05:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
their own consequences I know they don't
 
05:10:23.948 --> 05:10:23.958 align:start position:0%
have you're so the licenses you're
 
05:10:25.990 --> 05:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
looking at John Hunt's rule of licensure
 
05:10:29.070 --> 05:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
we is a big piece of this in state and
 
05:10:30.990 --> 05:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
so you want to be able to take that you
 
05:10:34.350 --> 05:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
want to be able to tell them they' been
 
05:10:36.788 --> 05:10:36.798 align:start position:0%
get feds have not been good on data
 
05:10:40.350 --> 05:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement we are good at it
 
05:10:41.470 --> 05:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
and I
 
05:10:44.470 --> 05:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
think traditionally CMS has deferred to
 
05:10:49.310 --> 05:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
the states to enforce this and um where
 
05:10:51.350 --> 05:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
we have the chiz that we have a whole
 
05:10:54.030 --> 05:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
department or division dedicated to data
 
05:10:55.590 --> 05:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
analytics there's a lot of great data
 
05:10:57.110 --> 05:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
here we would like to be able to use it
 
05:10:58.788 --> 05:10:58.798 align:start position:0%
but in order to do that we need to
 
05:11:00.310 --> 05:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
standardize the for what's the effective
 
05:11:04.190 --> 05:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
dat oh P passage oh great well I mean
 
05:11:06.190 --> 05:11:06.200 align:start position:0%
the proposed legislation is really just
 
05:11:07.990 --> 05:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
giving us can we say the Act will take
 
05:11:11.430 --> 05:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
effect upon passage of the federal
 
05:11:14.390 --> 05:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
legislation sure sure that could be a
 
05:11:16.830 --> 05:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
condition how about
 
05:11:19.830 --> 05:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
that does that sound better
 
05:11:22.750 --> 05:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
Pete I think that makes him
 
05:11:24.750 --> 05:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
happy you don't you don't think that'll
 
05:11:27.030 --> 05:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
work Paul well why don't you just say
 
05:11:28.990 --> 05:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
that uh the New Hampshire license
 
05:11:30.470 --> 05:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier shall comply with this
 
05:11:32.628 --> 05:11:32.638 align:start position:0%
federal law uh rather than say because
 
05:11:34.070 --> 05:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
this is still gives the department the
 
05:11:35.910 --> 05:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
ability to make their own format and we
 
05:11:37.150 --> 05:11:37.160 align:start position:0%
have to go through the whole thing again
 
05:11:38.628 --> 05:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
we'll tell you what our format is it'll
 
05:11:40.190 --> 05:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
be in Federal law what the format is
 
05:11:41.430 --> 05:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
then you can go to the data and get it
 
05:11:43.590 --> 05:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
yourself uh and then we don't have to
 
05:11:50.390 --> 05:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:54.590 --> 05:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
wheel theal La well is in this no I
 
05:11:57.190 --> 05:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't saying follow it I was saying
 
05:12:00.430 --> 05:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
upon that when was the effective date oh
 
05:12:07.788 --> 05:12:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:10.430 --> 05:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
um all right
 
05:12:15.868 --> 05:12:15.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:19.548 --> 05:12:19.558 align:start position:0%
egg so this legislation is not um
 
05:12:21.470 --> 05:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
dictating any specific format it doesn't
 
05:12:23.510 --> 05:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily give us the ability to
 
05:12:25.430 --> 05:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
require any kind of format what we're
 
05:12:27.430 --> 05:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
trying to do is get a standardized
 
05:12:30.110 --> 05:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
format just like the federal government
 
05:12:32.270 --> 05:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
so that we can actually use this data as
 
05:12:34.590 --> 05:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
intended what we're planning on doing is
 
05:12:36.910 --> 05:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
paying backing off of whatever the feds
 
05:12:38.670 --> 05:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
come up with we just want the ability to
 
05:12:41.590 --> 05:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
enforce it and that's why we've brought
 
05:12:43.708 --> 05:12:43.718 align:start position:0%
this legislation is to make sure that we
 
05:12:45.548 --> 05:12:45.558 align:start position:0%
have everything we need to enforce the
 
05:12:47.708 --> 05:12:47.718 align:start position:0%
transparency and coverage Provisions
 
05:12:50.270 --> 05:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
that CMS is expecting us to enforce and
 
05:12:51.628 --> 05:12:51.638 align:start position:0%
so that we can actually start using this
 
05:12:57.910 --> 05:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:59.990 --> 05:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
purpose and that's what this amendment
 
05:13:03.470 --> 05:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
is it's it's amending the bill to align
 
05:13:05.990 --> 05:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
with the uh Federal Executive Order okay
 
05:13:13.070 --> 05:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:15.190 --> 05:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
yeah some of it is you in terms of name
 
05:13:18.948 --> 05:13:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:21.910 --> 05:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
stuff so I know the original bill and I
 
05:13:24.310 --> 05:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
didn't look for this in the amendment um
 
05:13:25.708 --> 05:13:25.718 align:start position:0%
but the original Bill allow the
 
05:13:27.230 --> 05:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner to establish what the
 
05:13:29.590 --> 05:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
format should be um and whether that's
 
05:13:31.150 --> 05:13:31.160 align:start position:0%
changed in the amendment I'm not sure is
 
05:13:34.430 --> 05:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
that in here Alex so says be consistent
 
05:13:37.430 --> 05:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
with the feral Federal hasent with
 
05:13:37.440 --> 05:13:39.310 align:start position:0%
with the feral Federal hasent with
Federal

05:13:39.310 --> 05:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
05:13:42.750 --> 05:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
P this is a chicken in the egg so does
 
05:13:48.628 --> 05:13:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:53.230 --> 05:13:53.240 align:start position:0%
we and my Specialists on this have have
 
05:13:55.230 --> 05:13:55.240 align:start position:0%
concerns about time frame I think we
 
05:13:58.150 --> 05:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
share similar concerns progr also sort
 
05:14:01.750 --> 05:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
of the question of why it's needed but
 
05:14:03.628 --> 05:14:03.638 align:start position:0%
we have not a chance only of the
 
05:14:06.990 --> 05:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
department so I think my general concern
 
05:14:09.590 --> 05:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
is around timing and amount of
 
05:14:13.708 --> 05:14:13.718 align:start position:0%
have to the federal rules they come out
 
05:14:16.788 --> 05:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
and the state as well yes so I my fear
 
05:14:19.788 --> 05:14:19.798 align:start position:0%
is that the feds may take forever to get
 
05:14:19.798 --> 05:14:21.230 align:start position:0%
is that the feds may take forever to get
it

05:14:21.230 --> 05:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:14:24.708 --> 05:14:24.718 align:start position:0%
done that's my but we don't live in a
 
05:14:26.708 --> 05:14:26.718 align:start position:0%
world we have you know we have to do one
 
05:14:28.110 --> 05:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
thing for the federal government and
 
05:14:30.750 --> 05:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
then do something slightly different for
 
05:14:33.868 --> 05:14:33.878 align:start position:0%
a reason that's unknown to me for the
 
05:14:35.910 --> 05:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
state and I guess we're questioning the
 
05:14:37.948 --> 05:14:37.958 align:start position:0%
urgency whoever's speaking please speak
 
05:14:50.548 --> 05:14:50.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:54.270 --> 05:14:54.280 align:start position:0%
you I guess so sorry about that Sabrina
 
05:14:57.750 --> 05:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
dlab from Anthem um again we got this
 
05:14:59.510 --> 05:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday and so I just got feedback
 
05:15:00.990 --> 05:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
from my team so I was trying to chat
 
05:15:02.070 --> 05:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
with the department but it's a little
 
05:15:05.390 --> 05:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
bit rushed um so what I've gleaned from
 
05:15:07.708 --> 05:15:07.718 align:start position:0%
our specialist is there's concern around
 
05:15:09.510 --> 05:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
the timing and how much time we would
 
05:15:12.310 --> 05:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
have to once the federal requirements
 
05:15:14.310 --> 05:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
come out then comply with state law and
 
05:15:16.190 --> 05:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
I guess we share Harvard pilgram sort of
 
05:15:19.230 --> 05:15:19.240 align:start position:0%
general questions around the urgency of
 
05:15:21.390 --> 05:15:21.400 align:start position:0%
why this is needed right now so we would
 
05:15:23.390 --> 05:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
agree with
 
05:15:25.310 --> 05:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
retaining and I think our team would
 
05:15:27.868 --> 05:15:27.878 align:start position:0%
also not be sad if the bill went away
 
05:15:32.350 --> 05:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
but trying to be collaborative so so
 
05:15:36.788 --> 05:15:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:39.030 --> 05:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
concerns and from the Department's
 
05:15:42.270 --> 05:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
perspective we're trying to advance the
 
05:15:44.390 --> 05:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
whole rationale behind transparency and
 
05:15:45.948 --> 05:15:45.958 align:start position:0%
coverage and actually get that
 
05:15:48.270 --> 05:15:48.280 align:start position:0%
transparency out there in order to do
 
05:15:50.548 --> 05:15:50.558 align:start position:0%
that we need these changes so that we
 
05:15:53.430 --> 05:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
can actually use the
 
05:15:55.510 --> 05:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
data so one other thing I'm just looking
 
05:15:57.788 --> 05:15:57.798 align:start position:0%
at the email from our team if I could um
 
05:15:59.430 --> 05:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
it says the from the amendment
 
05:16:00.830 --> 05:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
Provisions would be applicable for plan
 
05:16:03.670 --> 05:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
years beginning onor after 1126 this is
 
05:16:06.628 --> 05:16:06.638 align:start position:0%
an aggressive timeline uh it's unclear
 
05:16:08.230 --> 05:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
Federal guidance will be finalized by
 
05:16:10.390 --> 05:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
then and and they said at the very least
 
05:16:11.868 --> 05:16:11.878 align:start position:0%
we need a reasonable Runway from the
 
05:16:13.708 --> 05:16:13.718 align:start position:0%
date of finalized Federal guidance at
 
05:16:16.230 --> 05:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
least 6 months from the date final
 
05:16:19.590 --> 05:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
regulations are issued perhaps longer so
 
05:16:21.190 --> 05:16:21.200 align:start position:0%
that's just I would say that's the
 
05:16:23.230 --> 05:16:23.240 align:start position:0%
problem with the retaining is that
 
05:16:25.910 --> 05:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
retaining means you this wouldn't become
 
05:16:30.150 --> 05:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
law until at best next May so then we're
 
05:16:32.910 --> 05:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
in a world where we're complying with
 
05:16:34.670 --> 05:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
state requirements on this issue and
 
05:16:36.990 --> 05:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
then Federal Regulations are updated and
 
05:16:38.390 --> 05:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
we're then complying with those it's
 
05:16:38.400 --> 05:16:39.548 align:start position:0%
we're then complying with those it's
just

05:16:39.548 --> 05:16:39.558 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:16:42.350 --> 05:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
it it is a lift and I think I don't
 
05:16:43.948 --> 05:16:43.958 align:start position:0%
quite see the reason
 
05:16:46.868 --> 05:16:46.878 align:start position:0%
for needing to get a state law through
 
05:16:50.230 --> 05:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
on this at this moment so again we did
 
05:16:52.390 --> 05:16:52.400 align:start position:0%
not have a lot of time to process we've
 
05:16:53.628 --> 05:16:53.638 align:start position:0%
been talking in the department I'm not
 
05:16:56.390 --> 05:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
trying to you know say bades we haven't
 
05:16:58.070 --> 05:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
had a lot time to look at the amendment
 
05:16:59.990 --> 05:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
my saying the effective date should be
 
05:17:03.670 --> 05:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
when the Act take takes effect for
 
05:17:06.430 --> 05:17:06.440 align:start position:0%
federally seems like the right answer
 
05:17:08.430 --> 05:17:08.440 align:start position:0%
the federal statute requiring this has
 
05:17:10.990 --> 05:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
been an effect for a while this is
 
05:17:14.510 --> 05:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
really just the guidance in how you're
 
05:17:17.230 --> 05:17:17.240 align:start position:0%
putting together the I got that isn't
 
05:17:20.070 --> 05:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
there effective where the feds say that
 
05:17:22.390 --> 05:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
they expect someone to be in compliance
 
05:17:24.548 --> 05:17:24.558 align:start position:0%
with their statute depending on how they
 
05:17:26.230 --> 05:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
do it they could issue it in guidance
 
05:17:30.190 --> 05:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
and there's not necessarily um rules go
 
05:17:32.470 --> 05:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
we like guidance right don't we like and
 
05:17:35.150 --> 05:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to proceed that way if um
 
05:17:36.670 --> 05:17:36.680 align:start position:0%
you guys think it's appropriate we can
 
05:17:38.510 --> 05:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
issue our guidance as well because these
 
05:17:38.520 --> 05:17:39.788 align:start position:0%
issue our guidance as well because these
are

05:17:39.788 --> 05:17:39.798 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:17:42.390 --> 05:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
laws that are already on the books we're
 
05:17:44.230 --> 05:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
really just trying to get some
 
05:17:46.750 --> 05:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
consistency in the way it's
 
05:17:50.150 --> 05:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
being compiled that what the underlying
 
05:17:52.788 --> 05:17:52.798 align:start position:0%
data requirements are not changing it's
 
05:17:56.510 --> 05:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
just the way that they're being compiled
 
05:17:58.948 --> 05:17:58.958 align:start position:0%
disclosed it's a formatting issue and
 
05:18:00.470 --> 05:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
format Jason feel free to come up if you
 
05:18:11.910 --> 05:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:13.830 --> 05:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Shar just a quick moment uh
 
05:18:15.708 --> 05:18:15.718 align:start position:0%
Jason I a director of Health Economics
 
05:18:17.190 --> 05:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire insurance department I
 
05:18:19.350 --> 05:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
work with the data the claims data
 
05:18:20.910 --> 05:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
indeed with the hospital price
 
05:18:22.948 --> 05:18:22.958 align:start position:0%
transparency data and the transparency
 
05:18:24.788 --> 05:18:24.798 align:start position:0%
and coverage data two different domains
 
05:18:27.390 --> 05:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
from two different actors I just wanted
 
05:18:29.628 --> 05:18:29.638 align:start position:0%
to comment the carriers we shared this
 
05:18:31.430 --> 05:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
important legislative Endeavor with the
 
05:18:33.830 --> 05:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
carriers in late summer and have had
 
05:18:37.230 --> 05:18:37.240 align:start position:0%
they've had ample time um to review that
 
05:18:39.390 --> 05:18:39.400 align:start position:0%
we're not really hearing that much
 
05:18:41.910 --> 05:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
response from them until just recently
 
05:18:45.750 --> 05:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
which concerns me but um the urgency
 
05:18:47.390 --> 05:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
part I just wanted to address this is
 
05:18:50.390 --> 05:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
part of 2020 2020 Consolidated
 
05:18:55.190 --> 05:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
Appropriations act and it's 2025 now and
 
05:18:57.590 --> 05:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
there is no State thus far who's made
 
05:19:00.310 --> 05:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
any use of the insurers transparency and
 
05:19:02.628 --> 05:19:02.638 align:start position:0%
coverage data it's a different story
 
05:19:04.708 --> 05:19:04.718 align:start position:0%
compared to the same legislation at the
 
05:19:07.150 --> 05:19:07.160 align:start position:0%
same time for the hospital transparency
 
05:19:09.070 --> 05:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
and there's a reason why and it has to
 
05:19:11.708 --> 05:19:11.718 align:start position:0%
do with the the lack of the guidance or
 
05:19:13.190 --> 05:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
the the structure of the guidance for
 
05:19:15.708 --> 05:19:15.718 align:start position:0%
the formatting and so what a shame to
 
05:19:18.470 --> 05:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
have rendered such important data for
 
05:19:20.590 --> 05:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
policy makers and our citizens to
 
05:19:22.150 --> 05:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
understand how much things cost for
 
05:19:24.910 --> 05:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
their health care still not knowing
 
05:19:28.070 --> 05:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
because of a formatting issue so I the
 
05:19:29.670 --> 05:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
last thing I just wanted to comment on
 
05:19:32.110 --> 05:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
is the marginal cost of being compliant
 
05:19:34.110 --> 05:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
with the same standard that the federal
 
05:19:37.230 --> 05:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
government has essentially um provided
 
05:19:40.750 --> 05:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
for and even with the the new standards
 
05:19:43.750 --> 05:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment provides that the state
 
05:19:45.910 --> 05:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
law will follow along with that so
 
05:19:47.990 --> 05:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
there'll be no new cost incurred because
 
05:19:51.190 --> 05:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
of new new standardization rather the
 
05:19:53.190 --> 05:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
fact that these data sets are already
 
05:19:55.628 --> 05:19:55.638 align:start position:0%
framed the the fixed cost of that
 
05:19:57.788 --> 05:19:57.798 align:start position:0%
endeavor is almost already endured and
 
05:20:00.030 --> 05:20:00.040 align:start position:0%
so now it's just the variable cost which
 
05:20:01.750 --> 05:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
is the small marginal cost so I just
 
05:20:04.590 --> 05:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
didn't want the overstatement of the
 
05:20:08.708 --> 05:20:08.718 align:start position:0%
cost burden to to be the lasting message
 
05:20:10.270 --> 05:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
because I don't agree with that this is
 
05:20:12.590 --> 05:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
an important Endeavor for my role at the
 
05:20:14.430 --> 05:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
department the Department's transparency
 
05:20:17.110 --> 05:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
work for which we have a longstanding
 
05:20:20.150 --> 05:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
tenure for doing that and now we we've
 
05:20:22.628 --> 05:20:22.638 align:start position:0%
been pioneers of that pioneers and it's
 
05:20:24.830 --> 05:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
still not known to our consumers how
 
05:20:28.670 --> 05:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
much I got I got I I have now resolved
 
05:20:31.030 --> 05:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
it for myself so here's my
 
05:20:35.750 --> 05:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:41.390 --> 05:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:43.470 --> 05:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
the provisions of this subdivision apply
 
05:20:45.948 --> 05:20:45.958 align:start position:0%
for plan years beginning on or after
 
05:20:48.110 --> 05:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
January 1 of
 
05:20:52.590 --> 05:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
2026 so even if we left in this language
 
05:20:56.230 --> 05:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
that is that the date say it's it takes
 
05:20:57.670 --> 05:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
effect upon
 
05:21:00.708 --> 05:21:00.718 align:start position:0%
passage nothing is really happening yet
 
05:21:03.430 --> 05:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
until January 1 in where the data is now
 
05:21:05.670 --> 05:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
being uploaded has to be you got to be
 
05:21:08.750 --> 05:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
preparing to add data January 1st so
 
05:21:10.830 --> 05:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
that means in the meantime you know
 
05:21:13.830 --> 05:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
you're unless you're going to put in
 
05:21:18.910 --> 05:21:18.920 align:start position:0%
pre- dat before the January one um I
 
05:21:20.190 --> 05:21:20.200 align:start position:0%
guess I'm not really worried about the
 
05:21:23.030 --> 05:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
effective date anymore because the the
 
05:21:25.510 --> 05:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
whole thing is January 1 so all they're
 
05:21:27.910 --> 05:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
saying is is that you you've got to take
 
05:21:30.310 --> 05:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
you know the companies I'm looking at
 
05:21:32.070 --> 05:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
you three
 
05:21:34.670 --> 05:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
right that you're you take you got to do
 
05:21:36.868 --> 05:21:36.878 align:start position:0%
get your systems in place how you're
 
05:21:38.590 --> 05:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
going to download the data what you're
 
05:21:40.430 --> 05:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
going to do with it but you don't have
 
05:21:42.628 --> 05:21:42.638 align:start position:0%
to do anything until January 1
 
05:21:44.868 --> 05:21:44.878 align:start position:0%
anyways all you have to do is be ready
 
05:21:54.510 --> 05:21:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:57.270 --> 05:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
wrong okay let's pretend like let's just
 
05:22:00.470 --> 05:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
go with this idea and then
 
05:22:02.910 --> 05:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
um and if you come up with something
 
05:22:04.110 --> 05:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
better you can take it up with the
 
05:22:04.120 --> 05:22:09.708 align:start position:0%
better you can take it up with the
Senate

05:22:09.708 --> 05:22:09.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:12.910 --> 05:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:15.670 --> 05:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
president yeah at this point I you know
 
05:22:18.070 --> 05:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
I I can't I don't want to belabor this
 
05:22:21.390 --> 05:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
anymore this is this is this is too
 
05:22:25.350 --> 05:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
painful and I think that yeah right well
 
05:22:26.628 --> 05:22:26.638 align:start position:0%
compared to what we've been through
 
05:22:29.548 --> 05:22:29.558 align:start position:0%
already Yes we just to say is you know
 
05:22:30.910 --> 05:22:30.920 align:start position:0%
when you pick your poison when's the
 
05:22:32.830 --> 05:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
right day when right that the at the end
 
05:22:35.190 --> 05:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
of the day the purpose is both the
 
05:22:37.310 --> 05:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
federal and yours is is that it's
 
05:22:39.910 --> 05:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
supposed to be ready to go January
 
05:22:42.910 --> 05:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
1 that's what it says here to me I mean

people are in the room so I'm just going
 
05:25:58.110 --> 05:25:58.120 align:start position:0%
to count
 
05:26:01.430 --> 05:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
them at this
 
05:26:03.548 --> 05:26:03.558 align:start position:0%
point this is why that's why they have a
 
05:26:05.548 --> 05:26:05.558 align:start position:0%
house clerk you know because you can't
 
05:26:09.030 --> 05:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
expect the speaker to count
 
05:26:12.110 --> 05:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
okay all right next one is
 
05:26:15.830 --> 05:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
529 oh this make a motion this is the
 
05:26:18.788 --> 05:26:18.798 align:start position:0%
yeah okay um so yeah I actually was
 
05:26:21.150 --> 05:26:21.160 align:start position:0%
talking to the sponsor and I suggested
 
05:26:23.070 --> 05:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
just because this needs to be amended
 
05:26:25.270 --> 05:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
and it hasn't been that hasn't been done
 
05:26:27.350 --> 05:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
we haven't had a chance to do it no um
 
05:26:28.750 --> 05:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
could we retain it and come back to it
 
05:26:30.470 --> 05:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
in the fall and it definitely would work
 
05:26:33.030 --> 05:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
on it because I'm interested in this but
 
05:26:36.270 --> 05:26:36.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm always good for retaining okay
 
05:26:40.430 --> 05:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:42.750 --> 05:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
cuz it it each piece is going to take a
 
05:26:44.150 --> 05:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
lot of takes some work we don't have
 
05:26:49.070 --> 05:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
time to do it before contemplation MH so
 
05:26:50.788 --> 05:26:50.798 align:start position:0%
actually with the the hour ones we
 
05:26:53.430 --> 05:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
already did that and the Senate stuck it
 
05:26:56.110 --> 05:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
in our face so well we know that that's
 
05:26:57.590 --> 05:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
where fun goes to die but that doesn't
 
05:26:59.030 --> 05:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
mean we shouldn't do it
 
05:27:01.310 --> 05:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
again and then I have to say Mike is
 
05:27:03.628 --> 05:27:03.638 align:start position:0%
that the problem with the hours ones is
 
05:27:06.270 --> 05:27:06.280 align:start position:0%
in you know your testimony you know that
 
05:27:07.708 --> 05:27:07.718 align:start position:0%
who who Who's going to find the people
 
05:27:10.110 --> 05:27:10.120 align:start position:0%
to do this that's not our problem and
 
05:27:12.110 --> 05:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
certainly the owner doesn't have to stay
 
05:27:12.120 --> 05:27:17.590 align:start position:0%
certainly the owner doesn't have to stay
open

05:27:17.590 --> 05:27:17.600 align:start position:0%

okay so uh think it's probably not going
 
05:28:44.430 --> 05:28:44.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:46.548 --> 05:28:46.558 align:start position:0%

05:28:56.670 --> 05:28:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:06.180 --> 05:29:06.190 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:06.190 --> 05:29:22.628 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:29:22.628 --> 05:29:22.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:25.990 --> 05:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
okay so the we start out with um Roman
 
05:29:26.000 --> 05:29:27.110 align:start position:0%
okay so the we start out with um Roman
numeral

05:29:27.110 --> 05:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
numeral
 
05:29:29.590 --> 05:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
one the commission May issue a Tavern
 
05:29:31.510 --> 05:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
license in any town which has voted to
 
05:29:33.190 --> 05:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
accept the
 
05:29:35.270 --> 05:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
provisions now reason why this is
 
05:29:36.708 --> 05:29:36.718 align:start position:0%
important is because we're going to be
 
05:29:40.590 --> 05:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
lifting this concept and put it in other
 
05:29:40.600 --> 05:29:42.430 align:start position:0%
lifting this concept and put it in other
places

05:29:42.430 --> 05:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
places
 
05:29:45.070 --> 05:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
so what are you asking me did it go down
 
05:29:47.510 --> 05:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
this way yeah yeah everybody everybody's
 
05:29:55.708 --> 05:29:55.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:58.110 --> 05:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
okay and then the rest of the language
 
05:30:14.788 --> 05:30:14.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:17.708 --> 05:30:17.718 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in here about
 
05:30:20.830 --> 05:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
cost I'm not seeing Oh with the the
 
05:30:22.868 --> 05:30:22.878 align:start position:0%
license dollar amount of the license
 
05:30:24.030 --> 05:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't there going to be something like
 
05:30:26.150 --> 05:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
you were going to do I I think I pulled
 
05:30:27.548 --> 05:30:27.558 align:start position:0%
the number out of out of the air didn't
 
05:30:29.948 --> 05:30:29.958 align:start position:0%
I 6400 yeah yeah so what happened where
 
05:30:32.510 --> 05:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
where that would that we didn't put it
 
05:30:35.110 --> 05:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
in this amendment this isn't the one I
 
05:30:37.590 --> 05:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
submitted oh this is not this is the
 
05:30:43.190 --> 05:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
first one that o that um OS drafted okay
 
05:30:43.200 --> 05:30:46.030 align:start position:0%
first one that o that um OS drafted okay
rut

05:30:46.030 --> 05:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:51.190 --> 05:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
R so um did I did I forward you anything
 
05:30:56.670 --> 05:30:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:05.030 --> 05:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:17.548 --> 05:31:17.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:17.558 --> 05:31:38.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:31:38.070 --> 05:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:40.030 --> 05:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
all right well we're gonna take this up
 
05:31:55.430 --> 05:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:55.440 --> 05:31:59.150 align:start position:0%
 
week

05:31:59.150 --> 05:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:03.788 --> 05:32:03.798 align:start position:0%
six correct so the the number one the
 
05:32:06.470 --> 05:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
6635 is if the town allows liquor
 
05:32:06.480 --> 05:32:07.990 align:start position:0%
6635 is if the town allows liquor
licenses

05:32:07.990 --> 05:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
05:32:11.030 --> 05:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
so that's standard in all liquor license
 
05:32:13.628 --> 05:32:13.638 align:start position:0%
um rsas because that just says the town
 
05:32:15.350 --> 05:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
is going to allow alcohol to be sold in
 
05:32:18.070 --> 05:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
their Town what the committee had
 
05:32:21.070 --> 05:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
requested last time was the local option
 
05:32:23.548 --> 05:32:23.558 align:start position:0%
where the town would have to vote to
 
05:32:27.310 --> 05:32:27.320 align:start position:0%
allow a Tavern license in the town much
 
05:32:29.548 --> 05:32:29.558 align:start position:0%
like Kino so it mirors The Kino language
 
05:32:30.628 --> 05:32:30.638 align:start position:0%
that they would have to put it on the
 
05:32:33.190 --> 05:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
ballad vote to allow a Tavern license to
 
05:32:35.750 --> 05:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
be accepted in the town before we could
 
05:32:37.350 --> 05:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
accept an application for a Tavern
 
05:32:38.750 --> 05:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
license in the the town but that first
 
05:32:41.350 --> 05:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
line is just saying alcohol can be sold
 
05:32:44.070 --> 05:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
in the town but isn't that what this
 
05:32:47.070 --> 05:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
says no this is specific to the town in
 
05:32:48.590 --> 05:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
general is going to allow any type of
 
05:32:48.600 --> 05:32:52.948 align:start position:0%
general is going to allow any type of
liquor

05:32:52.948 --> 05:32:52.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:52.958 --> 05:32:54.910 align:start position:0%
 
license

05:32:54.910 --> 05:32:54.920 align:start position:0%

05:32:54.920 --> 05:32:56.510 align:start position:0%
license
ACS

05:32:56.510 --> 05:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
ACS
 
05:32:56.520 --> 05:33:00.470 align:start position:0%
ACS
oh

05:33:00.470 --> 05:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:02.310 --> 05:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
right obviously we're going to have to
 
05:33:04.868 --> 05:33:04.878 align:start position:0%
come back to this um can you make sure
 
05:33:08.110 --> 05:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
Kristen has the correct one so we can
 
05:33:12.350 --> 05:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
get that to LOLs and take a but don't go
 
05:33:15.990 --> 05:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
anywhere please do not
 
05:33:19.948 --> 05:33:19.958 align:start position:0%
leave okay this is the 18th as
 
05:33:19.958 --> 05:33:22.390 align:start position:0%
leave okay this is the 18th as
well

05:33:22.390 --> 05:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:33:28.910 --> 05:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
okay all right next one is uh social
 
05:33:31.430 --> 05:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
districts did we have an amendment for
 
05:33:46.948 --> 05:33:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:48.910 --> 05:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
467 now
 
05:33:52.270 --> 05:33:52.280 align:start position:0%
right it was a
 
05:33:56.548 --> 05:33:56.558 align:start position:0%
typo ke Keo was still in it okay so you
 
05:34:00.868 --> 05:34:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:05.030 --> 05:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
did so so I had we had some we had the
 
05:34:08.190 --> 05:34:08.200 align:start position:0%
language from the original bill
 
05:34:09.548 --> 05:34:09.558 align:start position:0%
and you're saying there was just one
 
05:34:11.910 --> 05:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
little typo that we needed to
 
05:34:14.230 --> 05:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
correct that was our understanding I
 
05:34:16.470 --> 05:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
don't know if he if um the
 
05:34:18.868 --> 05:34:18.878 align:start position:0%
representative had made additional
 
05:34:21.070 --> 05:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
changes to
 
05:34:24.390 --> 05:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
that there it is
 
05:35:33.750 --> 05:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:38.868 --> 05:35:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:15.590 --> 05:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:32.430 --> 05:36:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:42.230 --> 05:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:36.070 --> 05:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:36.080 --> 05:37:46.230 align:start position:0%
 
that's

05:37:46.230 --> 05:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:46.240 --> 05:38:36.430 align:start position:0%
 
people

05:38:36.430 --> 05:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:36.440 --> 05:39:06.310 align:start position:0%
 
said

um

05:43:56.548 --> 05:43:56.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:00.910 --> 05:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
okay didn't do 467 yet the social
 
05:44:03.390 --> 05:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
districts did we do we do we have the
 
05:44:05.468 --> 05:44:05.478 align:start position:0%
amendment on the no there was no
 
05:44:08.590 --> 05:44:08.600 align:start position:0%
amendment was there no 467 we need a on
 
05:44:12.030 --> 05:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
467 did we have any
 
05:44:18.948 --> 05:44:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:21.270 --> 05:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
mistake is that the one with the keynote
 
05:44:23.548 --> 05:44:23.558 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so this one has a little
 
05:44:26.310 --> 05:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
one-word problem so we're GNA have to
 
05:44:28.628 --> 05:44:28.638 align:start position:0%
take that up on Tuesday so on page two
 
05:44:32.030 --> 05:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
line five it has the word Keno
 
05:44:32.040 --> 05:44:33.910 align:start position:0%
line five it has the word Keno
is6

05:44:33.910 --> 05:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
is6
 
05:44:41.190 --> 05:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:44.430 --> 05:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
467 that's the
 
05:44:47.590 --> 05:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
word and then and then 276 had the same
 
05:44:51.708 --> 05:44:51.718 align:start position:0%
word problem is that what happened no no
 
05:44:56.190 --> 05:44:56.200 align:start position:0%
the T um 276 referred to the wrong the T
 
05:44:59.070 --> 05:44:59.080 align:start position:0%
had just the wrong bill right
 
05:45:03.670 --> 05:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
okay okay so now right so now we're down
 
05:45:03.680 --> 05:45:05.230 align:start position:0%
okay okay so now right so now we're down
to

05:45:05.230 --> 05:45:05.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:45:07.990 --> 05:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
565 I'll move that
 
05:45:10.910 --> 05:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
well so we're having a little bit of
 
05:45:13.510 --> 05:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
disagreement on this
 
05:45:13.520 --> 05:45:22.350 align:start position:0%
disagreement on this
bill

05:45:22.350 --> 05:45:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:26.468 --> 05:45:26.478 align:start position:0%
um um because I my memory was we were
 
05:45:26.478 --> 05:45:27.390 align:start position:0%
um um because I my memory was we were
that

05:45:27.390 --> 05:45:27.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:45:29.510 --> 05:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
that that if you were going to sign
 
05:45:34.110 --> 05:45:34.120 align:start position:0%
someone in you had they had to be a
 
05:45:37.070 --> 05:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
relative that's my memory you discussed
 
05:45:39.868 --> 05:45:39.878 align:start position:0%
family family or a
 
05:45:42.510 --> 05:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
relative um obviously the commission is
 
05:45:44.750 --> 05:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
pointing out that that somewhat
 
05:45:48.110 --> 05:45:48.120 align:start position:0%
enforceable problem we said family
 
05:45:51.230 --> 05:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
members oh so I did
 
05:45:54.270 --> 05:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
okay the person who is and a family
 
05:45:57.788 --> 05:45:57.798 align:start position:0%
member unquote family
 
05:45:57.798 --> 05:46:05.070 align:start position:0%
member unquote family
member

05:46:05.070 --> 05:46:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:07.628 --> 05:46:07.638 align:start position:0%
um yeah so I I think that's how we left
 
05:46:08.990 --> 05:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
it unfortunately is that we were going
 
05:46:11.230 --> 05:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
to do family member but where we going
 
05:46:14.150 --> 05:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
to change family member to unless it it
 
05:46:21.110 --> 05:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:25.030 --> 05:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
old and let's who has sign
 
05:46:28.750 --> 05:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
in the minor family member minor or
 
05:46:30.670 --> 05:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
miners into the club and listed their
 
05:46:30.680 --> 05:46:42.788 align:start position:0%
miners into the club and listed their
age

05:46:42.788 --> 05:46:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:47.390 --> 05:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
family okay so we we do
 
05:46:50.708 --> 05:46:50.718 align:start position:0%
have an opposite opinion from our former
 
05:46:58.510 --> 05:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:00.868 --> 05:47:00.878 align:start position:0%
bill yeah you can sit over here no you
 
05:47:03.390 --> 05:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
guys stay right
 
05:47:05.788 --> 05:47:05.798 align:start position:0%
there in the old days we used to just
 
05:47:07.110 --> 05:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
you know hold together but it's all
 
05:47:11.230 --> 05:47:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:13.788 --> 05:47:13.798 align:start position:0%
so thank you for allowing me to speak
 
05:47:15.990 --> 05:47:16.000 align:start position:0%

05:47:16.000 --> 05:47:17.230 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself Jane bolier former
State

05:47:17.230 --> 05:47:17.240 align:start position:0%
State
 
05:47:22.230 --> 05:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
Rep um sorry about the gum but anyway um
 
05:47:25.990 --> 05:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
the reason why you do not want children
 
05:47:29.430 --> 05:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
into a social club number one they watch
 
05:47:31.788 --> 05:47:31.798 align:start position:0%
their parents drink all night long
 
05:47:34.670 --> 05:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
because often times when people go to
 
05:47:36.468 --> 05:47:36.478 align:start position:0%
Social Clubs they are all night and
 
05:47:38.910 --> 05:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
their kids kids are there with them all
 
05:47:40.750 --> 05:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
night and then they drive home drunk
 
05:47:44.788 --> 05:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
with their kids another reason smoking
 
05:47:46.670 --> 05:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
you don't want a child in a room full of
 
05:47:48.430 --> 05:47:48.440 align:start position:0%
smoke for two or three
 
05:47:51.708 --> 05:47:51.718 align:start position:0%
hours and this is very personal for me
 
05:47:53.548 --> 05:47:53.558 align:start position:0%
my daughter is an alcoholic her father
 
05:47:56.150 --> 05:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
used to take her to Social Clubs when
 
05:48:00.150 --> 05:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
she was 6 years old seven8 nine 10 we
 
05:48:01.708 --> 05:48:01.718 align:start position:0%
were divorced at the time I didn't know
 
05:48:03.430 --> 05:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
this until just
 
05:48:06.350 --> 05:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
recently so um she would drink at the
 
05:48:06.360 --> 05:48:07.788 align:start position:0%
recently so um she would drink at the
club

05:48:07.788 --> 05:48:07.798 align:start position:0%
club
 
05:48:10.670 --> 05:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
because her father wanted her drunk um
 
05:48:13.430 --> 05:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
and they were drinking so it's
 
05:48:15.750 --> 05:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely ridiculous that you would
 
05:48:18.670 --> 05:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
allow a child to be in a social club
 
05:48:20.190 --> 05:48:20.200 align:start position:0%
another reason there's no you don't have
 
05:48:22.310 --> 05:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
to eat there because there's no food
 
05:48:26.070 --> 05:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
oftentimes so it's dangerous for the
 
05:48:26.080 --> 05:48:28.070 align:start position:0%
oftentimes so it's dangerous for the
child

05:48:28.070 --> 05:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
child
 
05:48:32.430 --> 05:48:32.440 align:start position:0%
and no there's no good reason to have
 
05:48:34.788 --> 05:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
someone six seven eight years old which
 
05:48:37.430 --> 05:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
they could be reading this bill in a
 
05:48:40.670 --> 05:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
social club watching their parents drink
 
05:48:42.628 --> 05:48:42.638 align:start position:0%
and smoke and then driving home with
 
05:48:46.750 --> 05:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
them drunk that's absolutely no not
 
05:48:49.390 --> 05:48:49.400 align:start position:0%
being responsible as a state legislator
 
05:48:53.948 --> 05:48:53.958 align:start position:0%

05:49:20.070 --> 05:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:22.190 --> 05:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
conditions were
 
05:49:25.750 --> 05:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:31.910 --> 05:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:35.310 --> 05:49:35.320 align:start position:0%
CL but then they said persons not with
 
05:49:37.788 --> 05:49:37.798 align:start position:0%
standing so persons under the age of 21
 
05:49:39.708 --> 05:49:39.718 align:start position:0%
shall be allowed in renovable rooms
 
05:49:41.390 --> 05:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
approved by the commission when beverage
 
05:49:44.190 --> 05:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
spell so they're raising the
 
05:49:44.200 --> 05:49:45.910 align:start position:0%
spell so they're raising the
age

05:49:45.910 --> 05:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
age
 
05:49:48.150 --> 05:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
in these side rooms like you're saying
 
05:49:51.110 --> 05:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
the ballrooms right no those are already
 
05:49:52.548 --> 05:49:52.558 align:start position:0%
those aren't age restricted at the
 
05:49:54.590 --> 05:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
moment so in a social club you have the
 
05:49:56.948 --> 05:49:56.958 align:start position:0%
canteen the canteen is the members only
 
05:49:58.868 --> 05:49:58.878 align:start position:0%
portion of the
 
05:50:02.910 --> 05:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
club um that is remember you have to be
 
05:50:05.430 --> 05:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
um is it 21 I think it's eight I think
 
05:50:07.788 --> 05:50:07.798 align:start position:0%
it's 18 right now unless or you're
 
05:50:09.910 --> 05:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
accompanied by uh no sorry no parent so
 
05:50:13.110 --> 05:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
18 signed in by a member um there are
 
05:50:15.110 --> 05:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
function Halls that are associated with
 
05:50:16.708 --> 05:50:16.718 align:start position:0%
these clubs the function Halls are not
 
05:50:18.590 --> 05:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
age restricted they are separate from
 
05:50:21.150 --> 05:50:21.160 align:start position:0%
the canteen those would be the halls or
 
05:50:23.468 --> 05:50:23.478 align:start position:0%
the rooms that the public can rent or
 
05:50:26.708 --> 05:50:26.718 align:start position:0%
the um Social Club could host an event
 
05:50:29.150 --> 05:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
in if they wanted to serve alcohol at
 
05:50:30.430 --> 05:50:30.440 align:start position:0%
those events then they request a
 
05:50:32.590 --> 05:50:32.600 align:start position:0%
supplemental license from us to allow
 
05:50:34.670 --> 05:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
alcohol service in those rooms so
 
05:50:36.070 --> 05:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes there are parties with alcohol
 
05:50:38.590 --> 05:50:38.600 align:start position:0%
there sometimes there or not um we see a
 
05:50:40.590 --> 05:50:40.600 align:start position:0%
host of things such as celebrations of
 
05:50:42.830 --> 05:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
life baby showers wedding showers again
 
05:50:44.910 --> 05:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
some have they use the supplemental
 
05:50:47.390 --> 05:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
license for some they do not but the
 
05:50:49.788 --> 05:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
canteen itself is currently the age
 
05:50:51.270 --> 05:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
restricted portion of the club this
 
05:50:55.510 --> 05:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
would allow underage um people or miners
 
05:50:58.868 --> 05:50:58.878 align:start position:0%
into the canteen members only area of
 
05:50:58.878 --> 05:50:59.990 align:start position:0%
into the canteen members only area of
the

05:50:59.990 --> 05:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:51:02.350 --> 05:51:02.360 align:start position:0%
club right because it well it says
 
05:51:04.190 --> 05:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
rentable rooms approved by the
 
05:51:06.150 --> 05:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
commission so that's what you're talking
 
05:51:09.070 --> 05:51:09.080 align:start position:0%
about is the small rooms isn't it that's
 
05:51:10.990 --> 05:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
that's the the function rooms yeah
 
05:51:12.190 --> 05:51:12.200 align:start position:0%
they're they're talking about raising
 
05:51:15.430 --> 05:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
the age to 21 from 18 and I thought that
 
05:51:18.190 --> 05:51:18.200 align:start position:0%
was open to anybody so I'm I'm totally
 
05:51:25.150 --> 05:51:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:30.110 --> 05:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:32.310 --> 05:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
of1 yeah on that one they're going the
 
05:51:35.110 --> 05:51:35.120 align:start position:0%
opposite way yeah they're already
 
05:51:41.310 --> 05:51:41.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:48.070 --> 05:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:51.910 --> 05:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:51.920 --> 05:51:56.310 align:start position:0%
 
only

05:51:56.310 --> 05:51:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:59.468 --> 05:51:59.478 align:start position:0%
right and the the rentable rooms are per
 
05:52:01.830 --> 05:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
are allowing persons under the age of 18
 
05:52:03.468 --> 05:52:03.478 align:start position:0%
are allowed in rentable rooms that's the
 
05:52:07.190 --> 05:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
statute as it is right now
 
05:52:09.948 --> 05:52:09.958 align:start position:0%
okay all right there it is Sir without a
 
05:52:12.190 --> 05:52:12.200 align:start position:0%
parent or Guardian present at such times
 
05:52:18.430 --> 05:52:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:24.310 --> 05:52:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:27.468 --> 05:52:27.478 align:start position:0%
now the agent shall be allowed in the
 
05:52:29.110 --> 05:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
rentable rooms and they're moving it
 
05:52:32.430 --> 05:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
from 18 to 21 so that is
 
05:52:34.868 --> 05:52:34.878 align:start position:0%
say well that's what I'm saying so
 
05:52:36.190 --> 05:52:36.200 align:start position:0%
understand why this paragraphs in the
 
05:52:38.590 --> 05:52:38.600 align:start position:0%
stat anyways in the rentable rooms
 
05:52:41.708 --> 05:52:41.718 align:start position:0%
because the first paragraph sets the age
 
05:52:45.230 --> 05:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
restriction for the canteen for any room
 
05:52:47.708 --> 05:52:47.718 align:start position:0%
the first section is for any
 
05:52:50.390 --> 05:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
room correct second section is the
 
05:52:50.400 --> 05:52:51.590 align:start position:0%
room correct second section is the
rentable

05:52:51.590 --> 05:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
rentable
 
05:52:54.350 --> 05:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
rooms so without a parent or Guardian
 
05:52:56.788 --> 05:52:56.798 align:start position:0%
present so that allows individuals under
 
05:52:58.910 --> 05:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
the age of 18 to be in rentable rooms
 
05:53:01.270 --> 05:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
even if there's a supplemental license
 
05:53:03.548 --> 05:53:03.558 align:start position:0%
without a parent or Guardian right okay
 
05:53:05.670 --> 05:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
so there's your family member quote we
 
05:53:08.830 --> 05:53:08.840 align:start position:0%
just put parent or Guardian present
 
05:53:11.070 --> 05:53:11.080 align:start position:0%
because assuming that's enforceable
 
05:53:19.030 --> 05:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:19.040 --> 05:53:20.830 align:start position:0%
 
phrase

05:53:20.830 --> 05:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
phrase
 
05:53:20.840 --> 05:53:26.350 align:start position:0%
phrase
okay

05:53:26.350 --> 05:53:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:29.150 --> 05:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
um ask what what's the uh liquor
 
05:53:31.310 --> 05:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
commission's Take On The Spill do you
 
05:53:33.708 --> 05:53:33.718 align:start position:0%
support it neutral they want us to kill
 
05:53:35.590 --> 05:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
it what are you kidding then let's kill
 
05:53:35.600 --> 05:53:37.670 align:start position:0%
it what are you kidding then let's kill
it

05:53:37.670 --> 05:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:53:42.070 --> 05:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
I told L we would or at least retain it
 
05:53:57.350 --> 05:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:59.468 --> 05:53:59.478 align:start position:0%
it they can do that in the rentable
 
05:54:02.230 --> 05:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
rooms they can't do that in the canteen
 
05:54:05.548 --> 05:54:05.558 align:start position:0%
so where that was what that was the that
 
05:54:07.590 --> 05:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
was the story yeah that was the
 
05:54:10.948 --> 05:54:10.958 align:start position:0%
story so because I have to I visualized
 
05:54:13.548 --> 05:54:13.558 align:start position:0%
you know our BMW we have it's got It's
 
05:54:15.868 --> 05:54:15.878 align:start position:0%
really got two big actually has three
 
05:54:18.270 --> 05:54:18.280 align:start position:0%
rooms there has a smaller room that's
 
05:54:21.230 --> 05:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
right by the door you know and then you
 
05:54:23.628 --> 05:54:23.638 align:start position:0%
have the next the big room where they do
 
05:54:26.948 --> 05:54:26.958 align:start position:0%
the meat auction and uh and then that
 
05:54:29.868 --> 05:54:29.878 align:start position:0%
has a bar in it and also it has
 
05:54:32.190 --> 05:54:32.200 align:start position:0%
hamburgers and hot dogs so that would be
 
05:54:33.830 --> 05:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
the rentable room that's the rentable
 
05:54:35.830 --> 05:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
room even the other room that other room
 
05:54:37.750 --> 05:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
is a rent room it just doesn't have a
 
05:54:40.190 --> 05:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
bar in it that you know and then and
 
05:54:42.230 --> 05:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
then you go behind the big you know
 
05:54:45.270 --> 05:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
famous doors and now you're into the
 
05:54:47.230 --> 05:54:47.240 align:start position:0%
canteen the canteen which is the members
 
05:54:50.270 --> 05:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
only age restricted member restricted
 
05:54:58.270 --> 05:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:04.750 --> 05:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:08.070 --> 05:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
so maybe there particular VFW doesn't
 
05:55:10.628 --> 05:55:10.638 align:start position:0%
have that could be I thought the sponsor
 
05:55:12.510 --> 05:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
was a member of a social
 
05:55:15.910 --> 05:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
club so it just could be the setup floor
 
05:55:18.910 --> 05:55:18.920 align:start position:0%
the floor plan of that particular Social
 
05:55:24.190 --> 05:55:24.200 align:start position:0%
Club all right I will schedule this for
 
05:55:27.830 --> 05:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:30.510 --> 05:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
military well the military yes said to
 
05:55:33.350 --> 05:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
the military uh but is in the military
 
05:55:34.830 --> 05:55:34.840 align:start position:0%

05:55:37.830 --> 05:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
person 21 years or older
 
05:55:40.628 --> 05:55:40.638 align:start position:0%
person who is under 21 Old but is in the
 
05:55:42.708 --> 05:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
military does not need to be accompanied
 
05:55:47.310 --> 05:55:47.320 align:start position:0%

05:55:50.990 --> 05:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
don't get have to be signed in well well
 
05:55:54.270 --> 05:55:54.280 align:start position:0%
