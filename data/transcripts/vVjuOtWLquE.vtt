um good afternoon time being just a
 
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
little after one o'clock today on the
 
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
13th I'd like to welcome all of you here
 
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 align:start position:0%
to uh Public Works and highways
 
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
I do not believe there's a better
 
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 align:start position:0%
Committee in this uh in this state than
 
00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 align:start position:0%
the one that we are sitting with
 
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
um some of the some of the things that
 
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 align:start position:0%
come to mind is I have been here since
 
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
2002 on and off I'm starting my ninth
 
00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
term I have had the pleasure of serving
 
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
as chair as Vice chair and once again as
 
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.170 align:start position:0%
as chair as Vice chair and once again as
chairman

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
um I think when we go through
 
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 align:start position:0%
introductions you're going to be
 
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 align:start position:0%
surprised some of the new members of
 
00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 align:start position:0%
this committee to find out uh the
 
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
lineage here where so many have been
 
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
chairman and vice chairman of whether
 
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
it's this uh committee or others we're
 
00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
the Hallmark for uh bipartisanship
 
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
we have I've served I think it's the
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
first time I've served more times under
 
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
Republican speaker than I have a
 
00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 align:start position:0%
Democrat speaker our votes tend to come
 
00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:34.990 align:start position:0%
Democrat speaker our votes tend to come
out

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
nearly unanimous
 
00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
uh we have a habit of trying to work
 
00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 align:start position:0%
through and come out with something that
 
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 align:start position:0%
works for everybody
 
00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:48.199 align:start position:0%
the speaker has asked that we mingle
 
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 align:start position:0%
Democrats with Republicans which we
 
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
always have anyways
 
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
um and um I'm just really looking
 
00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.100 align:start position:0%
forward to getting started here again
 
00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:01.259 align:start position:0%
I'm going to uh we'll go around the room
 
00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 align:start position:0%
and introduce ourselves uh Christy I'm
 
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
sorry Christie your last name
 
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
offense is she is our committee research
 
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.890 align:start position:0%
offense is she is our committee research
person

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
and I have had to lean heavily already
 
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
and her guidance has been absolutely
 
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.590 align:start position:0%
and her guidance has been absolutely
tremendous

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
tremendous
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
so I'll I will um I will start with
 
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
myself uh for the new members and give
 
00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 align:start position:0%
you a little background as I said I was
 
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
first elected to this house in 2002 uh
 
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
I'm starting my ninth term here
 
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
I'm I own a business that I still
 
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 align:start position:0%
conduct a family business
 
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 align:start position:0%
my two sons my daughter I have a foreman
 
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
and another person that works with us so
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
that takes a bit of my time and the only
 
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 align:start position:0%
reason I can do this job for so many
 
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
years is because I have my family there
 
00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
in support of me when I'm gone
 
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
I served as a zoning chairman in my town
 
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
in Ossipee for 14 or 15 years I served
 
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 align:start position:0%
on the Executive Board of the Lakes
 
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
Region Planning Commission I know
 
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:15.900 align:start position:0%
several of you have been in that
 
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
position so I have a lot of background
 
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
in that area
 
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.730 align:start position:0%
in that area
um

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:22.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
and that's pretty much myself I will
 
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
pass to the vice chairman okay thank you
 
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I am a state I'm sorry I am
 
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
state representative John Cloutier from
 
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
Claremont I have served in the house
 
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
since 1992 and all but one term on this
 
00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
committee but during that term I was on
 
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
on two different committees I came to
 
00:07:47.089 --> 00:07:47.099 align:start position:0%
appreciate this committee even more as
 
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
you know uh and for many of the reasons
 
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
that the chairman has just alluded to
 
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
um but but also too I have served I I've
 
00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
served as chair of this committee Vice
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
chair which I'm coming back in again a
 
00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:03.539 align:start position:0%
clerk ranking member so I've practically
 
00:08:05.809 --> 00:08:05.819 align:start position:0%
done held every position on this
 
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
committee that you can hold
 
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
uh I'd like to think that gives me some
 
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
experience and I think it does but I
 
00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
also have found over the years that I
 
00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
always learn new things serving on this
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
committee as well as the legislature in
 
00:08:19.969 --> 00:08:19.979 align:start position:0%
the whole and I guess that's why I keep
 
00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
running again and again and again and
 
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:24.180 align:start position:0%
thank goodness the voters of my area I
 
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
now represent not only Claremont but the
 
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
town of Croydon keep returning because I
 
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
guess they like what I do and they think
 
00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:33.539 align:start position:0%
I'm effective uh and I think hopefully
 
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
this is a very bipartisan committee
 
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:37.740 align:start position:0%
overall we do have some disputes but
 
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:40.380 align:start position:0%
hopefully we've always been in the past
 
00:08:42.769 --> 00:08:42.779 align:start position:0%
been able to settle them amicably and
 
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
without any lasting ill effects and
 
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:46.140 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll do the same if we get
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
into any this year uh and it's my hope
 
00:08:51.769 --> 00:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
to try to make sure that happens uh but
 
00:08:53.449 --> 00:08:53.459 align:start position:0%
I think you'll look you'll enjoy your
 
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
experience here
 
00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:58.740 align:start position:0%
and uh be feel free to to ask if you
 
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
have questions concern any the chairman
 
00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:02.220 align:start position:0%
myself or any other member of the
 
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
committee or the staff I found them to
 
00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
be always very helpful and look forward
 
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:08.820 align:start position:0%
again to working with you all for the
 
00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:13.220 align:start position:0%

but I was very interested in being on
 
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:29.940 align:start position:0%
public works and highways although my
 
00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:33.020 align:start position:0%
first term I
 
00:21:36.649 --> 00:21:36.659 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to get on I was on a
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
transportation committee which did give
 
00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:43.580 align:start position:0%
me some contacts with the dot and
 
00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
to figure out a little bit about what
 
00:21:51.049 --> 00:21:51.059 align:start position:0%
was going on and I I do enjoy serving on
 
00:21:54.049 --> 00:21:54.059 align:start position:0%
this committee because it has been
 
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
spoken about
 
00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
by a number of the members
 
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
it is a bipartisan
 
00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:04.490 align:start position:0%
it is a bipartisan
um

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
committee and usually we don't have any
 
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.149 align:start position:0%
committee and usually we don't have any
trouble

00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
convincing the whole house to go around
 
00:22:18.409 --> 00:22:18.419 align:start position:0%
along with what our recommendation is uh
 
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately sometimes the Senate
 
00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
does not file a course
 
00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm married for 47 years I have won
 
00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:35.700 align:start position:0%
a child a child who is now an adult and

two grandchildren
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
I hope we continue that the progress we
 
00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.250 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:22:58.250 --> 00:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
I served in the U.S Air Force as an
 
00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:01.980 align:start position:0%
intelligence agent
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
I was stationed Okinawa
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
I broke my area responsibility of
 
00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
Beijing and I broke two of the codes
 
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
they've been working on for 20 years in
 
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
four months
 
00:23:16.669 --> 00:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
when I left the service
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
I sold cars for a few years
 
00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
now they decided I wanted to go into
 
00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:22.130 align:start position:0%
now they decided I wanted to go into
Construction

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
Construction
 
00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
so it did
 
00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
I ended up designing and building over
 
00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
100 commercial industrial buildings in
 
00:23:30.289 --> 00:23:30.299 align:start position:0%
three states
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
and then we went belly up under uh one
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
of those recessions Bush the old the
 
00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:37.940 align:start position:0%
bush recession
 
00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
uh USB one to keep me going but I didn't
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
want to do it
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
so I started a
 
00:23:48.529 --> 00:23:48.539 align:start position:0%
Discount Store got up to four stores
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
took me a while I only had eleven
 
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
dollars a wife and four kids when I
 
00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:54.470 align:start position:0%
dollars a wife and four kids when I
started

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
started
 
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
so it was
 
00:24:00.409 --> 00:24:00.419 align:start position:0%
we so start selling furniture to get
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
started anyway
 
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh this is my fourth term
 
00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
first term I was on Health and Human
 
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
Services and that was a zoo
 
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
nobody talked to anybody
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
they just argued all the time so this
 
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
was a absolute Delight to get on this
 
00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:20.039 align:start position:0%
committee we'll at least we can talk to
 
00:24:20.039 --> 00:24:20.930 align:start position:0%
committee we'll at least we can talk to
people

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:20.940 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:23.460 align:start position:0%
we don't always have to agree
 
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
but we do most of the time eventually
 
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
and that's what I like about this
 
00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:29.390 align:start position:0%
and that's what I like about this
committee

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.789 align:start position:0%
committee
uh

00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:31.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:35.529 --> 00:24:35.539 align:start position:0%

perspective to sound barriers rumble
strips

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:48.500 align:start position:0%
strips
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
roads Bridges dams and I think over the
 
00:24:54.529 --> 00:24:54.539 align:start position:0%
time that I've spent on this committee
 
00:24:57.169 --> 00:24:57.179 align:start position:0%
and in doing some traveling with my
 
00:24:59.090 --> 00:24:59.100 align:start position:0%

mean about some of the drama on other
committees

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
the country
 
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:12.900 align:start position:0%
some of which are fairly spectacular and

idea what it was I chose three other
 
00:25:48.649 --> 00:25:48.659 align:start position:0%
worthwhile committees I thought and I
 
00:25:51.649 --> 00:25:51.659 align:start position:0%

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
Stephen bogert I represent Laconia
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:07.980 align:start position:0%
I'm currently on the Zoning Board of
 
00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:10.500 align:start position:0%
adjustments for Laconia for 20 years 18
 
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
years as a chairperson the I'm also the

within the town and I'm also the
 
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
treasurer for the Laconia youth football
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
and cheer Association for 18 years
 
00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:32.580 align:start position:0%
it's been quite exciting to be up here
 
00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:35.820 align:start position:0%
in Laconia prior to that I worked 30
 
00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
years with Motorola down in Fort
 
00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
Lauderdale Florida where I had the
 
00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to also work and and and
 
00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
learn about planning and zoning and I
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
became also a City Commissioner within
 
00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
as a side note I was one of six
 
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
Republicans that requested to sit in a
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
center section of
 
00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:07.140 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
and the reason I picked the center
 
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
section is I wanted to have an
 
00:27:14.649 --> 00:27:14.659 align:start position:0%
opportunity to see all the different
 
00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:18.740 align:start position:0%
viewpoints that are coming across us
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
we've had too much division over the
 
00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:24.900 align:start position:0%
years and I think
 
00:27:27.649 --> 00:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
since 80 percent of the same people are
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
both are ninety percent of the same
 
00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
people are both Democrats and
 
00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:33.190 align:start position:0%
people are both Democrats and
Republicans

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
Republicans
 
00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
that have
 
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
the same wants and things that this
 
00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
would be a good place uh Public Works I
 
00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:43.380 align:start position:0%
find uh
 
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
I was
 
00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
unsure of
 
00:27:48.529 --> 00:27:48.539 align:start position:0%
but I'm looking forward to working with
 
00:27:51.289 --> 00:27:51.299 align:start position:0%
it because I've had a lot of planning
 
00:27:54.529 --> 00:27:54.539 align:start position:0%
experience and stuff we've built a city
 
00:27:57.649 --> 00:27:57.659 align:start position:0%
that was 40 percent built to build out
 
00:28:00.649 --> 00:28:00.659 align:start position:0%
of 60 percent which was approximately 10
 
00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
square miles and we've had to learn how
 
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
to set up codes how to set up roadways
 
00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919 align:start position:0%
how to set up intersections and and how
 
00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
to manage the different uh requirements
 
00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
for when the development happened and it
 
00:28:21.769 --> 00:28:21.779 align:start position:0%
was quite exciting so I was hoping that
 
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
maybe some of my experience would be
 
00:28:27.409 --> 00:28:27.419 align:start position:0%
able be of some use and if not I'm
 
00:28:30.169 --> 00:28:30.179 align:start position:0%
hoping to learn a whole lot of new stuff
 
00:28:36.169 --> 00:28:36.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:40.140 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Richard Baldwin I represent
 
00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:43.340 align:start position:0%
District Six which encompasses Guildford
 
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
Gilmanton and Ward 2 Laconia
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
this will be my second time in the house
 
00:28:54.409 --> 00:28:54.419 align:start position:0%
and also my second time on pwh
 
00:28:57.529 --> 00:28:57.539 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that we can work together and
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you one and all and for
 
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
the new members a couple items I think
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
it's in I think it's worthwhile for the
 
00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
new members to hear what the history is
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
and you can see that many of us whether
 
00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
you're you're a new member or a seasoned
 
00:29:24.169 --> 00:29:24.179 align:start position:0%
person has had a lot of involvement in
 
00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:26.820 align:start position:0%
your community served on boards and that
 
00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:29.220 align:start position:0%
sort of thing so following procedure
 
00:29:30.649 --> 00:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
from the chairman I think should be
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
rather easy for you so I throw that
 
00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
um representative Abbott throughout a a
 
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
very important thing that I probably
 
00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:40.940 align:start position:0%
should have brought up
 
00:29:44.029 --> 00:29:44.039 align:start position:0%
it has been a long history of this
 
00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
committee and it's because of the work
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
we do together and that we find resolve
 
00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:51.860 align:start position:0%
and that we we come up with
 
00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:55.860 align:start position:0%
bills that are are strong that we are
 
00:29:59.149 --> 00:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
very rarely questioned on the floor when
 
00:30:00.889 --> 00:30:00.899 align:start position:0%
it comes time to present our two
 
00:30:03.769 --> 00:30:03.779 align:start position:0%
Hallmark bills one being in the capital
 
00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:05.700 align:start position:0%
budget which we're going to work on this
 
00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
year and next year will be the 10-year
 
00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:10.029 align:start position:0%
year and next year will be the 10-year
10-year

00:30:10.029 --> 00:30:10.039 align:start position:0%
10-year
 
00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:12.200 align:start position:0%
Transportation plan
 
00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.049 align:start position:0%
Transportation plan
so

00:30:14.049 --> 00:30:14.059 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
we we I put it out there we're thought
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
highly in other committees and so I want
 
00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
you to know that you're coming into a
 
00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:25.980 align:start position:0%
group that in all honesty when we step
 
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
on the floor is well thought out
 
00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
represent Newman I did not realize it
 
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.240 align:start position:0%

00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.600 align:start position:0%

00:30:54.169 --> 00:30:54.179 align:start position:0%

rack in there if it turns out we don't
 
00:31:11.409 --> 00:31:11.419 align:start position:0%
have enough accommodation
 
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
then please let me know and we'll figure
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%

table
 
00:31:34.669 --> 00:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
when we are out here some of the members
 
00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
will need to have
 
00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919 align:start position:0%
uh Clerk and others might have a laptop
 
00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
and that sort of thing but during all
 
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
hearings we want we want the people to

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
there is a chart on the wall over there
 
00:32:30.889 --> 00:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
I'll double check that that talks about
 
00:32:33.649 --> 00:32:33.659 align:start position:0%
how we get out of here in the event of a
 
00:32:35.409 --> 00:32:35.419 align:start position:0%
fire emergency
 
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:39.960 align:start position:0%

00:32:56.269 --> 00:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
airline showing you which door we're
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%

um one day in a session that they will
 
00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:05.820 align:start position:0%

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
we have not chosen yet although
 
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
representative Newman is is showing much
 
00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
urgency in this position but the
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
um the far the far right seat uh next to
 
00:33:24.289 --> 00:33:24.299 align:start position:0%

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
assign I don't know what the official
 
00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
title is but we will come up with one
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
our security individual in in the event
 
00:33:36.769 --> 00:33:36.779 align:start position:0%
that during testimony or for some reason
 
00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:39.740 align:start position:0%
we have a health emergency
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
we'd alert the person on the far right
 
00:33:47.529 --> 00:33:47.539 align:start position:0%
seat who will then contact security and
 
00:33:51.909 --> 00:33:51.919 align:start position:0%
and keep things moving forward
 
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
we they've talked about a word the word
 
00:33:57.649 --> 00:33:57.659 align:start position:0%
typically has been Hawk when we ask for
 
00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:02.220 align:start position:0%
Mr Hawk then that's that's when the
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
the person on the last seat jumps to
 
00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
alert and runs out of the room
 
00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:08.810 align:start position:0%
alert and runs out of the room
so

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
um our seating assignment is uh is
 
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
hybrid at this point uh speaker has
 
00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:17.700 align:start position:0%
asked that we mingle in and out every
 
00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:19.980 align:start position:0%
other or so forth Republican Democrat
 
00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
I've sort of worked uh the front table
 
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
here if if you're sitting somewhere that
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
is not comfortable for you or you have
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
needs where you need to leave the room
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh for some some certain reason then
 
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
just please let me know and we'll make
 
00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:39.060 align:start position:0%
arrangement and so by the time we meet
 
00:34:41.869 --> 00:34:41.879 align:start position:0%
next time uh we will have it
 
00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:43.980 align:start position:0%
um in stone where everyone's going to be
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
sitting the microphones
 
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
um they um because we are live
 
00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
um you need to press your uh I think
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
most of you just have one button and uh
 
00:34:58.849 --> 00:34:58.859 align:start position:0%
turn it on and turn it off when you
 
00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
speak and when you're finished
 
00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:04.130 align:start position:0%
speak and when you're finished
the

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:06.540 align:start position:0%

that they weren't going to be here for
 
00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:14.780 align:start position:0%
one reason or the other
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%

first first term people and or business
 
00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
that's coming up as much notice as we
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
can get would be preferable
 
00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
uh first time I came to the house one
 
00:35:59.810 --> 00:35:59.820 align:start position:0%
election my wife and I and our kids had
 
00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:02.700 align:start position:0%
already lined up a trip to Disney I
 
00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to be here for inauguration
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
day I don't know if
 
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
um you folks know the name Gene Chandler
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
he was first time speaker at the time
 
00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:13.500 align:start position:0%
and I had mentioned to the speaker that
 
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
I wasn't going to be there for
 
00:36:17.089 --> 00:36:17.099 align:start position:0%
inauguration and if you knew the
 
00:36:19.849 --> 00:36:19.859 align:start position:0%
gentleman he had very very dry sense of
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
humor and Gene turned to me and said
 
00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
well you should be so I made
 
00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
arrangements to fly my family come back
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
and then go back again only to find out
 
00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
after 20 years he says Mark you never
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
had to do that so
 
00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
so I'm just saying if you can't if you
 
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
can't be here please just let us know
 
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
ahead of time
 
00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
the um we have posted I'm sure you all
 
00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:47.720 align:start position:0%
know about the calendar
 
00:36:50.569 --> 00:36:50.579 align:start position:0%
our notices have to come out of this
 
00:36:53.089 --> 00:36:53.099 align:start position:0%
room by Wednesday to make it into the
 
00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:56.220 align:start position:0%
calendar we've posted our first hearings
 
00:36:59.390 --> 00:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
which will be John on the 20th Wednesday
 
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
the 25th right starting at 10 A.M 25th
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
and I have we have 14 bills before our
 
00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:10.740 align:start position:0%
committee right now we're hoping to take
 
00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:13.980 align:start position:0%
the first seven on the first day and I
 
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
have a schedule here that I've shared
 
00:37:20.089 --> 00:37:20.099 align:start position:0%
with uh with John and with David which
 
00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:22.260 align:start position:0%
would be the following Friday where we
 
00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
would handle the next seven
 
00:37:26.569 --> 00:37:26.579 align:start position:0%
we have a conflict if we're picking the
 
00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
27th because Rockingham County as their
 
00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:31.980 align:start position:0%
executive committee meaning that they at
 
00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
all okay so 27th and it's special except
 
00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
nine o'clock so we can't okay sounds
 
00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
good we'll we'll work through that we so
 
00:37:42.349 --> 00:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
we have our first we will most likely be
 
00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
the following Monday I would think
 
00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
we um we'll figure that out and and let
 
00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
you know many of you are have businesses
 
00:37:55.609 --> 00:37:55.619 align:start position:0%
or still work and
 
00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
um so I'm trying to stay ahead of the
 
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
schedule the capital budget the governor
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
will release that officially has to
 
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
release it I Believe by February 15th
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
they're about
 
00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
um we have
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
I've had some conversations with his uh
 
00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:15.500 align:start position:0%
budget director
 
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
it looks like our numbers at least at
 
00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
this point will be somewhere somewhat
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
that we've seen him in the past
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
120 million dollars or so
 
00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
um there were rumors that it was going
 
00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
to be a much lesser number but it looks
 
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
like we have a comfortable number the
 
00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:34.140 align:start position:0%
treasure will be one of the first people
 
00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
that comes in we'll talk about our
 
00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:37.390 align:start position:0%
that comes in we'll talk about our
responsible

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:37.400 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
bonding how that comes about and so
 
00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
forth so
 
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
we will be we will deliberate we will
 
00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
hear our bills we will get our bills
 
00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
done well ahead of the February deadline
 
00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
because once we go into the capital
 
00:38:58.730 --> 00:38:58.740 align:start position:0%
budget we will spend four or five days
 
00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
hearing from the agencies
 
00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
and we will probably then spend nearly
 
00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
as much time than
 
00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
um discussing their budget needs so we
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
will have a very intense schedule
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
um through February and mid-march
 
00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:20.820 align:start position:0%
and then of course we always have to
 
00:39:23.569 --> 00:39:23.579 align:start position:0%
work around the days we're in session
 
00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:25.140 align:start position:0%
and so forth
 
00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:28.280 align:start position:0%
so that's that's sort of
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
our schedule on our first day I think we
 
00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
start at 10 o'clock and our last hearing
 
00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
is at um three o'clock three o'clock so
 
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:44.089 --> 00:39:44.099 align:start position:0%
it's always a chore for a chairman to
 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
figure how much time it's it's going to
 
00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:49.940 align:start position:0%
be for each and every one so hopefully
 
00:39:52.609 --> 00:39:52.619 align:start position:0%
past experience helps a little so we
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
don't have too much dead time there we
 
00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
do have a request what day did I say
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to do that
 
00:40:03.069 --> 00:40:03.079 align:start position:0%
we had we had a request from
 
00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:05.900 align:start position:0%
to do a site visit
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
just around the corner Department of
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
Education wants to move into new digs
 
00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
and I scheduled that tentatively
 
00:40:19.069 --> 00:40:19.079 align:start position:0%
for that Friday so I have to move it
 
00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
um because it's just down the road I
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
thought we'd go take a peek at what
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
their facilities that they want to move
 
00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:37.849 --> 00:40:37.859 align:start position:0%
so I know everyone should be well versed
 
00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
on you know at least what's coming in
 
00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:41.220 align:start position:0%
for the first when we talk about public
 
00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:42.490 align:start position:0%
for the first when we talk about public
hearings

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:42.500 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
I find especially important that we be
 
00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
as courteous that's what we're here to
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
to hear testimony I do not
 
00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
um and it has never been the policy of a
 
00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
chairman in this committee to allow
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
members to debate or engage
 
00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
persons that are here with testimony if
 
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
you have if you have questions
 
00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
department heads or a question a
 
00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
clarifying question that's fine but I
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%

know I've been a clerk and it's not an
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
easy job not a job that everybody wants
 
00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
but to make the clerk's job a little bit
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
easier if you have it please uh you know
 
00:43:24.589 --> 00:43:24.599 align:start position:0%
and maybe pass out the copies well ahead
 
00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:27.180 align:start position:0%
of time and but in any case if you have
 
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
your just one copy you know the clerk
 
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
would appreciate a copy at the end of
 
00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
00:43:36.109 --> 00:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
um as far as recognizing people uh I
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
mean I'm just and I'm marking on how you
 
00:43:40.849 --> 00:43:40.859 align:start position:0%
do it but the first person who raises a
 
00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:42.900 align:start position:0%
hand I will recognize you sometimes
 
00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of people I write a list
 
00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:46.380 align:start position:0%
down to keep a track in my head because
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
sometimes I'm trying to follow stuff and
 
00:43:50.809 --> 00:43:50.819 align:start position:0%
it's not easy and if I forget just
 
00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:53.220 align:start position:0%
politely ask me that you have a question
 
00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
and remind me when I try to take it and
 
00:43:58.370 --> 00:43:58.380 align:start position:0%
the order I see your hand raised so if
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
if for example representative Newman
 
00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
raises her hand first she goes first uh
 
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
Representatives under fidolfi if he's
 
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
next same thing and I've I've watched
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
cheers over the years and I write a list
 
00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:11.940 align:start position:0%
of last names if they're into a way for
 
00:44:13.849 --> 00:44:13.859 align:start position:0%
me to keep track especially a lot of you
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
have questions
 
00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
um I can't think of anything else at the
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
moment Mr chairman thank you
 
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
David do you have anything dead at this
 
00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:22.970 align:start position:0%
David do you have anything dead at this
point

00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:22.980 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
um uh no sir I just want to go over two
 
00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:26.870 align:start position:0%
um uh no sir I just want to go over two
things

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:44:28.849 --> 00:44:28.859 align:start position:0%
because I have to call roll call on a
 
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
lot of these things and I want to make
 
00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
sure I've got these last two names it's
 
00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.430 align:start position:0%
sure I've got these last two names it's
vallone

00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
vallone
 
00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:37.140 align:start position:0%
the loan and
 
00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:40.730 align:start position:0%
the loan and
Baldwin

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:43.849 --> 00:44:43.859 align:start position:0%
I'm done those are ones I had problems
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
with unless I've been saying anybody
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
else is wrong for the last 10 years
 
00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:49.730 align:start position:0%
else is wrong for the last 10 years
representative

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:49.740 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
I think it might be helpful if you
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
explain uh
 
00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:55.380 align:start position:0%
that when you're recognized to ask the
 
00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
question you ask one question and then
 
00:44:59.630 --> 00:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
if you have something to follow on you
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
asked to be recognized again or for
 
00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:03.530 align:start position:0%
asked to be recognized again or for
follow-up

00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
um and the other thing I'll make you
 
00:45:08.329 --> 00:45:08.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:12.300 align:start position:0%
who who can or who does see the video
 
00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:14.660 align:start position:0%
and and audio feed and
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
just so people are aware that there's an
 
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
audience out there
 
00:45:23.089 --> 00:45:23.099 align:start position:0%
excellent points so
 
00:45:23.099 --> 00:45:23.870 align:start position:0%
excellent points so
um

00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
unless unless you're told otherwise when
 
00:45:29.089 --> 00:45:29.099 align:start position:0%
you're when you're in this room
 
00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:31.079 align:start position:0%
take the stance that you're being
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
recorded we will because there's is
 
00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:35.700 align:start position:0%
there a red light or anything that's
 
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
telling us something's going on here I
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
don't think there is so if you're in
 
00:45:42.109 --> 00:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
this room
 
00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:44.460 align:start position:0%
um and it is there have been you're
 
00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
being filmed and it's going out and so
 
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
private conversation take it private and
 
00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:51.900 align:start position:0%
especially if you're caught on a hot mic
 
00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
that's that's not a good thing so you
 
00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
recognize for the question as Robson
 
00:45:58.910 --> 00:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
Fogg said if you have a follow-up Mr
 
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
chairman my follow-up is uh but just
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
don't keep just don't keep rolling
 
00:46:04.319 --> 00:46:06.650 align:start position:0%
don't keep just don't keep rolling
through

00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:07.930 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:07.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:10.740 align:start position:0%
represent Mills will be calling the roll
 
00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
call as we go I'm I will come right back
 
00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
to you I'm notoriously horrible with
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
last names
 
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
that's just that's just part of my uh of
 
00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:23.940 align:start position:0%
who I am so if I get stuck and we're in
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
a committee and I pointed to the
 
00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:27.500 align:start position:0%
representative or call for someone else
 
00:46:30.829 --> 00:46:30.839 align:start position:0%
please go with me we'll we'll find our
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
way through
 
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
um a question
 
00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:37.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so just to clarify
 
00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
so if we testify on a bill that we're
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
having a hearing on we're done for that
 
00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:43.140 align:start position:0%
hearing we have to stay in the audience
 
00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
we don't come back to our chair is that
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
correct that's that's my understanding
 
00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:49.500 align:start position:0%
yes great executive session needless to
 
00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
say you're allowed back at your chair
 
00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:55.220 align:start position:0%
okay but the the idea is to contain
 
00:46:58.910 --> 00:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
asking questions on on your own
 
00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
anyone else with questions at this point
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:08.460 align:start position:0%
just the clarification if you're
 
00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:11.460 align:start position:0%
testifying on a bill you only step aside
 
00:47:12.829 --> 00:47:12.839 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
that bill only once that bill has been
 
00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
heard you can come back to sit that
 
00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
would be true sir thank you
 
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
and if we're having an executive session
 
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
it will be noticed ahead of time
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
the um the rules as I understand them is
 
00:47:35.809 --> 00:47:35.819 align:start position:0%
that we're to give four days notice
 
00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:40.020 align:start position:0%

00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
uh that's one of our charges and and
 
00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:47.940 align:start position:0%
many times
 
00:47:50.569 --> 00:47:50.579 align:start position:0%
um it will be for a lost family member
 
00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:53.460 align:start position:0%
or something and we may have in the
 
00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:55.140 align:start position:0%
audience family members that have
 
00:47:57.890 --> 00:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
traveled here and I don't because see I
 
00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
did not put this on our first notice but
 
00:48:01.609 --> 00:48:01.619 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure it goes out
 
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
Wednesday that we may exec on all of
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
those bills but I'll make that as a
 
00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:10.140 align:start position:0%
courtesy we we try and exec those bills
 
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sorry please go ahead
 
00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
it looks it looks like Mondays and
 
00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:28.740 align:start position:0%
Fridays well
 
00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
well conflict with that with
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
the county commissions because they're
 
00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:34.500 align:start position:0%
so used to every
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
everyone's name there's Thursdays that
 
00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:38.660 align:start position:0%
that they try and schedule okay
 
00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:42.660 align:start position:0%
so we we lost Tuesday in here because of
 
00:48:44.809 --> 00:48:44.819 align:start position:0%
the transportation committee so we'll
 
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
fill in on days then on Tuesday so we're
 
00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
saying Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and
 
00:48:52.609 --> 00:48:52.619 align:start position:0%
Thursday so we'll does that work for you
 
00:48:52.619 --> 00:49:00.829 align:start position:0%
Thursday so we'll does that work for you
sir

00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
Fridays are not good
 
00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:07.140 align:start position:0%
Fridays for other members an issue
 
00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:10.910 align:start position:0%
Fridays for other members an issue
counties

00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:13.380 align:start position:0%
okay we're in it we're in a tough spot
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
where we're sharing a room it was always
 
00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:17.220 align:start position:0%
so much easier and we had one room and
 
00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
we could work on our day so
 
00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:22.140 align:start position:0%
um I will sit with the vice chairman and
 
00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
the clerk uh when we finish to push that
 
00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
on to a new day that works for us but
 
00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
once County County work you should
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
actually be done in a couple months
 
00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:33.900 align:start position:0%
won't you depending on what your
 
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:38.460 align:start position:0%
all right a lot of things moving yes sir
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh just a some information due to the
 
00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:45.180 align:start position:0%
county budget and stuff coming February
 
00:49:47.329 --> 00:49:47.339 align:start position:0%
Wednesdays it looks like we're trying to
 
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
cover our from a county delegation uh
 
00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:53.700 align:start position:0%
the budgets from one to five each of
 
00:49:57.010 --> 00:49:57.020 align:start position:0%
those Wendy's Wednesdays of February
 
00:49:59.630 --> 00:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that'll have any adverse
 
00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:02.050 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that'll have any adverse
effect

00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:02.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
yeah every every County's different
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
um we my Carroll County we tend to uh
 
00:50:13.069 --> 00:50:13.079 align:start position:0%
meet on Mondays and when we have
 
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
conflicts with the house then we meet on
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
Saturdays so perhaps you folks could let
 
00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
us know where you know where where your
 
00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
county schedules are
 
00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:27.849 align:start position:0%
county schedules are
um

00:50:27.849 --> 00:50:27.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:30.589 --> 00:50:30.599 align:start position:0%
I view the most important work is done
 
00:50:32.569 --> 00:50:32.579 align:start position:0%
in this room in the county is second but
 
00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:35.460 align:start position:0%
we will we will we will work that out
 
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
anyone else with questions
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you chair you
 
00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:44.940 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh reviewing capital budget uh
 
00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
it's going to be intense from the middle
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
of February until about the middle of
 
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
March uh and that would
 
00:50:53.569 --> 00:50:53.579 align:start position:0%
be Tuesday through Thursday for the most
 
00:50:53.579 --> 00:50:54.650 align:start position:0%
be Tuesday through Thursday for the most
part

00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
part
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
is that how it looks at this point we
 
00:50:58.430 --> 00:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
would we would meet two to three days a
 
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
week okay and then there'll be there
 
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
might be a house session in there
 
00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:05.700 align:start position:0%
working around that yeah same same sort
 
00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:08.220 align:start position:0%
of schedule we'll start for nine o'clock
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
or ten o'clock and go to at least three
 
00:51:12.549 --> 00:51:12.559 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the afternoon
 
00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
trying to schedule our hearings uh so
 
00:51:18.829 --> 00:51:18.839 align:start position:0%
that we can get an hour break for uh
 
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
lunch usually somewhere around noon to
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
one o'clock
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
if you have dietary needs and and things
 
00:51:31.069 --> 00:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
are running and you it's you need to
 
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
have food then
 
00:51:36.609 --> 00:51:36.619 align:start position:0%
off off to the committee room you go
 
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
let's see what else I have
 
00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:47.690 align:start position:0%
let's see what else I have
um

00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll hold it for the next time
 
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
yes amendments to bills now normally
 
00:51:55.609 --> 00:51:55.619 align:start position:0%
when we have an amendment to the bill we
 
00:51:57.770 --> 00:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
we take it up before the main bill that
 
00:51:59.569 --> 00:51:59.579 align:start position:0%
the practice in our committee at least
 
00:52:01.309 --> 00:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
although some committees are different
 
00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
but normally most amendments we don't
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
have a roll call vote right and we we
 
00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:08.220 align:start position:0%
vote on but we may do a Voice vote for
 
00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:10.140 align:start position:0%
an amendment and then do a roll call on
 
00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
the bill itself and if it's amended as
 
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
on the bill is amended right I mean
 
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
that's this one that can clear to
 
00:52:19.390 --> 00:52:19.400 align:start position:0%
everybody how we handle amendments more
 
00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
amendments excuse me amendments to
 
00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:24.300 align:start position:0%
legislation we have before us to to
 
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
consider an amendment it has to be in
 
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
writing and and gone through the process
 
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
and brought back to this committee room
 
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
with a seal on it and I'm sure that was
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
discussed uh other times amendments will
 
00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:38.940 align:start position:0%
be brought up if you recognized in the
 
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:41.700 align:start position:0%
amendment uh will be brought forward and
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
it does not have to be a roll call so uh
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
um a hand count or uh some and there was
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
a controversy a few years back that one
 
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
of our I think officials former house
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
clerk said that everything amendments
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
had to be a roll call and I guess at the
 
00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
time I think that our one of our chair
 
00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:00.900 align:start position:0%
get back here I hate to use the name
 
00:53:02.809 --> 00:53:02.819 align:start position:0%
chairman Chandler disagreed and our
 
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
process had been any amendments normal
 
00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:06.780 align:start position:0%
unless it's a major issue that we do
 
00:53:09.049 --> 00:53:09.059 align:start position:0%
just The Voice vote on amendments but a
 
00:53:11.569 --> 00:53:11.579 align:start position:0%
roll call on a main a bill and if it's
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
amended the bill as amended I just want
 
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
to clarify that that's that's correct
 
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
and before we before we go into our
 
00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
first executive session will will go
 
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
through all the all the procedures and
 
00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
and how and how that is done
 
00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:33.049 --> 00:53:33.059 align:start position:0%
yes go right ahead thank you uh the
 
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
former chair of the committee uh David
 
00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
Campbell of Nashua is the Corporation
 
00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
Council at the New Hampshire North Coast
 
00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
Railroad and he's been kind enough to
 
00:53:43.370 --> 00:53:43.380 align:start position:0%
bring us calendars full of pictures of
 
00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
trains there on the table here and
 
00:53:49.370 --> 00:53:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.309 --> 00:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.319 --> 00:53:56.829 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:53:56.829 --> 00:53:56.839 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
I I really don't have anything else at
 
00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:02.220 align:start position:0%
this point unless John you do or David
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
at this point uh we will the only other
 
00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:07.380 align:start position:0%
thing if you don't thank you Mr chairman
 
00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
about executive sessions that when we
 
00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
have an executive session that normally
 
00:54:14.569 --> 00:54:14.579 align:start position:0%
that's the time the public it's a public
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
meeting the public can stay here but
 
00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:18.180 align:start position:0%
they it's no longer testimony time they
 
00:54:21.049 --> 00:54:21.059 align:start position:0%
basically it's our show and it's us an
 
00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
opportunity for committee members to
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
debate a bill ask questions but unless
 
00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
we need some information normally we
 
00:54:29.329 --> 00:54:29.339 align:start position:0%
don't they're supposed to keep their
 
00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
mouth you know quiet to be honest with
 
00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:32.940 align:start position:0%
you right that's the practice for any
 
00:54:34.609 --> 00:54:34.619 align:start position:0%
executive session I think some members
 
00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
get a little confused about what an
 
00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
executive session is versus a public
 
00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
hearing and executive session normally
