00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
in a so-called donor town so maybe I um
 

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.310 align:start position:0%
in a so-called donor town so maybe I um
maybe<00:32:22.080><c> have</c><00:32:22.159><c> a</c><00:32:22.320><c> different</c><00:32:22.559><c> perspective</c><00:32:23.000><c> on</c><00:32:23.159><c> it</c>

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:23.320 align:start position:0%
maybe have a different perspective on it
 

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.990 align:start position:0%
maybe have a different perspective on it
but<00:32:23.440><c> I</c><00:32:23.559><c> think</c><00:32:23.760><c> it</c><00:32:24.000><c> probably</c><00:32:24.240><c> is</c><00:32:24.440><c> appropriate</c>

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
but I think it probably is appropriate
 

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.710 align:start position:0%
but I think it probably is appropriate
for<00:32:25.360><c> some</c><00:32:25.600><c> towns</c><00:32:25.840><c> that</c><00:32:26.000><c> have</c><00:32:26.200><c> high</c><00:32:26.399><c> property</c>

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
for some towns that have high property
 

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.909 align:start position:0%
for some towns that have high property
values<00:32:27.240><c> in</c><00:32:27.360><c> fact</c><00:32:27.559><c> end</c><00:32:27.720><c> up</c><00:32:27.960><c> being</c><00:32:28.159><c> donor</c><00:32:28.559><c> town</c>

00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
values in fact end up being donor town
 

00:32:28.919 --> 00:32:30.789 align:start position:0%
values in fact end up being donor town
so<00:32:29.080><c> it's</c><00:32:29.320><c> kind</c><00:32:29.440><c> of</c><00:32:30.000><c> didn't</c><00:32:30.240><c> really</c><00:32:30.399><c> make</c><00:32:30.600><c> much</c>

00:32:30.789 --> 00:32:30.799 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of didn't really make much
 

00:32:30.799 --> 00:32:32.590 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of didn't really make much
sense<00:32:31.039><c> of</c><00:32:31.200><c> it</c><00:32:31.639><c> if</c><00:32:31.760><c> we</c><00:32:31.880><c> have</c><00:32:32.000><c> a</c><00:32:32.120><c> Statewide</c>

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:32.600 align:start position:0%

00:32:36.149 --> 00:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
property tax um it should actually be a
 

00:32:36.159 --> 00:32:39.110 align:start position:0%
property tax um it should actually be a
Statewide<00:32:36.679><c> property</c><00:32:37.080><c> tax</c><00:32:37.399><c> so</c><00:32:37.600><c> certainly</c><00:32:38.360><c> they</c>

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax so certainly they
 

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.470 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax so certainly they
you<00:32:39.240><c> know</c><00:32:39.480><c> that's</c><00:32:40.399><c> I</c><00:32:40.519><c> mean</c><00:32:40.720><c> some</c><00:32:40.919><c> towns</c><00:32:41.240><c> will</c>

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:41.480 align:start position:0%
you know that's I mean some towns will
 

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.870 align:start position:0%
you know that's I mean some towns will
be<00:32:42.200><c> paying</c><00:32:42.480><c> more</c><00:32:42.720><c> Statewide</c><00:32:43.240><c> property</c><00:32:43.559><c> tax</c>

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:43.880 align:start position:0%

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.549 align:start position:0%

independent um regulated businesses
 

01:30:46.199 --> 01:30:48.510 align:start position:0%
independent um regulated businesses
right<01:30:46.320><c> so</c><01:30:46.679><c> heavily</c><01:30:47.080><c> regulated</c><01:30:47.719><c> but</c><01:30:48.040><c> but</c><01:30:48.239><c> even</c>

01:30:48.510 --> 01:30:48.520 align:start position:0%
right so heavily regulated but but even
 

01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:50.310 align:start position:0%

all<03:53:27.520><c> I</c><03:53:27.600><c> think</c><03:53:27.760><c> the</c><03:53:27.920><c> answer</c><03:53:28.239><c> is</c><03:53:28.720><c> is</c><03:53:28.960><c> no</c><03:53:29.640><c> because</c>

03:53:30.189 --> 03:53:30.199 align:start position:0%
all I think the answer is is no because
 

03:53:30.199 --> 03:53:33.630 align:start position:0%
all I think the answer is is no because
it's<03:53:30.520><c> really</c><03:53:31.359><c> about</c><03:53:31.640><c> the</c><03:53:31.840><c> finance</c><03:53:32.520><c> so</c><03:53:33.520><c> there</c>

03:53:35.910 --> 03:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
was a little bit of vague stuff about
 

03:53:35.920 --> 03:53:40.710 align:start position:0%
was a little bit of vague stuff about

03:53:40.710 --> 03:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
because um um uh municipalities might
 

03:53:40.720 --> 03:53:42.670 align:start position:0%
because um um uh municipalities might
have<03:53:40.920><c> Labor</c><03:53:41.319><c> agreements</c><03:53:42.040><c> therefore</c><03:53:42.520><c> they</c>
