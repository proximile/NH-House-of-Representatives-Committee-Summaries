morning it being 10 o'clock I will call
 
00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:41.439 align:start position:0%
the finance committee meeting to order
 
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
the purpose of today's 10:00 meeting is
 
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 align:start position:0%
a review of House Bill
 
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
1583 a non-gain Amendment because it was
 
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
changing the law slightly from the
 
00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
original Bill we are required to have a
 
00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
public hearing this will be a chime for
 
00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 align:start position:0%
us to listen to the public then later on
 
00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 align:start position:0%
we will discuss among ourselves any new
 
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
information that came forward in this
 
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
public hearing I I have many pink cards
 
00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 align:start position:0%
here some of you have been nice enough
 
00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.159 align:start position:0%
to put down three minutes and I hope you
 
00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
can stay to that some of you have not uh
 
00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 align:start position:0%
marked on your card whether you support
 
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 align:start position:0%
the bill or how much time you want to
 
00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:24.199 align:start position:0%
take so if there have been comments made
 
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
by a previous
 
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
speaker that are pretty much the same as
 
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 align:start position:0%
what you would like like to say uh
 
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes the committee gets a little
 
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
tired of the repetition so if there's
 
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
something that's the same as has been
 
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
previously stated please mention that
 
00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 align:start position:0%
and and shorten your remarks so that we
 
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
can fit everybody in in the one hour
 
00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 align:start position:0%
because we'll have another one after
 
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
that I would now like to hear from the
 
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh sponsor or of the um non-gain
 
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
amendment to House Bill 1583 represent
 
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
Emer chairman of division two on the
 
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
house finance committee representative
 
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
Emer thank you Mr
 
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
chair I'll start by saying the the house
 
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.350 align:start position:0%
chair I'll start by saying the the house
bill

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:14.199 align:start position:0%
1583 as passed in the
 
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
house remains largely the same all of
 
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
the special allocations and grants are
 
00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 align:start position:0%
still in the bill the only thing that is
 
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 align:start position:0%
being changed is
 
00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 align:start position:0%
adequacy uh what this amendment does is
 
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
33561 that was recommended by the judge
 
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
in the conval uh education case this
 
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
amendment has three parts part one is
 
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
the actual adequacy statement and how
 
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
this is going to be
 
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 align:start position:0%
handled what happens is the districts
 
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
contribute a little over $2 billion to
 
00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 align:start position:0%
education and the state contributes
 
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
about 1 billion so what we're going to
 
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
do is recharacterize some of the $2.2
 
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
billion that the districts uh contribute
 
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
to call it swept so the swept will go up
 
00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:13.479 align:start position:0%
by about $400
 
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 align:start position:0%
million and that would give us the the
 
00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
higher adequacy uh value part two of the
 
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
amendment has to do
 
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
with uh setting appropriation controls
 
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
so that if the if the District sees some
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
headro because of the dollars that have
 
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 align:start position:0%
been allocated for swept they cannot
 
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
raise their
 
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 align:start position:0%
total uh
 
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
budget higher than what was appropriated
 
00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:44.919 align:start position:0%
at their town meeting because that's
 
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
already set so they they can not go up
 
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
any higher than has already been
 
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
appropriated that part two also uh has a
 
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.909 align:start position:0%
appropriated that part two also uh has a
uh

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.120 align:start position:0%
three-year uh ceiling on spending uh
 
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
currently it has to do
 
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
allows increases by the Consumer Price
 
00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:05.479 align:start position:0%
Index or by a 2third vote of the uh
 
00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:07.070 align:start position:0%
Index or by a 2third vote of the uh
District's

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
District's
 
00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 align:start position:0%
legislature part three of the
 
00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
bill is excess swept which is part of a
 
00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:15.879 align:start position:0%
Rand decision and also part of the
 
00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
conval decision uh that the excess swept
 
00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:21.759 align:start position:0%
in communities like mine in Hampton
 
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
cannot be maintained by the district but
 
00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:26.919 align:start position:0%
must be forwarded to the state for the
 
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
educational trust fund so that's the
 
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
30,000 foot view I'll be glad to answer
 
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
any questions if the committee has
 
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
members representative Edwards uh thank
 
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you represent
 
00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
Emer um in I I I I I'm open to the
 
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:53.720 align:start position:0%
amount of money that you all looked at
 
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
and considered I uh I'm I tend to want
 
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
to support your initiative I just would
 
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
like to know was there any testimony in
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
committee that voiced concern about the
 
00:08:11.149 --> 00:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
judicial branch assuming the
 
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
prerogatives of the legislature I I
 
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
think when we set up our form of
 
00:08:19.149 --> 00:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
government it was expected that each
 
00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:22.879 align:start position:0%
branch would jealously guard its uh
 
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
privileges under the Constitution and in
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
this case it feels like a a judge does
 
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
not know
 
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
their their boundaries and they've gone
 
00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
into the spending mode which is purely a
 
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
legislative function so was there was
 
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
there any testimony that suggested that
 
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
we're setting a a bad precedent by just
 
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
simply following the J the judges um uh
 
00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
level of funding recommended level of
 
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
funding I think the operative word
 
00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:54.949 align:start position:0%
funding I think the operative word
there's

00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
recommended he didn't make it a part of
 
00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
the of the uh findings but it was a a
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation that that he had
 
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
calculated so I when I put the amendment
 
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
together I just took his
 
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation follow up follow so then
 
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
in in in in the in your way of thinking
 
00:09:23.389 --> 00:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
then have we maintained our legislative
 
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
independence from the Judiciary yes
 
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.350 align:start position:0%
independence from the Judiciary yes
thank

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:28.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
you further questions from committee
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%

taking my question um the um uh to come
 
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
up with the additional funds needed to
 
00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
raise the adequacy level uh your bill
 
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
proposes um Statewide property tax
 
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
increase uh did you consider any other
 
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
sources of funding uh to make up the
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
difference no is follow up it has to
 
00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:00.839 align:start position:0%
come property
 
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
could you explain why it has to come
 
00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:05.240 align:start position:0%
from property tax is that by Statute
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
or thank
 
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
you representative Wallner followed by
 
00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:16.470 align:start position:0%
you representative Wallner followed by
representative

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
Heath so when I was looking at the bill
 
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
and then I was looking at the
 
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
materials provided by the um legislative
 
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
budget assistant it seemed that
 
00:10:35.069 --> 00:10:35.079 align:start position:0%
this proposal actually is about $100
 
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
million um short of funding what we need
 
00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
for um giving to the Comm um funding our
 
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
schools can you explain to me how where
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
that $100 million would come from
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
certainly currently the excess swep in
 
00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:54.839 align:start position:0%
the state is approximately $29 million
 
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
once we move the adequacy up to over
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
$7,000 the ESS swep will be about $90
 
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
million which takes the Lion Share of
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
increase thank you representative Heath
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr chair
 
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I continue to
 
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
be confused by the mathematics of all
 
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
this so from what I understand the Dr
 
00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:29.639 align:start position:0%
will set the amount of money that a
 
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
school district can spend on public
 
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
education um the then they will generate
 
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
the amount of um swept taxes that have
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:48.839 align:start position:0%
raised for some reason is as much as
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
you've tried to explain it to me I
 
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
simply cannot understand how we are
 
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
going to use money the school districts
 
00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
already using and then raise sufficient
 
00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
funds for swept without having to raise
 
00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:07.240 align:start position:0%
local property taxes can you please
 
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.350 align:start position:0%
local property taxes can you please
enlighten

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
enlighten
 
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
me well
 
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
first I won't get into the Dr portion
 
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:13.829 align:start position:0%
first I won't get into the Dr portion
because

00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
that's I just try to explain where the
 
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
money is going to come from currently if
 
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
a if a a community has uh
 
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
a150 or their Ed local education what
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
this says is that 20 cents of that will
 
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
now be recharacterized as swept so your
 
00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
tax bill instead of saying a150 we'll
 
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
say $130 per th000 the 20 cents will go
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
into the swep calculation so what this
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
if the swep was a dollar it's now
 
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
a120 the net effect to the taxpayer is
 
00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
no increase all it is is redefining
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:59.230 --> 00:12:59.240 align:start position:0%
swept even further question um thank you
 
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so we'll be using I'm from
 
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester so Manchester will be
 
00:13:12.189 --> 00:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
spending and then
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
raising the the necessary amount
 
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:20.519 align:start position:0%
locally for the amount of money we have
 
00:13:20.519 --> 00:13:22.150 align:start position:0%
locally for the amount of money we have
to

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
raise without any fiscal impact at all
 
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
on our tax base correct
 
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
I will put a caveat in there if you are
 
00:13:37.949 --> 00:13:37.959 align:start position:0%
a excess swept District yes you will see
 
00:13:39.949 --> 00:13:39.959 align:start position:0%
could see an increase in your local
 
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
taxes because the swept has to come back
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
to the state but in Manchester that's
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
you representative tki for a question
 
00:13:53.389 --> 00:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question can you just clarify
 
00:13:59.949 --> 00:13:59.959 align:start position:0%
um when you were talking about um
 
00:13:59.959 --> 00:14:01.870 align:start position:0%
um when you were talking about um
part

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
part
 
00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
two about um municipalities won't be
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
able to they'll be a sealing on spending
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me like that you're taking
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
away local control from each Town's
 
00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
ability to um determine their spending
 
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
no it the the it actually talks about
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
appropriation it's saying you you can't
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
increase your
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation beyond what it's already
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
voted on and over the next three years
 
00:14:31.749 --> 00:14:31.759 align:start position:0%
the is tied to the Consumer Price Index
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
for increases or the legislative body by
 
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.670 align:start position:0%
 
appropriation

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:47.749 --> 00:14:47.759 align:start position:0%
followup that puzzled look it is a
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
puzzled look um so this
 
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
is not
 
00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
limiting a Town's ability to adjust no
 
00:14:59.310 --> 00:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
their spending over the course course of
 
00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
three years
 
00:15:03.629 --> 00:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
no they their legislative body can
 
00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
increase it with a two-thirds vote by a
 
00:15:09.069 --> 00:15:09.079 align:start position:0%
two-thirds vote which is sorry which one
 
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
last comment before I um a two-thirds
 
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
vote which has proven to be extremely
 
00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
challenging in many
 
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
you right I think uh we already heard
 
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
from representative Stringham so we'll
 
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
go next to representative Murray and
 
00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:31.399 align:start position:0%
then representative hacken Phillips
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
my question um this involves Public
 
00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:37.480 align:start position:0%
Schools can you tell me what the
 
00:15:39.309 --> 00:15:39.319 align:start position:0%
financial impact would be if you're
 
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
start if you include your charter
 
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
schools and the EFA programs because
 
00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
that's a whole another um bushel of
 
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
students isn't it that's not included in
 
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
this is it there will be the EFA will be
 
00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
affected because the new new adequacy is
 
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.949 align:start position:0%
affected because the new new adequacy is
the

00:15:55.949 --> 00:15:55.959 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:58.509 --> 00:15:58.519 align:start position:0%
77356 so if that's the new adequacy and
 
00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
that's what allocated in the EFA program
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
yes but that's not an increase those
 
00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:06.440 align:start position:0%
dollars are already
 
00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:08.440 align:start position:0%
budgeted well you want me to do the
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
second part of
 
00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
you followup my understanding was that
 
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
these numbers were based us on public
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
school students though not the EFA
 
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
students or the charter
 
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
schools that was initially true but I
 
00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
think the numbers you have today I
 
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
haven't seen these yet so I believe
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
these take into account the efas are a a
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
a wash that's just a redefinition of
 
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
where the money's going that's not an
 
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:35.720 align:start position:0%
increase Charter Schools however is
 
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
adequacy plus dollars so this would
 
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
increase Charter School uh adequacy or
 
00:16:48.309 --> 00:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
payments to uh I don't remember what the
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
what the plus is but it would be
 
00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:58.590 --> 00:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
$10,000 members we have 11 people that
 
00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.910 align:start position:0%
$10,000 members we have 11 people that
want

00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
have input on this public hearing we as
 
00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:04.360 align:start position:0%
committee members will have a chance to
 
00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:06.799 align:start position:0%
discuss it further so I I would hope
 
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
could give a preference to the public
 
00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:13.079 align:start position:0%
and not have so many questions and we're
 
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
having a work session on this tomorrow
 
00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:17.720 align:start position:0%
at 10 yes so that's that's for us to
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
speak uh representative Heath
 
00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:21.959 align:start position:0%
representative Maria you
 
00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
finished sure thank you representative
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
hacken Phillips for a question I'll
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
defer to tomorrow Mr uh chair in your
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
statement thank you for that all right
 
00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:35.720 align:start position:0%
can we go now to the public hearing and
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
first I'd like to call on representative
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
cordelli Vice chair of the Depart of the
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
education and thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
committee members uh for the record uh
 
00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
Glenn cordelli representing Tuftonboro
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
wolf B and oopy in the beautiful Lakes
 
00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
Region and um uh I have uh concerns with
 
00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:11.240 align:start position:0%
the amendment in several regards um we
 
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:14.200 align:start position:0%
are in a uh Cooperative School District
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
with six towns uh two of my towns um
 
00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
have excess swept currently uh totaling
 
00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
about $2.8 million between the two
 
00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
towns with the proposed amendment
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
the um excess swept amount for those two
 
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
towns will go up to almost $9
 
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
million um it is also my understanding
 
00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.909 align:start position:0%
million um it is also my understanding
that

00:18:42.909 --> 00:18:42.919 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
um the excess swept return to the state
 
00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:52.280 align:start position:0%
will actually impact all towns uh
 
00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
beginning in
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
February and I I might mention the
 
00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
number of excess swept towns increases
 
00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
from or pretty much
 
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
doubles but in my understanding is in
 
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
February the excess swep towns will be
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
required to send
 
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
30% of that exess to the state with 70%
 
00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
then coming uh later in the year in the
 
00:19:24.909 --> 00:19:24.919 align:start position:0%
fall question is with budgets in
 
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
place where are we going to uh find mind
 
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
that excess money to send to the state I
 
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
think that'll be a huge problem for
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
these 50 some OD uh communities um I
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
don't know what the impact is going to
 
00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
be if it's going to be um a special
 
00:19:48.909 --> 00:19:48.919 align:start position:0%
meeting um to adjust the budget or I'm
 
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
not sure what the process will be to do
 
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
that so it's uh it's a great concern uh
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
to many of our
 
00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:03.640 align:start position:0%
some of us have some data before us from
 
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
the legislative budget assistant it
 
00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
appears that prior to this amendment
 
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
there were 49 donor towns and this
 
00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:14.799 align:start position:0%
brings it up to 53 all of them have been
 
00:20:17.149 --> 00:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
increase but I don't think we double the
 
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
number of donor towns and this was this
 
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:22.919 align:start position:0%
was the decision of the court and this
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
is the way we try to deal with it if
 
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
there's some other way we're open to
 
00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.830 align:start position:0%
there's some other way we're open to
entertainment

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
entertainment
 
00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:32.039 align:start position:0%

bring you into the weeds if I may um of
 
00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:14.440 align:start position:0%
what's been going on at Hillsboro daring
 
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:16.919 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Hillsboro Dearing was part
 
00:21:20.269 --> 00:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
of the lawsuit with conal so um we have
 
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
some skin in the game on that um however
 
00:21:26.149 --> 00:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
I've been studying and scrutinizing the
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
finances of the Hillsboro school board
 
00:21:31.269 --> 00:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
for the last four years in in great
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
depth and um mostly because we've been
 
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
carrying a surplus that averages $1.6
 
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
million per year and that's before our
 
00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:43.720 align:start position:0%
trust funds um after trust funds our
 
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
Surplus average is $1.4
 
00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:48.799 align:start position:0%
million and for Hillsboro Dearing to be
 
00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
at the court saying that the state isn't
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
giving them enough money and to be
 
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
gathering $1.4 million in Surplus money
 
00:21:58.909 --> 00:21:58.919 align:start position:0%
that they then choose this is also um
 
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
1.4 million after they have their end
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
ofe shopping spray which I would like to
 
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
share some of those details with you as
 
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
well um you know I'm I'm a bit bothered
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
by the fact that they're in front of the
 
00:22:11.789 --> 00:22:11.799 align:start position:0%
the court saying that they don't get
 
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
enough money to fund their school when
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing how we're handling the money
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
that is coming through our school in
 
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
addition to the the
 
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
surpluses so most recently um I'd like
 
00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
to share our our most recent issue we
 
00:22:30.909 --> 00:22:30.919 align:start position:0%
had um um we had received Esser funds
 
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
for those who may not be familiar with
 
00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
Esser funds that's the covid money that
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
came through the federal government the
 
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:38.200 align:start position:0%
arpa money and one of the projects that
 
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
we had um listed to do Under The Green
 
00:22:43.789 --> 00:22:43.799 align:start position:0%
under the Esser funds was a greenhouse
 
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
project this was to increase our outdoor
 
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
uh learning space would have been a
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
great Grant project what ended up
 
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
happening is the doe um discouraged the
 
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
school from using yeser funds due to the
 
00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
timing of the construction project
 
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
because it expires in September so the
 
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
school board proceeded to transfer
 
00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
$106,000 from our um Surplus which was
 
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
from an English language arts teacher um
 
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
salary position and all their benefits
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
they transferred that into repairs and
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
maintenance to build this greenhouse um
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
they did it also on a very Sly move they
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
didn't make this public to the come uh
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
to the uh body and they did it after the
 
00:23:27.549 --> 00:23:27.559 align:start position:0%
deliberative session that they made this
 
00:23:27.559 --> 00:23:29.470 align:start position:0%
deliberative session that they made this
announcement

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
announcement
 
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:31.640 align:start position:0%
first of all a greenhouse system is an
 
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
asset it's a stru it's a building
 
00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:34.360 align:start position:0%
structure it's going to have a footing
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
it should not be in repairs and
 
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:37.240 align:start position:0%
maintenance now it's part of repairs and
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
maintenance it's going to become part of
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
our default budget um as well as it's
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
using our tax dollars to go to a
 
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
greenhouse this is you know this is not
 
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
a requirement of adequate
 
00:23:50.669 --> 00:23:50.679 align:start position:0%
education so we had presented to them
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
some options to use other grant money
 
00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:55.640 align:start position:0%
and um for example a rain catchment
 
00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
system instead of digging a well because
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
they couldn't give us a fixed number
 
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
number on the well they decided that um
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
because these plants were going to be
 
00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
growing fruits and vegetables that the
 
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
kids were going to be eating that it
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
required potable water therefore they
 
00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:11.480 align:start position:0%
needed to attach to the town water which
 
00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:14.039 align:start position:0%
now is increasing our ongoing expenses
 
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
for this greenhouse they're also going
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
to put in a heater and some fans which
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
will require additional electricity for
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
this to be going on meanwhile we have a
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
list of $9.2 million of um priority
 
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance items that need to be done
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
one being our high school needs a boiler
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
and the estimate on that was
 
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
$700,000 they didn't option to go
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
replace the boiler with our Surplus
 
00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:38.200 align:start position:0%
money or with this excess uh salary
 
00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
money instead they're putting in the
 
00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:44.200 align:start position:0%
greenhouse so I have concerns about how
 
00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
that all comes into our default budget
 
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
and everything else and how they've been
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
able to get away with putting it through
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
a repairs and maintenance line not a
 
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
capital line but I'm working on that
 
00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
still I further want to point out that
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
our school boards um at least um I don't
 
00:25:00.909 --> 00:25:00.919 align:start position:0%
know how many but in Hillsboro daring we
 
00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:03.799 align:start position:0%
have shown that we are not very um
 
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
prudent with our contract
 
00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
negotiations we had a snow plowing and
 
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
Landscaping contract with a vendor for
 
00:25:13.389 --> 00:25:13.399 align:start position:0%
six years and that vendor last year
 
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
decided to put an $188,000 increase on
 
00:25:19.149 --> 00:25:19.159 align:start position:0%
his contract which is a 15.3% increase
 
00:25:21.669 --> 00:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
there was an RFP for this contract there
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
was no competitive bids received the
 
00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:27.039 align:start position:0%
school only gave 40 hours notice to
 
00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
those that they notified the that there
 
00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
was an RFP for them to come to a
 
00:25:31.789 --> 00:25:31.799 align:start position:0%
mandatory meeting none of them could
 
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
reschedule their Landscaping Deals they
 
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't make it they awarded this
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
contract with a 15.3% increase and this
 
00:25:41.789 --> 00:25:41.799 align:start position:0%
contractor is now getting a guaranteed
 
00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
$114,000 a month for 6 months to
 
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
snowplow we had a few maybe a handful
 
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
maybe five snowplowing events but he
 
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
received $84,000 of our tax money to do
 
00:25:56.549 --> 00:25:56.559 align:start position:0%
our snow plowing this winter again I was
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
in front of them saying please put this
 
00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:00.200 align:start position:0%
back out to bid please do not Grant this
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
contract in this fashion they ignored it
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
contract back in 2022 we paid off the
 
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
bond of our high of our Middle School
 
00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
$753,000 we requested that this Bond
 
00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
payment be returned back to the
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayers the one that no longer needs
 
00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:20.360 align:start position:0%
to be made they instead absorbed that
 
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
into the budget so even though we paid
 
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
off the middle school bond to $753,000
 
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't get to see that back in our in
 
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:32.909 --> 00:26:32.919 align:start position:0%
our bus contract is also increased I I
 
00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
have an issue with the fact that busing
 
00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
seems to have a monopoly we don't have
 
00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:38.200 align:start position:0%
any competition for student is our
 
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.430 align:start position:0%
any competition for student is our
busing

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
busing
 
00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:42.440 align:start position:0%
contractor going back to the um Surplus
 
00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
so that I'm not can you relate this to
 
00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.789 align:start position:0%
so that I'm not can you relate this to
the

00:26:45.789 --> 00:26:45.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
amendment can I relate this to the
 
00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
amendment the amendment being yes so I
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
have an issue with the fact that we are
 
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
putting an amendment through based on a
 
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
judge's opinion of a dollar amount that
 
00:26:59.909 --> 00:26:59.919 align:start position:0%
he feels is adequate educ education I do
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
not feel that what our schools are
 
00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
giving to the state as far as the money
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
that they need in their budget is really
 
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
um responsible and
 
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
um I don't feel it ties into this dollar
 
00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
amount I feel that the schools are
 
00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:17.720 align:start position:0%
giving the state at least my school and
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
I have heard from others although I do
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
not have actual facts but I've heard
 
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
from others that they are inflating
 
00:27:25.389 --> 00:27:25.399 align:start position:0%
their spending and their budgets and the
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
money that's being reported to the state
 
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
is more than really what they need for
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
an adequate
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
education and that's why I was getting
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
into the weeds of this because I'm I'm
 
00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
I'm showing that in Hillsboro deering's
 
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
case we are spending money that we don't
 
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
need to spend for an adequate education
 
00:27:41.789 --> 00:27:41.799 align:start position:0%
these are not costs that are going to
 
00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:43.720 align:start position:0%
improve our education system in
 
00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.149 align:start position:0%
improve our education system in
Hillsboro

00:27:45.149 --> 00:27:45.159 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro
 
00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:48.559 align:start position:0%
Dearing so we had a surplus in 2021 we
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
had a surplus of $2 million of that
 
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
Surplus the school went on a shopping
 
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:55.240 align:start position:0%
spree they put in a baseball irrigation
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
system they put in elementary school
 
00:27:59.710 --> 00:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
lockers they put in stage curtains they
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
bought 128 new Chromebooks even though
 
00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919 align:start position:0%
we have already we had over um enough
 
00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
Chromebooks to cover our students and
 
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
staff so we had we have 1233 students in
 
00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:13.799 align:start position:0%
staff and we now have nearly 1,500
 
00:28:16.269 --> 00:28:16.279 align:start position:0%
Chrome books if not more that we're not
 
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
aware of so they continue to spend most
 
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
recently what I found out is we have a
 
00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
new fund called the donation fund fund
 
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
25 interestingly enough this fund has
 
00:28:30.909 --> 00:28:30.919 align:start position:0%
never been reported to the doe and has
 
00:28:33.509 --> 00:28:33.519 align:start position:0%
never been reported to the Dr the fund
 
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
has almost $200,000 in it and last year
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
saw transactions of hundreds of
 
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars passed through this
 
00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:43.640 align:start position:0%
they took our funds from our general
 
00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
fund inter fund transfers and put it
 
00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
into fund 25 and they left
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
$171,000 in this of our tax money they
 
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:55.480 align:start position:0%
did not report that back to the Dr when
 
00:28:57.509 --> 00:28:57.519 align:start position:0%
I thank you I think you've made the
 
00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:00.440 align:start position:0%
point and it's a very valid one that the
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
spending we've been seeing increase year
 
00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:06.200 align:start position:0%
over year over year is is somewhat
 
00:29:09.909 --> 00:29:09.919 align:start position:0%
extravagant so I think that's that point
 
00:29:11.389 --> 00:29:11.399 align:start position:0%
has been made thank you thank you I'll
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
just close that I left you a packet of
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
what our finances uh look like what our
 
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
school numbers look like and everything
 
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
else thank you for your time notes thank
 
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
you very
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:35.029 align:start position:0%
 
Horgan

00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:37.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you very much I'm
 
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
representing Timothy Oregon from
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
straford County District 10 which is um
 
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
the town of Durham which in turn is one
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
of the three towns in the U the Oyster
 
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:49.640 align:start position:0%
River Cooperative school district and um
 
00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
I know yes we do have we do have a
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
program at the mahit school to grow uh
 
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
some of the fruits and vegetables I
 
00:29:58.750 --> 00:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
assume the water supply that goes that
 
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
is p
 
00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
but I'm um there's some things I like I
 
00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
was uh I was not a sponsor of the
 
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
original 1583 but I I would have liked
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
to have been I just my name didn't end
 
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
up on the bast head because you when
 
00:30:13.389 --> 00:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
were shuffling around and I did end up
 
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
um supporting being a co-sponsor of a
 
00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
companion bill about the special
 
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
education grants and they both raised it
 
00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:21.430 align:start position:0%
education grants and they both raised it
uh

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
significantly um and I think uh I'm not
 
00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:28.360 align:start position:0%
saying uh you know I'm not saying um I'm
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
not saying everything I'm not saying
 
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
there isn't some wasteful uh spending in
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
public education but I think in general
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:38.559 align:start position:0%
we it's not a bad thing to be spending
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
more in public education we should be
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
providing we shouldn't be wasting money
 
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
but we should be providing you know our
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
children with the uh best schools we can
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
afford not the cheapest schools we can
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
get away with but that's um sort of a
 
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
philosophical thing I've got I like uh
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
what rever em described as the first
 
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
part of his Amendment which is Raising
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
um the um ad adequacy Aid the original
 
00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:05.480 align:start position:0%
bill I think was 10,000 um both those
 
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:07.720 align:start position:0%
address the concerns that um well judge
 
00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:09.919 align:start position:0%
rof had in the convol cases but other
 
00:31:11.629 --> 00:31:11.639 align:start position:0%
ones and we tend to blame the judges but
 
00:31:13.789 --> 00:31:13.799 align:start position:0%
the problem is the state
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
legislature um we we pass laws you know
 
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
and we have a constitutional provision
 
00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
too about about education but we haven't
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
been you know backing it up with actual
 
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
um actual dollars in in our bial bu
 
00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
since sense that's really our problem
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
not the
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
judges I'm the Judiciary Committee
 
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
actually our chairman had an interesting
 
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:37.240 align:start position:0%
idea which he had a con he proposed a
 
00:31:38.909 --> 00:31:38.919 align:start position:0%
constitution amendment to Simply cut the
 
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
courts out of jurisdiction over
 
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
education funding which was an ingenious
 
00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:44.440 align:start position:0%
idea not really a good idea but
 
00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
ingenious idea but that's I think a
 
00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:48.440 align:start position:0%
better way to do is actually address the
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
concern that judge ruof and previous
 
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
judges have uh concern have expressed
 
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
over the decades and actually adequately
 
00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:55.470 align:start position:0%
over the decades and actually adequately
fund

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
education and this does a few good
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
things um probably raising the Statewide
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
property tax um not that any of us like
 
00:32:05.389 --> 00:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
to raise taxes and I know there's uh
 
00:32:07.149 --> 00:32:07.159 align:start position:0%
some of us in his body for whom raising
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
any tax for any purpose as a non-starter
 
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
but even even if you're on more the
 
00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799 align:start position:0%
progressive side of the spectrum like me
 
00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
that's not something I'd like to do but
 
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
it may be necessary and um I don't live
 
00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
in a so-called donor town so maybe I um
 
00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:23.320 align:start position:0%
maybe have a different perspective on it
 
00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
but I think it probably is appropriate
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
for some towns that have high property
 
00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
values in fact end up being donor town
 
00:32:30.789 --> 00:32:30.799 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of didn't really make much
 
00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
sense of it if we have a Statewide
 
00:32:36.149 --> 00:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
property tax um it should actually be a
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax so certainly they
 
00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:41.480 align:start position:0%
you know that's I mean some towns will
 
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
be paying more Statewide property tax
 
00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:45.559 align:start position:0%
and they're using for the schools and
 
00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
that's uh I don't not crazy I know
 
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
understand why they don't like it but
 
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
that's uh probably that's it's probably
 
00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
sensible it's probably like uh it's it's
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
probably something that has to be has to
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
be tolerated in some cases what I
 
00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:01.720 align:start position:0%
something I'm very suspicious about is a
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
2/3 super majority for raising which I
 
00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
think applies to the overall
 
00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:07.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the school district
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
not which uh not just the adequacy aid
 
00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
which is basically on a per capita basis
 
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
but the whole school district include
 
00:33:18.509 --> 00:33:18.519 align:start position:0%
which you know School budgets don't you
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of overhead in school
 
00:33:22.029 --> 00:33:22.039 align:start position:0%
budgets a lot of things that aren't
 
00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
don't go up or down based on how many or
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
heal few students you have so that's uh
 
00:33:29.669 --> 00:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
I think that's a bad idea um I think it
 
00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919 align:start position:0%
should just be a simple majority like it
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
is now and that will certainly create a
 
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
lot of uh downward pressure on school
 
00:33:37.269 --> 00:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
spending and not as I said before not
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
that I hate wasteful spending but I
 
00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
think it's probably better the air on
 
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
the side of spending you know being more
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
generous or our schools rather than uh
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
stingy with our schools and
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
also um this does address uh Charter
 
00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
Schools I guess it gives them more money
 
00:33:54.389 --> 00:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
which is probably good it doesn't really
 
00:33:56.269 --> 00:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
do anything about the uncontrolled
 
00:33:59.789 --> 00:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
growth of the EFA account so if you
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
um you want to put some guard rails in
 
00:34:04.029 --> 00:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
the pill like that may be easy for me to
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
vote for it obviously one thing is I'm
 
00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
not on the finance committee so unless
 
00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599 align:start position:0%
they bring me as a sub I don't have to
 
00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
vote on anything until it makes it makes
 
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
it to the floor so that probably makes
 
00:34:17.629 --> 00:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
my life a little bit easier I generally
 
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
don't EnV you the task you have have
 
00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
ahead of you so I'm um I think we should
 
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
I think we should just go back to the uh
 
00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
original bill is introduced rais the
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
adequacy aid and and a lot of this uh
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
stuff and some of which I'm suspicious
 
00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
of to the stuff is added earlier the
 
00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
process I you know like this whole
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
there's a whole section about how they
 
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
um how they prate the adequate a it's
 
00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:43.480 align:start position:0%
just it's a very complicated uh
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
complicated procedure that uh I don't I
 
00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
don't really understand of course um I
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
only have a uh Masters in Business
 
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
Administration from University of
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
Southern California so probably I'm not
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
as much of an expert as some other
 
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
people in the committee are but do you
 
00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:57.800 align:start position:0%
have written testimony no unfortunately
 
00:34:59.950 --> 00:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
no I don't but I would say thanks and
 
00:35:01.069 --> 00:35:01.079 align:start position:0%
that's basically what I wanted to say
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just very all right to all present
 
00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
if you have testimony and you have it
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
written it will ensure that it gets
 
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
accurately in the record thank you I
 
00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
also wanted to wait until I heard Rend
 
00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
Emmer's explanation of it before I like
 
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
wrote wrote something up anyway because
 
00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
I just you know this is very complicated
 
00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
one of the problems many more thank you
 
00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.230 align:start position:0%
one of the problems many more thank you
very

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
much NE next lik like to call on The
 
00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you Mr chairman um I guess I
 
00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
should introduce myself I'm Doug Hall
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
from Chai Chester and I had been on this
 
00:35:50.309 --> 00:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
uh committee 3 what five years ago now I
 
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
think and for a couple of terms uh
 
00:35:55.589 --> 00:35:55.599 align:start position:0%
chaired the division that included the
 
00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
school funding problem and this was
 
00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
before the conval and Claremont both
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
cases um I'm here to testify about this
 
00:36:05.359 --> 00:36:06.589 align:start position:0%
cases um I'm here to testify about this
proposed

00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:06.599 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
amendment and I do have written
 
00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
testimony which why I will um pass up to
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
you I'm concerned about the proposed
 
00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:17.839 align:start position:0%
amendment because while it solves two
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
problems it introduces yet another
 
00:36:23.309 --> 00:36:23.319 align:start position:0%
problem The Proposal will make the
 
00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax meet
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional requ requirements that's
 
00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:31.480 align:start position:0%
a big plus it will also provide an
 
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
increase in the base cost for State
 
00:36:36.589 --> 00:36:36.599 align:start position:0%
support of each student uh to the
 
00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
absolute minimum level required by the
 
00:36:41.829 --> 00:36:41.839 align:start position:0%
recent Superior Court ruling in the
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
conval case that's also a big
 
00:36:48.829 --> 00:36:48.839 align:start position:0%
plus I can certainly support those
 
00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:51.880 align:start position:0%
aspects of this bill and I applaud
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
representative Emer for tackling those
 
00:36:58.109 --> 00:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
issues headon I haven't often seen those
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
issues tackled
 
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
headon unfortunately the proposal also
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
includes a cap on future increases in
 
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:09.640 align:start position:0%
the spending of all school districts I
 
00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
know that some people object to this on
 
00:37:14.349 --> 00:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
the philosophical basis that this
 
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
removes a major aspect of local control
 
00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:18.710 align:start position:0%
removes a major aspect of local control
of

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
schools but my objection is different
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
the goal that I hope we all
 
00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
share is that all students have an
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity for Education that does not
 
00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:36.200 align:start position:0%
vary by ZIP
 
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
codes this proposal will lock in the
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
great disparities that it currently
 
00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
exist districts with large class sizes
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
will not be able to reduce them to
 
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
districts every expensive special
 
00:37:59.069 --> 00:37:59.079 align:start position:0%
education student who moves into a small
 
00:38:02.309 --> 00:38:02.319 align:start position:0%
town will necessarily result in a
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
reduction of funds available for the
 
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
education of all the other students this
 
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
just happened in my town of
 
00:38:12.309 --> 00:38:12.319 align:start position:0%
Chichester in fact Chichester special
 
00:38:17.349 --> 00:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
education costs now exceed all state aid
 
00:38:20.069 --> 00:38:20.079 align:start position:0%
so there is no state aid available for
 
00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:22.280 align:start position:0%
any of the other
 
00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:26.079 align:start position:0%
students if a district needs a new
 
00:38:30.309 --> 00:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
building or run ation of an aging
 
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
structure the cap will be a problem
 
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
because there will not be the
 
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
possibility of adding into the
 
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
budget for the subsequent years the bond
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
payments interest and principle and so
 
00:38:49.069 --> 00:38:49.079 align:start position:0%
that will lock districts which are
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
already starting to plan for building
 
00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:55.720 align:start position:0%
changes some of our buildings are 80
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
years and more old
 
00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.950 align:start position:0%
years and more old
um

00:38:59.950 --> 00:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
so if you remove the cap or find some
 
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
way to deal with that then I can support
 
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
this amendment because the other two
 
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
parts are wonderful but given the
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
amendment the way it's written right now
 
00:39:16.829 --> 00:39:16.839 align:start position:0%
um as it stands
 
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I urge you to vote against
 
00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
it if you can find a way to change it to
 
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
remove the problems I've cited that
 
00:39:26.349 --> 00:39:26.359 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:39:30.109 --> 00:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
wonderful thank you questions
 
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
representative papich Muller thank you
 
00:39:35.069 --> 00:39:35.079 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you Mr Hall for your
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
pass service and for being here to
 
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
testify about this um I'm just trying to
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
understand you said uh you know a cap
 
00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
that cannot be removed cannot be
 
00:39:46.349 --> 00:39:46.359 align:start position:0%
overcome you are aware that there is a
 
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:49.160 align:start position:0%
you know possibility to vote with a
 
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
two-thirds majority I would appreciate
 
00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
if you'd address why that is not a
 
00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
sufficient relief mechanisms for your
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
concerns I I certainly recognize the 2/3
 
00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's in there and I must say
 
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
that um a 2third majority is hard to get
 
00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
for anything in any school district
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
meeting or any town meeting so in in
 
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
some ways while it's written in there I
 
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
do not foresee it being used very often
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
if at
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
all further question thank you just just
 
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
as a quick
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
followup we already have a 60 %
 
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
requirement for you know School
 
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
Renovations and such and uh coming from
 
00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
Windham we were in exactly that same
 
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
situation where construction projects
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
proposed by the school board failed by
 
00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:41.960 align:start position:0%
33 to 67 margins two years two years in
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
a row it is my experience that when uh
 
00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
the school board uh did those proposals
 
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
the right way we got 57% the next time
 
00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
we tried and 63 the next time and we
 
00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:56.680 align:start position:0%
passed it I would submit to you that if
 
00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
you can get 60% after getting 33 that 66
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
may be achievable if things are done the
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
right way which to me is the point of
 
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
this amendment that you have to actually
 
00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
make a clear case to you know the town
 
00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
voters that those increases are needed
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
this is already a large increase in
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
school funding from the state side you
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
know it's important to put some guard
 
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
rails in there to ensure that we don't
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
see huge spikes in uh you know property
 
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
taxes thank you and my colleague reminds
 
00:41:34.109 --> 00:41:34.119 align:start position:0%
me that for a bond um to pass takes
 
00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
2third if the if the school district
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
wishes to bond something it takes
 
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
2third yeah the the bonding requirement
 
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um and and representative is
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
important and the super majority
 
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
required for that I I fully support for
 
00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
bonding because it's the one way in
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
which a school district commits
 
00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:02.200 align:start position:0%
future School District votes that can't
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
be reversed so for that reason I I
 
00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:09.880 align:start position:0%
support it for bonding but I would not
 
00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
support 2/3 for any increase in the
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
budget representative
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
Emer thank you Mr chair just for clarity
 
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh this the calculation says less
 
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
facilities acquisition and construction
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
so that is outside of this calculation
 
00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
the facility acquisition and
 
00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:32.359 align:start position:0%
construction is the capital cost being
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
paid out but what happens is after the
 
00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
construction is completed the bonding
 
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
interest in
 
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
principle is an expense and that's not
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
excluded as I understand
 
00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
it well that's the
 
00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:51.640 align:start position:0%
intent thank you thank you anything
 
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
further thank you good to see you
 
00:42:59.390 --> 00:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
Doug thank you I'll next call on uh Mark
 
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:12.069 --> 00:43:12.079 align:start position:0%
communities thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Mark
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
takoto and I currently chair the
 
00:43:20.109 --> 00:43:20.119 align:start position:0%
education Coalition communities 2.0
 
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
which is a group of 26 towns and cities
 
00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
that have come together to ensure that
 
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
any future funding solution for state
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
aid to education does not unfairly pit
 
00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
one municipality against another
 
00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
municipality by mandating that property
 
00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
tax money raised in one town be sent to
 
00:43:46.109 --> 00:43:46.119 align:start position:0%
another town for use in the receiving
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
community on behalf of the 26 member
 
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities I appear before you today
 
00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
to oppose amendment
 
00:43:58.430 --> 00:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
105h to house Bill
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
1583 this amendment only exacerbates an
 
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
unfair funding scheme that this
 
00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
legislature repealed in
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
2011 and only last month voted to Table
 
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
in a bill HB
 
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
1686 that had the same
 
00:44:20.109 --> 00:44:20.119 align:start position:0%
flaws this mechanism requires towns to
 
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
tax their citizens regardless of their
 
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
ability to pay and give that money to
 
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
another town with no accountability on
 
00:44:32.309 --> 00:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
how that money is spent that basic
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
concept is fundamentally wrong and at
 
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
odds with how cities and towns in New
 
00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have governed themselves for
 
00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:46.040 align:start position:0%
centuries every dollar our Our member
 
00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:49.079 align:start position:0%
communities now rais through swep is
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
spent on education in our school
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
districts these are not excess dollars
 
00:44:57.790 --> 00:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
within our towns and cities
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
under this amendment funding of an
 
00:45:05.069 --> 00:45:05.079 align:start position:0%
additional $ 88.4 million for Education
 
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
will have to be raised by selected
 
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
cities and towns in the town I work for
 
00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
$16,600 through the swept portion of the
 
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
tax rate all of that money is currently
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
used for educational purposes and we
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
also spend a additional funds for
 
00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
Education through the local education
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
portion of the tax rate under this
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
amendment we will have to raise a little
 
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
more than $1.5 million through the swept
 
00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:44.200 align:start position:0%
portion of the rate and we will have to
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
send approximately $1.2 million or
 
00:45:53.549 --> 00:45:53.559 align:start position:0%
77% of that amount to the state once we
 
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
send those funds to the state we will
 
00:45:59.829 --> 00:45:59.839 align:start position:0%
have to raise that amount again through
 
00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:03.160 align:start position:0%
our local education property tax rate to
 
00:46:05.309 --> 00:46:05.319 align:start position:0%
fund our
 
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
schools this is a
 
00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
$2.33 per $1,000 in valuation increase
 
00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
in our overall property tax rate and our
 
00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayers will have no say in how it is
 
00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:22.589 align:start position:0%
taxpayers will have no say in how it is
spent

00:46:22.589 --> 00:46:22.599 align:start position:0%
spent
 
00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:25.559 align:start position:0%
additionally this tax increase will need
 
00:46:28.829 --> 00:46:28.839 align:start position:0%
to be funded every every year as long as
 
00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
this amendment stays in
 
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
effect similar additional assessments as
 
00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
you pointed out Mr chairman will be will
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
have to be made in 53 communities
 
00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:43.839 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire in our town uh
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
if our towns do not want increases in
 
00:46:50.109 --> 00:46:50.119 align:start position:0%
already burdensome property taxes then
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
other and uh other priorities will be
 
00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
impacted this would include Road and
 
00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
Bridge projects
 
00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
environmental initiatives and other Town
 
00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:03.640 align:start position:0%
operations such as public safety and
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
water and sewer
 
00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
departments our taxpayers will also be
 
00:47:12.589 --> 00:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
forced to reassess School budgets and
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
services with potential negative impacts
 
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:19.480 align:start position:0%
on education programs this seems to be
 
00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
the opposite of the intent of any
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
increase in education funding within our
 
00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
state members of the committee I urge
 
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
you to reject this amendment's fallacy
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
of free money from so-called Rich
 
00:47:38.549 --> 00:47:38.559 align:start position:0%
towns the policy flaws in this amendment
 
00:47:41.549 --> 00:47:41.559 align:start position:0%
mirror the recent State Superior Court
 
00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
decision issued in November that
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
decision which is on appeal to the New
 
00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court and this
 
00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:54.079 align:start position:0%
amendment creates winners and losers all
 
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
across the granite state it has the
 
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
potential to negatively impact Municipal
 
00:48:05.109 --> 00:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:08.109 --> 00:48:08.119 align:start position:0%
ways the Ed education Coalition
 
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
communities 2.0 appreciates the
 
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
challenges in addressing school funding
 
00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
in our state we deeply care about
 
00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:19.400 align:start position:0%
ensuring a quality education for our
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
children and we will continue our
 
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
support for a fair and comprehensive
 
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
approach for education funding in New
 
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but we continue to
 
00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
oppose sorry we continue to oppose any
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
plan which requires property taxes
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
raised in one Community to be sent to
 
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
another community and used without
 
00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
accountability for their use We Believe
 
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
such a system treats different towns
 
00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:54.200 align:start position:0%
disproportionately or differently and is
 
00:48:56.349 --> 00:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
unfair and improper thank you Mr
 
00:48:56.359 --> 00:48:57.630 align:start position:0%
unfair and improper thank you Mr
chairman

00:48:57.630 --> 00:48:57.640 align:start position:0%

00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony oh wait
 
00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
somebody had represent Edwards yeah
 
00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
thank thank you I'm I'm picking up from
 
00:49:15.309 --> 00:49:15.319 align:start position:0%
your testimony that um uh you may have
 
00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
an opinion on on the following that
 
00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
there is um some value to having the
 
00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
locality that's making the spending
 
00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
decision s accountable and responsible
 
00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
for raising the revenues to pay for
 
00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
their spending decisions and that a key
 
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
reason to do that is to ensure
 
00:49:39.789 --> 00:49:39.799 align:start position:0%
accountability for the spending
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
decisions and to perhaps discipline and
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
and the the spending the the tendency to
 
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
want to spend what what what what do you
 
00:49:52.789 --> 00:49:52.799 align:start position:0%
think about this amendment and what it
 
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
may do to uh untethering the spending
 
00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
discipline from the requirement to raise
 
00:50:00.559 --> 00:50:02.670 align:start position:0%
discipline from the requirement to raise
local

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:02.680 align:start position:0%
local
 
00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:04.549 align:start position:0%
local
revenues

00:50:04.549 --> 00:50:04.559 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
I as far as how money is spent in other
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
communities that's sort of the point we
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
we within our communities within the the
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
Coalition communities will have to raise
 
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
money through our property taxes and we
 
00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
won't have a say so we don't know how it
 
00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:27.640 align:start position:0%
will affect expenditures in communities
 
00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:31.640 align:start position:0%
that receive additional swep that's the
 
00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
point of that I was trying to make is
 
00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
that we we have no accountability
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
spent okay so I what what I'm hearing
 
00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:49.720 align:start position:0%
you say is you're concerned that the
 
00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:51.640 align:start position:0%
receiving localities that are not
 
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
raising the
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
revenues uh you you since you won't have
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
accountability for their spending you're
 
00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
concerned inherently that they may be
 
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
making uh injudicious spending
 
00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
decisions yes you don't you don't really
 
00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
trust their spending decision process
 
00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
otherwise you wouldn't be concerned well
 
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I I don't think it is it
 
00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of not trusting it's a
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
matter of not having uh an ability to
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
affect that right now we are using swept
 
00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:25.720 align:start position:0%
dollars for Education within our
 
00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:29.240 align:start position:0%
communities and we have a say in how
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
that occurs $1.2 million is nearly all
 
00:51:37.549 --> 00:51:37.559 align:start position:0%
of our Town's school budget we will have
 
00:51:41.589 --> 00:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
to raise that send it to conquer and
 
00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
then raise it again to run our school so
 
00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
we will be we will be double taxed for
 
00:51:51.309 --> 00:51:51.319 align:start position:0%
that operation that portion of our
 
00:51:54.190 --> 00:51:54.200 align:start position:0%
budget thank you anything further for
 
00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:54.990 align:start position:0%
budget thank you anything further for
the

00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:59.589 --> 00:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:03.069 --> 00:52:03.079 align:start position:0%
tooto I'll next call on Lawrence gagman
 
00:52:06.069 --> 00:52:06.079 align:start position:0%
it says you're from the New Hampshire
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
Dr are there two of you from the Dr all
 
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
right why don't you come
 
00:52:20.829 --> 00:52:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
sir good morning members of the
 
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Keen mang Wong tax
 
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
policy council with the New Hampshire
 
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
dep of Revenue
 
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
good morning Lawrence gyon Revenue
 
00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:30.440 align:start position:0%
Council New Hampshire Department of
 
00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh the department does not have
 
00:52:36.829 --> 00:52:36.839 align:start position:0%
a position on the amendment to 1583 um
 
00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
however uh we do have some concerns that
 
00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:42.680 align:start position:0%
uh more so in terms of the
 
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
administration and and as well as
 
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
seeking clarification on some of the
 
00:52:48.309 --> 00:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
language that's used on the bill uh for
 
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
the DRS administration of of the 1583
 
00:52:53.069 --> 00:52:53.079 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh we're wondering may
 
00:52:54.510 --> 00:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
potentially that it could be best
 
00:52:55.829 --> 00:52:55.839 align:start position:0%
addressed during the work session
 
00:52:58.109 --> 00:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and it will save time for for
 
00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
the committee um and we probably also
 
00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:01.720 align:start position:0%
just wanted to highlight that uh during
 
00:53:04.589 --> 00:53:04.599 align:start position:0%
the last work session uh we heard that
 
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
potentially that the uh the the
 
00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
withholding of the um Municipal Revenue
 
00:53:14.789 --> 00:53:14.799 align:start position:0%
uh fund uh distribution to the
 
00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:17.839 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh was uh potentially an
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh a suggestion from the Dr uh that is a
 
00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
policy uh issue uh not uh not a
 
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
suggestion from the Dr um but once again
 
00:53:29.549 --> 00:53:29.559 align:start position:0%
we do potentially have concerns in terms
 
00:53:31.309 --> 00:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
of um the administration of that in
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
terms of the tax setting calculation and
 
00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
we can discuss that tomorrow we welcome
 
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
you to come to the work session tomorrow
 
00:53:41.710 --> 00:53:41.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Gagner I just reiterate the
 
00:53:43.069 --> 00:53:43.079 align:start position:0%
same comments and we'd be well happy to
 
00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
come back than you for putting those off
 
00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
you next call on Jason sens please don't
 
00:54:07.789 --> 00:54:07.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you for the opportunity uh
 
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
my name is Jason sens I live in Amherst
 
00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and uh I'm an economist at
 
00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
the American Institute for economic
 
00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
research although my uh comments are
 
00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
related to my research My Views do not
 
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily represent those of my
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
employer so I wanted to speak to the
 
00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
part of this amendment that would uh
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
require towns to remit excess uh
 
00:54:34.109 --> 00:54:34.119 align:start position:0%
education tax revenues to the State
 
00:54:38.589 --> 00:54:38.599 align:start position:0%
education trust fund the economics of uh
 
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
of this are are complex and subtle and
 
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to speak to um what the
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
research has shown about the effects of
 
00:54:48.829 --> 00:54:48.839 align:start position:0%
this kind of redistribution based on
 
00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:53.240 align:start position:0%
property tax base um the probably the
 
00:54:55.069 --> 00:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
foremost Economist who has worked on
 
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
this is Stanford University Carolyn
 
00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
hawksby she notes that uh one of the
 
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
primary effects of this kind of
 
00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:05.240 align:start position:0%
redistribution is that it discourages
 
00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:07.640 align:start position:0%
schools from being productive why does
 
00:55:11.069 --> 00:55:11.079 align:start position:0%
it do this because when you think about
 
00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:13.400 align:start position:0%
the fact that people are choosing where
 
00:55:15.549 --> 00:55:15.559 align:start position:0%
to live on the basis of quality of
 
00:55:19.069 --> 00:55:19.079 align:start position:0%
public services and their property tax
 
00:55:22.029 --> 00:55:22.039 align:start position:0%
burden there's an incentive there for
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
local governments to be efficient if
 
00:55:26.789 --> 00:55:26.799 align:start position:0%
they're inefficient then they either
 
00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:30.680 align:start position:0%
have to raise more in taxes to fund the
 
00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
same level of services as other towns or
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
given a a level of taxes they have to
 
00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
have lower quality public
 
00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
services so inefficient towns are going
 
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
to lose people to more efficient towns
 
00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
that causes property values to rise in
 
00:55:49.309 --> 00:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
the more efficient towns and fall in the
 
00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
inefficient towns that's a disincentive
 
00:55:55.069 --> 00:55:55.079 align:start position:0%
to being inefficient right people don't
 
00:55:57.789 --> 00:55:57.799 align:start position:0%
want their property value to fall home
 
00:55:59.789 --> 00:55:59.799 align:start position:0%
voters as as Economist Bill fishell
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
calls them will turn out to vote in
 
00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
local elections to stop this from
 
00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:05.720 align:start position:0%
happening so what this kind of
 
00:56:07.549 --> 00:56:07.559 align:start position:0%
redistribution does in essence the
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
intuition here is it gives towns an
 
00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
incentive to be inefficient it gives
 
00:56:14.109 --> 00:56:14.119 align:start position:0%
them an incentive to become property
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
poor you don't want to be a donor town
 
00:56:18.549 --> 00:56:18.559 align:start position:0%
you want to be a recipient town on the
 
00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:21.880 align:start position:0%
margin right the second effect that she
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
notes is sort of perverse from this form
 
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
of redistribution is that it penalized
 
00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
families with a greater taste for
 
00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
education and rewards those with a a
 
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
lesser taste for Education why does it
 
00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
do this because again people choose
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
where to live based on the mix of taxes
 
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
and services that they want so families
 
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
with a high taste for Education will
 
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
scrimp and pinch if they have to to live
 
00:56:49.069 --> 00:56:49.079 align:start position:0%
in a town where they can spend more on
 
00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:51.880 align:start position:0%
education so if you're a middle-income
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
family and you really have a strong
 
00:56:56.309 --> 00:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
preference for good education for your
 
00:56:58.109 --> 00:56:58.119 align:start position:0%
kids you might move to a town like
 
00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
Hanover even though it's very expensive
 
00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:03.160 align:start position:0%
right so $600,000 gets you a Shack in
 
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
Hanover and most houses are a lot more
 
00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
expensive than that so yes wealthier
 
00:57:09.789 --> 00:57:09.799 align:start position:0%
people will tend to live in in a town
 
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
like hover but also people with a strong
 
00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
taste for Education will tend to make
 
00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
those sacrifices to live in a town like
 
00:57:19.029 --> 00:57:19.039 align:start position:0%
that so what this would effectively do
 
00:57:21.069 --> 00:57:21.079 align:start position:0%
is would penalize people who've made
 
00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
those choices because of their taste for
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
Education they've wanted to to pay the
 
00:57:27.309 --> 00:57:27.319 align:start position:0%
cost of living in a so-called property
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
wealthy town and it would reward those
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
with a less taste for Education who have
 
00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
chosen to live in a property poor town
 
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
um where the uh the home values are
 
00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
lower the other effect um that that's
 
00:57:44.029 --> 00:57:44.039 align:start position:0%
worth noting here is on exclusionary
 
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
zoning uh Federal Reserve Economist
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
Byron Lutz has studied our very own
 
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
Claremont decision and the effects of
 
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
that he finds that uh under the system
 
00:57:54.029 --> 00:57:54.039 align:start position:0%
that was in effect from 1999 to 2011
 
00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
when you had donor and recipient towns
 
00:57:57.990 --> 00:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
people moved from donor to recipient
 
00:58:00.109 --> 00:58:00.119 align:start position:0%
towns property values fell in donor
 
00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
towns Rose in recipient towns although
 
00:58:05.069 --> 00:58:05.079 align:start position:0%
there was a net reduction in overall
 
00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
property wealth in the state so it
 
00:58:10.589 --> 00:58:10.599 align:start position:0%
destroyed property wealth and recipient
 
00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:13.640 align:start position:0%
towns to choke off this growth enacted
 
00:58:16.349 --> 00:58:16.359 align:start position:0%
growth management ordinances causing the
 
00:58:19.589 --> 00:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
cost of housing to rise so we are in a
 
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
housing crisis in this state and we have
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
been for several years we shouldn't be
 
00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
doing things that make this problem work
 
00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
why is there an incentive to do
 
00:58:31.309 --> 00:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
exclusionary zoning if um if you have
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
this kind of redistributive system well
 
00:58:35.829 --> 00:58:35.839 align:start position:0%
in part recipient towns will do this to
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
choke off growth but another effect of
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
this is that again you want to be
 
00:58:42.270 --> 00:58:42.280 align:start position:0%
property poor one way to be property
 
00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:45.839 align:start position:0%
poor is to stop development um so I have
 
00:58:47.549 --> 00:58:47.559 align:start position:0%
just done a study and this is not peer
 
00:58:48.789 --> 00:58:48.799 align:start position:0%
reviewed yet but I'm confident in my
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
numbers I did a study Nationwide study
 
00:58:52.829 --> 00:58:52.839 align:start position:0%
of uh the strictness of zoning
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
regulations and I looked at um how this
 
00:58:58.349 --> 00:58:58.359 align:start position:0%
was Ed by centralization of State
 
00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:00.839 align:start position:0%
education Finance so how much education
 
00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
Finance is funded by State versus local
 
00:59:05.029 --> 00:59:05.039 align:start position:0%
revenues and the strength of
 
00:59:06.670 --> 00:59:06.680 align:start position:0%
Equalization so redistribution from
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
so-called property wealthy to property
 
00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
poor towns and I found that both of
 
00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:12.200 align:start position:0%
those were associated with stricter
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
zoning regulations so you know if you if
 
00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
you uh have a taste of people in your
 
00:59:19.309 --> 00:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
town just don't want growth or they
 
00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
don't want commercial or they don't want
 
00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
multif family these are things that
 
00:59:24.990 --> 00:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
raise your property tax base per student
 
00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:27.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of research has shown that now
 
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
you're you're relaxing that constraint
 
00:59:31.470 --> 00:59:31.480 align:start position:0%
they no longer have to pay that cost of
 
00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
exclusionary Zing oh i' I'd like to
 
00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
exclusionary Zone but I'm worried about
 
00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
higher property tax burdens because we
 
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
if we keep out all this commercial and
 
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
multif family now they have an incentive
 
00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:43.240 align:start position:0%
to do that um so for those reasons i'
 
00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
would be very very cautious about this
 
00:59:47.109 --> 00:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
if if the state really wants to ensure
 
00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
that every family has access to an
 
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
adequate education let's make sure that
 
00:59:52.549 --> 00:59:52.559 align:start position:0%
actually lowincome families have access
 
00:59:54.270 --> 00:59:54.280 align:start position:0%
to good schools rather than
 
00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
redistributing among towns
 
00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
redistributing from poor people in
 
01:00:00.029 --> 01:00:00.039 align:start position:0%
Handover to rich people in the rest of
 
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
the state doesn't make very much sense
 
01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
thank you do you have uh these comments
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
written and do you have references to
 
01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
the uh reports that you've
 
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
referenced I uh I can I can email those
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
to the members of the committee if if
 
01:00:15.549 --> 01:00:15.559 align:start position:0%
you would contact our legislative budget
 
01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:17.720 align:start position:0%
assistant he would be happy to take
 
01:00:20.029 --> 01:00:20.039 align:start position:0%
those in sure I thank you this is
 
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
finally some original material all right
 
01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.950 align:start position:0%
finally some original material all right
thank

01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:30.349 align:start position:0%
thank
you

01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:30.359 --> 01:00:32.710 align:start position:0%
 
question

01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:00:36.349 --> 01:00:36.359 align:start position:0%
oh all right we're we're hoping to move
 
01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
along a little quicker now because we've
 
01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
heard most of the points and and I have
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
a person that's just going to take two
 
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:54.069 --> 01:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
par thank you Mr chairman my name is
 
01:00:55.630 --> 01:00:55.640 align:start position:0%
Shan par I'm on the Manchester School
 
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
Board where I chair the education
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
legislation committee today I'm speaking
 
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
behalf on of the Manchester School Board
 
01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
which has authorized me to advocate for
 
01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:06.200 align:start position:0%
fully funding education in New Hampshire
 
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
we do support the parts of this
 
01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
amendment that increase the base annual
 
01:01:12.029 --> 01:01:12.039 align:start position:0%
cost of providing an opportunity for an
 
01:01:14.829 --> 01:01:14.839 align:start position:0%
adequate education and we also supported
 
01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
the original draft of the HP 1583 as
 
01:01:20.589 --> 01:01:20.599 align:start position:0%
well however we do not support the
 
01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
portion of the amendment that caps the
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
spending of these funds we feel this
 
01:01:26.829 --> 01:01:26.839 align:start position:0%
limits uh local authori by placing a
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
spending cap on education across the
 
01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:31.160 align:start position:0%
state and the City of Manchester in fact
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
already has such a cap um Manchester was
 
01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
was part of the conval lawsuit so we do
 
01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
support uh the findings of that ruling
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's important to just
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
reiterate things that I've reiterated at
 
01:01:47.789 --> 01:01:47.799 align:start position:0%
the uh at meetings of the education
 
01:01:50.549 --> 01:01:50.559 align:start position:0%
committee that Manchester is one of
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
those districts with the greatest need
 
01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
we are the largest and most diverse
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
District in the state and and we have
 
01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
over 50% of our students qualifying for
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
free and reduced meals with around 25%
 
01:02:02.789 --> 01:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
of our students qualifying for special
 
01:02:05.269 --> 01:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
education services fully funding
 
01:02:06.510 --> 01:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
education in New Hampshire is
 
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
desperately needed thank you for your
 
01:02:10.589 --> 01:02:10.599 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you can you answer a
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
question okay representative Sweeney
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
being here to uh testify Prof our
 
01:02:17.789 --> 01:02:17.799 align:start position:0%
committee you mentioned Manchester
 
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:20.200 align:start position:0%
already has a cap on school spending
 
01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
what's the override provision for that
 
01:02:25.589 --> 01:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
cap it's also a super majority 2/3 I
 
01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:33.789 --> 01:02:33.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:36.200 align:start position:0%
right representative Edwards really
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
short I should we be expecting as we
 
01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
increase the funding for adequate uh
 
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
education that the uh school districts
 
01:02:50.109 --> 01:02:50.119 align:start position:0%
will sign up for improved academic
 
01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
outcomes or that there'll be a reduction
 
01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
in local property taxes as a result
 
01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
should even either of those be
 
01:02:59.589 --> 01:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
reasonable expectations that come along
 
01:03:02.349 --> 01:03:02.359 align:start position:0%
with passing this
 
01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
legislation I mean I think that's a
 
01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:05.839 align:start position:0%
different way than the way I think about
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
it but I mean I would say yes for sure
 
01:03:09.789 --> 01:03:09.799 align:start position:0%
to the academic standards there I mean I
 
01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
think this the city of Manchester our
 
01:03:14.549 --> 01:03:14.559 align:start position:0%
school district has been dedicated to
 
01:03:16.109 --> 01:03:16.119 align:start position:0%
closing the learning Gap since the
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic and we've been working very
 
01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:20.039 align:start position:0%
hard on lowering class sizes doing very
 
01:03:23.349 --> 01:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
much research informed steps to uh
 
01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
adjust our system and really try to make
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
sure that every student in our in our
 
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
city has the best opportunity for a a a
 
01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
great education and I think that I can I
 
01:03:37.029 --> 01:03:37.039 align:start position:0%
can say with confidence that that is for
 
01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
sure our agenda I'm as for the lowering
 
01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
tax uh local tax paay expenses there
 
01:03:44.349 --> 01:03:44.359 align:start position:0%
that's the domain of our Board of Mayor
 
01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
and Alderman not the domain of the
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
school of the school
 
01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:51.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
testimony next call on it looks like
 
01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:09.789 --> 01:04:09.799 align:start position:0%
Portsmith thank you chairman uh members
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Delan
 
01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:13.880 align:start position:0%
McCarran I represent Portsmith New
 
01:04:17.269 --> 01:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I was proud to sign on to a
 
01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
letter with uh 11 10 other Mayors um
 
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
that you have in your possession I won't
 
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
read it but the gist of it is that we
 
01:04:28.750 --> 01:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
are opposed to these recent amendments
 
01:04:31.470 --> 01:04:31.480 align:start position:0%
um but not opposed to the bill as it
 
01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:34.799 align:start position:0%
received large uh bipartisan support on
 
01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:37.640 align:start position:0%
the floor of the house earlier uh this
 
01:04:40.829 --> 01:04:40.839 align:start position:0%
year um it was important for me uh and
 
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
now I'm speaking as my myself and as the
 
01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
mayor of Portsmouth uh it's important to
 
01:04:49.069 --> 01:04:49.079 align:start position:0%
me to to come up here um and speak on
 
01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
behalf of increasing state aid to
 
01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
education I am uh the son of a of a man
 
01:04:59.710 --> 01:04:59.720 align:start position:0%
who who made a better life uh for
 
01:05:02.029 --> 01:05:02.039 align:start position:0%
himself and for our family through
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
education I believe very strongly uh in
 
01:05:08.109 --> 01:05:08.119 align:start position:0%
education and I believe it is uh in our
 
01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution that we cherish education
 
01:05:12.670 --> 01:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
we must make it available to all so I
 
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
think there was a question earlier if
 
01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
there was opposition if um if we didn't
 
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
trust uh other communities to make good
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
decisions I trust other communities to
 
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
make good education decisions uh for
 
01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
their Community what I do not trust uh
 
01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
is the system of which we have decided
 
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
on paying for uh this uh this uh
 
01:05:40.349 --> 01:05:40.359 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax donor
 
01:05:42.829 --> 01:05:42.839 align:start position:0%
towns versus receiver towns it's a
 
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
flawed system it was a flawed system you
 
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
know uh when it was it was enacted and
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
you know I'm speaking you know not uh
 
01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
for the the Coalition communities but I
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
think the entire system
 
01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh you know the the ship is sinking in
 
01:06:02.109 --> 01:06:02.119 align:start position:0%
terms of of how we're funding education
 
01:06:04.109 --> 01:06:04.119 align:start position:0%
uh in New Hampshire you know I
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
personally believe it is time to leave
 
01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:07.839 align:start position:0%
that ship and and chart a new course and
 
01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
I look for you guys to try to figure out
 
01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
how to do that I think there was an
 
01:06:14.829 --> 01:06:14.839 align:start position:0%
earlier uh there was an earlier speaker
 
01:06:17.789 --> 01:06:17.799 align:start position:0%
uh Jason sain who uh gave this committee
 
01:06:19.950 --> 01:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
a whole host of new information of why
 
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
this is a bad idea um and I remember my
 
01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:25.240 align:start position:0%
friend uh representative of Oregon
 
01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
talked or musing on the fact that Durham
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh is not a donor Town while Portsmouth
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
is a donor town uh and that's an
 
01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
interesting uh thing to bring up because
 
01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
we both share uh the Great Bay um there
 
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
are great restaurants in Durham um we
 
01:06:44.910 --> 01:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
are you know similar in in many respects
 
01:06:47.309 --> 01:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
except when you look at how much land we
 
01:06:49.269 --> 01:06:49.279 align:start position:0%
have in current use in Portsmith you
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
will find 4% if you go to Durham you
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
will find
 
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
40% um it is hard for me to imagine a
 
01:06:59.589 --> 01:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax could be applied
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
to residents of Portsmouth when other
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
communities make drastically different
 
01:07:05.269 --> 01:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
decisions on what to do with their land
 
01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:07.400 align:start position:0%
and I am not suggesting for a moment
 
01:07:09.789 --> 01:07:09.799 align:start position:0%
that Durham get rid of current use I
 
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
love wagon Hill and my daughter and I
 
01:07:14.190 --> 01:07:14.200 align:start position:0%
enjoy sledding on it uh every time
 
01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
there's enough snow uh but the fact
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
remains the property tax it's not unfair
 
01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
because well it it's certainly unfair
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
because you know houses don't pay taxes
 
01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
people pay taxes and when you increase
 
01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh taxes or valuations increase even if
 
01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:33.559 align:start position:0%
we uh do our best to keep the the the
 
01:07:37.029 --> 01:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
the budget low uh in Portsmith the
 
01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
increase in property valuation is
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
unequal among the towns and if we were
 
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
to have a flat tax appli to Portsmouth
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
it simply uh would not it would not be
 
01:07:50.829 --> 01:07:50.839 align:start position:0%
fair uh because it would not be equal to
 
01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
the other towns the other example is
 
01:07:56.589 --> 01:07:56.599 align:start position:0%
that a property tax is a local decision
 
01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh that we have because it is inherently
 
01:08:01.589 --> 01:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
taken you add up all the property all
 
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
the property in a town a city and then
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
you divide it based on your share of
 
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
that property the decisions that you
 
01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
make collectively as a community the
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
decision whether or not to have multif
 
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
family housing the decision whether or
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
not to invite commercial activity into
 
01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
your municipality growing the property
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
tax space when you try to make that that
 
01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
individual Community local control a
 
01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
Statewide thing you are finding all of
 
01:08:29.709 --> 01:08:29.719 align:start position:0%
the flaws that you see in this system
 
01:08:31.709 --> 01:08:31.719 align:start position:0%
because the system can't be expanded
 
01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:34.600 align:start position:0%
outside of the local community to do so
 
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
is going to continue to pit Town against
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
town because the decisions that are
 
01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
affecting the property tax rate are
 
01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
decisions outside of Simply the
 
01:08:45.149 --> 01:08:45.159 align:start position:0%
education funding component of that I
 
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
implore this committee to look at this
 
01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
seriously there's a stay as I understand
 
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
so you'll have a year or so to do it I
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
hope that you guys are going to to
 
01:08:57.630 --> 01:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
understand the moment that is in front
 
01:08:59.910 --> 01:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
of you a moment to actually solve
 
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
education funding and to do so in an
 
01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
equitable way that is what we vote you
 
01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
in for to put a aside party differences
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
and to make sure that we can actually
 
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
deliver education at is required in the
 
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
Constitution to cherish thank you thank
 
01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:18.520 align:start position:0%
you I wish to take a one minute recess
 
01:09:22.110 --> 01:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
to announce that house bill 1633 which
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
is scheduled for 11:00 will be delayed I
 
01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
have four more
 
01:09:30.749 --> 01:09:30.759 align:start position:0%
um four more people that wish to testify
 
01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
if we hold them all to three minutes and
 
01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
they hold themselves to 3 minutes then
 
01:09:38.349 --> 01:09:38.359 align:start position:0%
we will be another 12 minutes before we
 
01:09:42.349 --> 01:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
go into house bill 1633 public hearing
 
01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
thank you and now back to
 
01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:47.960 align:start position:0%
chair question representative papichi
 
01:09:51.269 --> 01:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
Müller thank you very much Mr
 
01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:54.199 align:start position:0%
chair I really appreciate you U sharing
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
your thoughts and uh um I was just
 
01:09:59.310 --> 01:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
curious when you say that we should find
 
01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
a you know Equitable way of funding us
 
01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
education do you have any thoughts of
 
01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
over what that may be other than that
 
01:10:09.229 --> 01:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
this is not really the way that you see
 
01:10:12.669 --> 01:10:12.679 align:start position:0%
fit sure what would you suggest well um
 
01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:14.679 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know if the the
 
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
chairman will allow me to kind of talk
 
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
myself into an answer here um but uh I
 
01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
think that it has
 
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
to I think that it that it has to look
 
01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
at the the the differences um that every
 
01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
Community faces I think that it has to
 
01:10:36.189 --> 01:10:36.199 align:start position:0%
look to solve and incentivize towns to
 
01:10:39.149 --> 01:10:39.159 align:start position:0%
make decisions that solve other problems
 
01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
uh within New Hampshire the housing
 
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
crisis is something that you see uh
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
increasingly uh you know coming up at
 
01:10:48.030 --> 01:10:48.040 align:start position:0%
least in our community I'm sure as other
 
01:10:50.110 --> 01:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
communities you know in Portsmith I want
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
my children to be able to live in
 
01:10:53.709 --> 01:10:53.719 align:start position:0%
Portsmith we just got our three-year-old
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
out of our bed I'd like her to you know
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
move out of the house at some point but
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
in order to do so she has to afford
 
01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
another house I think that the decisions
 
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
that we made um in terms of uh some of
 
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
the zoning regulations uh enable uh some
 
01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
towns to continue to to live in a world
 
01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
where they don't see the greater good I
 
01:11:14.950 --> 01:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
personally see the greater good New
 
01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I recognize that New Hampshire
 
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
is made up of its communities different
 
01:11:20.189 --> 01:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
communities I understand that Portsmith
 
01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
is a lot different than Manchester a lot
 
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
different to the Lakes Region uh but I
 
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
also know that if you look at Portsmouth
 
01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:27.560 align:start position:0%
you're going to see a mosaic of
 
01:11:29.229 --> 01:11:29.239 align:start position:0%
different communities within that one
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
Community I would like to see that and I
 
01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
hope that and in terms of just one thing
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
that we could start to think about is
 
01:11:38.830 --> 01:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
the burden of taxes especially when it
 
01:11:41.070 --> 01:11:41.080 align:start position:0%
comes to thinking outside the box
 
01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
potentially Homestead exemptions things
 
01:11:45.629 --> 01:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
that allow those types of communities
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
that see an increase and a flux in
 
01:11:50.709 --> 01:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
actually start to be able to willingly
 
01:11:53.629 --> 01:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
contribute uh to this much more proudly
 
01:11:55.790 --> 01:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh and not on the backs of some of the
 
01:11:58.110 --> 01:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
poorest of our community thank you thank
 
01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:15.920 align:start position:0%

elective office for more than 30 years
 
01:12:28.830 --> 01:12:28.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm speaking against only one
 
01:12:32.669 --> 01:12:32.679 align:start position:0%
piece of this uh Amendment and that is
 
01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
um the uh uh spending cap um your the
 
01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
spending cap substitutes your judgment
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
for the Judgment of my budget committee
 
01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
my school board and most importantly my
 
01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
district and uh I don't want that I want
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
my local control I want to give you one
 
01:12:54.719 --> 01:12:56.030 align:start position:0%
my local control I want to give you one
example

01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:12:58.510 --> 01:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
um which occurred uh one week ago our
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
district meeting our district meeting
 
01:13:03.229 --> 01:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
would not have been successful um with
 
01:13:04.669 --> 01:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
this amendment in
 
01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
place we had uh a teacher contract come
 
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
up three-year contract our prior
 
01:13:15.149 --> 01:13:15.159 align:start position:0%
contract occurred during covid so during
 
01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
the worst piece of covid so the teachers
 
01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
got almost no raises for three years we
 
01:13:24.189 --> 01:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
come up to the current time and our
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
teachers we we had a problem um we
 
01:13:29.229 --> 01:13:29.239 align:start position:0%
couldn't hire teachers we couldn't
 
01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
retain teachers uh and during that time
 
01:13:35.189 --> 01:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
when the teachers were getting no raises
 
01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
you know there was a great big
 
01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
inflationary uh piece to it so our
 
01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
district meeting just passed a
 
01:13:45.310 --> 01:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
significant a very significant teacher
 
01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
contract the highest one I've seen in my
 
01:13:50.189 --> 01:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
30 years and we passed it by a
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
significant uh majority and that will
 
01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
take our problem way that we we'll be
 
01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:00.760 align:start position:0%
able to hire teachers retain teachers
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh and um our our community this was a a
 
01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
once in a generation problem that we
 
01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
needed to solve then and that spending
 
01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
cap would have gotten in the way of uh
 
01:14:17.149 --> 01:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
our ability to control our own
 
01:14:20.669 --> 01:14:20.679 align:start position:0%
situation um and uh I don't appreciate
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
that um my community's judgment is
 
01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
better than and the state judgment

January 20 on 3 January 2024 the
 
01:15:27.229 --> 01:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Education released its
 
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
newest cost per pupil D data for an

01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:36.760 align:start position:0%
2223 for
 
01:15:39.310 --> 01:15:39.320 align:start position:0%
20323 historical data shows an average
 
01:15:41.990 --> 01:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
increase of 5.1% school budget per year
 
01:15:44.830 --> 01:15:44.840 align:start position:0%
for the Last 5 Years therefore the costs
 
01:15:47.790 --> 01:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
have increased over 25% cumulatively
 
01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:48.950 align:start position:0%
have increased over 25% cumulatively
since

01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
since
 
01:15:52.629 --> 01:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
2019 this 25% shift in burden is to the
 
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire taxpayers in rural towns
 
01:15:57.709 --> 01:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
not sustainable for the New Hampshire
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers due to the high public school
 
01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
taxes we are seeing more people with no
 
01:16:04.990 --> 01:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
children or family buying family houses
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
that have moved to another state with
 
01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
school AG children and no increase in
 
01:16:11.629 --> 01:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
housing availability thus decreasing the
 
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
student population each year and
 
01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
increasing the budget since Public
 
01:16:19.470 --> 01:16:19.480 align:start position:0%
School enrollment has been decreasing
 
01:16:21.669 --> 01:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
budgets have been increasing the burden
 
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
keeps getting greater and greater on
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
every rural new ire Town rural areas are
 
01:16:28.629 --> 01:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
especially bearing a greater burden
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
since there is little to no construction
 
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
of new homes in these areas the burden
 
01:16:34.510 --> 01:16:34.520 align:start position:0%
stays with a static group of towns
 
01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
people in these towns State funding is
 
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
decreasing based on reduced enrollment
 
01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
But Rising cost per student continues I
 
01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
support this bill and I also like the
 
01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
committee to think about the other means
 
01:16:53.149 --> 01:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
I know that you've asked other uh
 
01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
speakers but on the land use or current
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
use in the state of New
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%

thank you for hearing me this morning
 
01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:25.400 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um I make a few
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
quick points because many others have
 
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
already said what I want to
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
say I'm here on behalf of my 3700
 
01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
members across the state we mostly work
 
01:17:35.669 --> 01:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
in kindergarten through 12th grade
 
01:17:37.629 --> 01:17:37.639 align:start position:0%
public education as well as public
 
01:17:41.629 --> 01:17:41.639 align:start position:0%
universities and uh we supported HB 1583
 
01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
is passed by the house we like parts of
 
01:17:46.990 --> 01:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment but because of uh another
 
01:17:48.629 --> 01:17:48.639 align:start position:0%
part of it we do have to come out in
 
01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
opposition and I'm here to start talking
 
01:17:53.550 --> 01:17:53.560 align:start position:0%
about the students and the New Hampshire
 
01:17:57.390 --> 01:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
Constitution our Constitution guarantees
 
01:17:59.350 --> 01:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
every New Hampshire child the
 
01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity of a public education so
 
01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's where we need to start and um
 
01:18:07.229 --> 01:18:07.239 align:start position:0%
they have the right to the opportunity
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
of public education funded through the
 
01:18:11.550 --> 01:18:11.560 align:start position:0%
state defining the content of what goes
 
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
into the that education is a job of the
 
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
legislature and you have done a good job
 
01:18:16.830 --> 01:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
of it there's a committee that meets
 
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
down the hall that keeps trying to add
 
01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
things to it so if you have a problem
 
01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
with the cost you might want to talk to
 
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
them um but uh that educate
 
01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
must be a robust education that prepares
 
01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
our students for life beyond graduation
 
01:18:33.790 --> 01:18:33.800 align:start position:0%
whether it's going on to college into
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
directly into business into an
 
01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship into the service whatever
 
01:18:40.510 --> 01:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
they're doing Beyond um Public Schools
 
01:18:42.430 --> 01:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
or or whatever education their parents
 
01:18:44.669 --> 01:18:44.679 align:start position:0%
choose they must be well prepared for it
 
01:18:47.709 --> 01:18:47.719 align:start position:0%
and it must be as robust in Berlin as it
 
01:18:50.189 --> 01:18:50.199 align:start position:0%
is in Bedford in Franklin as it is in
 
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
Windom so as much as we love redefining
 
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
the adequacy amount to
 
01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
$735 And1 we're concerned that this
 
01:19:02.590 --> 01:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
amendment puts all the tags in one
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
basket um there is great disparity
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
between what those students get in
 
01:19:11.669 --> 01:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
different districts already so if
 
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
putting our limited State funding just
 
01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
into raising based adequacy per pupil
 
01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
means we won't have funding left to do
 
01:19:22.350 --> 01:19:22.360 align:start position:0%
the differentiated Aid that helps
 
01:19:24.390 --> 01:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
students with different needs who are
 
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
more more um expensive to educate
 
01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
because they have greater learning needs
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
that require more support or towns where
 
01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
you require more funding because you
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
have a greater concentration of students
 
01:19:40.149 --> 01:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
who have more needs or more families who
 
01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
need more support then we would have a
 
01:19:45.910 --> 01:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
problem with putting so much emphasis
 
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
just on racing the base adequacy rate
 
01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
Aid um we don't want to set those
 
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
disparities in Granite so to speak we we
 
01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
also have a huge problem with tying this
 
01:20:00.510 --> 01:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
01:20:03.669 --> 01:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
imposing an Appropriations or spending
 
01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
cap on all districts that's a matter for
 
01:20:09.310 --> 01:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
localities to decide and some have um
 
01:20:10.990 --> 01:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
but that is up to the local voters to
 
01:20:13.149 --> 01:20:13.159 align:start position:0%
decide I understand you can override it
 
01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
with a two-thirds vote because I worked
 
01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
in a place that had a spending cap in
 
01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
place um but that's a local issue for
 
01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
them to decide adopting a spending cap
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
or a tax cap makes it very difficult to
 
01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:30.719 align:start position:0%
respond to spikes in um the cost of
 
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
things so when the cost of fuel oil goes
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
through the roof as we've seen in recent
 
01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
years you still have to respond to that
 
01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
the next year you can't wait for it to
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
be rolled into the threeyear average of
 
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
the CPI um you still have to run the
 
01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
buses you still have to heat the school
 
01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
you can't have the kids you know coming
 
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
in the cold um you can't necessarily
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
tell all families sorry you have to um
 
01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
drive your kids in because that is not
 
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
fair to families who do not have someone
 
01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
home to drive their kids into school um
 
01:21:03.070 --> 01:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons we urge you
 
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately as much as we would like
 
01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
the base acacy a increased for all
 
01:21:09.629 --> 01:21:09.639 align:start position:0%
students we don't think this is the
 
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
right approach for it so we urge you uh
 
01:21:15.669 --> 01:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
to find this amendment and exp to
 
01:21:17.070 --> 01:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you so much for your
 
01:21:18.750 --> 01:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
time and so you can hear the rest of
 
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
these testifiers I will not take
 
01:21:23.669 --> 01:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh the last one I have is Zach shien
 
01:21:30.629 --> 01:21:30.639 align:start position:0%
he'll tell us what NHS ffp is and he has
 
01:21:32.709 --> 01:21:32.719 align:start position:0%
written testimony so perhaps you don't
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
need to take five minutes very fair uh
 
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
my name is Zach shien I'm the executive
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
director for the New Hampshire school
 
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
funding fairness project doesn't always
 
01:21:43.229 --> 01:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
fit in the pink card I do have written
 
01:21:44.709 --> 01:21:44.719 align:start position:0%
testimony that I can I need to make some
 
01:21:47.229 --> 01:21:47.239 align:start position:0%
more copies I'll pass around um I will
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
kind of skip through it to just hit some
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
points that I think have been missed or
 
01:21:54.149 --> 01:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
overlooked uh in the essence of time um
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
just real quick new H school funding
 
01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
fers project we're a nonprofit
 
01:21:59.189 --> 01:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
organization that educates um citizens
 
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
and policy makers about school funding
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
property taxes um and kind of some of
 
01:22:05.350 --> 01:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
the ways we can work to address these
 
01:22:07.149 --> 01:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
issues I really appreciate all the work
 
01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
that's been done specifically in finance
 
01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
division 2 and with this amendment to
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
try to tackle what is a very complicated
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
and challenging issue um I want to point
 
01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
out that there are a number of elements
 
01:22:24.270 --> 01:22:24.280 align:start position:0%
to this amendment and as stated um by
 
01:22:25.870 --> 01:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
the sponsor at the beginning the the
 
01:22:27.790 --> 01:22:27.800 align:start position:0%
kind of impetus for this amendment was
 
01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:30.520 align:start position:0%
to try to address the lack of funding
 
01:22:32.189 --> 01:22:32.199 align:start position:0%
take into account the recent court
 
01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%
rulings which were you know
 
01:22:35.709 --> 01:22:35.719 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the legislature about
 
01:22:38.030 --> 01:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
how to raise additional funding and
 
01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
where to set that base adequacy at a
 
01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:40.350 align:start position:0%
where to set that base adequacy at a
higher

01:22:40.350 --> 01:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
higher
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
amount and to try to address the
 
01:22:45.790 --> 01:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um structure that is
 
01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:48.910 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um structure that is
currently

01:22:48.910 --> 01:22:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
swept as past HB 1583 as we've heard did
 
01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
receive very Broad bipartisan support so
 
01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
I definitely urge the committee to take
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
into account that everyone who's spoken
 
01:23:00.750 --> 01:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
most people who have spoken today have
 
01:23:03.390 --> 01:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
been in support of that underlying Bill
 
01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
and recognizing that there are elements
 
01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
to the amendment that they might not be
 
01:23:08.830 --> 01:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
in favor of for a lot of the reasons
 
01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
that you have
 
01:23:14.310 --> 01:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
heard relative to the remittance of
 
01:23:16.669 --> 01:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
excess swept wanted to point out a few
 
01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
things um one is that swept was created
 
01:23:23.229 --> 01:23:23.239 align:start position:0%
to fund the state's obligation to pay
 
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education
 
01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:27.560 align:start position:0%
is a state tax for a state
 
01:23:30.430 --> 01:23:30.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility it is not a local
 
01:23:32.910 --> 01:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
tax that's why that money in the in the
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
ruling the Rand decision back in
 
01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
November the judge found that that money
 
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
needs to be remitted to the state
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
because it is a state revenue source for
 
01:23:43.350 --> 01:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
the state's
 
01:23:45.149 --> 01:23:45.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility I think that is a piece
 
01:23:46.590 --> 01:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
that was missed from some of the uh
 
01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
previous speakers Additionally the uh
 
01:23:51.149 --> 01:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
letter signed by the Mayors I wanted to
 
01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
point out that again they were in
 
01:23:54.870 --> 01:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
support of the underlying bill some of
 
01:23:56.629 --> 01:23:56.639 align:start position:0%
those Mayors are also part of the
 
01:23:58.830 --> 01:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
Coalition community and so I think that
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully that support for the
 
01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill extends to them as
 
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
well we are in favor of increasing the
 
01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
base adequacy amount um it's in line
 
01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
with the conval decision it's a step in
 
01:24:12.189 --> 01:24:12.199 align:start position:0%
the right direction there's a lot of
 
01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
evidence a lot of thought and rationale
 
01:24:17.310 --> 01:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
behind both the conval plaintiff's
 
01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
argument for the almost $10,000 in base
 
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
adequacy and the judges ruling in the
 
01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:27.110 align:start position:0%
adequacy and the judges ruling in the
$7,300

01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
one two last pieces one is um I want to
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
reiterate opposition to the spending cap
 
01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
element of this amendment I think what
 
01:24:37.870 --> 01:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
we are concerned about is that locks
 
01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
into place the current inequities we see
 
01:24:42.390 --> 01:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
across our school funding system
 
01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
communities would not have the option to
 
01:24:46.149 --> 01:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
spend the additional funds they would
 
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
get from this amendment on schools if
 
01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:52.040 align:start position:0%
they wanted to for most communities many
 
01:24:54.510 --> 01:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
of whom are represented in this room the
 
01:24:56.590 --> 01:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
of additional funding would far exceed
 
01:24:58.830 --> 01:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
the allowable increase in their school
 
01:25:00.430 --> 01:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
budgets even if they wanted to make that
 
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
decision locally I understand the 23d
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
element but we all know that is a very
 
01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
high bar to pass and locking into place
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
current inequities um as in an attempt
 
01:25:12.350 --> 01:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
to kind of reduce overall School
 
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
spending I think is misplaced and not
 
01:25:16.669 --> 01:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the intent of this bill
 
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
the intent of the lawsuits the stated
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
intent this bill is to help address
 
01:25:22.270 --> 01:25:22.280 align:start position:0%
school funding and the inequities in
 
01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
there and placing a cap on on District's
 
01:25:26.629 --> 01:25:26.639 align:start position:0%
ability to increase funding if that's
 
01:25:28.709 --> 01:25:28.719 align:start position:0%
what they find they want to do to try to
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
increase student outcomes I think is a
 
01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
bit of a mismatch my last
 
01:25:36.629 --> 01:25:36.639 align:start position:0%
comment um is
 
01:25:39.189 --> 01:25:39.199 align:start position:0%
that we have really good schools in New
 
01:25:40.910 --> 01:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on
 
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
average on average we spend a good
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
amount of money on average we have very
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
high achievement scores there's also no
 
01:25:50.430 --> 01:25:50.440 align:start position:0%
school district in the state that spends
 
01:25:53.550 --> 01:25:53.560 align:start position:0%
less than three times the amount of
 
01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
money they get from the state an
 
01:25:57.870 --> 01:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
adequacy fund per pupil so unless every
 
01:25:59.550 --> 01:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
single School District in the state is
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
spending on Superfluous items as was
 
01:26:05.109 --> 01:26:05.119 align:start position:0%
alluded to or referenced earlier every
 
01:26:06.109 --> 01:26:06.119 align:start position:0%
single district is spending
 
01:26:07.350 --> 01:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
significantly more than they get from
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
adequacy funding there is a huge gap in
 
01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that we receive from
 
01:26:13.229 --> 01:26:13.239 align:start position:0%
advocacy funding and the amount of money
 
01:26:16.390 --> 01:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
that schools spend on their students I
 
01:26:17.950 --> 01:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
just want to underscore that last piece
 
01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
that we have good schools most school
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
boards most school districts in the
 
01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
state want to provide good educ a for
 
01:26:27.669 --> 01:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
their students and are trying to do so
 
01:26:30.030 --> 01:26:30.040 align:start position:0%
balancing the burden on local property
 
01:26:32.109 --> 01:26:32.119 align:start position:0%
taxes appreciate your time and I'd be
 
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:38.430 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
hacken

01:26:38.430 --> 01:26:38.440 align:start position:0%
hacken
 
01:26:40.510 --> 01:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
Phillips thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:26:44.109 --> 01:26:44.119 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question Mr Sheen um
 
01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if you would mention
 
01:26:48.310 --> 01:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
or if you have any opinion about the
 
01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
Amendments page three penalties that
 
01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
seem to be set into non excess towns
 
01:26:56.790 --> 01:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
that may choose not to fulfill their
 
01:26:59.149 --> 01:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
obligation to the state did you have any
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
position on the ability of the state to
 
01:27:04.709 --> 01:27:04.719 align:start position:0%
withhold either any monies from the
 
01:27:07.229 --> 01:27:07.239 align:start position:0%
education department of Ed or on the
 
01:27:10.669 --> 01:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
meal and rooms um distribution that
 
01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
would not be
 
01:27:15.629 --> 01:27:15.639 align:start position:0%
made thank you for the
 
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
question I think
 
01:27:23.189 --> 01:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
that the intent of that was to try to as
 
01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
with a lot of pieces of this Amendment
 
01:27:27.550 --> 01:27:27.560 align:start position:0%
actually tackle these issues headon
 
01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
instead of beating around the bush which
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
is why I really appreciate a lot of the
 
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
work that's been put into that I don't
 
01:27:35.790 --> 01:27:35.800 align:start position:0%
know if potentially restricting revenues
 
01:27:36.910 --> 01:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
from other sources like the rims and
 
01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
meal is the best way to get access to up
 
01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
communities to comply with that but I
 
01:27:45.870 --> 01:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
think it's looking at this
 
01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
issue as it stands which is that there's
 
01:27:51.790 --> 01:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of mismatch in what the courts
 
01:27:53.870 --> 01:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
have said to do or potential legislation
 
01:27:56.310 --> 01:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
and what actually ends up happening so I
 
01:27:57.430 --> 01:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
don't know that that would be the best
 
01:27:59.350 --> 01:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
mechanism to make sure that EXs swep
 
01:28:01.350 --> 01:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
communities comply with the law but I
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate the attempt to try to work
 
01:28:06.149 --> 01:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
through how do we actually make sure the
 
01:28:09.550 --> 01:28:09.560 align:start position:0%
changes in this bill um are
 
01:28:12.390 --> 01:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
enacted thank you thank you I close this

1633 and call upon representative

Maguire thank you Mr chairman and fellow
 
01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
members of the finance committee I'm
 
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
here to introduce um amendment 124h to
 
01:29:30.910 --> 01:29:30.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:29:34.910 --> 01:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
1633 for the past uh 10 or 12 years the
 
01:29:37.950 --> 01:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
house has worked on cannabis
 
01:29:41.310 --> 01:29:41.320 align:start position:0%
legislation uh in some cases passing it
 
01:29:44.229 --> 01:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
only to see it fail in the next steps
 
01:29:47.229 --> 01:29:47.239 align:start position:0%
either the senate or maybe the governor
 
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
for the first time we seem to have some
 
01:29:54.870 --> 01:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh a little bit of of a window
 
01:29:57.750 --> 01:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
to possibly passing something in this
 
01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
area um I personally met with the
 
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
governor's representative Mr Parker he
 
01:30:08.350 --> 01:30:08.360 align:start position:0%
gave me a list of um things that the
 
01:30:10.669 --> 01:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
governor has said would make such
 
01:30:10.679 --> 01:30:12.990 align:start position:0%
governor has said would make such
legislation

01:30:12.990 --> 01:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:30:16.910 --> 01:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
acceptable number one on that list is
 
01:30:20.189 --> 01:30:20.199 align:start position:0%
What's called the franchise model that's
 
01:30:22.109 --> 01:30:22.119 align:start position:0%
what this amendment
 
01:30:27.669 --> 01:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
represents um the the current bill um
 
01:30:30.510 --> 01:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
1633 is what's called I think the agency
 
01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
model or something like that the the the
 
01:30:38.430 --> 01:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
main difference is that um 1633 as it
 
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
exists would create um uh
 
01:30:46.189 --> 01:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
independent um regulated businesses
 
01:30:48.510 --> 01:30:48.520 align:start position:0%
right so heavily regulated but but even
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
so they're they're essentially
 
01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
independent businesses you can think of
 
01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
it uh maybe like restaurants or
 
01:30:56.550 --> 01:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
something that you know some are
 
01:30:58.470 --> 01:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
together some are different and and so
 
01:31:00.149 --> 01:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
on but they're heavily regulated by the
 
01:31:03.149 --> 01:31:03.159 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission um as far as their
 
01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
their bar and alcohol sales this bill
 
01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
creates What's called the franchise
 
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
model so so essentially The Liquor
 
01:31:13.229 --> 01:31:13.239 align:start position:0%
Commission becomes the
 
01:31:17.790 --> 01:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
franchisor for some number of businesses
 
01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
and and is even more heavily regulated
 
01:31:23.550 --> 01:31:23.560 align:start position:0%
right the the what they sell what they
 
01:31:26.270 --> 01:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
CAU what they charge uh how they
 
01:31:28.510 --> 01:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
advertise all that sort of stuff would
 
01:31:31.709 --> 01:31:31.719 align:start position:0%
be in common you can think of it like a
 
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
like a chain right there's a there's a
 
01:31:35.830 --> 01:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
McDonald's headquarters and all the
 
01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
McDonald's look the same and they all uh
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
are are regulated and priced and have
 
01:31:44.510 --> 01:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
similar uh products and so on um
 
01:31:46.430 --> 01:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
although maybe this franchise that's in
 
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is not quite as you know the
 
01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
the manual for McDonald's is probably I
 
01:31:53.550 --> 01:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
don't know how thick but this will be
 
01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:54.990 align:start position:0%
don't know how thick but this will be
less

01:31:54.990 --> 01:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
less
 
01:31:58.229 --> 01:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
um but but again if we want something to
 
01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
pass this is the number one thing on the
 
01:32:03.149 --> 01:32:03.159 align:start position:0%
governor's list there's there's another
 
01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
10 things in there as well that's that's
 
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
part of this
 
01:32:09.669 --> 01:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
amendment we're kind of in an analogous
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
situation to what the legislature found
 
01:32:14.590 --> 01:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
itself in at the end of
 
01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
prohibition so um when they decided to
 
01:32:20.189 --> 01:32:20.199 align:start position:0%
create the Liquor Commission in the
 
01:32:24.910 --> 01:32:24.920 align:start position:0%
first place and um
 
01:32:28.270 --> 01:32:28.280 align:start position:0%
I think today looking back at that most
 
01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
of us are glad they did right um if you
 
01:32:35.870 --> 01:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
look at the way alcohol is sold and
 
01:32:38.629 --> 01:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
regulated and so on in our surrounding
 
01:32:41.830 --> 01:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
states it's not as good as what we
 
01:32:45.950 --> 01:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
experience here in New Hampshire we have
 
01:32:48.030 --> 01:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
um our Liquor
 
01:32:51.109 --> 01:32:51.119 align:start position:0%
Commission I mean what's the basis of we
 
01:32:53.390 --> 01:32:53.400 align:start position:0%
want to have revenue for the state for
 
01:32:55.990 --> 01:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
all the programs education everything
 
01:32:59.830 --> 01:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
else and and we get a significant amount
 
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
from The Liquor Commission and it's so
 
01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
significant that 50% of their sales goes
 
01:33:08.590 --> 01:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
to people who don't live in New
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so these are people that are
 
01:33:15.629 --> 01:33:15.639 align:start position:0%
voluntarily sending us revenue and and
 
01:33:18.149 --> 01:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
don't get services for that for that
 
01:33:21.870 --> 01:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
Revenue in some sense right so um that's
 
01:33:24.430 --> 01:33:24.440 align:start position:0%
how great it is and
 
01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
and the the only reason that worked was
 
01:33:32.109 --> 01:33:32.119 align:start position:0%
they were at a point where there was no
 
01:33:34.470 --> 01:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
existing businesses there was no
 
01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
existing Revenue um and and so they
 
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
created The Liquor Commission and built
 
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
it up over time so the the source of the
 
01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:44.669 align:start position:0%
it up over time so the the source of the
liquor

01:33:44.669 --> 01:33:44.679 align:start position:0%
liquor
 
01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
commission's revenue is the fact that
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
they have a Statewide Monopoly they have
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
very high volumes and and therefore they
 
01:33:57.870 --> 01:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
can offer prices that are lower than
 
01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
similar products in in surrounding
 
01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
states now um this bill does not create
 
01:34:07.550 --> 01:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
that model
 
01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
because of the federal prohibition right
 
01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
so so the Federal Pro prohibition means
 
01:34:17.910 --> 01:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
that unlike liquor we
 
01:34:21.790 --> 01:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
cannot um import uh cannabis from other
 
01:34:24.629 --> 01:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
places it has to be GR grown and created
 
01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and in the long
 
01:34:32.510 --> 01:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
run it's it's clear that it will not be
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
grown in New Hampshire I mean if at some
 
01:34:37.629 --> 01:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
point the federal prohibition went away
 
01:34:40.350 --> 01:34:40.360 align:start position:0%
and there was interstate commerce any
 
01:34:43.109 --> 01:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
growing going on in New Hampshire would
 
01:34:45.390 --> 01:34:45.400 align:start position:0%
essentially cease right I I mean we
 
01:34:47.709 --> 01:34:47.719 align:start position:0%
still produce some liquor and some wine
 
01:34:49.629 --> 01:34:49.639 align:start position:0%
and so on in New Hampshire but it's a
 
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
very tiny amount I mean the the climate
 
01:34:54.629 --> 01:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire the soil oil all that
 
01:34:58.229 --> 01:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
sort of stuff is not suitable for for
 
01:34:58.239 --> 01:34:59.790 align:start position:0%
sort of stuff is not suitable for for
major

01:34:59.790 --> 01:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
major
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
agriculture um like this you know so so
 
01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
we're not at a point where we can create
 
01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:07.669 align:start position:0%
we're not at a point where we can create
a

01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:35:10.390 --> 01:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
Statewide um cannabis commission if you
 
01:35:13.830 --> 01:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
will to set up dozens of stores and all
 
01:35:17.070 --> 01:35:17.080 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing but what we can do is
 
01:35:18.990 --> 01:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
is sort of dip our
 
01:35:22.990 --> 01:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
toe all right dip our toe into it and
 
01:35:25.229 --> 01:35:25.239 align:start position:0%
and uh um
 
01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
create uh create some business that can
 
01:35:35.070 --> 01:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
later move in that direction right so
 
01:35:37.990 --> 01:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
some of our liquor stores currently are
 
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
called agency stores there's they're
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
liquor stores but they're not run by The
 
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission this creates 15 stores
 
01:35:49.109 --> 01:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
not run by The Liquor Commission but
 
01:35:51.950 --> 01:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
it's clear that in the long run there
 
01:35:54.189 --> 01:35:54.199 align:start position:0%
will have to be many many more stores
 
01:35:57.629 --> 01:35:57.639 align:start position:0%
there's currently 73 stores in Vermont I
 
01:36:00.109 --> 01:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
don't know there's probably 473 stores
 
01:36:03.070 --> 01:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
in Maine I don't know how many stores in
 
01:36:06.270 --> 01:36:06.280 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but the these 15 stores
 
01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
could continue as agency stores if you
 
01:36:12.790 --> 01:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
will um but in the long run we could
 
01:36:15.470 --> 01:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
potentially have a cannabis business
 
01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
similar to the liquor business it's not
 
01:36:20.910 --> 01:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
easy it's not
 
01:36:24.189 --> 01:36:24.199 align:start position:0%
guaranteed um we're not number one in
 
01:36:27.189 --> 01:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
liquor but cannabis is a somewhat
 
01:36:30.270 --> 01:36:30.280 align:start position:0%
substitute for liquor and and the
 
01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
history of people who are number one in
 
01:36:34.629 --> 01:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
a business when that business goes
 
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
through a major transition continuing on
 
01:36:42.270 --> 01:36:42.280 align:start position:0%
is not good so so this is a possibility
 
01:36:44.350 --> 01:36:44.360 align:start position:0%
and I think this is the only possibility
 
01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
that will um that will work um thank you
 
01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
one other thing just I'm sorry
 
01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
but the the bill in front of you is not
 
01:36:58.750 --> 01:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
the one we're going to pass my my copy
 
01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
is littered with notes right so we are
 
01:37:05.310 --> 01:37:05.320 align:start position:0%
going to make changes in division um and
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
and so don't you know we have complaints
 
01:37:09.790 --> 01:37:09.800 align:start position:0%
from this that and the other thing those
 
01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
kind of things are going to be worked on
 
01:37:12.750 --> 01:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:37:15.510 --> 01:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
chairman ladies and gentlemen I'm going
 
01:37:18.790 --> 01:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
to have a hard stop in about an hour at
 
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
12:30 because we have a a full afternoon
 
01:37:25.270 --> 01:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
for this committee so I have a number of
 
01:37:27.709 --> 01:37:27.719 align:start position:0%
cards if people hold themselves to 3
 
01:37:29.870 --> 01:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
minutes we should be able to get through
 
01:37:33.669 --> 01:37:33.679 align:start position:0%
it by 1:30 and we will remind you of the
 
01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
time I will allow a little more time for
 
01:37:39.310 --> 01:37:39.320 align:start position:0%
some people that have an an alternative
 
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
um the next one up will be an an
 
01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
alternative to this amendment that she
 
01:37:45.430 --> 01:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
already has submitted an amendment
 
01:37:48.830 --> 01:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully she can be brief but if
 
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
everybody stays no more than three
 
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
minutes we should be able to get through
 
01:37:55.470 --> 01:37:55.480 align:start position:0%
it by uh 12:30 and then there'll be a
 
01:37:58.070 --> 01:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
work session on this
 
01:38:00.790 --> 01:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
and I'll have representative Lehman
 
01:38:03.070 --> 01:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
announce the work
 
01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
session thank you Mr chairman I believe
 
01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
it's 1:00 tomorrow afternoon and across
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
the hall here so um there's a lot to be
 
01:38:14.589 --> 01:38:14.599 align:start position:0%
said please don't be repetitious if
 
01:38:16.229 --> 01:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
someone else has already made the points
 
01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
you want to make I would appreciate if
 
01:38:19.950 --> 01:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
you just say I agree with the previous
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
speaker or the soand so that said this
 
01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
and if you have one additional point to
 
01:38:27.229 --> 01:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
make please do that but this is a
 
01:38:29.709 --> 01:38:29.719 align:start position:0%
complicated subject and if you've heard
 
01:38:31.109 --> 01:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of the things you're going to say
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
please don't repeat them thank you um
 
01:38:37.390 --> 01:38:37.400 align:start position:0%
questions for representative McGuire
 
01:38:38.990 --> 01:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll call on representative
 
01:38:46.470 --> 01:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:48.830 --> 01:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
alternative thank you Mr CH chairman and
 
01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um for the
 
01:38:52.870 --> 01:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
record my name is Erica Leon I represent
 
01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
the town of Derry and I'm the prime
 
01:38:57.709 --> 01:38:57.719 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill um right now
 
01:38:59.229 --> 01:38:59.239 align:start position:0%
there's two different Forks on the road
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
in front of you one of them is the
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
agency model that I have presented which
 
01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
is a state-run path the other is a
 
01:39:09.990 --> 01:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
franchise the other Forks in the road
 
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
are do we want to have a industry a
 
01:39:15.550 --> 01:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis industry that is aggressively
 
01:39:18.430 --> 01:39:18.440 align:start position:0%
growing sales in order to maximize
 
01:39:20.830 --> 01:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
conversion from liquor to cannabis and
 
01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
in order to maximize revenues to the
 
01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:23.910 align:start position:0%
in order to maximize revenues to the
state

01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:39:26.149 --> 01:39:26.159 align:start position:0%
or do we want to have a path where
 
01:39:27.550 --> 01:39:27.560 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire who are
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
currently using cannabis and either
 
01:39:31.950 --> 01:39:31.960 align:start position:0%
purchasing it out of state or from
 
01:39:35.070 --> 01:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
illicit dealers have a safer instate
 
01:39:37.470 --> 01:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
model where we have an opportunity for
 
01:39:39.109 --> 01:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
this Market to participate in the state
 
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire but we are not in the
 
01:39:44.109 --> 01:39:44.119 align:start position:0%
business of a state of having more
 
01:39:45.470 --> 01:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
people use
 
01:39:48.589 --> 01:39:48.599 align:start position:0%
cannabis I prefer the second path I know
 
01:39:50.270 --> 01:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
that the last hearing says that we have
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of uses for money but I don't
 
01:39:53.830 --> 01:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
think that converting people who don't
 
01:39:56.830 --> 01:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
use cannabis today to be cannabis users
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
is a smart path forward I have presented
 
01:40:02.350 --> 01:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
a bill with with my bill passed the
 
01:40:04.629 --> 01:40:04.639 align:start position:0%
house and I did present an amendment
 
01:40:07.709 --> 01:40:07.719 align:start position:0%
that had some um increas some changes to
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
it it had some definitions it made sure
 
01:40:11.990 --> 01:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
that their therapeutic cannabis program
 
01:40:15.189 --> 01:40:15.199 align:start position:0%
was appropriately recognized um and it
 
01:40:17.790 --> 01:40:17.800 align:start position:0%
also worked towards those Appropriations
 
01:40:19.350 --> 01:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
I do want to say that the therapeutic
 
01:40:21.229 --> 01:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
cannabis program is very important in
 
01:40:23.470 --> 01:40:23.480 align:start position:0%
this state um we just has passed a bill
 
01:40:25.149 --> 01:40:25.159 align:start position:0%
so people don't need opioids for their
 
01:40:27.550 --> 01:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
pain before they can use cannabis it's
 
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
important and we need to make sure that
 
01:40:31.310 --> 01:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
as we move forward with legalization
 
01:40:32.830 --> 01:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
we're not throwing the patients and the
 
01:40:34.910 --> 01:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
people that serve them out we need to
 
01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that there is a path for the
 
01:40:39.870 --> 01:40:39.880 align:start position:0%
atcs to continue to operate VI viably
 
01:40:41.350 --> 01:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
and we need to make sure that people who
 
01:40:44.270 --> 01:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
use cannabis as medicine still have that
 
01:40:46.750 --> 01:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity my bill and the foundation
 
01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
of that bill provides for that path um
 
01:40:51.790 --> 01:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
what I would what I am planning to
 
01:40:54.910 --> 01:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
present to you is a way way to carve out
 
01:40:57.669 --> 01:40:57.679 align:start position:0%
the business model from the regulatory
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
path on cannabis we need to have the
 
01:41:02.910 --> 01:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
regulatory portion separate from the
 
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
business model um in liquor The Liquor
 
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
Commission is well suited to do both
 
01:41:09.990 --> 01:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
because there are federal regulations
 
01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
that give us a lot of guidance and give
 
01:41:13.709 --> 01:41:13.719 align:start position:0%
us a lot of guard rails because the
 
01:41:16.109 --> 01:41:16.119 align:start position:0%
federal guidance on cannabis is don't do
 
01:41:18.510 --> 01:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
it don't sell it that doesn't provide
 
01:41:21.030 --> 01:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
the same guard rails um I plan to come
 
01:41:24.189 --> 01:41:24.199 align:start position:0%
with language that will have franchise
 
01:41:26.870 --> 01:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
separate and compartmentalized from the
 
01:41:29.550 --> 01:41:29.560 align:start position:0%
whole rest of the implementation so that
 
01:41:31.550 --> 01:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
we can see if the franchise model does
 
01:41:32.990 --> 01:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
in fact work in the state of New
 
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if that proves to be unviable
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
it won't kill the entire program because
 
01:41:41.390 --> 01:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
it won't be in meshed throughout when we
 
01:41:43.550 --> 01:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
had heard had the last hearing I heard
 
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
about a $5 million computer system I
 
01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
realized a lot of people want to have
 
01:41:50.310 --> 01:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis legalized and they're willing
 
01:41:52.189 --> 01:41:52.199 align:start position:0%
to accept the franchise model because we
 
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
can change it I realized that even even
 
01:41:57.109 --> 01:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
if I was the person holding the pen if
 
01:41:59.629 --> 01:41:59.639 align:start position:0%
we spent $5 million on a process that
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
locks in franchises even I wouldn't be
 
01:42:04.709 --> 01:42:04.719 align:start position:0%
able to change that so let's separate
 
01:42:07.109 --> 01:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
the regulation and the operation from
 
01:42:09.229 --> 01:42:09.239 align:start position:0%
the business model and set up a separate
 
01:42:11.430 --> 01:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
franchise I will bring this to you for
 
01:42:13.149 --> 01:42:13.159 align:start position:0%
the work session tomorrow hopefully
 
01:42:15.270 --> 01:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
fully drafted if not in the best
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
language I can get because I know time
 
01:42:18.990 --> 01:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
is pressing but I think we've come an
 
01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
amazing way in this discussion and I'm
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
open to questions thank you
 
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members seeing
 
01:42:30.629 --> 01:42:30.639 align:start position:0%
none thank you Senator abbis here we'll
 
01:42:39.870 --> 01:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:42.149 --> 01:42:42.159 align:start position:0%
next and I'll do my best with that three
 
01:42:44.790 --> 01:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
minute uh time time frame I I hear I
 
01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:50.669 --> 01:42:50.679 align:start position:0%
lot thank you Mr chairman Senator Daryl
 
01:42:53.550 --> 01:42:53.560 align:start position:0%
abis I represent uh District 22
 
01:42:56.310 --> 01:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
communities of pum Salem ainson and
 
01:42:59.510 --> 01:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
plastow uh and I'm here I do support the
 
01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
Maguire Amendment um I will say just
 
01:43:05.350 --> 01:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
working on this last year as a member of
 
01:43:07.950 --> 01:43:07.960 align:start position:0%
the house and now in the Senate it's
 
01:43:09.310 --> 01:43:09.320 align:start position:0%
what can get over the finish line
 
01:43:11.310 --> 01:43:11.320 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people who were
 
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
traditionally against cannabis anyone
 
01:43:15.390 --> 01:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
who served with me last term in the in
 
01:43:17.870 --> 01:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
the term before I've spoken in
 
01:43:21.709 --> 01:43:21.719 align:start position:0%
opposition to several cannabis bills and
 
01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
cacs uh this is a compromise on my end
 
01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
do I love it no but at the same time I
 
01:43:31.870 --> 01:43:31.880 align:start position:0%
think it's it's a fair compromise and
 
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
this from what I I can see has a chance
 
01:43:37.310 --> 01:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
to become law and I I believe it does
 
01:43:39.310 --> 01:43:39.320 align:start position:0%
have a support in the chamber that I sit
 
01:43:41.629 --> 01:43:41.639 align:start position:0%
in and and meeting and having
 
01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
conversations with uh a lot of
 
01:43:45.229 --> 01:43:45.239 align:start position:0%
interested parties this could actually
 
01:43:48.510 --> 01:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
become law in respect to the the bill as
 
01:43:50.589 --> 01:43:50.599 align:start position:0%
it was drafted and the proposed
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
amendments uh it doesn't have my support
 
01:43:54.030 --> 01:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
I don't believe it would make it to
 
01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
anyone's desk to even be signed I'm just
 
01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
being as transparent as I can in the
 
01:44:04.430 --> 01:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
other concern I have is in the Senate
 
01:44:06.109 --> 01:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure this is going to have the
 
01:44:07.790 --> 01:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
support of the finance committee so the
 
01:44:10.229 --> 01:44:10.239 align:start position:0%
reason why I'm taking upon myself to
 
01:44:13.149 --> 01:44:13.159 align:start position:0%
come to the house committees is that I
 
01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
believe a finance committee that if if
 
01:44:16.430 --> 01:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
you're willing to support the bill
 
01:44:18.750 --> 01:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
should work on it and I heard I heard
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
some issues with some of the numbers
 
01:44:21.709 --> 01:44:21.719 align:start position:0%
that have been put in that and that's
 
01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
exactly why you know having a finance
 
01:44:26.430 --> 01:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
committee involved in the process that
 
01:44:30.149 --> 01:44:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:33.149 --> 01:44:33.159 align:start position:0%
beneficial going another Direction This
 
01:44:35.589 --> 01:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
the agency stor I keep hearing that it
 
01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
to me it just looking at it it's a
 
01:44:41.229 --> 01:44:41.239 align:start position:0%
rebranding of what was HP 639 in several
 
01:44:43.470 --> 01:44:43.480 align:start position:0%
bills we had over the years it's just
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
the new title it's not State controlled
 
01:44:50.070 --> 01:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh it's certainly not um any type of
 
01:44:52.270 --> 01:44:52.280 align:start position:0%
state store it's a private licensed
 
01:44:54.510 --> 01:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
store and we've seen every other state
 
01:44:56.470 --> 01:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
that allowed recreational Mech canist do
 
01:44:58.950 --> 01:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
that and they oversaturate the market
 
01:45:01.109 --> 01:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
and what that leads to is a lot of these
 
01:45:03.390 --> 01:45:03.400 align:start position:0%
go under and a lot of the wealthier
 
01:45:05.830 --> 01:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
investors they can withstand that and
 
01:45:08.990 --> 01:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
it's been a problem and I think going
 
01:45:11.589 --> 01:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
this route having the franchise model it
 
01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
really creates a partnership with the
 
01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:14.070 align:start position:0%
really creates a partnership with the
individual

01:45:14.070 --> 01:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:45:17.189 --> 01:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
franchises and I think there's a lot of
 
01:45:20.950 --> 01:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
benefits to that obviously you never see
 
01:45:22.589 --> 01:45:22.599 align:start position:0%
you don't want any of these stores going
 
01:45:23.470 --> 01:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
out of business
 
01:45:26.709 --> 01:45:26.719 align:start position:0%
business that's all about branding you
 
01:45:28.430 --> 01:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to see that and that's really
 
01:45:31.229 --> 01:45:31.239 align:start position:0%
critical to putting forward a something
 
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
that works together everyone's working
 
01:45:34.910 --> 01:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
together every franchisee would be
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
working together putting forward this
 
01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
this business model so I think just to
 
01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
sum it up this can make it over the
 
01:45:44.470 --> 01:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
Finish Line I was involved as the chair
 
01:45:46.229 --> 01:45:46.239 align:start position:0%
of the commission that met over the fall
 
01:45:47.550 --> 01:45:47.560 align:start position:0%
so I can answer any questions if you
 
01:45:49.310 --> 01:45:49.320 align:start position:0%
have any concerns about some of the
 
01:45:51.990 --> 01:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
provisions in here and um I'll be happy
 
01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
to answer those but again if you want
 
01:45:55.709 --> 01:45:55.719 align:start position:0%
something to become law it's best that
 
01:45:57.390 --> 01:45:57.400 align:start position:0%
we all paddle in the same direction
 
01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative papich Muller
 
01:46:01.709 --> 01:46:01.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you senator
 
01:46:04.149 --> 01:46:04.159 align:start position:0%
for testifying and taking questions um
 
01:46:06.310 --> 01:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
obviously it's a 38 page Amendment so
 
01:46:08.709 --> 01:46:08.719 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to get into the weeds but
 
01:46:11.470 --> 01:46:11.480 align:start position:0%
just one brief question how do you see
 
01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:12.310 align:start position:0%
just one brief question how do you see
this

01:46:12.310 --> 01:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:46:15.070 --> 01:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
model interplay with the current federal
 
01:46:16.950 --> 01:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
legislation I know that have been a lot
 
01:46:18.910 --> 01:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
of concerns expressed about the state
 
01:46:21.470 --> 01:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
and the federal governments butting
 
01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
heads on this and I'd appreciate your
 
01:46:27.189 --> 01:46:27.199 align:start position:0%
thoughts it's against federal law it's
 
01:46:28.830 --> 01:46:28.840 align:start position:0%
all the therapeutic program is against
 
01:46:31.470 --> 01:46:31.480 align:start position:0%
federal law it's all against federal law
 
01:46:33.310 --> 01:46:33.320 align:start position:0%
uh I think we want to take it the
 
01:46:34.589 --> 01:46:34.599 align:start position:0%
position we're either going to follow
 
01:46:36.270 --> 01:46:36.280 align:start position:0%
the federal law and and acknowledge it
 
01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
or ignore it but I think for what we're
 
01:46:41.990 --> 01:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
trying to do I preferred this the state
 
01:46:44.990 --> 01:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
control model similar to that of liquor
 
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
but it's difficult really Define uh
 
01:46:50.750 --> 01:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
investors into cultivation when you only
 
01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
have one customer so it's kind of
 
01:46:54.910 --> 01:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
without the interstate commerce piece to
 
01:46:58.189 --> 01:46:58.199 align:start position:0%
it it is a tall order so this franchise
 
01:47:02.189 --> 01:47:02.199 align:start position:0%
model was the Compromise from that thank
 
01:47:04.709 --> 01:47:04.719 align:start position:0%
you any further questions from committee
 
01:47:07.189 --> 01:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
members seeing none I'll next Call On
 
01:47:19.709 --> 01:47:19.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:21.550 --> 01:47:21.560 align:start position:0%
Hannon good morning and thank you
 
01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh my name name
 
01:47:25.669 --> 01:47:25.679 align:start position:0%
is Joe Hannon uh I'm a former legislator
 
01:47:28.229 --> 01:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
and I was also on the uh uh the study
 
01:47:29.550 --> 01:47:29.560 align:start position:0%
commission back in
 
01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
2018 as and I've been working on this
 
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
issue uh for quite a while with uh
 
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
several people who put forth the
 
01:47:37.270 --> 01:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
legislation in the last few years uh
 
01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot of things I'd like
 
01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
to to say but I know time is limited so
 
01:47:43.109 --> 01:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
I'll try to keep it brief um that we
 
01:47:44.910 --> 01:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
heard about the state model and why it's
 
01:47:46.870 --> 01:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
successful and why it works and why
 
01:47:48.189 --> 01:47:48.199 align:start position:0%
people some people think that it needs
 
01:47:49.470 --> 01:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
to be that way for
 
01:47:52.629 --> 01:47:52.639 align:start position:0%
cannabis uh prohibition from of alcohol
 
01:47:54.310 --> 01:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
is is what led to the state liquor
 
01:47:55.750 --> 01:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
commissions even being allowed when
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
prohibition was repealed the 21st
 
01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
amendment gave States the sole power to
 
01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
regulate uh Commerce and in and within
 
01:48:04.910 --> 01:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
their states and they can take complete
 
01:48:06.669 --> 01:48:06.679 align:start position:0%
control it's the one thing the federal
 
01:48:07.990 --> 01:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
government gave the authority to the
 
01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
states to do as far as Commerce we can't
 
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
say oh we're going to be the only ones
 
01:48:13.030 --> 01:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
that sell Tomatoes we're the only ones
 
01:48:14.910 --> 01:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
that sell tires we're not allowed to do
 
01:48:17.470 --> 01:48:17.480 align:start position:0%
that it's only allowed because the 21st
 
01:48:19.070 --> 01:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
amendment to the Constitution gives the
 
01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
state the expressed authority to do so
 
01:48:24.470 --> 01:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
so um we hear that one of the reasons
 
01:48:26.189 --> 01:48:26.199 align:start position:0%
why the state didn't have state stores
 
01:48:28.830 --> 01:48:28.840 align:start position:0%
because it's just a better compromise it
 
01:48:30.750 --> 01:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
would mean that the state would be
 
01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
directly selling an illegal federally
 
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
illegal substance every other state that
 
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
has done this has pretty much gone uh
 
01:48:40.589 --> 01:48:40.599 align:start position:0%
with a a different model and that's what
 
01:48:42.350 --> 01:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do with the original
 
01:48:45.629 --> 01:48:45.639 align:start position:0%
bill that was passed um in the
 
01:48:47.629 --> 01:48:47.639 align:start position:0%
house uh there were a couple other
 
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
things that I wanted to bring up um this
 
01:48:53.390 --> 01:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
you know every time that I see a bill if
 
01:48:54.709 --> 01:48:54.719 align:start position:0%
I wasn't sure if we should do it or not
 
01:48:58.310 --> 01:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
one is it effective is it allowed um and
 
01:49:01.350 --> 01:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
does it make uh does it solve a problem
 
01:49:02.830 --> 01:49:02.840 align:start position:0%
uh there's nothing in this amendment
 
01:49:04.550 --> 01:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
that can't be done through a franchise
 
01:49:07.470 --> 01:49:07.480 align:start position:0%
model this the model that you've seen if
 
01:49:08.629 --> 01:49:08.639 align:start position:0%
the governor and other people in the
 
01:49:12.189 --> 01:49:12.199 align:start position:0%
Senate would like uh certain controls
 
01:49:13.629 --> 01:49:13.639 align:start position:0%
they can get them through the model that
 
01:49:15.550 --> 01:49:15.560 align:start position:0%
was put forth and passed in the last
 
01:49:18.390 --> 01:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
committee and by the whole house uh the
 
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
state constitution I'm not going to read
 
01:49:22.109 --> 01:49:22.119 align:start position:0%
all the articles but I I you know I'd
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
like for everyone wanted to go peruse
 
01:49:25.709 --> 01:49:25.719 align:start position:0%
them if they haven't memorized them I'm
 
01:49:29.229 --> 01:49:29.239 align:start position:0%
sure some of you have um basically we
 
01:49:31.149 --> 01:49:31.159 align:start position:0%
have natural rights all men have certain
 
01:49:32.669 --> 01:49:32.679 align:start position:0%
natural essential inherent rights among
 
01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
them which are enjoying the defending
 
01:49:36.510 --> 01:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
and defending life and Liberty acquiring
 
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
possessing and protecting property and
 
01:49:40.750 --> 01:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
in a word of seeking and obtaining
 
01:49:44.550 --> 01:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
happiness um we're allow we have a right
 
01:49:47.229 --> 01:49:47.239 align:start position:0%
to privacy article 2B and's right to
 
01:49:48.750 --> 01:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
live free from governmental intrusion
 
01:49:50.189 --> 01:49:50.199 align:start position:0%
and private or personal information is
 
01:49:51.629 --> 01:49:51.639 align:start position:0%
natural essential and
 
01:49:51.639 --> 01:49:53.750 align:start position:0%
natural essential and
inherent

01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
inherent
 
01:49:56.310 --> 01:49:56.320 align:start position:0%
um there's a couple of prisions
 
01:49:58.350 --> 01:49:58.360 align:start position:0%
Provisions in this amendment that uh I
 
01:50:00.109 --> 01:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
think are are going to be a problem one
 
01:50:02.910 --> 01:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
is the uh anti- lobbying provision for
 
01:50:05.109 --> 01:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
the franchises the explanation for that
 
01:50:06.870 --> 01:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
is well they have to sign a contract so
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
it's okay that we don't allow them to
 
01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
petition the legislature for um their
 
01:50:14.030 --> 01:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
industry their their livelihood uh the
 
01:50:16.390 --> 01:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
state constitution in several places uh
 
01:50:18.030 --> 01:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
says that everybody in New Hampshire has
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
a right to petition for redress of
 
01:50:23.430 --> 01:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
grievances and also uh to petition the
 
01:50:25.510 --> 01:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
legislature to educate them or to ask
 
01:50:27.870 --> 01:50:27.880 align:start position:0%
them to do something everybody has that
 
01:50:29.470 --> 01:50:29.480 align:start position:0%
right there are multiple times in the
 
01:50:30.830 --> 01:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
state constitution where that's
 
01:50:33.629 --> 01:50:33.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned um I won't list them all but
 
01:50:37.109 --> 01:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
Article 28 14 22 30 and 32 are all
 
01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
articles in the State Constitution that
 
01:50:42.510 --> 01:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
contradict that part of this so if you
 
01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
don't change anything else I think
 
01:50:44.669 --> 01:50:44.679 align:start position:0%
that's something that needs to be
 
01:50:46.550 --> 01:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
addressed I think it's in there and we
 
01:50:48.990 --> 01:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
heard someone say this just recently and
 
01:50:50.950 --> 01:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
someone just came up and said that we
 
01:50:52.430 --> 01:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
have to pass this because it's the one
 
01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
thing that can pass and I know that
 
01:50:57.189 --> 01:50:57.199 align:start position:0%
you're all very uh you know honorable
 
01:51:01.149 --> 01:51:01.159 align:start position:0%
educated people in here and I when I was
 
01:51:03.470 --> 01:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
a representative I never ever wanted to
 
01:51:04.830 --> 01:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
vote to pass something just because
 
01:51:07.550 --> 01:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
that's the only thing we can pass what
 
01:51:09.470 --> 01:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
should you pass and I think that's the
 
01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
question we have to ask ourselves I'm
 
01:51:12.390 --> 01:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
not going to read the statement of
 
01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
principles from the nhgop platform but
 
01:51:17.790 --> 01:51:17.800 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's kind of scary when you read
 
01:51:20.430 --> 01:51:20.440 align:start position:0%
the list and think this bill is being
 
01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
put forth and other people people in my
 
01:51:25.390 --> 01:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
party are going to vote for it because
 
01:51:27.910 --> 01:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
um there's nothing in our statement of
 
01:51:29.790 --> 01:51:29.800 align:start position:0%
principles that really makes sense with
 
01:51:32.990 --> 01:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
this this amendment um you know uh Free
 
01:51:34.629 --> 01:51:34.639 align:start position:0%
People free markets free
 
01:51:37.109 --> 01:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
enterprise um you know less government
 
01:51:39.550 --> 01:51:39.560 align:start position:0%
intrusion less regulations Less business
 
01:51:42.629 --> 01:51:42.639 align:start position:0%
uh barriers to enter businesses uh the
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
amendment that will be brought forth
 
01:51:46.589 --> 01:51:46.599 align:start position:0%
later I believe is going to have um you
 
01:51:49.270 --> 01:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
know more lower entry fees lower tiers
 
01:51:51.589 --> 01:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
for people that do smaller craft uh
 
01:51:54.589 --> 01:51:54.599 align:start position:0%
growing or or whatnot so I think that
 
01:51:56.390 --> 01:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
there are so many reasons and I and I
 
01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
can keep going but I know there's a lot
 
01:51:58.870 --> 01:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
of people like to speak so I just
 
01:52:00.589 --> 01:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
suggest that people go back read the
 
01:52:02.189 --> 01:52:02.199 align:start position:0%
State Constitution and read all the
 
01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
things that are that are in this list I
 
01:52:06.149 --> 01:52:06.159 align:start position:0%
know uh you know Karen O ke from
 
01:52:08.430 --> 01:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
marijuana policy project sent sent you
 
01:52:11.069 --> 01:52:11.079 align:start position:0%
all list of all the you know this bill
 
01:52:13.470 --> 01:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
the M the the uh the regular amendment
 
01:52:16.149 --> 01:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
that was passed this amendment and they
 
01:52:17.550 --> 01:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
have suggested amendments and then if
 
01:52:18.990 --> 01:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
you go through that list and look at the
 
01:52:20.069 --> 01:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the statement of
 
01:52:21.950 --> 01:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
principles there's a lot of things that
 
01:52:23.350 --> 01:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
don't don't don't make any sense
 
01:52:25.109 --> 01:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
whatsoever so I I really ask you to
 
01:52:27.510 --> 01:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
please um take the time to deliberate
 
01:52:29.550 --> 01:52:29.560 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and and later in the week or
 
01:52:32.709 --> 01:52:32.719 align:start position:0%
next week or two and um pass a bill that
 
01:52:34.870 --> 01:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
makes sense and guarantees freedom
 
01:52:37.310 --> 01:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
business free enterprise and still
 
01:52:38.750 --> 01:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
protects people in the state there's
 
01:52:40.550 --> 01:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
nothing in the other in the in the bill
 
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
that was passed already and by one one
 
01:52:44.870 --> 01:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
committee that doesn't do almost
 
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
everything the governor wants except for
 
01:52:47.470 --> 01:52:47.480 align:start position:0%
a couple little things that are
 
01:52:49.390 --> 01:52:49.400 align:start position:0%
blatantly unconstitutional or go against
 
01:52:51.149 --> 01:52:51.159 align:start position:0%
our statement of principles for from the
 
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
party that I belong to and I believe
 
01:52:54.390 --> 01:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
that that's something that every party
 
01:52:58.189 --> 01:52:58.199 align:start position:0%
should actually believe so thank you
 
01:52:58.199 --> 01:52:59.470 align:start position:0%

01:53:53.790 --> 01:53:53.800 align:start position:0%
of this Community struggle financially
 
01:53:55.510 --> 01:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
to get their medicine because it is not
 
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
covered by health insurance as almost
 
01:54:00.229 --> 01:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
all other accepted medicines are note
 
01:54:01.870 --> 01:54:01.880 align:start position:0%
regardless if you believe cannabis is a
 
01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
medicine or not we have over 40,000
 
01:54:05.910 --> 01:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed Publications and I believe
 
01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
it is objectively a medicine patients
 
01:54:10.350 --> 01:54:10.360 align:start position:0%
are paying for their medicine out of
 
01:54:11.870 --> 01:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
pocket and they need all the assistance
 
01:54:13.790 --> 01:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
they can get the proposed amendment
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
would increase the price of cannabis
 
01:54:16.669 --> 01:54:16.679 align:start position:0%
products for medical patients by
 
01:54:19.750 --> 01:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
imparting a 12.5% tax this is not only
 
01:54:21.310 --> 01:54:21.320 align:start position:0%
unnecessary because medical patients
 
01:54:23.310 --> 01:54:23.320 align:start position:0%
make up a significantly lower portion of
 
01:54:25.069 --> 01:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
the population compared to the adult use
 
01:54:26.990 --> 01:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
Market but is also unnecessary in
 
01:54:29.189 --> 01:54:29.199 align:start position:0%
targeting a vulnerable population in New
 
01:54:31.189 --> 01:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that we should be protecting
 
01:54:32.589 --> 01:54:32.599 align:start position:0%
the only way that I see this as a
 
01:54:34.430 --> 01:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
feasible rout route forward is if we
 
01:54:36.069 --> 01:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
provide medical patients with the right
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
to homow allowing them to have
 
01:54:39.589 --> 01:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
affordable and accessible Avenue to
 
01:54:41.830 --> 01:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
Quality cannabis products and grow them
 
01:54:44.910 --> 01:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
to their specific needs additionally in
 
01:54:46.709 --> 01:54:46.719 align:start position:0%
relation to the alternative treatment
 
01:54:48.310 --> 01:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
centers these facilities have
 
01:54:49.830 --> 01:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
established a community of trust with
 
01:54:51.629 --> 01:54:51.639 align:start position:0%
their patients and Community they were
 
01:54:53.589 --> 01:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
able to provide medicine education and
 
01:54:55.229 --> 01:54:55.239 align:start position:0%
Community when no other place in the
 
01:54:56.950 --> 01:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
state allowed access to this medicinal
 
01:54:58.790 --> 01:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
plant purposely limiting The
 
01:55:00.589 --> 01:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
Establishment for the sake of State
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
funds is egregious in my opinion we
 
01:55:04.870 --> 01:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
should be prioritizing implementing what
 
01:55:06.870 --> 01:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
the atcs have learned from doing
 
01:55:08.430 --> 01:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire and use their
 
01:55:10.510 --> 01:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
leadership as an example for patient
 
01:55:12.790 --> 01:55:12.800 align:start position:0%
focused medicine and prioritize them in
 
01:55:14.510 --> 01:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
their patients as legislation moves
 
01:55:16.669 --> 01:55:16.679 align:start position:0%
forward myself and many other members of
 
01:55:18.109 --> 01:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis Community were excited to
 
01:55:19.990 --> 01:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
have an industry in the state but while
 
01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
reading the proposed amendment including
 
01:55:23.709 --> 01:55:23.719 align:start position:0%
page 15 line 15 which says that there is
 
01:55:26.189 --> 01:55:26.199 align:start position:0%
a prerequisite of operating a cannabis
 
01:55:28.229 --> 01:55:28.239 align:start position:0%
establishment in another state as a
 
01:55:29.870 --> 01:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
criteria for granting licenses for
 
01:55:31.870 --> 01:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
franchise models combined with the
 
01:55:34.709 --> 01:55:34.719 align:start position:0%
lenient res residency requirements to me
 
01:55:36.270 --> 01:55:36.280 align:start position:0%
this is essentially asking people in
 
01:55:38.270 --> 01:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
neighboring states like Massachusetts
 
01:55:40.109 --> 01:55:40.119 align:start position:0%
who on average make significantly more
 
01:55:41.950 --> 01:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
money than New Hampshire residents to
 
01:55:43.950 --> 01:55:43.960 align:start position:0%
continue taking opportunities away from
 
01:55:45.470 --> 01:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
us we would have loved to have
 
01:55:47.030 --> 01:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
experience in the canabus industry in
 
01:55:49.109 --> 01:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
the State running businesses but our
 
01:55:50.830 --> 01:55:50.840 align:start position:0%
state did not allow us to and we should
 
01:55:52.910 --> 01:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
not be reprimanded because are loyal to
 
01:55:54.790 --> 01:55:54.800 align:start position:0%
our community and our state this
 
01:55:56.310 --> 01:55:56.320 align:start position:0%
proposed model emphasizes large
 
01:55:58.430 --> 01:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
corporations and discourages small craft
 
01:56:00.069 --> 01:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
businesses which is the opposite of what
 
01:56:02.750 --> 01:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
we preach in our constitution lastly
 
01:56:04.510 --> 01:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
increasing penalties for consumption of
 
01:56:06.550 --> 01:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis in public does not make any
 
01:56:08.430 --> 01:56:08.440 align:start position:0%
sense to me it is clear discrimination
 
01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
against cannabis consumers and it makes
 
01:56:13.189 --> 01:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
no sense to increase access availability
 
01:56:15.229 --> 01:56:15.239 align:start position:0%
and education but also increase
 
01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
punishments for using the same medicine
 
01:56:19.910 --> 01:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
I hope to see um as we move forward that
 
01:56:21.669 --> 01:56:21.679 align:start position:0%
we prioritize culture community and
 
01:56:23.629 --> 01:56:23.639 align:start position:0%
quality of medicine for adult youth
 
01:56:25.430 --> 01:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
consumers and for medical patients thank
 
01:56:28.430 --> 01:56:28.440 align:start position:0%

his behalf I'm speaking in favor of the

Maguire Amendment we believe it is a
 
01:57:10.910 --> 01:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
workable model and most importantly one
 
01:57:13.149 --> 01:57:13.159 align:start position:0%
that can actually be enacted into law
 
01:57:14.950 --> 01:57:14.960 align:start position:0%

next call in Michelle Merritt for three
 
01:57:36.709 --> 01:57:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:39.109 --> 01:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
Futures thank you Mr chairman honorable

Michelle Merritt I'm the president at
 
01:57:43.589 --> 01:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
new Futures many of you are familiar
 
01:57:45.030 --> 01:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
with our organization we're here quite
 
01:57:47.790 --> 01:57:47.800 align:start position:0%
often um today I also representing the
 
01:57:49.750 --> 01:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire cannabis policy Coalition
 
01:57:52.470 --> 01:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
for Public Health and Social Justice um
 
01:57:54.109 --> 01:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
this is a group of aligned nonprofit
 
01:57:56.189 --> 01:57:56.199 align:start position:0%
organizations who share the belief that
 
01:57:58.229 --> 01:57:58.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire if New Hampshire moves in
 
01:58:00.870 --> 01:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
the direction of commercializing uh
 
01:58:03.189 --> 01:58:03.199 align:start position:0%
recreational Cannabis that policy makers
 
01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
must utilize the best available science
 
01:58:08.430 --> 01:58:08.440 align:start position:0%
and evidence to reduce public harm limit
 
01:58:10.510 --> 01:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
Youth and problematic use and purposely
 
01:58:13.149 --> 01:58:13.159 align:start position:0%
Advanced equity in this state for these
 
01:58:15.870 --> 01:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
reasons the policy Coalition um came
 
01:58:17.790 --> 01:58:17.800 align:start position:0%
together around a common set of
 
01:58:19.950 --> 01:58:19.960 align:start position:0%
principles and they are to protect
 
01:58:21.709 --> 01:58:21.719 align:start position:0%
Children and Youth promote social
 
01:58:24.669 --> 01:58:24.679 align:start position:0%
justice and opportunities for Equity
 
01:58:26.629 --> 01:58:26.639 align:start position:0%
protect public health and population
 
01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
health and ensure appropriate funding
 
01:58:31.109 --> 01:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
for cannabis revenue is directed towards
 
01:58:32.950 --> 01:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
efforts that reduce the public harms
 
01:58:35.790 --> 01:58:35.800 align:start position:0%
associated with use so it's this last
 
01:58:37.669 --> 01:58:37.679 align:start position:0%
particular principle that I'm going to
 
01:58:39.189 --> 01:58:39.199 align:start position:0%
touch on briefly I'm going to keep it to
 
01:58:41.229 --> 01:58:41.239 align:start position:0%
three minutes um we are pleased to see
 
01:58:43.229 --> 01:58:43.239 align:start position:0%
that this amendment creates a substance
 
01:58:45.229 --> 01:58:45.239 align:start position:0%
abuse prevention treatment and Recovery
 
01:58:48.950 --> 01:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
Fund um however it only allocates 10% of
 
01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
the revenues to this fund according to
 
01:58:53.270 --> 01:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
estimates from from policy makers and
 
01:58:54.910 --> 01:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
legislators who have done work on this
 
01:58:57.109 --> 01:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
issue for years this is likely going to
 
01:58:59.830 --> 01:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
result in only a few million dollars
 
01:59:02.510 --> 01:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
that would be designated to increase um
 
01:59:03.990 --> 01:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
treatment needs in the state of New
 
01:59:07.189 --> 01:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that is not enough um we urge
 
01:59:09.189 --> 01:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
the committee to please consider
 
01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
increasing that debt is consistent with
 
01:59:12.709 --> 01:59:12.719 align:start position:0%
the recommendation that was made by the
 
01:59:14.310 --> 01:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
study commission who worked on this
 
01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
issue over the summer uh and into the
 
01:59:20.390 --> 01:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
fall um our Behavioral Health System is
 
01:59:22.350 --> 01:59:22.360 align:start position:0%
fragile in this moment and if we are
 
01:59:24.709 --> 01:59:24.719 align:start position:0%
going to respond to Growing need for
 
01:59:26.430 --> 01:59:26.440 align:start position:0%
services we need to make sure the funds
 
01:59:28.030 --> 01:59:28.040 align:start position:0%
and the revenues are there to support
 
01:59:30.669 --> 01:59:30.679 align:start position:0%
that system the last principle that I
 
01:59:32.750 --> 01:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
just quickly wish to touch on is around
 
01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
social justice um it was mentioned by a
 
01:59:36.950 --> 01:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
previous speaker but we share the
 
01:59:39.629 --> 01:59:39.639 align:start position:0%
concerns around how the penalties for
 
01:59:41.390 --> 01:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
smoking in public are assessed under
 
01:59:43.149 --> 01:59:43.159 align:start position:0%
this amendment under the current
 
01:59:45.069 --> 01:59:45.079 align:start position:0%
decriminalization law if someone is
 
01:59:47.069 --> 01:59:47.079 align:start position:0%
caught smoking in public with less than
 
01:59:49.149 --> 01:59:49.159 align:start position:0%
three fifths uh I'm sorry 34s of an
 
01:59:51.390 --> 01:59:51.400 align:start position:0%
ounce of cannabis the highest penalty
 
01:59:52.830 --> 01:59:52.840 align:start position:0%
that they would face case for a third
 
01:59:55.589 --> 01:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
offense is a Class B misdemeanor and a
 
01:59:57.030 --> 01:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
fine of up to
 
01:59:59.149 --> 01:59:59.159 align:start position:0%
$1,200 this is a serious criminal
 
02:00:01.589 --> 02:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
penalty that um creates a record and
 
02:00:04.189 --> 02:00:04.199 align:start position:0%
also includes a substantial fine however
 
02:00:05.629 --> 02:00:05.639 align:start position:0%
under the proposed amendment New
 
02:00:07.189 --> 02:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would be opening the door to
 
02:00:09.229 --> 02:00:09.239 align:start position:0%
putting people in jail for up to a year
 
02:00:11.550 --> 02:00:11.560 align:start position:0%
for a second Offense for this exact same
 
02:00:14.510 --> 02:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
conduct um it's also punishable under as
 
02:00:17.229 --> 02:00:17.239 align:start position:0%
an undefined misdemeanor we raised this
 
02:00:18.669 --> 02:00:18.679 align:start position:0%
point before the committee for
 
02:00:20.189 --> 02:00:20.199 align:start position:0%
consideration because it has the
 
02:00:22.790 --> 02:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
potential to be extremely costly to New
 
02:00:24.390 --> 02:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and also to New Hampshire
 
02:00:26.350 --> 02:00:26.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who will have to pay for
 
02:00:28.390 --> 02:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
public defenders for in any any
 
02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
individual who is charged with a Class A
 
02:00:32.950 --> 02:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor um the state would be ending
 
02:00:35.589 --> 02:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
up having to foot the bill for this um
 
02:00:37.229 --> 02:00:37.239 align:start position:0%
so for these reasons we ask the
 
02:00:39.550 --> 02:00:39.560 align:start position:0%
committee if you are so inclined to pass
 
02:00:39.560 --> 02:00:40.709 align:start position:0%
committee if you are so inclined to pass

designated for substance abuse treatment
 
02:00:51.069 --> 02:00:51.079 align:start position:0%

on the other hand uh rep Maguire's
 
02:03:01.350 --> 02:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
non-gain Amendment submitted on behalf
 
02:03:06.109 --> 02:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
of uh Senator Senator abbis represents a
 
02:03:08.069 --> 02:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
big government takeover of New
 
02:03:10.629 --> 02:03:10.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's cannabis Market without

including statutory language authorizing

the state to become a cannabis
 
02:03:17.910 --> 02:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
franchiser the Amendments attempt to
 
02:03:21.870 --> 02:03:21.880 align:start position:0%
establish a state cannabis cartel where
 
02:03:23.550 --> 02:03:23.560 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission would control the
 
02:03:27.350 --> 02:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
prices packaging labeling promotion
 
02:03:30.229 --> 02:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
advertising location and even the sale
 
02:03:32.709 --> 02:03:32.719 align:start position:0%
of property of cannabis
 
02:03:35.109 --> 02:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
establishments the amendment would have
 
02:03:37.030 --> 02:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
would pave the way for vertically
 
02:03:39.709 --> 02:03:39.719 align:start position:0%
integrated operations where only the
 
02:03:42.350 --> 02:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
manager of the operation would need to
 
02:03:44.149 --> 02:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
be a resident of New
 
02:03:46.470 --> 02:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the amendment provides no
 
02:03:48.390 --> 02:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
pathway for alternative treatment
 
02:03:51.790 --> 02:03:51.800 align:start position:0%
centers to become cannabis retail stores
 
02:03:55.750 --> 02:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
it would po impose a 12 1 12% tax on the
 
02:03:58.750 --> 02:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
sale of medical cannabis while providing
 
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
a 10% pay raise to Liquor Commission
 
02:04:04.750 --> 02:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
employees and administrators to set up
 
02:04:06.510 --> 02:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis
 
02:04:08.870 --> 02:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
cartel plus the overall claim that
 
02:04:11.390 --> 02:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis would be regulated like alcohol
 
02:04:14.229 --> 02:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
is totally false as detailed in my
 
02:04:17.830 --> 02:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
written comments as a hemp licensed hemp
 
02:04:20.109 --> 02:04:20.119 align:start position:0%
grower I'm concerned that the amendment
 
02:04:22.510 --> 02:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
would require all licensed hemp
 
02:04:24.910 --> 02:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
operations in New Hampshire to cease
 
02:04:27.030 --> 02:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
operation since we would no longer have
 
02:04:29.709 --> 02:04:29.719 align:start position:0%
access to seeds which would be defined
 
02:04:33.950 --> 02:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
and regulated as cannabis under the
 
02:04:36.310 --> 02:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
amendment with an appropriation request
 
02:04:39.149 --> 02:04:39.159 align:start position:0%
of almost 19 million over two years the
 
02:04:41.069 --> 02:04:41.079 align:start position:0%
amendment is more than twice as
 
02:04:43.990 --> 02:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
expensive as the 8 million requested to
 
02:04:46.350 --> 02:04:46.360 align:start position:0%
implement hp1
 
02:04:48.950 --> 02:04:48.960 align:start position:0%

level of support for legal cannabis
 
02:05:05.149 --> 02:05:05.159 align:start position:0%
among Granite State farmers of which I

am
 
02:05:09.549 --> 02:05:09.559 align:start position:0%
one the survey found that 87% of
 
02:05:11.830 --> 02:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
respondents that currently
 
02:05:15.189 --> 02:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
support uh currently Farm support the

legislation of adult use cannabis 78% of
 
02:05:22.069 --> 02:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
those New Hampshire farmers expressed

interest in becoming licensed Growers
 
02:05:27.629 --> 02:05:27.639 align:start position:0%
only 10% of farmers surveyed support a
 
02:05:30.910 --> 02:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
state Monopoly system I urge the finance
 
02:05:33.310 --> 02:05:33.320 align:start position:0%
committee to reject rep Maguire's
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%

02:05:40.310 --> 02:05:40.320 align:start position:0%

him to question since he's representing
 
02:05:54.510 --> 02:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:10.830 --> 02:06:10.840 align:start position:0%

patients which now number uh slightly
over

02:06:47.030 --> 02:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
over
 
02:06:50.750 --> 02:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
14,000 in our state so we are a
 
02:06:50.760 --> 02:06:52.109 align:start position:0%
14,000 in our state so we are a
nonprofit

02:06:52.109 --> 02:06:52.119 align:start position:0%
nonprofit
 
02:06:55.030 --> 02:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
we are solely focused on New Hampshire
 
02:06:57.189 --> 02:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
uh we do not have any connections with
 
02:07:00.990 --> 02:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
large companies and other states Etc so
 
02:07:04.149 --> 02:07:04.159 align:start position:0%
we support legalization unfortunately we
 
02:07:05.790 --> 02:07:05.800 align:start position:0%
cannot support this amendment as
 
02:07:08.709 --> 02:07:08.719 align:start position:0%
currently written um to be clear we
 
02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
would be willing to go along with all of
 
02:07:13.390 --> 02:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
the requirements that have been clearly
 
02:07:16.270 --> 02:07:16.280 align:start position:0%
stated by the governor on this issue
 
02:07:18.229 --> 02:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
some of them we don't necessarily agree
 
02:07:21.030 --> 02:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
with but we're willing to live with them
 
02:07:22.910 --> 02:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh really appreciated the governor's
 
02:07:24.709 --> 02:07:24.719 align:start position:0%
statement that the top priority for
 
02:07:27.030 --> 02:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis legalization should be harm
 
02:07:30.270 --> 02:07:30.280 align:start position:0%
reduction not profits uh we believe that
 
02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
our program does serve a harm reduction
 
02:07:35.109 --> 02:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
function in New Hampshire I won't go
 
02:07:37.189 --> 02:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
into details on that I'll be here
 
02:07:38.830 --> 02:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and I'll be happy to talk about
 
02:07:42.149 --> 02:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
anything you might like to to talk about
 
02:07:43.629 --> 02:07:43.639 align:start position:0%
but in this case I'm pleased to hear
 
02:07:45.149 --> 02:07:45.159 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire say that this
 
02:07:47.030 --> 02:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
amendment will not pass as is that it
 
02:07:48.790 --> 02:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
will receive further work in this
 
02:07:51.669 --> 02:07:51.679 align:start position:0%
committee I think that's great because
 
02:07:53.830 --> 02:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
definitely needs more work and I don't
 
02:07:55.709 --> 02:07:55.719 align:start position:0%
believe that it would go the whole way
 
02:07:59.390 --> 02:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't receive more work so I
 
02:08:01.510 --> 02:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
have passed out written testimony for
 
02:08:03.750 --> 02:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
those of you who are on division one
 
02:08:05.830 --> 02:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
you've already received these documents
 
02:08:07.750 --> 02:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
via email the only change is that I
 
02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
added the amendment number so if you've
 
02:08:11.790 --> 02:08:11.800 align:start position:0%
already read it it's still the same if
 
02:08:14.189 --> 02:08:14.199 align:start position:0%
you haven't here it is again there's a
 
02:08:16.709 --> 02:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
onepage side by side that lays out four
 
02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
issues that are most important from the
 
02:08:22.470 --> 02:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis perspective
 
02:08:24.470 --> 02:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
big picture we want to have a program
 
02:08:26.510 --> 02:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
that aligns and integrates the
 
02:08:28.589 --> 02:08:28.599 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program with the
 
02:08:31.510 --> 02:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
adult use stores the vision for the
 
02:08:33.390 --> 02:08:33.400 align:start position:0%
franchise model as I understand it is
 
02:08:36.069 --> 02:08:36.079 align:start position:0%
that patients could buy cannabis at the
 
02:08:37.830 --> 02:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
franchise stores which I think would be
 
02:08:39.950 --> 02:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
great it would expand access Statewide
 
02:08:42.030 --> 02:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
Statewide it's access is currently
 
02:08:44.830 --> 02:08:44.840 align:start position:0%
limited to seven dispensary locations so
 
02:08:46.629 --> 02:08:46.639 align:start position:0%
it would be great for patients if we can
 
02:08:48.870 --> 02:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
explain that unfortunately the amendment
 
02:08:50.870 --> 02:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
is completely silent on how those sales
 
02:08:52.910 --> 02:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
are supposed to take place how they're
 
02:08:55.470 --> 02:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
to be regulated there needs to be
 
02:08:57.910 --> 02:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
integration with the current program for
 
02:09:02.149 --> 02:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
that to work at all so I I don't want to
 
02:09:03.629 --> 02:09:03.639 align:start position:0%
sit here and talk I'll definitely not
 
02:09:05.189 --> 02:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
exceed my three minutes I'm happy to
 
02:09:07.589 --> 02:09:07.599 align:start position:0%
answer questions I'll be here tomorrow
 
02:09:09.310 --> 02:09:09.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time and
 
02:09:11.189 --> 02:09:11.199 align:start position:0%

you seeing no questions I have uh four
 
02:09:18.109 --> 02:09:18.119 align:start position:0%
more pink cards to speak some of them
 
02:09:21.790 --> 02:09:21.800 align:start position:0%
three to five minutes five minutes 6 to
 
02:09:23.470 --> 02:09:23.480 align:start position:0%
7 minutes 10
 
02:09:26.470 --> 02:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
minutes coming up against my hard stop I
 
02:09:28.990 --> 02:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
want to reduce all those times to about
 
02:09:31.790 --> 02:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
3 and a half minutes so we will be
 
02:09:34.629 --> 02:09:34.639 align:start position:0%
finished by 1:30 and you won't deny
 
02:09:36.790 --> 02:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
otherwise I will have to recess this
 
02:09:39.669 --> 02:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
till next Monday be finished by 12:30
 
02:09:41.790 --> 02:09:41.800 align:start position:0%

and I'm here to today just to speak um
 
02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
to the amendment but we're not taking a
 
02:10:26.750 --> 02:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
position either way on the amendment or
 
02:10:30.629 --> 02:10:30.639 align:start position:0%
the bill uh at this point um just a
 
02:10:33.270 --> 02:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
couple of points that Research indicates
 
02:10:35.149 --> 02:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
that people with mental illness report
 
02:10:37.830 --> 02:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
using marijuana at a rate of at least
 
02:10:39.589 --> 02:10:39.599 align:start position:0%
twice that of people without mental
 
02:10:42.270 --> 02:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
illness there's documented correlation
 
02:10:43.990 --> 02:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
between cannabis use and the onset of
 
02:10:45.629 --> 02:10:45.639 align:start position:0%
schizophrenia and other psychotic
 
02:10:48.629 --> 02:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
disorders and especially in Young Folks
 
02:10:51.430 --> 02:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
um who start using in either their teen
 
02:10:54.030 --> 02:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
late teens or early 20s and for young
 
02:10:56.709 --> 02:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
adults in particular cannabis use cont
 
02:10:58.549 --> 02:10:58.559 align:start position:0%
can contribute to symptoms of mood
 
02:11:01.470 --> 02:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
disorder anxiety and psychosis and may
 
02:11:04.030 --> 02:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
Hassen the emergence of these disorders
 
02:11:06.589 --> 02:11:06.599 align:start position:0%
um and and because of that uh we are
 
02:11:09.229 --> 02:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
here today just to talk about um you
 
02:11:11.549 --> 02:11:11.559 align:start position:0%
know the responsibility around this bill
 
02:11:14.030 --> 02:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
and what New Hampshire needs to do and
 
02:11:16.270 --> 02:11:16.280 align:start position:0%
put in place to make sure that we as
 
02:11:18.149 --> 02:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
Michelle Meritt um mentioned reduce the
 
02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
harms as much as possible um just a
 
02:11:25.709 --> 02:11:25.719 align:start position:0%
couple of things um we also support
 
02:11:27.910 --> 02:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
increasing the allocation to the
 
02:11:30.430 --> 02:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
substance use prevention and treatment
 
02:11:32.830 --> 02:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
Recovery Fund to a minimum of 20% but
 
02:11:36.589 --> 02:11:36.599 align:start position:0%
we're also um suggesting that there be a
 
02:11:39.510 --> 02:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
requirement that 50% of those funds be
 
02:11:41.149 --> 02:11:41.159 align:start position:0%
allocated to the use of mental health
 
02:11:43.030 --> 02:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
prevention treatment and recovery and
 
02:11:44.350 --> 02:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
that's mental health treatment whether
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
it is co-occurring or not co-occurring
 
02:11:48.549 --> 02:11:48.559 align:start position:0%
with a substance use disorder um we know
 
02:11:50.990 --> 02:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
that some of these folks try marijuana
 
02:11:54.589 --> 02:11:54.599 align:start position:0%
one and then they have psychosis and so
 
02:11:56.549 --> 02:11:56.559 align:start position:0%
therefore we want to make sure that
 
02:11:59.430 --> 02:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
there is some funding available to
 
02:12:01.229 --> 02:12:01.239 align:start position:0%
assist the Community Mental Health
 
02:12:03.390 --> 02:12:03.400 align:start position:0%
Centers and the hospitals with treating
 
02:12:06.470 --> 02:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
these folks um and then the other
 
02:12:09.870 --> 02:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
suggestion that we had um is that
 
02:12:12.709 --> 02:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
there's language in the amendment um
 
02:12:15.189 --> 02:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
that talks about uh funding being used
 
02:12:17.109 --> 02:12:17.119 align:start position:0%
just for co-occurring disorders and we
 
02:12:19.149 --> 02:12:19.159 align:start position:0%
have a suggestion that that be changed
 
02:12:22.069 --> 02:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
in the written testimony I have a
 
02:12:24.430 --> 02:12:24.440 align:start position:0%
suggestion on the back so when you
 
02:12:26.069 --> 02:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
receive that you can take a look at that
 
02:12:28.549 --> 02:12:28.559 align:start position:0%
and um with that um I will just take any
 
02:12:31.149 --> 02:12:31.159 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have thank
 
02:12:33.990 --> 02:12:34.000 align:start position:0%

02:12:36.950 --> 02:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
hle yes thank you um the studies that
 
02:12:38.830 --> 02:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
you mentioned is it a correlation or is
 
02:12:41.149 --> 02:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
there a causation at the at the root
 
02:12:44.669 --> 02:12:44.679 align:start position:0%
level what we're with the study that we
 
02:12:48.229 --> 02:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:51.229 --> 02:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
causation thank you and written test
 
02:12:53.030 --> 02:12:53.040 align:start position:0%

you good morning Mr chairman members of
 
02:13:14.069 --> 02:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
community name is Mike mlof represent
 
02:13:17.430 --> 02:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
Sanu arec and I will not try to Echo the
 
02:13:18.990 --> 02:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
comments of Matt Simon will point out a
 
02:13:22.069 --> 02:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
couple of things uh and Hampshire is in
 
02:13:24.430 --> 02:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
the marijuana sales business it has been
 
02:13:28.350 --> 02:13:28.360 align:start position:0%
for seven years it has been with seven
 
02:13:29.870 --> 02:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
different locations throughout the state
 
02:13:32.229 --> 02:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
selling therapeutic products very
 
02:13:35.750 --> 02:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
successfully uh the bills we see today
 
02:13:38.149 --> 02:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
and the amendment seem to look at
 
02:13:40.669 --> 02:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
creation of something that doesn't exist
 
02:13:42.589 --> 02:13:42.599 align:start position:0%
it does exist and the New Hampshire ATC
 
02:13:43.790 --> 02:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
should be
 
02:13:46.629 --> 02:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
involved uh this amendment today from
 
02:13:49.030 --> 02:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire in one of the early
 
02:13:51.069 --> 02:13:51.079 align:start position:0%
paragraphs points out that an
 
02:13:52.750 --> 02:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment center shall not
 
02:13:55.629 --> 02:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
hold a retail license to sell cannabis
 
02:13:58.790 --> 02:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
products yet later in the same Amendment
 
02:14:00.430 --> 02:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
they ask the alternative treatment
 
02:14:02.549 --> 02:14:02.559 align:start position:0%
centers to sell their products to
 
02:14:04.750 --> 02:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
franchise retail outlets so they're
 
02:14:06.589 --> 02:14:06.599 align:start position:0%
basically asking us to sell to the
 
02:14:08.629 --> 02:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
competition and help put us out of
 
02:14:11.470 --> 02:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
business when a when a state
 
02:14:14.549 --> 02:14:14.559 align:start position:0%
incorporates retail sales into uh a
 
02:14:16.669 --> 02:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
therapeutic Market there's a traditional
 
02:14:21.390 --> 02:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
30 40% drop in activity so this
 
02:14:22.950 --> 02:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
amendment basically
 
02:14:25.950 --> 02:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
says uh keep working as a therapeutic
 
02:14:28.669 --> 02:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
center give your products to other
 
02:14:30.910 --> 02:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
people as you watch your business
 
02:14:33.069 --> 02:14:33.079 align:start position:0%
decline it just is
 
02:14:35.350 --> 02:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
nonsensical in addition further on in
 
02:14:37.390 --> 02:14:37.400 align:start position:0%
the amendment they talk about how being
 
02:14:39.709 --> 02:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
an alternative treatment center should
 
02:14:42.830 --> 02:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
allow you to have a oneup on getting a
 
02:14:45.750 --> 02:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
license uh so we'll work on this
 
02:14:47.629 --> 02:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
hopefully in the committee but it just
 
02:14:49.229 --> 02:14:49.239 align:start position:0%
you're looking at a business that's
 
02:14:51.510 --> 02:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
existed in the state selling therapeutic
 
02:14:54.470 --> 02:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
marijuana products successfully that's
 
02:14:56.549 --> 02:14:56.559 align:start position:0%
now being asked in this amendment to
 
02:14:58.270 --> 02:14:58.280 align:start position:0%
stay out of the business that they know
 
02:15:01.390 --> 02:15:01.400 align:start position:0%
best and that's how I will end my
 
02:15:03.430 --> 02:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
remarks thank you for cutting through
 
02:15:05.470 --> 02:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
all that thank you any questions I'll be
 
02:15:07.910 --> 02:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
happy any questions seeing
 
02:15:11.189 --> 02:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
none next call on Daryl Ames I have the
 
02:15:12.790 --> 02:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
next two cards one is New Hampshire
 
02:15:14.830 --> 02:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis Association the other one is
 
02:15:17.030 --> 02:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire cannabis party he will
 
02:15:18.669 --> 02:15:18.679 align:start position:0%
tell us what's the difference between
 
02:15:21.669 --> 02:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
those two groups thank you uh my name is
 
02:15:23.030 --> 02:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
darl eem I'm the founder of the New
 
02:15:25.750 --> 02:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cannabis Association and in my
 
02:15:27.870 --> 02:15:27.880 align:start position:0%
duties the last six years I've been
 
02:15:30.149 --> 02:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
speaking with residents in governmental
 
02:15:31.910 --> 02:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
and non-governmental organizations all
 
02:15:34.030 --> 02:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the state I speak with
 
02:15:36.109 --> 02:15:36.119 align:start position:0%
associations all around the country and
 
02:15:39.350 --> 02:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
in my professional uh duties I as a
 
02:15:40.950 --> 02:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
consultant in the space I speak with
 
02:15:42.990 --> 02:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
hundreds of operators every year all
 
02:15:45.589 --> 02:15:45.599 align:start position:0%
around the country and the one thing I
 
02:15:47.910 --> 02:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
want to kind of say today is that we we
 
02:15:50.069 --> 02:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
oppose this amendment because structures
 
02:15:52.750 --> 02:15:52.760 align:start position:0%
matter and what the real balance of what
 
02:15:55.629 --> 02:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
we're you're being asked to do is to uh
 
02:15:57.510 --> 02:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
balance the state's direct involvement
 
02:16:01.270 --> 02:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
in plant touching activities against um
 
02:16:04.229 --> 02:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
Federal intervention along with Public
 
02:16:08.069 --> 02:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
Safety the uh health of the atcs and a
 
02:16:09.910 --> 02:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
structure and foundation for an industry
 
02:16:11.790 --> 02:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
where they can The Operators can be
 
02:16:13.830 --> 02:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
successful and to the representative's
 
02:16:16.510 --> 02:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
question about that the franchise model
 
02:16:18.549 --> 02:16:18.559 align:start position:0%
actually lowers the bar for federal
 
02:16:21.149 --> 02:16:21.159 align:start position:0%
Intervention when you have uh on one
 
02:16:22.790 --> 02:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
side traditional models that that seek
 
02:16:25.030 --> 02:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
to insulate the state by limiting their
 
02:16:27.470 --> 02:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
exposure to plant touching activities on
 
02:16:28.990 --> 02:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
the other end of that Spectrum you have
 
02:16:30.629 --> 02:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
state run stores where you are the
 
02:16:32.389 --> 02:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
business and in the middle you have a
 
02:16:35.629 --> 02:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
franchise and agency model uh the state
 
02:16:37.509 --> 02:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
run stores is kind of a nebulous thre
 
02:16:39.230 --> 02:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
threat from the federal government if
 
02:16:41.150 --> 02:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
they decide some agency somewhere could
 
02:16:43.230 --> 02:16:43.240 align:start position:0%
come and take action uh if you're a
 
02:16:44.990 --> 02:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
franchise you are putting the state of
 
02:16:46.750 --> 02:16:46.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire directly under the purview
 
02:16:48.349 --> 02:16:48.359 align:start position:0%
of the Federal Trade Commission and the
 
02:16:50.950 --> 02:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
federal franchise regulations which
 
02:16:53.389 --> 02:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
means in theory a potential that if a
 
02:16:55.230 --> 02:16:55.240 align:start position:0%
franchisee decided that they were being
 
02:16:56.990 --> 02:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
treated unfairly they could Lodge a
 
02:16:59.429 --> 02:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
complaint with the FTC and if the FTC
 
02:17:01.389 --> 02:17:01.399 align:start position:0%
finds it has Merit they could launch a
 
02:17:02.950 --> 02:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
federal investigation into the state of
 
02:17:05.589 --> 02:17:05.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that's very concrete but
 
02:17:07.990 --> 02:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
let's just talk about the how the vision
 
02:17:11.070 --> 02:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
of these structures play out in reality
 
02:17:13.990 --> 02:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
HB 1633 is the culmination of many years
 
02:17:15.709 --> 02:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
and dozens of people working on a bill
 
02:17:18.750 --> 02:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
to try and balance these requirements in
 
02:17:20.469 --> 02:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
contrast the amendment reads like it was
 
02:17:22.349 --> 02:17:22.359 align:start position:0%
written by a handful of people for one
 
02:17:24.309 --> 02:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
person so let's walk through some of
 
02:17:27.429 --> 02:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
this so HB 1633 provides flexibility and
 
02:17:28.990 --> 02:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
pricing to balance supply and demand
 
02:17:30.669 --> 02:17:30.679 align:start position:0%
signals in the market so retailers can
 
02:17:32.870 --> 02:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
stay competitive the other states not
 
02:17:34.349 --> 02:17:34.359 align:start position:0%
that the commission can simply consult
 
02:17:36.030 --> 02:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
on price but rather that the commission
 
02:17:38.030 --> 02:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
has and I quote the final authority to
 
02:17:39.910 --> 02:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
set the price of all cannabis products
 
02:17:42.030 --> 02:17:42.040 align:start position:0%
sold in a retail store in the private
 
02:17:44.270 --> 02:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
Market we call this price fixing one
 
02:17:45.469 --> 02:17:45.479 align:start position:0%
bill understands that vertically
 
02:17:47.270 --> 02:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
integrated companies may want to co
 
02:17:49.190 --> 02:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
collocate cultivation or manufacturing
 
02:17:50.790 --> 02:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
with retail if allowed in their mun
 
02:17:52.990 --> 02:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
municipality to reduce cost and risk the
 
02:17:54.509 --> 02:17:54.519 align:start position:0%
other actually forbids retail
 
02:17:57.070 --> 02:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
collocation entirely even if it's legal
 
02:17:58.429 --> 02:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
one bill believes medical patient
 
02:17:59.709 --> 02:17:59.719 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be burden with paying another
 
02:18:01.830 --> 02:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
12 a half% the amendment believes that
 
02:18:03.830 --> 02:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's perfectly acceptable one bill of
 
02:18:05.950 --> 02:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
used The Advisory Board as an an asset
 
02:18:08.469 --> 02:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
to help these new operators uh with
 
02:18:10.030 --> 02:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
things like education and funding and
 
02:18:11.830 --> 02:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
act as a conduit for communication on
 
02:18:12.990 --> 02:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
what is and isn't working to the
 
02:18:15.990 --> 02:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
commission the other reads like a Liquor
 
02:18:19.349 --> 02:18:19.359 align:start position:0%
Commission Advisory Board they let's
 
02:18:20.509 --> 02:18:20.519 align:start position:0%
take a peek at it they have the chair of
 
02:18:21.830 --> 02:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
the Li commission I'm pretty sure the
 
02:18:23.230 --> 02:18:23.240 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission talks to The Liquor
 
02:18:25.030 --> 02:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
Commission they've got the president of
 
02:18:27.190 --> 02:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
the associations of chiefs of police uh
 
02:18:28.389 --> 02:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
some random member of the public
 
02:18:29.990 --> 02:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor a state
 
02:18:31.790 --> 02:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
senator and State Rep these are all
 
02:18:33.750 --> 02:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
people who can talk to the commission
 
02:18:35.950 --> 02:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
currently and and that's it it's going
 
02:18:38.230 --> 02:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
to set it up as a politicized adversary
 
02:18:39.990 --> 02:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
to the industry on top of the Liquor
 
02:18:41.309 --> 02:18:41.319 align:start position:0%
Commission and their
 
02:18:44.389 --> 02:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
regulation uh one bill provides clear
 
02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
legislative intent to ensure our medical
 
02:18:48.070 --> 02:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
cannabis industry has a path to survival
 
02:18:49.509 --> 02:18:49.519 align:start position:0%
the other creates a high risk that our
 
02:18:51.990 --> 02:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
medical industry will crumble one bill
 
02:18:53.629 --> 02:18:53.639 align:start position:0%
allows municipalities in partnership
 
02:18:55.070 --> 02:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
with private owners to determine their
 
02:18:57.110 --> 02:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
location one bill puts that decision
 
02:18:59.110 --> 02:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
solely up to the commission end up
 
02:19:01.709 --> 02:19:01.719 align:start position:0%
choosing a location that doesn't work
 
02:19:03.030 --> 02:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
too bad you're not going to have the
 
02:19:04.870 --> 02:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
right to move without uh approval even
 
02:19:06.509 --> 02:19:06.519 align:start position:0%
if you're working with an opted in
 
02:19:08.549 --> 02:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
municipality one bill understands the
 
02:19:11.429 --> 02:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
size nature and Le of the facilities is
 
02:19:13.070 --> 02:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
a consideration for the private owner in
 
02:19:15.429 --> 02:19:15.439 align:start position:0%
the municipality the other one the
 
02:19:17.349 --> 02:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission will will basically
 
02:19:19.589 --> 02:19:19.599 align:start position:0%
stipulate what your layout is one bill
 
02:19:21.349 --> 02:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
Embraces the Nuance of lands that are
 
02:19:23.190 --> 02:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
both public and private and strikes a
 
02:19:26.070 --> 02:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
balance if you own land that that has
 
02:19:28.750 --> 02:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
incurred use is that public or private
 
02:19:29.950 --> 02:19:29.960 align:start position:0%
well the other bill doesn't even
 
02:19:32.030 --> 02:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
approach that one bill slightly
 
02:19:33.349 --> 02:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
increases the penalties for public
 
02:19:35.030 --> 02:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
consumption we've heard this amendment
 
02:19:38.190 --> 02:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
really ramps it up even more uh one the
 
02:19:39.669 --> 02:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
amendment also declares the commission
 
02:19:41.589 --> 02:19:41.599 align:start position:0%
shall have the primary responsibility
 
02:19:43.230 --> 02:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
for enforcement of all cannabis laws
 
02:19:45.509 --> 02:19:45.519 align:start position:0%
including any trafficking uh quote from
 
02:19:46.990 --> 02:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
an article in the last several years
 
02:19:48.830 --> 02:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
Chinese backed marijuana operations have
 
02:19:50.270 --> 02:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
cropped up across the United States
 
02:19:52.150 --> 02:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
including major drug bus in New Mexico
 
02:19:55.230 --> 02:19:55.240 align:start position:0%
in Maine in Maine alone border patrol
 
02:19:58.230 --> 02:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
has reportedly identified at least 270
 
02:19:59.910 --> 02:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
illegal marijuana grow operations
 
02:20:02.110 --> 02:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
throughout the state I'm very concerned
 
02:20:03.030 --> 02:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
that they might not have the
 
02:20:04.910 --> 02:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
capabilities to handle that the
 
02:20:06.270 --> 02:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
amendment envisions the commission have
 
02:20:08.030 --> 02:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
a primary responsibility enforcement of
 
02:20:09.670 --> 02:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
all cannabis laws I saw nothing in the
 
02:20:10.870 --> 02:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
amendment of whether they have to
 
02:20:12.389 --> 02:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
actually notify any jurisdictions
 
02:20:14.429 --> 02:20:14.439 align:start position:0%
they're going into the amendment also
 
02:20:17.429 --> 02:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
provides that that 10% uh bonus in the
 
02:20:19.590 --> 02:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
private sector you might hire more
 
02:20:20.950 --> 02:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
people you might have something that's
 
02:20:22.710 --> 02:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
more goal- based they're just saying
 
02:20:24.910 --> 02:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
here's 10% for for coming in working on
 
02:20:27.469 --> 02:20:27.479 align:start position:0%
this the vision of this amendment really
 
02:20:29.389 --> 02:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
strikes me as something for the wealthy
 
02:20:31.510 --> 02:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
and the connected all right if I were
 
02:20:33.270 --> 02:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
setting the stage for something like
 
02:20:35.190 --> 02:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
that that's probably exactly the bill
 
02:20:37.590 --> 02:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
that I would that I would write um and I
 
02:20:39.030 --> 02:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
would say you know there's risk in any
 
02:20:40.429 --> 02:20:40.439 align:start position:0%
industry there's going to be a
 
02:20:42.670 --> 02:20:42.680 align:start position:0%
consolidation right a ramp up a
 
02:20:46.630 --> 02:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
consolidation in an evening um and can
 
02:20:48.630 --> 02:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
you finish yes I can and I would say
 
02:20:51.190 --> 02:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
this as the last thing um representative
 
02:20:54.270 --> 02:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
Maguire mentioned last week that he who
 
02:20:58.230 --> 02:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
cares the least has the most power and I
 
02:21:00.510 --> 02:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
there's some definite wisdom in that I
 
02:21:01.990 --> 02:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
would just say that some of us care
 
02:21:03.630 --> 02:21:03.640 align:start position:0%
enough that it's better to see a good
 
02:21:05.630 --> 02:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
bill die than it is to see a bad bill
 
02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
become law this amendment should never
 
02:21:09.389 --> 02:21:09.399 align:start position:0%
see the light of day out of this
 
02:21:10.910 --> 02:21:10.920 align:start position:0%

02:22:25.950 --> 02:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
withstanding the dangers of the proposed
 
02:22:27.790 --> 02:22:27.800 align:start position:0%
cannabis franchise model which I will
 
02:22:30.349 --> 02:22:30.359 align:start position:0%
Briefly summarize the non- gerain
 
02:22:32.150 --> 02:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
amendment before us is nothing more than
 
02:22:34.469 --> 02:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
a corrupt and cynical political zombie
 
02:22:37.110 --> 02:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
Trojan Horse it's designed and intended
 
02:22:39.710 --> 02:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
to fail and to blow up in our faces I am
 
02:22:42.469 --> 02:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
not going to detail here and now why and
 
02:22:44.030 --> 02:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
how this is the case but for those who
 
02:22:45.389 --> 02:22:45.399 align:start position:0%
are interested in the underlying
 
02:22:47.910 --> 02:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
political motivation of promoting this
 
02:22:49.830 --> 02:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
model to the exclusion of Common Sense
 
02:22:51.990 --> 02:22:52.000 align:start position:0%

02:22:54.429 --> 02:22:54.439 align:start position:0%

02:23:13.309 --> 02:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
officially notified last November of the
 
02:23:15.389 --> 02:23:15.399 align:start position:0%
lack of legal viability and extreme
 
02:23:17.790 --> 02:23:17.800 align:start position:0%

a copy of that email notice including a

02:23:31.590 --> 02:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
note find in the package an excerpted

additional details on the risks of

non-implementation due to federal law
 
02:23:49.269 --> 02:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
and of high possible Financial costs to
 
02:23:52.230 --> 02:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire due to to vulnerability to
 
02:23:54.630 --> 02:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
litigation cannabis is currently a
 
02:23:57.110 --> 02:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
federally illegal and prohibited DEA

02:24:01.469 --> 02:24:01.479 align:start position:0%
its possession use and commerce is
 
02:24:04.030 --> 02:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
considered criminal activity a criminal
 
02:24:06.590 --> 02:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
Enterprise cannot offer franchises of
 
02:24:09.830 --> 02:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:12.349 --> 02:24:12.359 align:start position:0%
model claiming not to be directly
 
02:24:13.870 --> 02:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
involved in the business of selling
 
02:24:15.670 --> 02:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
cannabis because one is merely a
 
02:24:18.469 --> 02:24:18.479 align:start position:0%
franchisor is as utterly ridiculous as
 
02:24:19.950 --> 02:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
McDonald's claiming it's not in the
 
02:24:21.630 --> 02:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
business of selling hamburgers because
 
02:24:24.429 --> 02:24:24.439 align:start position:0%
it has franchisees it is quite possible
 
02:24:25.990 --> 02:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
a court could find that the state
 
02:24:28.590 --> 02:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
franchising Cannabis stores must entail
 
02:24:30.590 --> 02:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
a conspiracy to sell cannabis in
 
02:24:32.990 --> 02:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
violation of federal law or aiding and
 
02:24:35.150 --> 02:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
abetting the sale of cannabis a court
 
02:24:36.790 --> 02:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
could rule an agent setting up a
 
02:24:39.070 --> 02:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
franchise cannot fulfill his obligation
 
02:24:41.630 --> 02:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
under state law and simultaneously heed
 
02:24:43.110 --> 02:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
the federal ban on Distributing
 
02:24:45.590 --> 02:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
marijuana and that the law is thus
 
02:24:48.230 --> 02:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
preempted if a state worker's job is to
 
02:24:49.790 --> 02:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
sell cannabis the state would be
 
02:24:52.830 --> 02:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
directing them to commit a federal crime
 
02:24:55.510 --> 02:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
in 2017 a federal district court in
 
02:24:57.790 --> 02:24:57.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts dismissed a RICO case
 
02:25:00.230 --> 02:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
against the defendant Bank on grounds
 
02:25:01.910 --> 02:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
that merely providing customary
 
02:25:04.710 --> 02:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
Financial Services to a state Li State
 
02:25:07.870 --> 02:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
LC albeit operating in violation of
 
02:25:10.389 --> 02:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
federal law did not rise to the level of
 
02:25:12.070 --> 02:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
Direction in and control of the
 
02:25:14.950 --> 02:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
Enterprise to implicate Rico liability
 
02:25:17.630 --> 02:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
as a codefendant this reasoning allows
 
02:25:19.550 --> 02:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
states to regulate cannabis industry
 
02:25:21.630 --> 02:25:21.640 align:start position:0%
operators as a customary government
 
02:25:23.550 --> 02:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
function so long as they are not
 
02:25:25.269 --> 02:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
substantially involved in the operation
 
02:25:27.990 --> 02:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
and direction of the business itself
 
02:25:29.830 --> 02:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
however the franchise model proposed by
 
02:25:32.030 --> 02:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission Envision envisions
 
02:25:33.990 --> 02:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
quite the opposite as they would be
 
02:25:36.429 --> 02:25:36.439 align:start position:0%
enforcing strict standards in almost
 
02:25:38.870 --> 02:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
every aspect of franchisee operations
 
02:25:41.230 --> 02:25:41.240 align:start position:0%
Direction and practices enacting this
 
02:25:43.710 --> 02:25:43.720 align:start position:0%
scheme could easily invite multiple Rico
 
02:25:45.830 --> 02:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
based private litigations as well as
 
02:25:48.469 --> 02:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
public prosecution the distinction may
 
02:25:51.190 --> 02:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
seem puzzling but a legalizing and
 
02:25:53.269 --> 02:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
regulating conduct is legally different
 
02:25:54.630 --> 02:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
from the state entering into a
 
02:25:56.309 --> 02:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
commercial relationship to commit
 
02:25:56.319 --> 02:25:57.670 align:start position:0%
commercial relationship to commit
federal

02:25:57.670 --> 02:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
federal
 
02:26:00.710 --> 02:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
crimes there are also burdens to being a
 
02:26:03.070 --> 02:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
franchisor the commission and the state
 
02:26:04.910 --> 02:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
as franchisor would be subject to
 
02:26:06.870 --> 02:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
Federal jurisdiction penalties and
 
02:26:08.670 --> 02:26:08.680 align:start position:0%
investigations the Federal Trade
 
02:26:10.990 --> 02:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
commission's franchise rule imposes
 
02:26:13.590 --> 02:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
obligations on franchise ores including
 
02:26:16.750 --> 02:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
a 23p part legal disclosure the FTC
 
02:26:19.030 --> 02:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
defines a franchise as any continuing

02:26:30.750 --> 02:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
to exert a significant degree of control
 
02:26:33.389 --> 02:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
over the franchisees method of operation
 
02:26:35.469 --> 02:26:35.479 align:start position:0%
or provide significant assistance to the
 
02:26:37.349 --> 02:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
franchisees method of
 
02:26:40.230 --> 02:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
operation a franchisor is not always
 
02:26:43.110 --> 02:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
liable for the actions of a franchisee
 
02:26:45.510 --> 02:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
the plaintiff must prove actual agency
 
02:26:47.750 --> 02:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
or apparent agency but the level of
 
02:26:49.550 --> 02:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
control and involvement envisioned by
 
02:26:51.349 --> 02:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
the commission and its franchise model
 
02:26:53.190 --> 02:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
makes it likely that a court could find
 
02:26:56.309 --> 02:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
either type of agency even unsuccessful
 
02:26:57.870 --> 02:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
litigation can be a significant

financial drain Andor delay program
 
02:27:03.670 --> 02:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
implementation indefinitely with all of
 
02:27:05.590 --> 02:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
the potential and likely civil and
 
02:27:07.790 --> 02:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
criminal consequences of either a state
 
02:27:10.030 --> 02:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
Monopoly or franchise model while
 
02:27:12.030 --> 02:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis remains a federally controlled
 
02:27:14.349 --> 02:27:14.359 align:start position:0%
and prohibited substance bear in mind
 
02:27:16.190 --> 02:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
that enacting the proposed franchise
 
02:27:18.469 --> 02:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
model would subject both the state with
 
02:27:20.510 --> 02:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
its Deep Pockets as well as the elected
 
02:27:22.469 --> 02:27:22.479 align:start position:0%
leadership and our state employees to

03:05:46.630 --> 03:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:46.640 --> 03:06:16.550 align:start position:0%

e

03:07:18.590 --> 03:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
e
 
03:07:22.469 --> 03:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
committee exec session we have 10 bills
 
03:07:25.309 --> 03:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
have some people missing that I try to
 
03:07:25.319 --> 03:07:26.910 align:start position:0%
have some people missing that I try to
accommodate

03:07:26.910 --> 03:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
accommodate
 
03:07:29.910 --> 03:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
so what I'll do is take up the bills
 
03:07:32.469 --> 03:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
that were non-controversial
 
03:07:35.510 --> 03:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
first if the committee will indulge so
 
03:07:37.550 --> 03:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
we won't have we'll get through those
 
03:07:39.710 --> 03:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
quickly and and know we're done with

those
 
03:07:44.870 --> 03:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
and so that's what I want to do until
 
03:07:46.710 --> 03:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
whoever gone to the Senate can get back
 
03:07:48.030 --> 03:07:48.040 align:start position:0%

second thank you got him in my ear
 
03:08:31.349 --> 03:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
oh uh this bill requires lobbyists to
 
03:08:33.309 --> 03:08:33.319 align:start position:0%
identify clients and income received
 
03:08:35.229 --> 03:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
from lobbying activity it also
 
03:08:37.070 --> 03:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
authorizes the Secretary of State to
 
03:08:40.150 --> 03:08:40.160 align:start position:0%
enforce lobbyist statement requirements
 
03:08:42.750 --> 03:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
uh there's really no true large fiscal
 
03:08:44.630 --> 03:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
impact to this bill I actually think we

amendment motion or
 
03:11:56.870 --> 03:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
a we've been passed an amendment I think
 
03:11:59.150 --> 03:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
we got to pass the amendment first sorry
 
03:12:01.349 --> 03:12:01.359 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to uh make a motion to adopt
 
03:12:05.990 --> 03:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1037 H to HB
 
03:12:08.950 --> 03:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
1570 is there a second
 
03:12:11.550 --> 03:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
second and I can speak to the amendment
 
03:12:14.229 --> 03:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
all right you're recognized uh the this
 
03:12:16.830 --> 03:12:16.840 align:start position:0%
bill came to us with a $5 million price
 
03:12:16.840 --> 03:12:17.710 align:start position:0%
bill came to us with a $5 million price
tag

03:12:17.710 --> 03:12:17.720 align:start position:0%
tag
 
03:12:20.670 --> 03:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
in order to go out and take a physical
 
03:12:24.030 --> 03:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
inventory of of all the school buildings
 
03:12:24.990 --> 03:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:12:28.910 --> 03:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
State uh we decided uh maybe we don't
 
03:12:31.229 --> 03:12:31.239 align:start position:0%
want to spend $5 million on this right
 
03:12:34.110 --> 03:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
about now midterm uh because it sounds
 
03:12:35.870 --> 03:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
more like a budgeted item so we took the
 
03:12:40.030 --> 03:12:40.040 align:start position:0%
money out but we wanted to give some
 
03:12:41.990 --> 03:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
ability for the Department of Education
 
03:12:44.710 --> 03:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
to continue to go down this path because
 
03:12:46.510 --> 03:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
it was a general consensus it's not a
 
03:12:48.990 --> 03:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
bad idea
 
03:12:51.630 --> 03:12:51.640 align:start position:0%
however without any money they they
 
03:12:53.870 --> 03:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
really can't do the work because the
 
03:12:56.950 --> 03:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
idea is to hire a consultant and we have
 
03:12:59.950 --> 03:12:59.960 align:start position:0%
33,000 square feet I it's a lot of
 
03:13:02.030 --> 03:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
square feet and you pay so much per
 
03:13:03.950 --> 03:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
square foot for all these
 
03:13:06.510 --> 03:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
evaluations so what what this amendment
 
03:13:09.309 --> 03:13:09.319 align:start position:0%
does is we we decided that the
 
03:13:10.990 --> 03:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Education should be able
 
03:13:13.349 --> 03:13:13.359 align:start position:0%
to go to fiscal committee and request
 
03:13:17.510 --> 03:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
funds once they have a contract or RFP
 
03:13:20.830 --> 03:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
out and some replies back and do it the
 
03:13:24.190 --> 03:13:24.200 align:start position:0%
right way uh so what the but they didn't
 
03:13:25.830 --> 03:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
have the ability to go the fiscal
 
03:13:28.670 --> 03:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
committee so what the amendment does the
 
03:13:31.630 --> 03:13:31.640 align:start position:0%
uh Amendment uh
 
03:13:33.950 --> 03:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
137h it gives the Department of
 
03:13:35.830 --> 03:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
Education the ability to go to fiscal
 
03:13:38.229 --> 03:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
committee and ask for money that's all
 
03:13:41.309 --> 03:13:41.319 align:start position:0%
it does it's so it's not changing the
 
03:13:42.950 --> 03:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
idea that we're not going to fund it
 
03:13:45.190 --> 03:13:45.200 align:start position:0%
it's changing the idea that they can go
 
03:13:48.110 --> 03:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
get funds as they move down the
 
03:13:48.120 --> 03:13:49.630 align:start position:0%
get funds as they move down the
road

03:13:49.630 --> 03:13:49.640 align:start position:0%
road
 
03:13:54.110 --> 03:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:57.190 --> 03:13:57.200 align:start position:0%

H further discussion uh yes may I sir
 
03:18:39.469 --> 03:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
sir uh so uh this this bill uh was
 
03:18:41.510 --> 03:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
pretty non-controversial this came out
 
03:18:44.349 --> 03:18:44.359 align:start position:0%
of uh the committee uh the the policy
 
03:18:46.990 --> 03:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
committee 13 to nothing and um and
 
03:18:50.030 --> 03:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
passed easily in the house it closes a
 
03:18:53.349 --> 03:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
loophole in cases where a child turns 18
 
03:18:57.269 --> 03:18:57.279 align:start position:0%
while in school uh but then does not
 
03:19:00.110 --> 03:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
graduate U so this this would allow

their social security benefits um to be
 
03:19:05.030 --> 03:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
managed in a way that's consistent with
 
03:19:07.150 --> 03:19:07.160 align:start position:0%
the duration of the child support and
 
03:19:09.590 --> 03:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
close the
 
03:19:13.469 --> 03:19:13.479 align:start position:0%
loophole this uh was recommended for uh
 
03:19:17.590 --> 03:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
passage 9 Nothing by division 3
 
03:19:21.150 --> 03:19:21.160 align:start position:0%

leave today does that have money uh can
 
03:21:00.070 --> 03:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
this go on consent there's no money
 
03:21:01.389 --> 03:21:01.399 align:start position:0%
spent in this
 
03:21:04.389 --> 03:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
budget but it's in the it's in the but
 
03:21:06.030 --> 03:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
it goes forward to the next someone
 
03:21:08.670 --> 03:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
could argue that yes it spends money but
 
03:21:12.469 --> 03:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
not now right okay so probably regular
 
03:21:15.750 --> 03:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
calendar to avoid any okay we could
 
03:21:18.070 --> 03:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
probably just do Pi on that the single
 
03:21:23.830 --> 03:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
Pi y all right so that's so and and uh
 
03:21:26.670 --> 03:21:26.680 align:start position:0%
committee members the likely effect of
 
03:21:30.590 --> 03:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
what's been going on by the uh speaker
 
03:21:33.349 --> 03:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
and the clerk is that probably all the
 
03:21:36.189 --> 03:21:36.199 align:start position:0%
finance bills will end up maybe on April
 
03:21:39.269 --> 03:21:39.279 align:start position:0%
11th like 41
 
03:21:42.110 --> 03:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
bills so
 
03:21:45.710 --> 03:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
punishment the the uh procedure I'd like
 
03:21:47.309 --> 03:21:47.319 align:start position:0%
to follow is like what they were doing
 
03:21:48.830 --> 03:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
with election
 
03:21:52.389 --> 03:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
law just having piis and of course these
 
03:21:53.590 --> 03:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
bills we're doing now that are
 
03:21:56.030 --> 03:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
non-controversial they may not even have
 
03:21:59.189 --> 03:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
discussions if they come 23 to Z or 25
 
03:22:01.630 --> 03:22:01.640 align:start position:0%
to Z on a recommendation I expect the
 
03:22:05.950 --> 03:22:05.960 align:start position:0%
speaker will just say all in favor say I
 
03:22:05.960 --> 03:22:07.950 align:start position:0%
speaker will just say all in favor say I
so

03:22:07.950 --> 03:22:07.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:22:11.189 --> 03:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
question I just wondered if that I
 
03:22:12.750 --> 03:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
understand that you want to do just pis
 
03:22:15.590 --> 03:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
but on some of these more complex bills
 
03:22:17.309 --> 03:22:17.319 align:start position:0%
don't you think that we should have more
 
03:22:20.349 --> 03:22:20.359 align:start position:0%
discussion with the full
 
03:22:23.349 --> 03:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
house if if I can't get pis on all of
 
03:22:26.349 --> 03:22:26.359 align:start position:0%
them then we it'll be what it'll be but
 
03:22:28.469 --> 03:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
I think the whole house would appreciate
 
03:22:30.910 --> 03:22:30.920 align:start position:0%
it if there's 41 bills from finance that
 
03:22:33.830 --> 03:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
we do something to expedite them so I'll
 
03:22:37.349 --> 03:22:37.359 align:start position:0%
I'll try to anyone that that wants to do
 
03:22:40.110 --> 03:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
something more uh extensive please let
 
03:22:43.150 --> 03:22:43.160 align:start position:0%
me know so I'll I'll at least give the
 
03:22:44.750 --> 03:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
clerk and this and the speaker some
 
03:22:46.750 --> 03:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
warning that's some of them I'm going to
 
03:22:48.110 --> 03:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
take a little longer but I'm hopeful
 
03:22:51.189 --> 03:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
that I'm hopeful the majority of them
 
03:22:53.150 --> 03:22:53.160 align:start position:0%
can be quick when we have that many
 
03:22:55.030 --> 03:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
bills that people will say oh you people
 
03:22:58.309 --> 03:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
from Finance you like
 
03:23:00.870 --> 03:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
education we don't want that at
 
03:23:04.150 --> 03:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
reputation so so give to give you a
 
03:23:07.030 --> 03:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
heads up sir I expect 1573 is going to
 
03:23:08.349 --> 03:23:08.359 align:start position:0%
require a
 
03:23:11.429 --> 03:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
debate I expect you're
 
03:23:14.030 --> 03:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
right and and some of those I know we
 
03:23:17.710 --> 03:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
can't avoid it but if we can expedite
 
03:23:21.990 --> 03:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
a pretty good portion of our input that
 
03:23:24.870 --> 03:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh the rest of the members of the house
 
03:23:29.110 --> 03:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
will be grateful so that's my hope as
 
03:23:31.389 --> 03:23:31.399 align:start position:0%
well as us we don't want to be there
 
03:23:34.269 --> 03:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
till 10:00 that night either but if all
 
03:23:36.750 --> 03:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
our bills end up in a calendar with
 
03:23:38.790 --> 03:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
dozens of others but the reason for that
 
03:23:41.269 --> 03:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
is most of the second committee bills
 
03:23:42.110 --> 03:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
have a
 
03:23:46.830 --> 03:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
longer um deadline so they'll liable to
 
03:23:49.429 --> 03:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
be a lot at the end we may be in with a
 
03:23:51.950 --> 03:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
bunch of others so just a warning I want
 
03:23:55.389 --> 03:23:55.399 align:start position:0%
to I want to hope to we can um
 
03:23:55.399 --> 03:23:56.830 align:start position:0%
to I want to hope to we can um
accomplish

03:23:56.830 --> 03:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
accomplish
 
03:23:59.990 --> 03:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
so hope for your cooperation thank you
 
03:24:02.550 --> 03:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
all right the next one uh I think we're
 
03:24:05.309 --> 03:24:05.319 align:start position:0%
going we've got the uh three that we had
 
03:24:06.389 --> 03:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
nine to
 
03:24:09.309 --> 03:24:09.319 align:start position:0%
zero and division three you have any you
 
03:24:10.670 --> 03:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
have uh
 
03:24:15.670 --> 03:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
1564 1564 was five to one all right I
 
03:24:17.349 --> 03:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
guess that was
 
03:24:23.870 --> 03:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:28.670 --> 03:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
uh um all right 1564 it's on the back of
 
03:24:32.910 --> 03:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:35.710 --> 03:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
three so representative Mooney do you
 
03:24:38.429 --> 03:24:38.439 align:start position:0%

03:24:40.750 --> 03:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
I would like to move ought to pass on
 
03:24:44.269 --> 03:24:44.279 align:start position:0%
house spill 1564 and I can speak to that
 
03:24:46.830 --> 03:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
motion I'll second
 
03:24:49.189 --> 03:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
all right and you are recognized thank
 
03:24:53.070 --> 03:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
you very much House Bill 16 excuse me
 
03:24:56.229 --> 03:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
1564 uh came out unanimously out of the
 
03:24:58.670 --> 03:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
children and family law committee and
 
03:25:02.110 --> 03:25:02.120 align:start position:0%
then further out of the Full House the
 
03:25:04.910 --> 03:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
bill is a long time
 
03:25:07.269 --> 03:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
incoming adjustments to the child
 
03:25:10.389 --> 03:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
support guidelines were in need and the
 
03:25:12.990 --> 03:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
sponsors of the bill spent an entire
 
03:25:17.070 --> 03:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
summer meeting with Statewide
 
03:25:19.670 --> 03:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
interested vested parties to those that
 
03:25:22.790 --> 03:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
know child support guidelines best those
 
03:25:25.150 --> 03:25:25.160 align:start position:0%
from the legal Community those from uh
 
03:25:27.070 --> 03:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
those from the legislature those from
 
03:25:30.309 --> 03:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
legal assistants those for who are uh
 
03:25:32.870 --> 03:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
parents and so as a result of that this
 
03:25:35.950 --> 03:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
bill was sponsored and so uh seeing as
 
03:25:39.990 --> 03:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
though it is so uh well researched and
 
03:25:42.630 --> 03:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
seeing as though it is so local you'll
 
03:25:44.790 --> 03:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
hear about a competing bill later on
 
03:25:46.750 --> 03:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
today but it is so local
 
03:25:49.750 --> 03:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
to the state I I would recommend an
 
03:25:51.469 --> 03:25:51.479 align:start position:0%
ought to
 
03:25:54.429 --> 03:25:54.439 align:start position:0%
pass further
 
03:25:56.990 --> 03:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
discussion uh it's a little it's a
 
03:25:59.950 --> 03:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
little related um my my comment on this
 
03:26:02.349 --> 03:26:02.359 align:start position:0%
is that uh
 
03:26:06.790 --> 03:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
1564 was so well accepted that we passed
 
03:26:09.469 --> 03:26:09.479 align:start position:0%
it pretty quickly and then what we did
 
03:26:11.429 --> 03:26:11.439 align:start position:0%
was there was a second bill that was
 
03:26:15.590 --> 03:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
very similar to it um uh 1595 and I I
 
03:26:18.910 --> 03:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
won't speak that other than to say that
 
03:26:21.830 --> 03:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
um a small amount of money gets spent in
 
03:26:24.790 --> 03:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
1564 that same amount got repeated in
 
03:26:28.189 --> 03:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
1595 but if we pass both bills we only
 
03:26:31.750 --> 03:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
need one slice of the money and I think
 
03:26:32.870 --> 03:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
that was what
 
03:26:35.349 --> 03:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
$105,000 or something so it's pretty
 
03:26:39.750 --> 03:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
pretty di Minimus so I I support 1564
 
03:26:41.469 --> 03:26:41.479 align:start position:0%
and just want you to have a heads up
 
03:26:45.590 --> 03:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
that $595 is H is pretty tightly related
 
03:26:46.750 --> 03:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
okay and I see
 
03:26:49.910 --> 03:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
tersi and priest made the Motions in in
 
03:26:52.269 --> 03:26:52.279 align:start position:0%

to pass is adopted and we'll be looking
 
03:28:37.590 --> 03:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
for that uh report from representative
 
03:28:40.229 --> 03:28:40.239 align:start position:0%
Mooney who's probably got it written
 
03:28:43.710 --> 03:28:43.720 align:start position:0%
already and I guess this spends money so
 
03:28:48.670 --> 03:28:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:52.229 --> 03:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
okay so if you're looking for input I
 
03:28:56.229 --> 03:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
think 1593 would be doable in this
 
03:29:00.229 --> 03:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
circumstance okay and is this PRI and
 
03:29:02.429 --> 03:29:02.439 align:start position:0%

other than that the uh the base part of
 
03:34:23.150 --> 03:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
the bill stays the
 
03:34:23.160 --> 03:34:25.070 align:start position:0%

otpa out of the division 3 7 to3 uh 6
 
03:34:40.030 --> 03:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
to3 rather and uh I've since I was one
 
03:34:42.790 --> 03:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
of the Nays I've reconsidered my vote
 
03:34:45.349 --> 03:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
and so if we were to revote in division
 
03:34:48.670 --> 03:34:48.680 align:start position:0%
3 it would have been 72 I think I I
 
03:34:51.830 --> 03:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
support the uh the stringam amendment
 
03:34:55.309 --> 03:34:55.319 align:start position:0%

on House Bill 1593 as amended by
Amendment

03:35:40.950 --> 03:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
03:35:44.670 --> 03:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
11618 further discussion string I can
 
03:35:47.590 --> 03:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
just speak briefly this bill was NE
 
03:35:49.870 --> 03:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
necessitated by A disruption to the
 
03:35:52.710 --> 03:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
developmental Services Program and it
 
03:35:54.670 --> 03:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
was caused by an unannounced change in
 
03:35:57.189 --> 03:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
the list of eligible Services during
 
03:36:00.269 --> 03:36:00.279 align:start position:0%
this budget cycle individuals previously
 
03:36:03.630 --> 03:36:03.640 align:start position:0%
rece receiving services like bowling
 
03:36:05.830 --> 03:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
swimming and karate and other activities
 
03:36:08.429 --> 03:36:08.439 align:start position:0%
that promote socialization with the
 
03:36:10.910 --> 03:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
general public and help Advance health
 
03:36:13.590 --> 03:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
and safety goals are no longer part of
 
03:36:15.590 --> 03:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
the developmental disability Medicaid
 
03:36:18.349 --> 03:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
waiver program uh so in essence these
 
03:36:20.030 --> 03:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
people with the de developmental
 
03:36:22.590 --> 03:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
Disability Services have had one element
 
03:36:24.710 --> 03:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
of their support kind of taken out in
 
03:36:26.510 --> 03:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
the middle of this budget
 
03:36:29.750 --> 03:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
cycle after July 1st so this bill
 
03:36:31.550 --> 03:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
provides a maximum of
 
03:36:34.030 --> 03:36:34.040 align:start position:0%
$600 uh per person through the end of
 
03:36:36.870 --> 03:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
the budget cycle prioritizing those who
 
03:36:39.590 --> 03:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
participated in these programs under a
 
03:36:43.110 --> 03:36:43.120 align:start position:0%
prior individualized service budget and
 
03:36:45.830 --> 03:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
it would be effective upon Passage the
 
03:36:47.750 --> 03:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
program still has an income and medical
 
03:36:51.630 --> 03:36:51.640 align:start position:0%
necessity means test for any participate
 
03:36:55.269 --> 03:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
participant the appropriation is
 
03:36:57.550 --> 03:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
$500,000 uh but there are comparable
 
03:36:59.510 --> 03:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
Savings in the budget under the
 
03:37:01.870 --> 03:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
developmental disability waiver normally
 
03:37:03.670 --> 03:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
these people would have received these
 
03:37:06.309 --> 03:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
services for the full two years uh we
 
03:37:07.790 --> 03:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
would have paid half of it out of the
 
03:37:10.229 --> 03:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
general fund now we're talking about one
 
03:37:13.830 --> 03:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
year and um uh paying for all of it out
 
03:37:16.110 --> 03:37:16.120 align:start position:0%
of the general fund uh so this is a
 
03:37:19.110 --> 03:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
one-time fix it goes away after the end
 
03:37:23.670 --> 03:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
of this bium cycle um the the uh items
 
03:37:26.830 --> 03:37:26.840 align:start position:0%
discussed in the amendment is to uh help
 
03:37:29.150 --> 03:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
us you know rebuild the support stool
 
03:37:32.469 --> 03:37:32.479 align:start position:0%
for the developmentally disabled uh and
 
03:37:35.510 --> 03:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh um you find out exactly how these
 
03:37:37.790 --> 03:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
services are being used what's being
 
03:37:40.229 --> 03:37:40.239 align:start position:0%
requested and making appropriate changes
 
03:37:43.990 --> 03:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
in the program uh so uh so this this
 
03:37:46.070 --> 03:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
change instead of being chaos is
 
03:37:48.830 --> 03:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
something a little more um smooth for
 
03:37:51.990 --> 03:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
these people so I ask for your vote to
 
03:37:54.550 --> 03:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on this okay motion is
 
03:37:56.630 --> 03:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended by string
 
03:37:58.110 --> 03:37:58.120 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham seconded by
 
03:38:00.750 --> 03:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
representative Heath question from
 
03:38:03.030 --> 03:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you Mr
 
03:38:05.830 --> 03:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
chairman um what makes this a one-time
 
03:38:08.870 --> 03:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
expense and not ongoing won't the same
 
03:38:10.990 --> 03:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
thing come up next year this dis
 
03:38:14.389 --> 03:38:14.399 align:start position:0%
appropriation is at the end of it ends
 
03:38:16.429 --> 03:38:16.439 align:start position:0%
and any unspent funds go away at the end
 
03:38:21.229 --> 03:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
of the bium and uh uh there's no no
 
03:38:23.030 --> 03:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
provision for continuing these
 
03:38:24.910 --> 03:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
recreational services for these
 
03:38:28.030 --> 03:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
individuals after the end of this panium
 
03:38:30.910 --> 03:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
follow question so but I meant the need
 
03:38:32.590 --> 03:38:32.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to think that next time
 
03:38:36.070 --> 03:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
we'll need the same thing again yes no
 
03:38:38.710 --> 03:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
well um you you know that part of the
 
03:38:40.349 --> 03:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
reason why we're doing a report is to
 
03:38:43.550 --> 03:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
find out exactly what services are being
 
03:38:46.870 --> 03:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
requested how they're being used and um
 
03:38:49.389 --> 03:38:49.399 align:start position:0%
and to contemplate whether some of them
 
03:38:52.189 --> 03:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
uh can be can be refashioned in a way
 
03:38:53.389 --> 03:38:53.399 align:start position:0%
that puts them back into the
 
03:38:55.670 --> 03:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
developmental disability program or
 
03:38:57.469 --> 03:38:57.479 align:start position:0%
whether we need to find something else
 
03:38:59.910 --> 03:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
and uh work work closely with the
 
03:39:01.550 --> 03:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:39:03.750 --> 03:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
and the disability Community to faret
 
03:39:07.110 --> 03:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
that out uh but um you know I don't
 
03:39:09.670 --> 03:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
think a long-term solution that involves
 
03:39:13.229 --> 03:39:13.239 align:start position:0%
us paying uh all of these Services Under
 
03:39:14.950 --> 03:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
the general fund is is what we're
 
03:39:17.189 --> 03:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
looking to
 
03:39:20.910 --> 03:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
do further discussion seeing none the
 
03:39:23.790 --> 03:39:23.800 align:start position:0%

I appreciate you waiting for and

03:40:54.229 --> 03:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
shortly thank you all right moving now
 
03:40:56.990 --> 03:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
back to division one and recognizing
 
03:41:00.630 --> 03:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
representative Lehman for House Bill
 
03:41:03.150 --> 03:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
1178 thank you Mr chairman House Bill
 
03:41:07.070 --> 03:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
1178 relative to an employees unused

earn time I'd like to recognize
 
03:41:12.110 --> 03:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire who also has an
 
03:41:15.870 --> 03:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
amendment to offer yes thank you um I
 
03:41:20.429 --> 03:41:20.439 align:start position:0%
I'd like to move Amendment 1326 H uh
 
03:41:22.790 --> 03:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
which is on your table and this is
 
03:41:25.030 --> 03:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
identical to the amendment we voted on
 
03:41:28.389 --> 03:41:28.399 align:start position:0%
in committee it's just that um Amendment
 
03:41:30.710 --> 03:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
1047 H was actually written by
 
03:41:32.710 --> 03:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
representative infantine and had his
 
03:41:35.870 --> 03:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
name on the top so this this is uh me
 
03:41:37.269 --> 03:41:37.279 align:start position:0%
doing the same thing I was doing this
 
03:41:39.950 --> 03:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
morning putting my name on something
 
03:41:42.189 --> 03:41:42.199 align:start position:0%
somebody else somebody else's
 
03:41:44.910 --> 03:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
work something I never did in school but
 
03:41:44.920 --> 03:41:46.030 align:start position:0%
work something I never did in school but
anyway

03:41:46.030 --> 03:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
03:41:50.189 --> 03:41:50.199 align:start position:0%
um second yes thank you so
 
03:41:53.429 --> 03:41:53.439 align:start position:0%
um and so this is this is the amendment
 
03:41:55.710 --> 03:41:55.720 align:start position:0%
that representative infantine who the
 
03:41:59.389 --> 03:41:59.399 align:start position:0%
chair of the labor committee wanted to
 
03:42:02.910 --> 03:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
um put before the house um when this
 
03:42:06.309 --> 03:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
bill first came up but OS for some
 
03:42:09.030 --> 03:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
reason neglected to draft it for him and
 
03:42:12.670 --> 03:42:12.680 align:start position:0%
and so it didn't didn't happen so what
 
03:42:19.950 --> 03:42:19.960 align:start position:0%
it does is um it it changes the um the
 
03:42:23.710 --> 03:42:23.720 align:start position:0%
circumstances under which someone's um
 
03:42:27.630 --> 03:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
earn time would get paid to them to the
 
03:42:30.070 --> 03:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
just the circumstances of when the
 
03:42:34.670 --> 03:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
company um uh he leaves employment when
 
03:42:37.349 --> 03:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
the company uh closes or changes
 
03:42:40.790 --> 03:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
ownership so um what representative
 
03:42:43.950 --> 03:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
infantine is concerned about is that the
 
03:42:46.950 --> 03:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
way the bill was originally written it
 
03:42:51.630 --> 03:42:51.640 align:start position:0%
it uh over could override uh Union
 
03:42:54.189 --> 03:42:54.199 align:start position:0%
contracts and other you know labor
 
03:42:57.349 --> 03:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
agreements that um where this particular
 
03:42:58.510 --> 03:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
issue is
 
03:43:02.429 --> 03:43:02.439 align:start position:0%
already um already in those agreements
 
03:43:06.149 --> 03:43:06.159 align:start position:0%
and so by doing this it's it's um
 
03:43:09.990 --> 03:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
reducing the scope to cases where
 
03:43:11.550 --> 03:43:11.560 align:start position:0%
essentially the company's going out of
 
03:43:15.110 --> 03:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
business or or being sold so therefore
 
03:43:19.590 --> 03:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
or such agreements would would not um uh
 
03:43:22.309 --> 03:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
sort of would not apply and and in
 
03:43:24.670 --> 03:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
particular representative infantine also
 
03:43:27.389 --> 03:43:27.399 align:start position:0%
said that the previous the other version
 
03:43:29.670 --> 03:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
of the bill the one that passed the
 
03:43:33.550 --> 03:43:33.560 align:start position:0%
house has gone further in the process
 
03:43:36.030 --> 03:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
and just been stopped dead every time so
 
03:43:37.670 --> 03:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
this this is not the first time this has
 
03:43:39.269 --> 03:43:39.279 align:start position:0%
come up this has come up years and years
 
03:43:42.189 --> 03:43:42.199 align:start position:0%
and years so he thinks that with this
 
03:43:45.309 --> 03:43:45.319 align:start position:0%
amendment this will get approval and
 
03:43:48.630 --> 03:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
become law but without it it won't thank
 
03:43:51.269 --> 03:43:51.279 align:start position:0%
you thank you questions representative
 
03:43:53.790 --> 03:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
hle thank you Mr chair question from
 
03:43:54.790 --> 03:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
someone on the
 
03:43:57.429 --> 03:43:57.439 align:start position:0%
committee um some employers are moving
 
03:44:01.309 --> 03:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
to New vacation time off models from the
 
03:44:03.550 --> 03:44:03.560 align:start position:0%
traditional paid holidays paid time off
 
03:44:06.030 --> 03:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
to something called Flex time off I
 
03:44:09.070 --> 03:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
guess where it's not as as rigid in
 
03:44:10.870 --> 03:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
accounted for how is that taken care of
 
03:44:14.030 --> 03:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:17.670 --> 03:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
amendment so um you'll
 
03:44:19.790 --> 03:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
see than yeah thank you for the question
 
03:44:23.790 --> 03:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:28.630 --> 03:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
um that the written policy so so line
 
03:44:31.910 --> 03:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
15 um paid time off per the per the
 
03:44:35.870 --> 03:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
employer's written policy so um this
 
03:44:38.670 --> 03:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
allows the employer to actually have a
 
03:44:41.830 --> 03:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
policy that that addresses this so I
 
03:44:44.830 --> 03:44:44.840 align:start position:0%
think that's that's where um that would
 
03:44:49.429 --> 03:44:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:52.030 --> 03:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
play representative Edward this is just
 
03:44:54.990 --> 03:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
a technical clarification sir the the
 
03:44:57.750 --> 03:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
the document that we're using to as a
 
03:45:00.670 --> 03:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
table of contents lists amendment number
 
03:45:00.680 --> 03:45:02.110 align:start position:0%
table of contents lists amendment number
1

03:45:02.110 --> 03:45:02.120 align:start position:0%
1
 
03:45:05.389 --> 03:45:05.399 align:start position:0%
47h and the and the one the amendment I
 
03:45:08.670 --> 03:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
have in front of me is 1326 I just want
 
03:45:10.429 --> 03:45:10.439 align:start position:0%
to make sure I know which one I'm voting
 
03:45:13.830 --> 03:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
on yes thank you so this is they they're
 
03:45:15.510 --> 03:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
identical except
 
03:45:18.510 --> 03:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
that at the top of 1047 H says
 
03:45:20.710 --> 03:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
representative infantine at the top of
 
03:45:23.389 --> 03:45:23.399 align:start position:0%
this it says representative Maguire and
 
03:45:27.469 --> 03:45:27.479 align:start position:0%
and uh that's because technically we we
 
03:45:30.550 --> 03:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
cannot pass an infantine amendment you
 
03:45:33.389 --> 03:45:33.399 align:start position:0%
know so that's why it's there thank
 
03:45:36.990 --> 03:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
you any further discussion on
 
03:45:39.070 --> 03:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
representative grassy yes thank you Mr
 
03:45:42.070 --> 03:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
chairman um what this amendment does is
 
03:45:45.550 --> 03:45:45.560 align:start position:0%
it pretty much guts the bill this bill
 
03:45:47.550 --> 03:45:47.560 align:start position:0%
um dealt with employees the bill deals
 
03:45:50.550 --> 03:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
with with companies that have 15 or more
 
03:45:52.750 --> 03:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
employees and it changes to 20 or more
 
03:45:55.149 --> 03:45:55.159 align:start position:0%
employees at 15 or more employees that
 
03:45:57.469 --> 03:45:57.479 align:start position:0%
exempts 84% of the businesses in the
 
03:45:59.910 --> 03:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire so you know going
 
03:46:02.469 --> 03:46:02.479 align:start position:0%
to 20 employees you know how many more
 
03:46:03.870 --> 03:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
EMP how many more businesses is
 
03:46:06.110 --> 03:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
affecting I'm not sure but the thing is
 
03:46:07.910 --> 03:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
is that we're basically saying that
 
03:46:09.070 --> 03:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to provide protections for
 
03:46:11.070 --> 03:46:11.080 align:start position:0%
fewer workers and the most important
 
03:46:15.269 --> 03:46:15.279 align:start position:0%
thing that this does is it takes out one
 
03:46:18.389 --> 03:46:18.399 align:start position:0%
incident where an employee is separated
 
03:46:20.309 --> 03:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
from their employer and that's being
 
03:46:20.319 --> 03:46:21.389 align:start position:0%
from their employer and that's being
laid

03:46:21.389 --> 03:46:21.399 align:start position:0%
laid
 
03:46:24.710 --> 03:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
off and I can tell you from personal
 
03:46:28.030 --> 03:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
experience that when a company lays you
 
03:46:30.229 --> 03:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
off they may or may not have the intent
 
03:46:33.950 --> 03:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
to rehire you but if you ACR your time
 
03:46:37.189 --> 03:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
by the Personnel policy in January on
 
03:46:40.070 --> 03:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
January 1 you acre your time and if the
 
03:46:44.469 --> 03:46:44.479 align:start position:0%
layoff occurs as it did during covid on
 
03:46:45.670 --> 03:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
March Mar
 
03:46:47.790 --> 03:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
15th and somebody took all their
 
03:46:49.590 --> 03:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
vacation an employee in the company took
 
03:46:51.870 --> 03:46:51.880 align:start position:0%
all their vacation time in
 
03:46:51.880 --> 03:46:53.710 align:start position:0%
all their vacation time in
February

03:46:53.710 --> 03:46:53.720 align:start position:0%
February
 
03:46:56.830 --> 03:46:56.840 align:start position:0%
that when March 15th hits the employees
 
03:46:59.309 --> 03:46:59.319 align:start position:0%
who hadn't taken their vacation time
 
03:47:01.030 --> 03:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
lose that vacation
 
03:47:04.429 --> 03:47:04.439 align:start position:0%
time um unless the company comes back in
 
03:47:08.070 --> 03:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
you know reopens very quickly um and and
 
03:47:10.229 --> 03:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
the and the owner of the company is
 
03:47:12.189 --> 03:47:12.199 align:start position:0%
willing to protect the benefits of that
 
03:47:14.349 --> 03:47:14.359 align:start position:0%
employees they would lose their acred
 
03:47:14.359 --> 03:47:16.030 align:start position:0%
employees they would lose their acred
time

03:47:16.030 --> 03:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:47:18.429 --> 03:47:18.439 align:start position:0%
and I think that this really is
 
03:47:21.910 --> 03:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
something that affects more working
 
03:47:24.469 --> 03:47:24.479 align:start position:0%
people than it does Executives or people
 
03:47:25.910 --> 03:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
that work in high-tech where they have
 
03:47:29.269 --> 03:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
Flex time uh this affects people who are
 
03:47:32.269 --> 03:47:32.279 align:start position:0%
at the lower end of the pay scale and to
 
03:47:34.790 --> 03:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
basically take time that they have
 
03:47:34.800 --> 03:47:35.790 align:start position:0%
basically take time that they have
worked

03:47:35.790 --> 03:47:35.800 align:start position:0%
worked
 
03:47:38.070 --> 03:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
for sometimes for
 
03:47:42.030 --> 03:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
years and and and to say that's not
 
03:47:44.189 --> 03:47:44.199 align:start position:0%
important and we're not going to protect
 
03:47:48.070 --> 03:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
you um is is irresponsible i i you know
 
03:47:49.510 --> 03:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
if we're going to if we're going to help
 
03:47:51.710 --> 03:47:51.720 align:start position:0%
anybody our job should be able to help
 
03:47:53.710 --> 03:47:53.720 align:start position:0%
those who struggle the hardest and this
 
03:47:56.790 --> 03:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
is a bill that does protect them and the
 
03:47:58.790 --> 03:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
amendment does not do that because it
 
03:48:00.510 --> 03:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
takes that provision where you've been
 
03:48:03.710 --> 03:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
laid off and it takes that right out and
 
03:48:05.630 --> 03:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
I think there's you know if you're if
 
03:48:08.910 --> 03:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
the business closes or changes hands
 
03:48:12.630 --> 03:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
that's good if it if you're laid off or
 
03:48:15.750 --> 03:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
if you leave on your own accord and you
 
03:48:17.510 --> 03:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
in in favorable terms in the employee
 
03:48:20.510 --> 03:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
you will many times get your ACR
 
03:48:22.870 --> 03:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
vacation but if you're laid
 
03:48:26.070 --> 03:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
off which is no fault of your own you
 
03:48:28.229 --> 03:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
lose you can lose that time and this
 
03:48:30.429 --> 03:48:30.439 align:start position:0%
would provide protection for it I have
 
03:48:32.149 --> 03:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
an amendment which takes care of some of
 
03:48:35.110 --> 03:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
the issues and caps the amount of time
 
03:48:37.309 --> 03:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
that you can carry that that would be
 
03:48:40.429 --> 03:48:40.439 align:start position:0%
carried to 30 days um we felt that this
 
03:48:43.269 --> 03:48:43.279 align:start position:0%
was an amendment that would uh would
 
03:48:47.070 --> 03:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
protect most people work most average
 
03:48:49.030 --> 03:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
laborers don't get more than 30 days
 
03:48:51.429 --> 03:48:51.439 align:start position:0%
vacation in a year so they'd have to
 
03:48:53.189 --> 03:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
work there an awful long time to get
 
03:48:56.349 --> 03:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
that uh so we felt that the another
 
03:48:58.870 --> 03:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
amendment is more appropriate uh whereas
 
03:49:02.790 --> 03:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
this amendment really takes away uh this
 
03:49:06.189 --> 03:49:06.199 align:start position:0%
benefit to a large number of employees
 
03:49:07.990 --> 03:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
who work very hard for the time that
 
03:49:08.000 --> 03:49:09.030 align:start position:0%
who work very hard for the time that
they

03:49:09.030 --> 03:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:49:11.550 --> 03:49:11.560 align:start position:0%
acrew was there any discussion with the
 
03:49:14.229 --> 03:49:14.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor when we were dealing
 
03:49:17.309 --> 03:49:17.319 align:start position:0%
with this bill I recall some time ago
 
03:49:19.750 --> 03:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
testimony by the Department of Labor
 
03:49:22.070 --> 03:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
saying that when a business went out of
 
03:49:24.389 --> 03:49:24.399 align:start position:0%
business they were the first ones there
 
03:49:27.590 --> 03:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
to seize assets to ensure that the
 
03:49:30.269 --> 03:49:30.279 align:start position:0%
employees got their last paycheck that
 
03:49:31.710 --> 03:49:31.720 align:start position:0%
that was from when businesses go out of
 
03:49:33.229 --> 03:49:33.239 align:start position:0%
business but when layoffs happen that
 
03:49:35.229 --> 03:49:35.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't that doesn't happen I can tell
 
03:49:36.910 --> 03:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
you that I know a business that they
 
03:49:38.309 --> 03:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
laid off their employees it took a
 
03:49:39.590 --> 03:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
number of years before they brought
 
03:49:41.349 --> 03:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
everybody back everybody came back as a
 
03:49:44.670 --> 03:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
new employee so everybody lost their
 
03:49:46.269 --> 03:49:46.279 align:start position:0%
benefits lost all their vacation time
 
03:49:47.710 --> 03:49:47.720 align:start position:0%
and everything and and the company did
 
03:49:49.830 --> 03:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
not make that up you had a choice you
 
03:49:51.070 --> 03:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
either went back to work for the company
 
03:49:52.189 --> 03:49:52.199 align:start position:0%
or you didn't go back to work for the
 
03:49:53.790 --> 03:49:53.800 align:start position:0%
company some people went back to work
 
03:49:54.990 --> 03:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
for them some people had found other
 
03:49:56.469 --> 03:49:56.479 align:start position:0%
jobs and didn't go back to work for them
 
03:49:58.630 --> 03:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
but the thing is when you acrw time and
 
03:50:00.389 --> 03:50:00.399 align:start position:0%
particularly if you've pet in you know
 
03:50:04.229 --> 03:50:04.239 align:start position:0%
five or 10 years and you lose it that's
 
03:50:05.830 --> 03:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
the tough and the thing is is that
 
03:50:06.910 --> 03:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
they're saying well yeah you can go to
 
03:50:08.670 --> 03:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor and you can
 
03:50:11.510 --> 03:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
complain but if you expect to get
 
03:50:14.710 --> 03:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
rehired when the layoff ends and you
 
03:50:16.229 --> 03:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
filed a labor grievance against their
 
03:50:18.469 --> 03:50:18.479 align:start position:0%
company you just got moved to the bottom
 
03:50:20.389 --> 03:50:20.399 align:start position:0%
of that list you're not going to get
 
03:50:22.070 --> 03:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
rehired because you filed a grievance
 
03:50:24.950 --> 03:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
against them so you know it it saying
 
03:50:26.870 --> 03:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
that there is an opportunity most
 
03:50:29.870 --> 03:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
employees if they liked their job are
 
03:50:31.630 --> 03:50:31.640 align:start position:0%
not going toile an grievance they're
 
03:50:33.870 --> 03:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
basically going to say you know I hope
 
03:50:36.550 --> 03:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
the the company Honors that commitment
 
03:50:38.670 --> 03:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
they made to me and when they bring me
 
03:50:40.030 --> 03:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
back they'll give me my vacation time
 
03:50:42.510 --> 03:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
and I'll be happy with that uh but that
 
03:50:44.149 --> 03:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen and this law would
 
03:50:45.790 --> 03:50:45.800 align:start position:0%
protect that
 
03:50:47.630 --> 03:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
well I wonder if it overlaps what the
 
03:50:50.189 --> 03:50:50.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor is already doing and
 
03:50:51.950 --> 03:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
we didn't have any testimony from them
 
03:50:55.550 --> 03:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
did we represent hle thank you Mr chair
 
03:50:58.189 --> 03:50:58.199 align:start position:0%
um in the case of the employer wanting
 
03:51:00.429 --> 03:51:00.439 align:start position:0%
to to make sure that employee comes back
 
03:51:03.149 --> 03:51:03.159 align:start position:0%
because they're a valuable employee I
 
03:51:06.269 --> 03:51:06.279 align:start position:0%
think if they went ahead and cut their
 
03:51:08.469 --> 03:51:08.479 align:start position:0%
time and did not allocate it back to
 
03:51:10.670 --> 03:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
them in some form of a paycheck right
 
03:51:12.229 --> 03:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
you would disincentivize that person
 
03:51:14.630 --> 03:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
from returning or being a productive Lo
 
03:51:16.950 --> 03:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
person long term for the company and in
 
03:51:19.349 --> 03:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
in many cases would encourage them by by
 
03:51:20.950 --> 03:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
that type of act to move elsewhere to
 
03:51:22.870 --> 03:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
another company so for the employees
 
03:51:24.910 --> 03:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
that are that are valuable to the
 
03:51:28.110 --> 03:51:28.120 align:start position:0%
companies I think this is a
 
03:51:31.910 --> 03:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:34.429 --> 03:51:34.439 align:start position:0%

03:52:52.950 --> 03:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
much for helping me with
 
03:52:56.469 --> 03:52:56.479 align:start position:0%
numbers that's what we're here for all
 
03:53:00.030 --> 03:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
right so the motion before us ought to
 
03:53:04.389 --> 03:53:04.399 align:start position:0%
pass with Amendment 11 for House Bill
 
03:53:09.030 --> 03:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
1178 as amended by Amendment 1326 H the
 
03:53:10.469 --> 03:53:10.479 align:start position:0%
motion by representative Maguire
 
03:53:12.469 --> 03:53:12.479 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Sweeney clerk
 
03:53:14.550 --> 03:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
will call the role on that motion of o
 
03:53:16.590 --> 03:53:16.600 align:start position:0%
pass as amended what you I was ask a
 
03:53:19.389 --> 03:53:19.399 align:start position:0%
question all right further
 
03:53:22.550 --> 03:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
discussion does this amendment of impact
 
03:53:26.510 --> 03:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:30.189 --> 03:53:30.199 align:start position:0%
all I think the answer is is no because
 
03:53:33.630 --> 03:53:33.640 align:start position:0%
it's really about the finance so there
 
03:53:35.910 --> 03:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
was a little bit of vague stuff about
 
03:53:40.710 --> 03:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
because um um uh municipalities might
 
03:53:42.670 --> 03:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
have Labor agreements therefore they
 
03:53:44.630 --> 03:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
might be slightly affected you know that
 
03:53:47.870 --> 03:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
kind of thing but but um because they
 
03:53:49.990 --> 03:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
might somebody might lay off somebody
 
03:53:52.670 --> 03:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
right so so
 
03:53:55.830 --> 03:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
um but essentially no I mean essentially
 
03:53:58.870 --> 03:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
this is more about what's going out in
 
03:54:03.349 --> 03:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
in IND in Commerce than it than it is in
 
03:54:08.229 --> 03:54:08.239 align:start position:0%
um but but but it definitely takes any
 
03:54:10.389 --> 03:54:10.399 align:start position:0%
government because it's strictly about
 
03:54:12.070 --> 03:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
going out of business right that it
 
03:54:13.990 --> 03:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
takes any kind of government thing out
 
03:54:15.349 --> 03:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:54:15.359 --> 03:54:16.229 align:start position:0%
of the
thank

03:54:16.229 --> 03:54:16.239 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:54:20.429 --> 03:54:20.439 align:start position:0%
you U Mr Hoffman is there any fiscal
 
03:54:22.469 --> 03:54:22.479 align:start position:0%
note on
 
03:54:24.870 --> 03:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
this uh there's no fiscal note on the
 
03:54:26.670 --> 03:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
amendment yet however what
 
03:54:28.910 --> 03:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire is true um first
 
03:54:30.950 --> 03:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
of all the state isn't um subject to the
 
03:54:32.469 --> 03:54:32.479 align:start position:0%
provisions of this bill so it won't
 
03:54:37.070 --> 03:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
impact the state uh the other Bill did
 
03:54:38.870 --> 03:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
impact the university system but again
 
03:54:39.990 --> 03:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
because now this is going out of
 
03:54:41.349 --> 03:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
business I don't think they'll have an
 
03:54:43.990 --> 03:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
impact so um there shouldn't be an
 
03:54:46.510 --> 03:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
impact on this bill so if so there is no
 
03:54:48.750 --> 03:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
money in the bill so we could go to if
 
03:54:50.790 --> 03:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
we well it wouldn't have a vote we'd
 
03:54:53.309 --> 03:54:53.319 align:start position:0%
have to have a better vote to go to
 
03:54:54.950 --> 03:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
consent calendar anything all right
 
03:54:57.710 --> 03:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
disregard thank you all right if there's
 
03:55:00.030 --> 03:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
no further discussion clerk will call
 
03:55:02.830 --> 03:55:02.840 align:start position:0%

in in for consideration Amendment 1047 H
 
03:57:05.590 --> 03:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
which you're getting copies made right
 
03:57:07.349 --> 03:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
now I only made a couple of copies I
 
03:57:09.590 --> 03:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
didn't expect it to get this far but
 
03:57:12.429 --> 03:57:12.439 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for put this takes care of
 
03:57:13.750 --> 03:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment that I have which you'll
 
03:57:16.469 --> 03:57:16.479 align:start position:0%
be receiving shortly here um takes care
 
03:57:18.830 --> 03:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
of the the University Systems
 
03:57:22.469 --> 03:57:22.479 align:start position:0%
concern um it uh keeps it uh for more
 
03:57:27.189 --> 03:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
than um for 15 employees and uh which
 
03:57:29.269 --> 03:57:29.279 align:start position:0%
which I stated that argument
 
03:57:33.030 --> 03:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
previously and it uh also limits it caps
 
03:57:35.429 --> 03:57:35.439 align:start position:0%
the number of days that can be carried
 
03:57:39.070 --> 03:57:39.080 align:start position:0%
uh for um unused pay uh acred on use pay
 
03:57:42.229 --> 03:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
to 30 days so for most workers this will
 
03:57:43.710 --> 03:57:43.720 align:start position:0%
provide them with the protection they
 
03:57:45.710 --> 03:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
need to be able to make sure that they
 
03:57:48.229 --> 03:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
get paid and for the hours that they've
 
03:57:50.429 --> 03:57:50.439 align:start position:0%
recruited that they've worked years for
 
03:57:52.469 --> 03:57:52.479 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate your support for this I
 
03:57:54.189 --> 03:57:54.199 align:start position:0%
hope that we can get this passed and get
 
03:57:57.110 --> 03:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
this to the floor um whether an not to
 
03:57:58.830 --> 03:57:58.840 align:start position:0%
pass motion for something for the
 
03:58:02.070 --> 03:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
average working people you have a fiscal
 
03:58:04.510 --> 03:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
no uh it takes care of the University
 
03:58:06.510 --> 03:58:06.520 align:start position:0%
Systems issue so from what I understand
 
03:58:08.750 --> 03:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't impact the state at all so
 
03:58:10.269 --> 03:58:10.279 align:start position:0%
the university system said that the
 
03:58:12.189 --> 03:58:12.199 align:start position:0%
amendment has a section in here which
 
03:58:18.149 --> 03:58:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:21.510 --> 03:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
so this this has no no money in
 
03:58:26.630 --> 03:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
it for the state correct okay thank
 
03:58:30.790 --> 03:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
you and the the correct number is 1256
 
03:58:36.149 --> 03:58:36.159 align:start position:0%
age Mr CH motion the uh you said 1047
 
03:58:40.030 --> 03:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
the one we got was 1256 is that check
 
03:58:42.590 --> 03:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
with you represent I'm sorry I did have
 
03:58:43.590 --> 03:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
the wrong number because I was holding
 
03:58:49.469 --> 03:58:49.479 align:start position:0%
the wrong piece of Pap is 1256 H okay
 
03:58:58.830 --> 03:58:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:00.790 --> 03:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
amendment I have a
 
03:59:04.349 --> 03:59:04.359 align:start position:0%
question representa H thank you Mr chair
 
03:59:07.870 --> 03:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
um so you are capping this at the 30
 
03:59:10.670 --> 03:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
days right in line seven and eight would
 
03:59:13.429 --> 03:59:13.439 align:start position:0%
you be amendable to a smaller cap than
 
03:59:16.389 --> 03:59:16.399 align:start position:0%
that most people don't acrew five weeks
 
03:59:18.630 --> 03:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
of vacation or six weeks of vacation a
 
03:59:22.149 --> 03:59:22.159 align:start position:0%
year that we're talking about um it's
 
03:59:24.309 --> 03:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
more in the 2 to four range in terms of
 
03:59:27.030 --> 03:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
weeks of vacation um because most
 
03:59:28.830 --> 03:59:28.840 align:start position:0%
employers count some of the holidays
 
03:59:30.149 --> 03:59:30.159 align:start position:0%
toward their vacation time when they
 
03:59:33.750 --> 03:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
start acre at six weeks so um this would
 
03:59:35.670 --> 03:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
allow people to acrew more than a year's
 
03:59:39.469 --> 03:59:39.479 align:start position:0%
vacation the way it's drafted right
 
03:59:41.550 --> 03:59:41.560 align:start position:0%
now I'm I'm not sure I understand the
 
03:59:43.309 --> 03:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
question exactly but no I think 30 days
 
03:59:45.550 --> 03:59:45.560 align:start position:0%
is anade one because if you work for a
 
03:59:47.550 --> 03:59:47.560 align:start position:0%
company for more than 10 years there's a
 
03:59:49.229 --> 03:59:49.239 align:start position:0%
chance that you could get that type of
 
03:59:52.550 --> 03:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
vacation and um I've had experiences
 
03:59:55.030 --> 03:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
twice where I got to the five weeks of
 
03:59:59.269 --> 03:59:59.279 align:start position:0%
vacation um and U my employment ended so
 
04:00:01.830 --> 04:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
you know that's uh we we figure this
 
04:00:04.149 --> 04:00:04.159 align:start position:0%
will cover most people who work and uh
 
04:00:05.950 --> 04:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
they may have held over days from a
 
04:00:08.790 --> 04:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
previous year for V for a vacation uh
 
04:00:10.269 --> 04:00:10.279 align:start position:0%
whatever and this would would provide
 
04:00:13.189 --> 04:00:13.199 align:start position:0%
that protection for them most companies
 
04:00:15.550 --> 04:00:15.560 align:start position:0%
they cap companies in their personnel
 
04:00:17.670 --> 04:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
policies for most laborers do cap it
 
04:00:19.429 --> 04:00:19.439 align:start position:0%
that you can't carry more than 30 days
 
04:00:22.429 --> 04:00:22.439 align:start position:0%
at any one time of recruit
 
04:00:24.790 --> 04:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
time I have a technical represent
 
04:00:27.070 --> 04:00:27.080 align:start position:0%
Edwards uh thank you Mr chair I just
 
04:00:29.149 --> 04:00:29.159 align:start position:0%
have a technical question because I'm
 
04:00:33.030 --> 04:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
I'm still learning uh this amendment is
 
04:00:36.830 --> 04:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh signed is um sponsored by grassy and
 
04:00:38.990 --> 04:00:39.000 align:start position:0%

and I'm just curious how this rule Works
 
04:00:47.309 --> 04:00:47.319 align:start position:0%
where it the bills need or the
 
04:00:49.070 --> 04:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
Amendments need to be sponsored by a
 
04:00:52.229 --> 04:00:52.239 align:start position:0%
Committee Member is is having Kill from
 
04:00:56.149 --> 04:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
a different committee acceptable on this
 
04:00:58.950 --> 04:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
amendment because we have a finance guy
 
04:00:58.960 --> 04:00:59.830 align:start position:0%
amendment because we have a finance guy

it you want to say
 
04:01:02.000 --> 04:01:03.790 align:start position:0%
it you want to say
that

04:01:03.790 --> 04:01:03.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:01:05.990 --> 04:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
um we learned this morning from the
 
04:01:10.149 --> 04:01:10.159 align:start position:0%
clerk that that's not true um apparently
 
04:01:12.830 --> 04:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
amendments can have any state reps name
 
04:01:15.710 --> 04:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
on them and if there's any other D you
 
04:01:17.370 --> 04:01:17.380 align:start position:0%

[Music]

04:01:18.790 --> 04:01:18.800 align:start position:0%

you you confirm I okay very good all
 
04:01:28.750 --> 04:01:28.760 align:start position:0%

04:01:30.750 --> 04:01:30.760 align:start position:0%
representative kahill on there but is
 
04:01:32.349 --> 04:01:32.359 align:start position:0%

uh hang on it's um grassy and able on
 
04:01:44.070 --> 04:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
this amendment that will be before for
 
04:01:46.630 --> 04:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
us question over here
 
04:01:51.630 --> 04:01:51.640 align:start position:0%
just oh thank you we've got a second so
 
04:01:51.640 --> 04:01:52.750 align:start position:0%
just oh thank you we've got a second so
all

04:01:52.750 --> 04:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:01:56.149 --> 04:01:56.159 align:start position:0%
right um where does it show that the UNH
 
04:01:57.309 --> 04:01:57.319 align:start position:0%
is out of
 
04:01:59.229 --> 04:01:59.239 align:start position:0%
this there was one it doesn't
 
04:02:00.550 --> 04:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
specifically do it but it was one of the
 
04:02:05.269 --> 04:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
issues that they had um dealing um with
 
04:02:07.429 --> 04:02:07.439 align:start position:0%
the types of employ water to and
 
04:02:10.269 --> 04:02:10.279 align:start position:0%
employees described in Isa
 
04:02:13.349 --> 04:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
27543 uh this is something that they had
 
04:02:15.269 --> 04:02:15.279 align:start position:0%
a concern with and that's what was put
 
04:02:16.990 --> 04:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
in I'd have to compare it exactly
 
04:02:18.590 --> 04:02:18.600 align:start position:0%
between the from the original bill and I
 
04:02:20.590 --> 04:02:20.600 align:start position:0%
could tell you exactly where that was
 
04:02:24.110 --> 04:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
but they did um recommend that change
 
04:02:26.790 --> 04:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
and we put it in the in the bill so so
 
04:02:30.950 --> 04:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
when we Define an employer as RSA 27535
 
04:02:33.030 --> 04:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
it does not include the UNH yeah they
 
04:02:36.389 --> 04:02:36.399 align:start position:0%
actually um have better benefits than
 
04:02:38.710 --> 04:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
what this protects La so they've been
 
04:02:40.990 --> 04:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
Exempted thank you thank you for that
 
04:02:43.830 --> 04:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
explanation all right now we have before
 
04:02:47.229 --> 04:02:47.239 align:start position:0%
for us the amendment
 
04:02:52.269 --> 04:02:52.279 align:start position:0%
um 1256 on House Bill
 
04:02:54.710 --> 04:02:54.720 align:start position:0%

04:03:06.030 --> 04:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
this I uh this was alluded to
 
04:03:09.070 --> 04:03:09.080 align:start position:0%
earlier uh that the definitions of time
 
04:03:12.750 --> 04:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
off the the naming of time off is
 
04:03:16.790 --> 04:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
changing and increasingly uh something
 
04:03:21.990 --> 04:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
like slack time is is uh is being used
 
04:03:27.990 --> 04:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh and the uh and in some um companies
 
04:03:31.710 --> 04:03:31.720 align:start position:0%
sick leave is no longer an item it's
 
04:03:34.750 --> 04:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
just buried within all the available
 
04:03:38.790 --> 04:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
hours that a person can take off and so
 
04:03:41.429 --> 04:03:41.439 align:start position:0%
um so that's not a bad policy but I'm
 
04:03:44.870 --> 04:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
just curious if on line 8 where we talk
 
04:03:47.389 --> 04:03:47.399 align:start position:0%
about not sick days that we wouldn't
 
04:03:50.630 --> 04:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
count sick days if we're creating an
 
04:03:53.510 --> 04:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
ambiguous situation for those employers
 
04:03:57.110 --> 04:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
that don't account for sick days um uh
 
04:03:59.110 --> 04:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
specifically or precisely and and
 
04:04:03.469 --> 04:04:03.479 align:start position:0%
instead bundle them into um slack days
 
04:04:03.479 --> 04:04:06.149 align:start position:0%
instead bundle them into um slack days
or

04:04:06.149 --> 04:04:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:09.990 --> 04:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
whatever um I I again as I said before
 
04:04:12.110 --> 04:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
if you've taken a look at most of that
 
04:04:15.590 --> 04:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
time the flex time uh um vacation time
 
04:04:17.550 --> 04:04:17.560 align:start position:0%
periods or something you find more in
 
04:04:19.469 --> 04:04:19.479 align:start position:0%
high-tech businesses it's very rare that
 
04:04:21.429 --> 04:04:21.439 align:start position:0%
you find it in other businesses but when
 
04:04:23.429 --> 04:04:23.439 align:start position:0%
you do find it in a dist and virtually
 
04:04:25.469 --> 04:04:25.479 align:start position:0%
every study recently has proven this out
 
04:04:27.229 --> 04:04:27.239 align:start position:0%
that people actually get less vacation
 
04:04:28.229 --> 04:04:28.239 align:start position:0%
time than they would if they worked
 
04:04:30.269 --> 04:04:30.279 align:start position:0%
under an traditional system this is
 
04:04:33.349 --> 04:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
something that is for those people who
 
04:04:36.030 --> 04:04:36.040 align:start position:0%
are hard workers who work at their job
 
04:04:38.149 --> 04:04:38.159 align:start position:0%
year after year and it's just to protect
 
04:04:40.910 --> 04:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
that time that they've reced um you know
 
04:04:42.389 --> 04:04:42.399 align:start position:0%
mo a lot of companies do not give you
 
04:04:44.229 --> 04:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
any vacation in your first year you may
 
04:04:45.349 --> 04:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
have some sick days but you don't get
 
04:04:48.070 --> 04:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
any vacation time and you have to prove
 
04:04:50.790 --> 04:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
your sick time that you use and what
 
04:04:52.750 --> 04:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
you're looking at here is a situation
 
04:04:54.950 --> 04:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
where when they get to that first year
 
04:04:56.389 --> 04:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
after that first year employment and
 
04:04:57.469 --> 04:04:57.479 align:start position:0%
particularly if the company says your
 
04:05:00.189 --> 04:05:00.199 align:start position:0%
vacation crws on January 1 they get to
 
04:05:01.990 --> 04:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
that point on January 1st and they get
 
04:05:04.550 --> 04:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
their acred time um if a company is
 
04:05:07.309 --> 04:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
using using Flex time the way they pay
 
04:05:08.870 --> 04:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
it out the way they use it is is in
 
04:05:10.309 --> 04:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
their personnel policy but I will tell
 
04:05:12.670 --> 04:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
you Studies have shown as I've said
 
04:05:15.469 --> 04:05:15.479 align:start position:0%
people do not get as many vacation days
 
04:05:17.229 --> 04:05:17.239 align:start position:0%
under Flex time than they do under
 
04:05:19.830 --> 04:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
regular time and it's proving out that
 
04:05:21.870 --> 04:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
people are just working more hours and
 
04:05:24.229 --> 04:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
it's burning people out and the tech
 
04:05:25.750 --> 04:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
industry is one that proves that you
 
04:05:28.030 --> 04:05:28.040 align:start position:0%
burn people out in that business but
 
04:05:29.670 --> 04:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
this is more for people who work
 
04:05:32.630 --> 04:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
traditional jobs and earn that time by
 
04:05:35.990 --> 04:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
working hard and and and you know it was
 
04:05:37.630 --> 04:05:37.640 align:start position:0%
said that well if you want to get that
 
04:05:39.309 --> 04:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
employee to come back you're going to
 
04:05:40.790 --> 04:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
pay this kind of stuff out to him well
 
04:05:43.110 --> 04:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
that's not the case I know a situation
 
04:05:44.790 --> 04:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
where probably 90% of the people came
 
04:05:46.070 --> 04:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
back to work and they all lost that
 
04:05:49.790 --> 04:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
vacation time I thank you for that I I
 
04:05:52.710 --> 04:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't debating the the benefit or value
 
04:05:54.790 --> 04:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
of it I was asking about the technical
 
04:05:56.870 --> 04:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
application given the definitions and
 
04:05:59.590 --> 04:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
the use of specific words and so I I I
 
04:06:01.870 --> 04:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
don't know that we know uh but we can
 
04:06:05.630 --> 04:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
vote on this anyways well it obviously
 
04:06:08.790 --> 04:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
exempts sick time correct so that's
 
04:06:10.830 --> 04:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
that's the question you asked and I
 
04:06:12.710 --> 04:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
guess that's the answer but no sick time
 
04:06:15.950 --> 04:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
representative Papa M Mr chair I just
 
04:06:18.110 --> 04:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to add a bit more information
 
04:06:20.309 --> 04:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
here um I've heard the assertion that
 
04:06:22.110 --> 04:06:22.120 align:start position:0%
this is more a thing for High-Tech
 
04:06:25.429 --> 04:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
Industries and highly paid people since
 
04:06:27.790 --> 04:06:27.800 align:start position:0%
I've been working for the town of wiam I
 
04:06:30.189 --> 04:06:30.199 align:start position:0%
would like to briefly quote from their
 
04:06:31.870 --> 04:06:31.880 align:start position:0%
personnel policy that's available on
 
04:06:35.550 --> 04:06:35.560 align:start position:0%
their website Article 13 earn time earn
 
04:06:37.229 --> 04:06:37.239 align:start position:0%
time is an alternative approach to the
 
04:06:39.030 --> 04:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
traditional manner of covering absence
 
04:06:41.510 --> 04:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
for vacation personal day leave days and
 
04:06:43.830 --> 04:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
seek leave instead of dividing benefit
 
04:06:45.469 --> 04:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
into a specific number of days for each
 
04:06:47.229 --> 04:06:47.239 align:start position:0%
benefit earn time puts these days
 
04:06:49.630 --> 04:06:49.640 align:start position:0%
together into a single benefit I'm not
 
04:06:51.189 --> 04:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
going to quote the rest of the policy
 
04:06:53.469 --> 04:06:53.479 align:start position:0%
because it's about six pages long
 
04:06:55.790 --> 04:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
but I want to assure you that the town
 
04:06:58.149 --> 04:06:58.159 align:start position:0%
of wiam is a very low Tech
 
04:07:02.309 --> 04:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
employer okay and this is a significant
 
04:07:04.349 --> 04:07:04.359 align:start position:0%
concern because when we start
 
04:07:06.630 --> 04:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
legislating what was happening 5 years
 
04:07:09.469 --> 04:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
ago and we do not recognize these
 
04:07:12.630 --> 04:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
changes we can create I have no idea how
 
04:07:14.990 --> 04:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
the time of town of wiam were they
 
04:07:17.469 --> 04:07:17.479 align:start position:0%
covered by this would be able to apply
 
04:07:19.469 --> 04:07:19.479 align:start position:0%
this because they specifically say we do
 
04:07:21.590 --> 04:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
not split this so how do I know which
 
04:07:24.750 --> 04:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
portion of this ear time is covered by
 
04:07:27.149 --> 04:07:27.159 align:start position:0%
this law by this proposed amendment
 
04:07:29.670 --> 04:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
which is not so I just wanted to bring
 
04:07:31.670 --> 04:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
this to your attention I I don't have a
 
04:07:33.670 --> 04:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
solution but I'm aware of this issue
 
04:07:35.590 --> 04:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
thank you we might have to look up what
 
04:07:38.550 --> 04:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
RSA 275
 
04:07:42.309 --> 04:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
35-a defines as an employer and it since
 
04:07:45.229 --> 04:07:45.239 align:start position:0%
it exempts Una it it might even exempt
 
04:07:48.750 --> 04:07:48.760 align:start position:0%
Municipal County I but does anyone know
 
04:07:51.109 --> 04:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
that's looked at
 
04:07:54.189 --> 04:07:54.199 align:start position:0%
that represent Grassi do you know what
 
04:07:57.710 --> 04:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
all the language is on I'm assuming that
 
04:07:59.469 --> 04:07:59.479 align:start position:0%
the Municipal Employees are covered
 
04:08:01.469 --> 04:08:01.479 align:start position:0%
under the state same statute that state
 
04:08:03.389 --> 04:08:03.399 align:start position:0%
employees would be covered in they'd be
 
04:08:05.670 --> 04:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
exempt I mean maybe our staff can assist
 
04:08:07.349 --> 04:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
us in that I don't think they fall under
 
04:08:10.149 --> 04:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
that same exemption however when they
 
04:08:11.950 --> 04:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
did receive um a request for the
 
04:08:13.870 --> 04:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
original fiscal note that would be too
 
04:08:15.389 --> 04:08:15.399 align:start position:0%
far off from this fiscal note they said
 
04:08:17.630 --> 04:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
there would be no impact to them based
 
04:08:19.630 --> 04:08:19.640 align:start position:0%
on how their own Personnel rules are
 
04:08:22.389 --> 04:08:22.399 align:start position:0%
written no impact on municipalities and
 
04:08:24.630 --> 04:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
so on thank you for looking that up
 
04:08:27.070 --> 04:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate it because obviously that was
 
04:08:29.109 --> 04:08:29.119 align:start position:0%
a question in representative papovich
 
04:08:33.149 --> 04:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
müller's mind so all right we have a
 
04:08:34.710 --> 04:08:34.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment before
 
04:08:37.670 --> 04:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
us and I guess we've changed it now to
 
04:08:40.349 --> 04:08:40.359 align:start position:0%
its a motion by representative grassy
 
04:08:45.070 --> 04:08:45.080 align:start position:0%

on um HB
 
04:15:14.469 --> 04:15:14.479 align:start position:0%

and is your Amendment
 
04:15:20.149 --> 04:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
1086 it is thank you

04:15:27.389 --> 04:15:27.399 align:start position:0%
you Mooney
 
04:15:31.910 --> 04:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
Mooney well hasn't been
 
04:15:36.030 --> 04:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:39.510 --> 04:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
yes the amendment that I'm uh referring
 
04:15:41.910 --> 04:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
to once again is
 
04:15:46.269 --> 04:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
10868 H um it's somewhat difficult to
 
04:15:48.149 --> 04:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
talk about the amendment I guess if I
 
04:15:51.109 --> 04:15:51.119 align:start position:0%
don't talk about the bill itself uh
 
04:15:55.590 --> 04:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
first but um this bill is a bill that
 
04:16:00.070 --> 04:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
would uh ban the sale of products that
 
04:16:04.349 --> 04:16:04.359 align:start position:0%
have pasas intentionally added to them
 
04:16:08.630 --> 04:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
and the ban is to take effect in the
 
04:16:11.309 --> 04:16:11.319 align:start position:0%
bill in July of
 
04:16:13.910 --> 04:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
2028 but through the the com through the
 
04:16:18.550 --> 04:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
process in Commerce we did um refine the
 
04:16:22.349 --> 04:16:22.359 align:start position:0%
bill we removed certain uh Provisions
 
04:16:25.630 --> 04:16:25.640 align:start position:0%
that would make it more challenging for
 
04:16:28.750 --> 04:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
uh manufacturers to comply with and so
 
04:16:32.269 --> 04:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
it was felt in the division that moving
 
04:16:35.469 --> 04:16:35.479 align:start position:0%
the ban uh effective date up to January
 
04:16:35.479 --> 04:16:36.630 align:start position:0%
the ban uh effective date up to January
1st

04:16:36.630 --> 04:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
1st
 
04:16:40.590 --> 04:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
2027 was a good idea and the amendment
 
04:16:44.670 --> 04:16:44.680 align:start position:0%
uh was adopted either 8 to one or
 
04:16:48.630 --> 04:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
7-2 within the um within the
 
04:16:51.429 --> 04:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
division thank
 
04:16:54.670 --> 04:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
you any further discussion on the
 
04:16:57.830 --> 04:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
amendment yes representative Maguire
 
04:16:59.309 --> 04:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
thank you so I'm going to vote against
 
04:17:01.790 --> 04:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
this because I'm against the bill as a
 
04:17:03.950 --> 04:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
whole which I'll talk about when we get
 
04:17:06.910 --> 04:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
to it um but this is moving the
 
04:17:10.109 --> 04:17:10.119 align:start position:0%
effective date up 18 months essentially
 
04:17:13.349 --> 04:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
and so I'm against doing it at all ra
 
04:17:15.790 --> 04:17:15.800 align:start position:0%
and even more also against doing it
 
04:17:20.870 --> 04:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:23.149 --> 04:17:23.159 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
04:17:26.109 --> 04:17:26.119 align:start position:0%
Earth can I ask a question sure the
 
04:17:29.630 --> 04:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
amendment ends with a colon relating to
 
04:17:29.640 --> 04:17:30.469 align:start position:0%
amendment ends with a colon relating to
the

04:17:30.469 --> 04:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:17:30.479 --> 04:17:32.309 align:start position:0%
the
products

04:17:32.309 --> 04:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
products
 
04:17:36.189 --> 04:17:36.199 align:start position:0%
that a list basically is expected there
 
04:17:37.550 --> 04:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
yes so where's the list I mean this is
 
04:17:39.590 --> 04:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
the difficulty of talking about the
 
04:17:41.750 --> 04:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
amendment before we actually talk about
 
04:17:45.429 --> 04:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
the bill so so in the uh bill I have the
 
04:17:50.990 --> 04:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
bill yes in the in the bill as uh it was
 
04:17:54.349 --> 04:17:54.359 align:start position:0%
um as it was passed by the house if you
 
04:17:59.189 --> 04:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
look on page four line 36 you'll see the
 
04:18:02.510 --> 04:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh you'll see the product list thank you
 
04:18:02.520 --> 04:18:04.990 align:start position:0%
uh you'll see the product list thank you
very

04:18:04.990 --> 04:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:07.750 --> 04:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
much uh personally I have stated that I
 
04:18:10.429 --> 04:18:10.439 align:start position:0%
was in strong support of the meramac uh
 
04:18:13.269 --> 04:18:13.279 align:start position:0%
ex testing and I think that
 
04:18:15.750 --> 04:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
that will be the first instance of human
 
04:18:18.630 --> 04:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
testing to try to discover the effect of
 
04:18:22.309 --> 04:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
pasas what I think the uh Department of
 
04:18:24.750 --> 04:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
Environmental security has set is
 
04:18:27.229 --> 04:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
unreasonable they can't show me any real
 
04:18:30.710 --> 04:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
backup uh data other than rodents that
 
04:18:32.710 --> 04:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
12 parts per trillion is such a
 
04:18:35.870 --> 04:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
ridiculously low thing that 10 years ago
 
04:18:37.750 --> 04:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
we couldn't have measured that small in
 
04:18:41.710 --> 04:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
amount and the
 
04:18:44.469 --> 04:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
meramac uh testing going forward will
 
04:18:46.870 --> 04:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
finally give us some human testing and I
 
04:18:49.510 --> 04:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
hope that a lot of people get tested and
 
04:18:51.269 --> 04:18:51.279 align:start position:0%
I think probably any one of us has more
 
04:18:53.189 --> 04:18:53.199 align:start position:0%
than 12 parts per trillion in our body
 
04:18:55.070 --> 04:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
and I wish that they would come out and
 
04:18:56.950 --> 04:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
do testing and I would be happy to
 
04:18:59.790 --> 04:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
volunteer to be tested for p and see how
 
04:19:03.149 --> 04:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
much effect it has had on me and I'm in
 
04:19:07.149 --> 04:19:07.159 align:start position:0%
good health so I'm opposed to Banning
 
04:19:09.389 --> 04:19:09.399 align:start position:0%
things before we have real data from
 
04:19:11.710 --> 04:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
humans this is going to be a very
 
04:19:13.910 --> 04:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
expensive especially especially if if we
 
04:19:16.109 --> 04:19:16.119 align:start position:0%
get away with Dees going to 12 parts per
 
04:19:18.510 --> 04:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
trillion on every water system in the
 
04:19:22.389 --> 04:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
state without real data so I I can see
 
04:19:24.309 --> 04:19:24.319 align:start position:0%
why there's a push to do this because of
 
04:19:26.469 --> 04:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
what's happened in marac but to my mind
 
04:19:29.349 --> 04:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
it's incomplete at this point Thank you
 
04:19:29.359 --> 04:19:31.429 align:start position:0%
it's incomplete at this point Thank you
anybody

04:19:31.429 --> 04:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
04:19:34.950 --> 04:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
else representative Griffin I I've I've
 
04:19:37.469 --> 04:19:37.479 align:start position:0%
kind of come full circle I was impressed
 
04:19:42.710 --> 04:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
with how much work U uh representative
 
04:19:47.030 --> 04:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
EV had had done on this bill and I know
 
04:19:49.590 --> 04:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
she spent hours and hours and and
 
04:19:52.550 --> 04:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
consulted with a lot of people but I'm
 
04:19:55.429 --> 04:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
still afraid you know there's there's
 
04:19:57.510 --> 04:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
some other states that have
 
04:20:03.590 --> 04:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
bills and we this bill is you know it's
 
04:20:07.109 --> 04:20:07.119 align:start position:0%
it's setting the trail kind of Blazing
 
04:20:09.710 --> 04:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
the trail we're ahead of the federal
 
04:20:13.670 --> 04:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
government which usually is not the case
 
04:20:16.429 --> 04:20:16.439 align:start position:0%
and I think I've come full circle on it
 
04:20:19.710 --> 04:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
so I I'm I don't think I'm going to
 
04:20:22.670 --> 04:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
support it I was I was more in support
 
04:20:26.830 --> 04:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
and committee originally but the more I
 
04:20:29.309 --> 04:20:29.319 align:start position:0%
the more I thought about it and looked
 
04:20:32.590 --> 04:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
at the situation I'm just afraid that
 
04:20:35.469 --> 04:20:35.479 align:start position:0%
we're doing it without with insufficient
 
04:20:38.910 --> 04:20:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:42.630 --> 04:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
doing representative eel thank you um m
 
04:20:44.510 --> 04:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I was going to wait to talk
 
04:20:47.630 --> 04:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
about the more substantive um parts of
 
04:20:49.670 --> 04:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
the bill until we had voted on the
 
04:20:52.109 --> 04:20:52.119 align:start position:0%
amendment but I feel like we're talking
 
04:20:54.030 --> 04:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
about the substantive Parts at this
 
04:20:56.510 --> 04:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
point so I'd like to have an opportunity
 
04:21:00.109 --> 04:21:00.119 align:start position:0%
to talk about the bill itself um first
 
04:21:02.670 --> 04:21:02.680 align:start position:0%
of all I just would like to say that St
 
04:21:06.109 --> 04:21:06.119 align:start position:0%
gobain was the first instance in which
 
04:21:08.950 --> 04:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
the people in maram and many of the area
 
04:21:12.710 --> 04:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
towns experienced p and PAs contamin
 
04:21:16.870 --> 04:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
ation we all know about the uh terrible
 
04:21:20.710 --> 04:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
effects of that and the state is already
 
04:21:23.590 --> 04:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
um spending upwards of hundred million
 
04:21:27.349 --> 04:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
in remediation costs um and the state
 
04:21:31.830 --> 04:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
actually is in the middle of a huge um
 
04:21:36.149 --> 04:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh lawsuit to recoup the damages for
 
04:21:38.950 --> 04:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
that and in the complaint itself it
 
04:21:41.670 --> 04:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
lists all the problems with past that
 
04:21:46.429 --> 04:21:46.439 align:start position:0%
we've come to to know about so St gobain
 
04:21:49.189 --> 04:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
uh was number one we now have a ticking
 
04:21:51.550 --> 04:21:51.560 align:start position:0%
time bomb in the fact that many many of
 
04:21:54.109 --> 04:21:54.119 align:start position:0%
our products I mean practically
 
04:21:57.950 --> 04:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
everything you look at has p in it um
 
04:22:01.149 --> 04:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
this bill was well discussed and
 
04:22:04.870 --> 04:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
reviewed in Commerce we had a very full
 
04:22:07.389 --> 04:22:07.399 align:start position:0%
hearing on it and we had two lengthy
 
04:22:10.429 --> 04:22:10.439 align:start position:0%
work sessions and we discussed in great
 
04:22:14.030 --> 04:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
detail the policy itself the products
 
04:22:18.030 --> 04:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
certain exclusions which I worked out um
 
04:22:21.950 --> 04:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
and and many other aspects of the bill
 
04:22:25.429 --> 04:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
uh Commerce did vote 16-3 in favor of
 
04:22:27.750 --> 04:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended and they were
 
04:22:30.710 --> 04:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic about uh the prospect of
 
04:22:33.070 --> 04:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
this bill there was no debate on the
 
04:22:36.149 --> 04:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
floor whatsoever and the bill passed on
 
04:22:41.189 --> 04:22:41.199 align:start position:0%
a Voice vote um I Heard very few stray
 
04:22:44.269 --> 04:22:44.279 align:start position:0%
voices I won't say it was unanimous but
 
04:22:46.910 --> 04:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
there was virtually no disagreement on
 
04:22:49.830 --> 04:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
the bill um in the division it was
 
04:22:53.870 --> 04:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
recommended for a passage 5 to four um I
 
04:22:56.109 --> 04:22:56.119 align:start position:0%
brought the bill as the chair of the
 
04:22:58.510 --> 04:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
state's Solid Waste working group which
 
04:23:00.550 --> 04:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
is a broad stakeholder group that
 
04:23:04.469 --> 04:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
includes industry people um Advocates
 
04:23:07.309 --> 04:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities it's a very broad group
 
04:23:09.710 --> 04:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
and it was brought forward in support of
 
04:23:12.830 --> 04:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
the state's Solid Waste Management plan
 
04:23:15.389 --> 04:23:15.399 align:start position:0%
uh in an effort to reduce toxicity in
 
04:23:19.030 --> 04:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
the waist stream the toxicity uh comes
 
04:23:21.550 --> 04:23:21.560 align:start position:0%
from the products the products that goes
 
04:23:24.229 --> 04:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
into US it goes into landfills landfill
 
04:23:27.389 --> 04:23:27.399 align:start position:0%
leachate it's in Wastewater wastewater
 
04:23:30.510 --> 04:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
treatment plants drinking utilities um
 
04:23:33.950 --> 04:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
and and or drinking water ground water
 
04:23:39.030 --> 04:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
and so when I put forth the bill it was
 
04:23:41.670 --> 04:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
astonishing the broad support that the
 
04:23:44.269 --> 04:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
bill had and I think only something like
 
04:23:46.830 --> 04:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
P could bring together landfill
 
04:23:49.590 --> 04:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
operators clean water Advocates
 
04:23:51.950 --> 04:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant operators
 
04:23:55.229 --> 04:23:55.239 align:start position:0%
drinking utilities um the New Hampshire
 
04:23:58.109 --> 04:23:58.119 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association and the Public
 
04:24:02.469 --> 04:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
Health Association as well as um
 
04:24:05.309 --> 04:24:05.319 align:start position:0%
epidemiologists um this bill I have
 
04:24:07.710 --> 04:24:07.720 align:start position:0%
carefully crafted and discussed with the
 
04:24:10.309 --> 04:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee the items that are
 
04:24:13.389 --> 04:24:13.399 align:start position:0%
included for Banning are being are also
 
04:24:16.550 --> 04:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
being banned in other states quite a few
 
04:24:21.229 --> 04:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
of them um and the deadline of 2027
 
04:24:25.269 --> 04:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
actually is two years after 2025 when
 
04:24:28.550 --> 04:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
all of the um other bands are going into
 
04:24:32.429 --> 04:24:32.439 align:start position:0%
effect the items proposed are carpets or
 
04:24:36.429 --> 04:24:36.439 align:start position:0%
rugs um which bear huge P load into our
 
04:24:38.149 --> 04:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
landfills and it's also where our
 
04:24:41.670 --> 04:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
children crawl around Cosmetics directly
 
04:24:44.469 --> 04:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
apply to our faces there's a lot of
 
04:24:47.550 --> 04:24:47.560 align:start position:0%
exposure there textile treatments is
 
04:24:49.469 --> 04:24:49.479 align:start position:0%
fabric treatments the things that you
 
04:24:52.149 --> 04:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
put on your carpets and I'm sorry if
 
04:24:54.109 --> 04:24:54.119 align:start position:0%
this is banned your spaghetti stain
 
04:24:57.030 --> 04:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
might not come off as easily feminine
 
04:25:00.670 --> 04:25:00.680 align:start position:0%
hygiene products um food packaging which
 
04:25:03.469 --> 04:25:03.479 align:start position:0%
obviously uh to the extent that it has P
 
04:25:05.990 --> 04:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
fast we're ingesting it juvenile
 
04:25:08.030 --> 04:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
products and I'd like to really put in a
 
04:25:10.309 --> 04:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
plug for this these are products that
 
04:25:12.349 --> 04:25:12.359 align:start position:0%
are sold for children that are 12 years
 
04:25:14.870 --> 04:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
years old and under I don't know about
 
04:25:17.309 --> 04:25:17.319 align:start position:0%
you but I don't necessarily want my
 
04:25:19.429 --> 04:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
grandchild sleeping on a mattress with
 
04:25:22.950 --> 04:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
peass or wearing diapers with them and
 
04:25:26.070 --> 04:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
um it's a real concern personal
 
04:25:28.389 --> 04:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
protective equipment our professional
 
04:25:31.590 --> 04:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
firefighters were staunch um supporters
 
04:25:34.349 --> 04:25:34.359 align:start position:0%
of this bill upholstered furniture again
 
04:25:36.790 --> 04:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
I've mentioned the spaghetti problem and
 
04:25:39.870 --> 04:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
then textile Furnishings are um things
 
04:25:42.429 --> 04:25:42.439 align:start position:0%
like your your drapes so you're inside
 
04:25:46.550 --> 04:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
and you're breathing the uh the pasas
 
04:25:50.429 --> 04:25:50.439 align:start position:0%
that's how that um list was developed it
 
04:25:52.950 --> 04:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
was taking into consideration direct
 
04:25:56.710 --> 04:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
exposure and also past load in our in
 
04:25:59.870 --> 04:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
our landfills um I want to just quickly
 
04:26:03.229 --> 04:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
bring to your attention um a Minnesota
 
04:26:07.309 --> 04:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
study which said that um pasas can be
 
04:26:11.389 --> 04:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
bought for 50 to ,000 per pound but cost
 
04:26:15.710 --> 04:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
between two .7 and $18 million per pound
 
04:26:19.070 --> 04:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
to remove and Destroy from Municipal
 
04:26:21.670 --> 04:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
Wastewater now I'd just like to mention
 
04:26:24.429 --> 04:26:24.439 align:start position:0%
we've all we're all very familiar in
 
04:26:26.710 --> 04:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
this uh committee the amount of money
 
04:26:28.630 --> 04:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
that has been spent on upgrading
 
04:26:31.469 --> 04:26:31.479 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants I can tell
 
04:26:33.790 --> 04:26:33.800 align:start position:0%
you that there are federal regulations
 
04:26:37.670 --> 04:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
being considered where uh testing will
 
04:26:40.349 --> 04:26:40.359 align:start position:0%
have to be done for Waste Water being
 
04:26:42.750 --> 04:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
released into surface water and
 
04:26:45.710 --> 04:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
groundwater for pasas that does not
 
04:26:48.070 --> 04:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
happen now and I shudder to think the
 
04:26:50.070 --> 04:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
amount of money it's going to cost for
 
04:26:53.309 --> 04:26:53.319 align:start position:0%
Wastewater um treatment upgrades we
 
04:26:55.189 --> 04:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
already know that our drinking water
 
04:26:58.429 --> 04:26:58.439 align:start position:0%
utilities are uh staggering under the
 
04:27:01.429 --> 04:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
cost of doing that so whether you agree
 
04:27:03.550 --> 04:27:03.560 align:start position:0%
that the testing limits are too low or
 
04:27:07.750 --> 04:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
not those costs um exist as far as
 
04:27:12.189 --> 04:27:12.199 align:start position:0%
finances um you know this has one um
 
04:27:14.990 --> 04:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
employee at Dees to uh oversee the
 
04:27:17.590 --> 04:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
program and get it going it is time
 
04:27:20.349 --> 04:27:20.359 align:start position:0%
capped at the so it doesn't keep going
 
04:27:22.269 --> 04:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
so we can reassess if we need that
 
04:27:25.109 --> 04:27:25.119 align:start position:0%
position to keep going at the request of
 
04:27:27.750 --> 04:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh the chair of Commerce that is in
 
04:27:30.030 --> 04:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
there um and then there's an
 
04:27:31.830 --> 04:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
appropriation of
 
04:27:36.149 --> 04:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
$250,000 to get the um get the program
 
04:27:38.389 --> 04:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
going will'll be participating in
 
04:27:40.469 --> 04:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
multi-state Clearing Houses which
 
04:27:42.670 --> 04:27:42.680 align:start position:0%
streamline the process for
 
04:27:42.680 --> 04:27:44.229 align:start position:0%
streamline the process for
manufacturers

04:27:44.229 --> 04:27:44.239 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
04:27:44.239 --> 04:27:46.030 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
so

04:27:46.030 --> 04:27:46.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:27:49.910 --> 04:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
um when you go through all those things
 
04:27:52.910 --> 04:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
um and you think about the unbelievable
 
04:27:55.070 --> 04:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
burden that the state of New Hampshire
 
04:27:57.710 --> 04:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
is already struggling with and our
 
04:28:00.229 --> 04:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
people are facing Health Care concerns
 
04:28:03.149 --> 04:28:03.159 align:start position:0%
and extreme costs it makes every bit of
 
04:28:06.550 --> 04:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
sense not to keep using pasas in our
 
04:28:09.510 --> 04:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
products but to stop the problem at the
 
04:28:12.710 --> 04:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
source and this is our opportunity
 
04:28:14.429 --> 04:28:14.439 align:start position:0%
and I think our state should be really
 
04:28:17.229 --> 04:28:17.239 align:start position:0%
proud to step forward considering what
 
04:28:19.750 --> 04:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's already been through from the from
 
04:28:22.990 --> 04:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
the uh from these chemicals so with that
 
04:28:24.830 --> 04:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I'm not sure when you would
 
04:28:26.750 --> 04:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
like to vote on the amendment but I
 
04:28:28.870 --> 04:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
thought considering that everything else
 
04:28:32.630 --> 04:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
was being discussed I should um talk
 
04:28:35.309 --> 04:28:35.319 align:start position:0%
about the bill substantively so thank
 
04:28:36.790 --> 04:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you for all your
 
04:28:38.830 --> 04:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
research did you're welcome did the
 
04:28:43.030 --> 04:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
firefighting foam get removed um so so I
 
04:28:45.910 --> 04:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
I I'm happy to talk about it this all
 
04:28:50.469 --> 04:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
day as anybody knows but um actually in
 
04:28:55.389 --> 04:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
the order of bands firefighting foam was
 
04:28:58.109 --> 04:28:58.119 align:start position:0%
um the p and firefighting foam was
 
04:29:00.429 --> 04:29:00.439 align:start position:0%
banned by New Hampshire in 2020 and if
 
04:29:02.149 --> 04:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
you look at my graph we were actually
 
04:29:04.910 --> 04:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
the first state to do that um and the
 
04:29:07.590 --> 04:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
definition that is in this bill is the
 
04:29:11.309 --> 04:29:11.319 align:start position:0%
same definition and um the firefighters
 
04:29:13.750 --> 04:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
are really excited that we're going to
 
04:29:17.229 --> 04:29:17.239 align:start position:0%
go forward uh well with any luck here uh
 
04:29:19.269 --> 04:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to go forward to ban
 
04:29:22.309 --> 04:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
additional uh products and I just want
 
04:29:26.510 --> 04:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
to reemphasize that this is a business
 
04:29:30.429 --> 04:29:30.439 align:start position:0%
Public Health clean water advocacy uh
 
04:29:33.510 --> 04:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
supported Bill bringing together groups
 
04:29:36.349 --> 04:29:36.359 align:start position:0%
that you might not see again any time
 
04:29:38.429 --> 04:29:38.439 align:start position:0%
soon thank you for your thoroughness
 
04:29:40.910 --> 04:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
sure all right we have before us is
 
04:29:42.429 --> 04:29:42.439 align:start position:0%
there any further discussion on the
 
04:29:44.229 --> 04:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
amendment that's the first item we have
 
04:29:47.910 --> 04:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
before us seeing none all right the
 
04:29:51.030 --> 04:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
amendment before us is
 
04:29:53.870 --> 04:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
1086 anybody object to show of hands all
 
04:29:57.349 --> 04:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
in favor of the amendment 1086 please
 
04:30:04.670 --> 04:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:10.950 --> 04:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:10.960 --> 04:30:14.790 align:start position:0%
 
opposed

04:30:14.790 --> 04:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:17.950 --> 04:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
all right I didn't vote 13-7 the the
 
04:30:21.309 --> 04:30:21.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:24.229 --> 04:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
adopted we got 24 people the hell did
 
04:30:27.109 --> 04:30:27.119 align:start position:0%
you count who else didn't vote 13 to 11
 
04:30:28.550 --> 04:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
13 to
 
04:30:28.560 --> 04:30:34.149 align:start position:0%

04:30:37.950 --> 04:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
okay all right so now the motion before
 
04:30:42.590 --> 04:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
us is ought to pass on House Bill 1649
 
04:30:46.389 --> 04:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
as amended by uh Amendment
 
04:30:49.070 --> 04:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
1086 is there any further discussion on
 
04:30:51.469 --> 04:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
that motion of aop pass as amended

and
 
04:31:45.950 --> 04:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
drinking I want to remind this committee
 
04:31:49.630 --> 04:31:49.640 align:start position:0%
that as part of the budget last year we
 
04:31:53.189 --> 04:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
included a phase three of a feasibility
 
04:31:58.469 --> 04:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
report for health at a cost of about
 
04:32:03.510 --> 04:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
$500,000 now phase three has only been
 
04:32:05.389 --> 04:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
uh granted or
 
04:32:10.429 --> 04:32:10.439 align:start position:0%
needed two times in 10 years why because
 
04:32:14.469 --> 04:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
of the severity of concentrated cancer
 
04:32:17.550 --> 04:32:17.560 align:start position:0%
cases in my
 
04:32:20.870 --> 04:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
town we have spent hundreds of millions
 
04:32:25.149 --> 04:32:25.159 align:start position:0%
of dollars already on this scenario but
 
04:32:26.830 --> 04:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
I want to talk about the hundreds of
 
04:32:31.269 --> 04:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
thousands of hours we have spent as a
 
04:32:34.309 --> 04:32:34.319 align:start position:0%
community on commissions with the
 
04:32:36.590 --> 04:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
04:32:38.349 --> 04:32:38.359 align:start position:0%

04:32:44.990 --> 04:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
Council private you know behind closed
 
04:32:48.070 --> 04:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
doors and really the conclusion is all
 
04:32:52.109 --> 04:32:52.119 align:start position:0%
the same the only way to stop it is to
 
04:32:56.630 --> 04:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
prohibit it and this bill starts that
 
04:32:59.149 --> 04:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
prohibition so for that reason I will be
 
04:33:01.670 --> 04:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
voting yes on this bill and I encourage
 
04:33:04.910 --> 04:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
all to do the same thank you Mr chair
 
04:33:07.070 --> 04:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
04:33:09.709 --> 04:33:09.719 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire thank you Mr
 
04:33:14.990 --> 04:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
chairman um I have a a handout um that
 
04:33:17.551 --> 04:33:17.561 align:start position:0%
kind of I want to illustrate what what
 
04:33:21.230 --> 04:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
it is we're doing with this um uh with
 
04:33:26.629 --> 04:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
this bill so the bill does not just
 
04:33:30.349 --> 04:33:30.359 align:start position:0%
ban um the definition of pasas in the
 
04:33:34.029 --> 04:33:34.039 align:start position:0%
bill is not just the chemical um that
 
04:33:35.070 --> 04:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
was in
 
04:33:37.789 --> 04:33:37.799 align:start position:0%
marac it's
 
04:33:41.310 --> 04:33:41.320 align:start position:0%
15,000 chemical combinations right that
 
04:33:44.629 --> 04:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
are that are all quite
 
04:33:49.789 --> 04:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
useful to Industry right so and we're
 
04:33:52.269 --> 04:33:52.279 align:start position:0%
not talk and and the number of products
 
04:33:56.470 --> 04:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
involved in the ban
 
04:33:59.551 --> 04:33:59.561 align:start position:0%
um must be in the hundreds of thousands
 
04:34:00.750 --> 04:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
that are
 
04:34:06.269 --> 04:34:06.279 align:start position:0%
affected um so this is the this is the
 
04:34:11.830 --> 04:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
um uh front page of uh Wikipedia on PT
 
04:34:15.949 --> 04:34:15.959 align:start position:0%
Fe which is uh the technical term for
 
04:34:20.789 --> 04:34:20.799 align:start position:0%
teflon so what the bill defines as p is
 
04:34:23.590 --> 04:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
fully fluorinated carbon so if you look
 
04:34:26.830 --> 04:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
at the chemical formula here for for
 
04:34:29.830 --> 04:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
PTFE it's a carbon atom with two Florine
 
04:34:32.470 --> 04:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
atoms attached to it and it's in this
 
04:34:34.269 --> 04:34:34.279 align:start position:0%
long string it's attached to other
 
04:34:38.230 --> 04:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
carbon atoms so what the bill bands is
 
04:34:40.910 --> 04:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
any chem any item that has a chemical
 
04:34:44.269 --> 04:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
formula with one of these such carbon
 
04:34:47.189 --> 04:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
atoms right so if somewhere in the in
 
04:34:50.269 --> 04:34:50.279 align:start position:0%
the chemical formula of the item there
 
04:34:52.670 --> 04:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
is a carbon atom and two Florine atoms
 
04:34:56.551 --> 04:34:56.561 align:start position:0%
attached to it this bill and it's on the
 
04:34:59.230 --> 04:34:59.240 align:start position:0%
list of of items being banned this bill
 
04:35:01.470 --> 04:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
bans it that's what we Define as pasas
 
04:35:03.990 --> 04:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
here so it's not just whatever was in
 
04:35:06.429 --> 04:35:06.439 align:start position:0%
marac right which was
 
04:35:10.429 --> 04:35:10.439 align:start position:0%
something I I believe was a precursor to
 
04:35:14.390 --> 04:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
PTFE but but it's like anything and that
 
04:35:17.470 --> 04:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
incl the that particular
 
04:35:21.429 --> 04:35:21.439 align:start position:0%
definition um if you go to the back page
 
04:35:24.830 --> 04:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
this is just a section of things that
 
04:35:28.590 --> 04:35:28.600 align:start position:0%
include such such chemicals right so
 
04:35:31.590 --> 04:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
lubricants kitchen wear so Teflon itself
 
04:35:33.789 --> 04:35:33.799 align:start position:0%
is not banned by this bill as far as I
 
04:35:35.869 --> 04:35:35.879 align:start position:0%
can tell
 
04:35:39.629 --> 04:35:39.639 align:start position:0%
um even though it ATT it it touches food
 
04:35:42.910 --> 04:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
and all that sort of stuff um the soles
 
04:35:45.310 --> 04:35:45.320 align:start position:0%
the plates on irons not banned by this
 
04:35:48.150 --> 04:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
bill but things that are um fabric
 
04:35:49.789 --> 04:35:49.799 align:start position:0%
related things so the
 
04:35:53.470 --> 04:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
bill um bans any
 
04:35:58.990 --> 04:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
textile that has PTF p p in it by that
 
04:36:01.750 --> 04:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
definition so that that as far as I know
 
04:36:01.760 --> 04:36:02.709 align:start position:0%
definition so that that as far as I know
is

04:36:02.709 --> 04:36:02.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:36:06.869 --> 04:36:06.879 align:start position:0%
gortex um and it also bans any kind of
 
04:36:10.189 --> 04:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
um stain resistance stuff stain
 
04:36:13.470 --> 04:36:13.480 align:start position:0%
resistant carpet um Scotch Guard all
 
04:36:17.230 --> 04:36:17.240 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff right um but but you
 
04:36:19.590 --> 04:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
see how you see all these uses medical
 
04:36:22.910 --> 04:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
uses this is often used on catheters for
 
04:36:27.390 --> 04:36:27.400 align:start position:0%
example um uh Sports and medical stuff
 
04:36:33.230 --> 04:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
uh pyrotechnics etc etc so so this is
 
04:36:35.150 --> 04:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
anything that has
 
04:36:39.150 --> 04:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:42.470 --> 04:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
compounds this is a big deal this is not
 
04:36:44.830 --> 04:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
you know some some little something that
 
04:36:47.349 --> 04:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
that we can just say take that thing off
 
04:36:51.709 --> 04:36:51.719 align:start position:0%
the market right this is this is in all
 
04:36:54.949 --> 04:36:54.959 align:start position:0%
kinds of things and it's very
 
04:36:59.230 --> 04:36:59.240 align:start position:0%
useful because it's so stable right they
 
04:37:02.109 --> 04:37:02.119 align:start position:0%
they call this the forever chemical but
 
04:37:04.510 --> 04:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's so stable because it won't
 
04:37:06.070 --> 04:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
combine with other things that's what
 
04:37:08.310 --> 04:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
makes it stain resistant right it it
 
04:37:10.230 --> 04:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
keeps the thing that wants to combine
 
04:37:12.750 --> 04:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
with your carpet off your carpet or the
 
04:37:15.670 --> 04:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
or the or the water off your jacket or
 
04:37:19.910 --> 04:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
the whatever right the one word in the
 
04:37:22.510 --> 04:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
bill that it banss is
 
04:37:28.310 --> 04:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
ink right so so in in the grocery store
 
04:37:32.230 --> 04:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
every container has a label if the ink
 
04:37:35.789 --> 04:37:35.799 align:start position:0%
on that label has pest in it by this
 
04:37:38.189 --> 04:37:38.199 align:start position:0%
definition has one of those atoms in the
 
04:37:41.949 --> 04:37:41.959 align:start position:0%
in the chemical that makes up the ink
 
04:37:45.830 --> 04:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
that item that canabas or whatever it is
 
04:37:46.949 --> 04:37:46.959 align:start position:0%
will be
 
04:37:51.910 --> 04:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
banned right so um well that label on
 
04:37:53.310 --> 04:37:53.320 align:start position:0%
that can right you'd have to come up
 
04:37:55.869 --> 04:37:55.879 align:start position:0%
with a label that doesn't but but it
 
04:38:01.709 --> 04:38:01.719 align:start position:0%
seems to me that it's likely that that
 
04:38:04.310 --> 04:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
the property of pasas is important to
 
04:38:08.150 --> 04:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
the printing process right that that the
 
04:38:10.709 --> 04:38:10.719 align:start position:0%
the it has the property that it doesn't
 
04:38:13.551 --> 04:38:13.561 align:start position:0%
combine with water right so that's the
 
04:38:16.189 --> 04:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
way a lot of printing works is is you
 
04:38:18.830 --> 04:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
put water down on a printing plate then
 
04:38:21.070 --> 04:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
you dip it in ink and the ink sticks to
 
04:38:23.390 --> 04:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
the places that don't have the water and
 
04:38:25.551 --> 04:38:25.561 align:start position:0%
then you print right
 
04:38:29.551 --> 04:38:29.561 align:start position:0%
so so I'm not sure we know everything
 
04:38:32.429 --> 04:38:32.439 align:start position:0%
that's being banned here right and and
 
04:38:34.949 --> 04:38:34.959 align:start position:0%
the idea that this could this ban of
 
04:38:38.109 --> 04:38:38.119 align:start position:0%
hundreds of every every label on the in
 
04:38:40.150 --> 04:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
every in every shelf of the grocery
 
04:38:43.629 --> 04:38:43.639 align:start position:0%
store uh every piece of cloth on you
 
04:38:46.830 --> 04:38:46.840 align:start position:0%
know sold in any store that that somehow
 
04:38:49.429 --> 04:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to regulate all that with
 
04:38:49.439 --> 04:38:50.949 align:start position:0%
we're going to regulate all that with
one

04:38:50.949 --> 04:38:50.959 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:38:53.470 --> 04:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
employee I I mean this is a feel-good
 
04:38:55.510 --> 04:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
kind of thing it's it can't it it
 
04:38:58.670 --> 04:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily has to be selective
 
04:39:02.629 --> 04:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
enforcement um and so therefore they can
 
04:39:04.910 --> 04:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
decide well I'll go after you today or
 
04:39:07.750 --> 04:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
I'll get go after you today I mean if if
 
04:39:11.670 --> 04:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
they went to some Craft brewery and said
 
04:39:15.109 --> 04:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
I suspect that that uh the ink on your
 
04:39:19.269 --> 04:39:19.279 align:start position:0%
beer can contains P the way the bill is
 
04:39:22.949 --> 04:39:22.959 align:start position:0%
written the person who who sells the
 
04:39:25.949 --> 04:39:25.959 align:start position:0%
beer who who makes the beer can would
 
04:39:28.230 --> 04:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
have to send a letter back with with a
 
04:39:30.269 --> 04:39:30.279 align:start position:0%
cert you know with a a big shot
 
04:39:32.670 --> 04:39:32.680 align:start position:0%
signature on it saying no it doesn't
 
04:39:35.349 --> 04:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
right otherwise the beer is banned well
 
04:39:37.590 --> 04:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
who's going to sign such a letter do you
 
04:39:40.350 --> 04:39:40.360 align:start position:0%
think the the the Craft brewery knows
 
04:39:42.310 --> 04:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
what's in the ink on the their cans you
 
04:39:45.510 --> 04:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
know I mean it's just
 
04:39:49.830 --> 04:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
um this is a a big deal and and the
 
04:39:52.470 --> 04:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
amount of money involved is not the
 
04:39:55.628 --> 04:39:55.638 align:start position:0%
$240,000 in the fiscal note it's it's
 
04:39:59.390 --> 04:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
going to be big big stuff all throughout
 
04:40:03.110 --> 04:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
industry and and the state in my opinion
 
04:40:05.708 --> 04:40:05.718 align:start position:0%
um all right so I'm I'm going to put
 
04:40:07.948 --> 04:40:07.958 align:start position:0%
more in my floor speech and so on but I
 
04:40:09.910 --> 04:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
but I you know I'm I'm definitely
 
04:40:11.670 --> 04:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
opposed to this thank you thank you Mr
 
04:40:12.910 --> 04:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
chair represent Abel and then
 
04:40:14.310 --> 04:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
representative papichi then
 
04:40:14.320 --> 04:40:17.470 align:start position:0%
representative papichi then
representative

04:40:17.470 --> 04:40:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:20.110 --> 04:40:20.120 align:start position:0%
Murray I mean we could talk about this
 
04:40:23.470 --> 04:40:23.480 align:start position:0%
for a really long time there's I would
 
04:40:27.190 --> 04:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
argue that because we have a chemical
 
04:40:30.190 --> 04:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
that is a forever chemical that's used
 
04:40:33.350 --> 04:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
in so many products that is found
 
04:40:36.788 --> 04:40:36.798 align:start position:0%
throughout our state in our soil because
 
04:40:40.310 --> 04:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
the USG has done studies in our
 
04:40:44.470 --> 04:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
groundwater because Dees has a dashboard
 
04:40:47.350 --> 04:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
that shows it is precisely the reason
 
04:40:50.310 --> 04:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
why we have to stop somewhere to stop
 
04:40:53.948 --> 04:40:53.958 align:start position:0%
the proliferation of this chemical um
 
04:40:53.958 --> 04:40:55.070 align:start position:0%
the proliferation of this chemical um
you

04:40:55.070 --> 04:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:40:58.708 --> 04:40:58.718 align:start position:0%
know with due respect to representative
 
04:41:01.910 --> 04:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
Maguire um I have literally spent five
 
04:41:04.430 --> 04:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
to six months on this researching the
 
04:41:09.070 --> 04:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
chemistry researching the products um I
 
04:41:13.070 --> 04:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
didn't bring forth a bill that I thought
 
04:41:15.628 --> 04:41:15.638 align:start position:0%
would be over the toop for the State of
 
04:41:18.948 --> 04:41:18.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I brought forth a bill
 
04:41:22.430 --> 04:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
that has products that are banned in it
 
04:41:24.590 --> 04:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
that are being banned in quite a few
 
04:41:27.350 --> 04:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
other states larger States than New
 
04:41:30.030 --> 04:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so the manufacturers are
 
04:41:33.310 --> 04:41:33.320 align:start position:0%
already in the process and this is like
 
04:41:35.948 --> 04:41:35.958 align:start position:0%
a case of dominoes you can keep pushing
 
04:41:39.708 --> 04:41:39.718 align:start position:0%
things along and you know uh Cosmetics
 
04:41:42.190 --> 04:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
for instance in California they have a
 
04:41:45.910 --> 04:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
100% ban on P and cosmetics this is
 
04:41:50.070 --> 04:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
intentionally added um the whole thing
 
04:41:53.070 --> 04:41:53.080 align:start position:0%
you can talk about 15,000 chemicals you
 
04:41:55.948 --> 04:41:55.958 align:start position:0%
can talk about all the products the fact
 
04:41:58.190 --> 04:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
of the matter is that when you have
 
04:42:01.990 --> 04:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
these Florine chlorine bonds that's what
 
04:42:04.350 --> 04:42:04.360 align:start position:0%
makes them the forever chemical and
 
04:42:07.430 --> 04:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
that's what makes them um in many cases
 
04:42:10.670 --> 04:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
toxic and that's why they're everywhere
 
04:42:13.470 --> 04:42:13.480 align:start position:0%
and you know I have sat with the
 
04:42:15.470 --> 04:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
toxicologist for the State of New
 
04:42:17.788 --> 04:42:17.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we've gone over chemical
 
04:42:20.948 --> 04:42:20.958 align:start position:0%
equations until he was blue in the face
 
04:42:24.590 --> 04:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure what color I was but we
 
04:42:28.510 --> 04:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
need to start somewhere and I guess the
 
04:42:31.788 --> 04:42:31.798 align:start position:0%
one other thing I want to say is that I
 
04:42:35.270 --> 04:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
also chose products where the p in the
 
04:42:38.230 --> 04:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
product was not something that was
 
04:42:41.190 --> 04:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
essential to the product there are no
 
04:42:43.550 --> 04:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
medical devices in here they're excluded
 
04:42:45.830 --> 04:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
there's no drugs that are in here that
 
04:42:49.310 --> 04:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
are excluded um you
 
04:42:52.990 --> 04:42:53.000 align:start position:0%
know so and when and then the other uh
 
04:42:55.830 --> 04:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
analysis I did was for our children and
 
04:42:58.788 --> 04:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
also the amount of pfast load that goes
 
04:43:00.830 --> 04:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
into the landfills and into our
 
04:43:05.150 --> 04:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
Wastewater stream so you know it is I'll
 
04:43:07.708 --> 04:43:07.718 align:start position:0%
say it is a big deal it's really really
 
04:43:10.550 --> 04:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
important and we have to stop using this
 
04:43:13.070 --> 04:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
stuff in our products for the future of
 
04:43:13.080 --> 04:43:14.310 align:start position:0%
stuff in our products for the future of
our

04:43:14.310 --> 04:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:43:16.990 --> 04:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
state representative papovich Müller
 
04:43:18.230 --> 04:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
then representative Heath then
 
04:43:20.868 --> 04:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
representative grass thank you Mr
 
04:43:23.868 --> 04:43:23.878 align:start position:0%
chairman I deeply appreciate the real
 
04:43:27.788 --> 04:43:27.798 align:start position:0%
issue that sorry yeah okay I really
 
04:43:30.070 --> 04:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that we absolutely
 
04:43:32.270 --> 04:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
have a situation in marac and across the
 
04:43:34.110 --> 04:43:34.120 align:start position:0%
state that needs addressing I appreciate
 
04:43:36.948 --> 04:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
the passion and the work invested in
 
04:43:38.670 --> 04:43:38.680 align:start position:0%
this by everybody who is involved in
 
04:43:41.310 --> 04:43:41.320 align:start position:0%
preparing the bill I still am unable to
 
04:43:44.788 --> 04:43:44.798 align:start position:0%
support it and I'll be as brief I can as
 
04:43:48.310 --> 04:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
I can be poison is a matter of those
 
04:43:50.030 --> 04:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
anytime we talk poison and we do not
 
04:43:52.708 --> 04:43:52.718 align:start position:0%
talk those we are not being scientific
 
04:43:54.390 --> 04:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
we are not being reasonable we are not
 
04:43:56.550 --> 04:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
being fact
 
04:43:59.310 --> 04:43:59.320 align:start position:0%
based I'm drinking
 
04:44:02.510 --> 04:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
soda caffeine is poisonous in the right
 
04:44:05.390 --> 04:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
dosage taking off of it you die even
 
04:44:08.030 --> 04:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
more fun water is poisonous in the wrong
 
04:44:12.470 --> 04:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
dosage you drink enough of it you die so
 
04:44:14.190 --> 04:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
without talking those everything is
 
04:44:15.868 --> 04:44:15.878 align:start position:0%
poisonous almost
 
04:44:18.070 --> 04:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
everything marijuana is somehow an
 
04:44:20.030 --> 04:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
exception you'd have to eat about 20
 
04:44:23.030 --> 04:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
times your body weight to suffer from
 
04:44:26.670 --> 04:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
it so without talking about dosage
 
04:44:28.750 --> 04:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
anything that bans stuff and does not
 
04:44:32.788 --> 04:44:32.798 align:start position:0%
specify a dose is not going to be
 
04:44:35.990 --> 04:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
scientifically based anything that does
 
04:44:37.868 --> 04:44:37.878 align:start position:0%
not address the fact that the huge
 
04:44:39.788 --> 04:44:39.798 align:start position:0%
problems that we are suffering are due
 
04:44:42.510 --> 04:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
to due to past practices that are not
 
04:44:44.788 --> 04:44:44.798 align:start position:0%
going to be repeated I mean stuff like s
 
04:44:46.670 --> 04:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
gobain stuff like what happened in wiam
 
04:44:49.350 --> 04:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
where the town unknowingly dumped you
 
04:44:52.550 --> 04:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
know firefighting foam into the ground
 
04:44:54.430 --> 04:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
because they did not realize it was
 
04:44:57.670 --> 04:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
toxic all that stopped happening I I
 
04:44:59.670 --> 04:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
have not seen one shred of evidence to
 
04:45:01.830 --> 04:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
show me that all these things that we
 
04:45:04.550 --> 04:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
are looking to ban here are in any way
 
04:45:06.910 --> 04:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
contributing to our problem as far as I
 
04:45:08.830 --> 04:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
can tell our problem has been that
 
04:45:10.670 --> 04:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
industrial amounts of this stuff have
 
04:45:12.510 --> 04:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
been dumped into the water supply
 
04:45:15.030 --> 04:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
because we did not know better and we
 
04:45:17.390 --> 04:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
stopped doing that and if somebody
 
04:45:20.030 --> 04:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
knowing today what they know still does
 
04:45:23.390 --> 04:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
it my God hit them as hard as you can
 
04:45:27.470 --> 04:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
but this seems to be amazingly broad I
 
04:45:29.390 --> 04:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
you know I heard California mentioned
 
04:45:31.708 --> 04:45:31.718 align:start position:0%
that in reference to the fact that our
 
04:45:34.470 --> 04:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
laws are not as strict as Cali I'll end
 
04:45:36.230 --> 04:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
my argument by pointing out that
 
04:45:38.430 --> 04:45:38.440 align:start position:0%
California has a consumer notification
 
04:45:41.310 --> 04:45:41.320 align:start position:0%
law that requires that an warning lab is
 
04:45:44.030 --> 04:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
placed on any product that has contains
 
04:45:47.030 --> 04:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
a product a compound known to the state
 
04:45:49.350 --> 04:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
of California to cause cancer do you
 
04:45:52.628 --> 04:45:52.638 align:start position:0%
know what that label is on
 
04:45:55.310 --> 04:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
everything everything and as a result
 
04:45:57.750 --> 04:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
nobody pays attention to it because with
 
04:45:59.750 --> 04:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
everything is cancer inducing clearly
 
04:46:02.750 --> 04:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
nothing is I believe we need to address
 
04:46:05.550 --> 04:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
this I think that we need to remediate
 
04:46:07.390 --> 04:46:07.400 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of things that we can do
 
04:46:09.390 --> 04:46:09.400 align:start position:0%
to me this is a bit too broad and please
 
04:46:10.990 --> 04:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
understand that I say that with the most
 
04:46:13.628 --> 04:46:13.638 align:start position:0%
utmost respect for everybody involved
 
04:46:17.270 --> 04:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
and I understand the reasons why people
 
04:46:19.470 --> 04:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
want to promote this legislation but I
 
04:46:21.310 --> 04:46:21.320 align:start position:0%
did want to be on the record as do I
 
04:46:23.190 --> 04:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
cannot support it thank you
 
04:46:24.550 --> 04:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
representative Murray then
 
04:46:24.560 --> 04:46:26.190 align:start position:0%
representative Murray then
representative

04:46:26.190 --> 04:46:26.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:46:29.110 --> 04:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
grass thank you Mr chair um just as an
 
04:46:30.750 --> 04:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
aside I think the people in marac who
 
04:46:32.270 --> 04:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
are dealing with cancer would probably
 
04:46:34.270 --> 04:46:34.280 align:start position:0%
have a different perspective than what I
 
04:46:37.830 --> 04:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
just heard um but I have I'm hearing two
 
04:46:40.510 --> 04:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
different um perhaps definitions and I'm
 
04:46:42.628 --> 04:46:42.638 align:start position:0%
hoping um representative Abel can sort
 
04:46:44.510 --> 04:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
that out um she had said that she's
 
04:46:46.230 --> 04:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
using the definition that firefighters
 
04:46:49.670 --> 04:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
used for the pasas and then we have this
 
04:46:51.990 --> 04:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
handout is this the same thing as what
 
04:46:54.750 --> 04:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
the firefighters used or are they they
 
04:46:56.430 --> 04:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
is this a thank
 
04:46:59.030 --> 04:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
you um thank you very much for the
 
04:47:02.830 --> 04:47:02.840 align:start position:0%
question um the definition that is in
 
04:47:05.830 --> 04:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is Broad so that it would
 
04:47:08.190 --> 04:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
include all sorts of
 
04:47:12.590 --> 04:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
permutations of um of the chemical like
 
04:47:14.788 --> 04:47:14.798 align:start position:0%
if you switch out an oxygen or you
 
04:47:17.390 --> 04:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
switch out a hydrogen or something like
 
04:47:20.708 --> 04:47:20.718 align:start position:0%
that it's it's broad so that it includes
 
04:47:25.270 --> 04:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh chemicals with um that Florine Bond
 
04:47:28.990 --> 04:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
so that also by having a broader
 
04:47:32.070 --> 04:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
definition it anticipates the
 
04:47:35.430 --> 04:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
development of additional complex
 
04:47:38.548 --> 04:47:38.558 align:start position:0%
chemicals down the
 
04:47:41.830 --> 04:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
line representative grassy
 
04:47:43.350 --> 04:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman thank
 
04:47:45.590 --> 04:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
you I think as representative eel said
 
04:47:47.910 --> 04:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
we have to start somewhere agriculture
 
04:47:50.430 --> 04:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
in Maine is being destroyed because of
 
04:47:52.310 --> 04:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
biosolids Municipal biosolids have been
 
04:47:54.470 --> 04:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
spread on fields and they're finding PE
 
04:47:56.390 --> 04:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
fast in their in their vegetables and
 
04:47:59.110 --> 04:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
their plants that are and in their their
 
04:48:02.230 --> 04:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
grasses that are feeding their cows um
 
04:48:03.830 --> 04:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
and and this is impacted because of
 
04:48:05.070 --> 04:48:05.080 align:start position:0%
sludge that they get from water
 
04:48:07.190 --> 04:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
treatment plants municipal water
 
04:48:08.708 --> 04:48:08.718 align:start position:0%
treatment plants the stuff we use every
 
04:48:11.030 --> 04:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
day that's going down your drain waste
 
04:48:12.470 --> 04:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
management is spending millions of
 
04:48:14.270 --> 04:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
dollars to pre-treat their their leech
 
04:48:15.990 --> 04:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
eight because they're finding past in
 
04:48:17.628 --> 04:48:17.638 align:start position:0%
their leech eight because of products
 
04:48:19.830 --> 04:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
that represented Bill wants to ban are
 
04:48:21.470 --> 04:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
being disposed of in their in their
 
04:48:23.430 --> 04:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
landfill we have to start somewhere to
 
04:48:25.868 --> 04:48:25.878 align:start position:0%
reduce that so maybe at some point in
 
04:48:27.430 --> 04:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
time we can end that going into the
 
04:48:29.350 --> 04:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
leech eight so waste management is
 
04:48:30.470 --> 04:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to continue to spend
 
04:48:32.830 --> 04:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
Millions year after year to to fight
 
04:48:34.868 --> 04:48:34.878 align:start position:0%
this and it doesn't go into our waste
 
04:48:36.750 --> 04:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
water and into our water treatment
 
04:48:39.310 --> 04:48:39.320 align:start position:0%
plants and and and and then into the
 
04:48:42.030 --> 04:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
sludge that we have which is which is
 
04:48:43.868 --> 04:48:43.878 align:start position:0%
which when purified is uses biosolids on
 
04:48:45.110 --> 04:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
farmlands we have to work with our
 
04:48:47.910 --> 04:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
agricultural people the you want to have
 
04:48:50.310 --> 04:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
incidence of where where cancer has been
 
04:48:51.788 --> 04:48:51.798 align:start position:0%
found I mean you're not just looking at
 
04:48:53.190 --> 04:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
St gobain but look at the Cancer
 
04:48:55.030 --> 04:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
clusters in the Sea Coast Area because a
 
04:48:57.390 --> 04:48:57.400 align:start position:0%
firefighting foam that was used at peas
 
04:48:58.750 --> 04:48:58.760 align:start position:0%
they're finding out that this is has
 
04:49:00.708 --> 04:49:00.718 align:start position:0%
been a problem in fact everywhere I
 
04:49:02.750 --> 04:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
remember when P said hey we're going to
 
04:49:03.670 --> 04:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
give you a good thing all your
 
04:49:04.430 --> 04:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
communities you're going to get
 
04:49:06.548 --> 04:49:06.558 align:start position:0%
firefighting foam and we actually
 
04:49:08.030 --> 04:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
sprayed it on Main Street and kids were
 
04:49:10.190 --> 04:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
dancing in the stuff but you know it's
 
04:49:11.670 --> 04:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
something we Now find and they're
 
04:49:13.070 --> 04:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
finding that places where fire
 
04:49:14.670 --> 04:49:14.680 align:start position:0%
departments use this foam in some of
 
04:49:16.948 --> 04:49:16.958 align:start position:0%
their practices they're finding is the
 
04:49:19.230 --> 04:49:19.240 align:start position:0%
groundwater is contaminated because of
 
04:49:21.070 --> 04:49:21.080 align:start position:0%
that take a look at the one of the
 
04:49:23.430 --> 04:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
largest lawsuits in the country right
 
04:49:25.548 --> 04:49:25.558 align:start position:0%
now is Camp leun because of firefighting
 
04:49:27.548 --> 04:49:27.558 align:start position:0%
foram and past now we banned
 
04:49:29.590 --> 04:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
firefighting foam but we have to start
 
04:49:31.190 --> 04:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
somewhere with the materials that we're
 
04:49:32.990 --> 04:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
putting out our landfills that are going
 
04:49:35.190 --> 04:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
into down our drains and this is the
 
04:49:37.310 --> 04:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
first step to do that New Hampshire has
 
04:49:39.830 --> 04:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
to be proactive in this case what we're
 
04:49:42.230 --> 04:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
looking at is cumul effects cumulative
 
04:49:43.510 --> 04:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
impacts that have occurred over the
 
04:49:45.230 --> 04:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
years and the only way we're going to
 
04:49:47.470 --> 04:49:47.480 align:start position:0%
stop it is to reduce the amount of
 
04:49:50.990 --> 04:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
materials with past that we dispose of
 
04:49:54.670 --> 04:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
and this is the first place we
 
04:49:57.430 --> 04:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
start further discussion all right
 
04:49:58.590 --> 04:49:58.600 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards and
 
04:50:01.470 --> 04:50:01.480 align:start position:0%
representative PRI uh thank you Mr chair
 
04:50:05.350 --> 04:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
I I haven't uh been following along with
 
04:50:07.990 --> 04:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
the details of this bill and have just
 
04:50:10.910 --> 04:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
read it and the the parts of what I've
 
04:50:13.670 --> 04:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
heard here today by fellow committee
 
04:50:16.390 --> 04:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
members that really resonate with me is
 
04:50:19.190 --> 04:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
that we have to start somewhere okay so
 
04:50:22.310 --> 04:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
what so what how do I translate that I I
 
04:50:25.270 --> 04:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
I translate that to mean let's let's
 
04:50:28.310 --> 04:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
start with a small step that takes care
 
04:50:30.070 --> 04:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
of the things that we really know to be
 
04:50:33.190 --> 04:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
a problem uh we we you know the
 
04:50:36.270 --> 04:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and uh meramac we we we
 
04:50:39.150 --> 04:50:39.160 align:start position:0%
should certainly ban that the foam we've
 
04:50:41.788 --> 04:50:41.798 align:start position:0%
already banned but this list doesn't
 
04:50:44.310 --> 04:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
look like starting somewhere uh in the
 
04:50:46.750 --> 04:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
actual bill the number of products
 
04:50:52.070 --> 04:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
affected are extremely long and I uh I I
 
04:50:56.030 --> 04:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
can't vote for such a large list of
 
04:50:59.750 --> 04:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
items all at once because I don't think
 
04:51:03.470 --> 04:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
we can anticipate sort of the economic
 
04:51:07.150 --> 04:51:07.160 align:start position:0%
and consumer impact of pulling all those
 
04:51:12.590 --> 04:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
items out of the um sale channels um and
 
04:51:14.628 --> 04:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
uh and and what kind of unknown
 
04:51:17.230 --> 04:51:17.240 align:start position:0%
consequences we might have from uh
 
04:51:21.030 --> 04:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
government induced scarcity for example
 
04:51:23.910 --> 04:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
so so if If This Were A narrower Bill
 
04:51:25.750 --> 04:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
where we solved what we knew we needed
 
04:51:29.310 --> 04:51:29.320 align:start position:0%
to solve and set up a process to to to
 
04:51:33.548 --> 04:51:33.558 align:start position:0%
let manufacturers know that uh they have
 
04:51:35.510 --> 04:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
to come to us to demonstrate the
 
04:51:37.590 --> 04:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
efficacy of their product and we could
 
04:51:40.868 --> 04:51:40.878 align:start position:0%
use the same list but but put the B us
 
04:51:43.868 --> 04:51:43.878 align:start position:0%
on them to come to us and explain the
 
04:51:47.910 --> 04:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
safety issues before some date you know
 
04:51:50.670 --> 04:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
5 7 years from now so that we
 
04:51:55.110 --> 04:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
don't um accidentally um kill a Golden
 
04:51:57.670 --> 04:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
Goose here I mean let's let's solve the
 
04:52:00.230 --> 04:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
problem but let's not over engineer the
 
04:52:01.910 --> 04:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
solution and this feels like over
 
04:52:05.070 --> 04:52:05.080 align:start position:0%
engineer over engineering to me so at
 
04:52:06.590 --> 04:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
this point I I don't think I could
 
04:52:09.548 --> 04:52:09.558 align:start position:0%
support uh anything but an inter interim
 
04:52:13.030 --> 04:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
study representative PRI thank you Mr
 
04:52:16.350 --> 04:52:16.360 align:start position:0%
chairman I will be supporting this bill
 
04:52:16.360 --> 04:52:17.470 align:start position:0%
chairman I will be supporting this bill
um

04:52:17.470 --> 04:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:21.510 --> 04:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
120% because I see it as a the first
 
04:52:25.510 --> 04:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
step in trying to address paaps in New
 
04:52:29.070 --> 04:52:29.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um right now it's currently
 
04:52:31.510 --> 04:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
banned in Canada and in
 
04:52:36.110 --> 04:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
Europe and in several of our states um
 
04:52:39.430 --> 04:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
so this is not a new thing and I believe
 
04:52:42.230 --> 04:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
that the bill that's been worked out by
 
04:52:45.230 --> 04:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
representative eel is well researched
 
04:52:47.910 --> 04:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
well thought out and the list of
 
04:52:50.948 --> 04:52:50.958 align:start position:0%
products is very conservative when you
 
04:52:53.390 --> 04:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
consider the whole spectrum that could
 
04:52:58.270 --> 04:52:58.280 align:start position:0%
have been on this list and lastly I you
 
04:53:01.708 --> 04:53:01.718 align:start position:0%
know after being a a cancer
 
04:53:04.670 --> 04:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
survivor and knowing that the cancer
 
04:53:08.548 --> 04:53:08.558 align:start position:0%
rates have spiked up in marac and the
 
04:53:11.670 --> 04:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
communities around it
 
04:53:13.910 --> 04:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
because of the contamination I think
 
04:53:17.948 --> 04:53:17.958 align:start position:0%
it's time for us who are supposed to be
 
04:53:20.868 --> 04:53:20.878 align:start position:0%
looking out for the welfare and safety
 
04:53:24.750 --> 04:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
of our people to do something about this
 
04:53:24.760 --> 04:53:26.430 align:start position:0%
of our people to do something about this
thank

04:53:26.430 --> 04:53:26.440 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:53:29.150 --> 04:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
you further discussion representative
 
04:53:32.070 --> 04:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
Maguire uh thank you Mr chairman I I I
 
04:53:34.788 --> 04:53:34.798 align:start position:0%
want to address two things here uh first
 
04:53:37.628 --> 04:53:37.638 align:start position:0%
of all cancer
 
04:53:40.670 --> 04:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
um people may be under the impression
 
04:53:43.948 --> 04:53:43.958 align:start position:0%
that in general Cancer's On The Rise but
 
04:53:47.230 --> 04:53:47.240 align:start position:0%
that's not so and in particularly in New
 
04:53:50.150 --> 04:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's not so so if you go to
 
04:53:54.670 --> 04:53:54.680 align:start position:0%
the cdc's website they have um charts of
 
04:53:58.510 --> 04:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
cancer mortality over the years and and
 
04:54:00.990 --> 04:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
in general for the country the rates the
 
04:54:04.390 --> 04:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
number of can cancer deaths per
 
04:54:07.310 --> 04:54:07.320 align:start position:0%
100,000 have been declining over the
 
04:54:12.110 --> 04:54:12.120 align:start position:0%
last uh 20 plus years um but in
 
04:54:14.470 --> 04:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
particular for New Hampshire they have
 
04:54:18.190 --> 04:54:18.200 align:start position:0%
been declining even faster so New
 
04:54:20.750 --> 04:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was in
 
04:54:25.070 --> 04:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
2005 in the second worst quintile of
 
04:54:28.590 --> 04:54:28.600 align:start position:0%
cancer rates for the country in
 
04:54:31.948 --> 04:54:31.958 align:start position:0%
2014 I think it is we were in the middle
 
04:54:34.590 --> 04:54:34.600 align:start position:0%
quintile of cancer rates for the country
 
04:54:35.830 --> 04:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
and in
 
04:54:39.590 --> 04:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
2021 we are in the second best quintile
 
04:54:42.110 --> 04:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
of of canc rates for the country so even
 
04:54:43.948 --> 04:54:43.958 align:start position:0%
though the country's overall cancer
 
04:54:46.628 --> 04:54:46.638 align:start position:0%
rates are declining New Hampshire's are
 
04:54:50.230 --> 04:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
declining even faster so that says that
 
04:54:52.670 --> 04:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
to the extent that this is I mean these
 
04:54:55.110 --> 04:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
are all cancers so you know lung cancer
 
04:54:58.230 --> 04:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
and other things too um but but to the
 
04:55:00.830 --> 04:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
extent that this is a cancer problem
 
04:55:00.840 --> 04:55:02.310 align:start position:0%
extent that this is a cancer problem
it's

04:55:02.310 --> 04:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:55:06.590 --> 04:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
not as significant as as overall Cancers
 
04:55:09.190 --> 04:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
and other Cancers and so on okay second
 
04:55:11.548 --> 04:55:11.558 align:start position:0%
thing I want to talk about is is the
 
04:55:15.990 --> 04:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
broadness of the definition so um you'll
 
04:55:18.590 --> 04:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
notice that the list doesn't include
 
04:55:22.590 --> 04:55:22.600 align:start position:0%
things that people actually swallow
 
04:55:25.910 --> 04:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
right it's only consumer goods that sort
 
04:55:27.990 --> 04:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
of thing you know labels on cans and
 
04:55:30.788 --> 04:55:30.798 align:start position:0%
things like that but the food in the can
 
04:55:33.430 --> 04:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
is not on this list or the medications
 
04:55:37.150 --> 04:55:37.160 align:start position:0%
and so on so the theory here is that if
 
04:55:39.830 --> 04:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
I throw away the can with the ink that
 
04:55:40.830 --> 04:55:40.840 align:start position:0%
has p
 
04:55:45.470 --> 04:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
in it that's going to go into my um uh
 
04:55:47.830 --> 04:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
solid waste facility there'll be
 
04:55:49.990 --> 04:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
leachate that'll go down into the
 
04:55:51.750 --> 04:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
groundwater at some point I'm going to
 
04:55:54.230 --> 04:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
drink the groundwater and so on well all
 
04:55:59.030 --> 04:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
those steps dilute what's in the what's
 
04:56:01.190 --> 04:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
on the label right they don't they don't
 
04:56:05.590 --> 04:56:05.600 align:start position:0%
concentrate what's on the label and um
 
04:56:06.590 --> 04:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
and in
 
04:56:09.910 --> 04:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
particular there are chemicals that meet
 
04:56:12.390 --> 04:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
the this definition having a fully
 
04:56:16.390 --> 04:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
fluorinated uh carbon atom that people
 
04:56:20.230 --> 04:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
take every day including the number one
 
04:56:22.750 --> 04:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
prescription drug in America it's
 
04:56:25.750 --> 04:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
something called lipore uh people take
 
04:56:28.430 --> 04:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
it to reduce their cholesterol the
 
04:56:31.510 --> 04:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
chemical formula for lipor Al generic is
 
04:56:35.750 --> 04:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
called atorvastatin I think um has this
 
04:56:39.030 --> 04:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
atom in it so had the word medication be
 
04:56:41.110 --> 04:56:41.120 align:start position:0%
on the band list
 
04:56:42.910 --> 04:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
that would ban the number one
 
04:56:46.030 --> 04:56:46.040 align:start position:0%
prescription drug in America um proac
 
04:56:48.750 --> 04:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
has it as well and hundreds of other
 
04:56:51.830 --> 04:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
medications so the idea that anything
 
04:56:54.548 --> 04:56:54.558 align:start position:0%
with this atom in it is
 
04:56:58.230 --> 04:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
harmful all these medications that have
 
04:57:01.270 --> 04:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
this as part of their formula have been
 
04:57:05.708 --> 04:57:05.718 align:start position:0%
thoroughly tested for safety right if if
 
04:57:08.548 --> 04:57:08.558 align:start position:0%
lipor caused
 
04:57:12.430 --> 04:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
cancer um it wouldn't have been approved
 
04:57:13.948 --> 04:57:13.958 align:start position:0%
right they go through extensive
 
04:57:17.070 --> 04:57:17.080 align:start position:0%
extensive training so the the definition
 
04:57:20.030 --> 04:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
is way too broad we don't know I mean
 
04:57:22.030 --> 04:57:22.040 align:start position:0%
certainly there's there's useful
 
04:57:24.708 --> 04:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
chemicals that have that that would meet
 
04:57:27.628 --> 04:57:27.638 align:start position:0%
that definition that aren't being banned
 
04:57:32.548 --> 04:57:32.558 align:start position:0%
by this bill but you know anyways so
 
04:57:35.270 --> 04:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
again I'm against it thank
 
04:57:38.030 --> 04:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
you is this going to go on all
 
04:57:40.750 --> 04:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
day I hope not
 
04:57:42.390 --> 04:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
represent Hull then represent hacken
 
04:57:44.990 --> 04:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
Phillips thank you Mr chair um having
 
04:57:47.390 --> 04:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
spent time in the industry when I was in
 
04:57:50.190 --> 04:57:50.200 align:start position:0%
college relative to fluorinated
 
04:57:51.708 --> 04:57:51.718 align:start position:0%
substances that ended up in the printing
 
04:57:54.390 --> 04:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
ink to to Mr McGuire's Point earlier
 
04:57:57.510 --> 04:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
it's all over um it's used all the time
 
04:58:01.310 --> 04:58:01.320 align:start position:0%
in magazines it that industry has used
 
04:58:03.390 --> 04:58:03.400 align:start position:0%
wax and lubricants made with Teflon for
 
04:58:05.470 --> 04:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
a number of years I do think we should
 
04:58:06.948 --> 04:58:06.958 align:start position:0%
talk about the cookware side of this
 
04:58:09.750 --> 04:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
it's not in the bill and those I would
 
04:58:11.350 --> 04:58:11.360 align:start position:0%
ask everybody on the on this committee
 
04:58:12.628 --> 04:58:12.638 align:start position:0%
to think about the last time you use
 
04:58:14.548 --> 04:58:14.558 align:start position:0%
non-stick cookware because that is the
 
04:58:16.190 --> 04:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
biggest contributor to what's in your
 
04:58:19.708 --> 04:58:19.718 align:start position:0%
body it's not necessarily what's in in
 
04:58:21.350 --> 04:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
the leate that's going into the ground
 
04:58:23.628 --> 04:58:23.638 align:start position:0%
that's going right that's going into the
 
04:58:27.230 --> 04:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
water supply um let's look for the
 
04:58:29.190 --> 04:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
biggest sources before we start banning
 
04:58:30.150 --> 04:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
all of
 
04:58:32.990 --> 04:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
these represent hacken Phillips thank
 
04:58:35.350 --> 04:58:35.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I just wanted to refocus
 
04:58:37.548 --> 04:58:37.558 align:start position:0%
the discussion for a moment U we've
 
04:58:39.470 --> 04:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of about the substantive
 
04:58:41.868 --> 04:58:41.878 align:start position:0%
policy this afternoon and I um just
 
04:58:43.350 --> 04:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to remind the committee that it
 
04:58:46.868 --> 04:58:46.878 align:start position:0%
is our duty to be reviewing the fiscal
 
04:58:50.628 --> 04:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
uh impact of this bill um I as I
 
04:58:52.990 --> 04:58:53.000 align:start position:0%
understand it we're reviewing a
 
04:58:54.948 --> 04:58:54.958 align:start position:0%
250,000 annual
 
04:58:57.628 --> 04:58:57.638 align:start position:0%
appropriation um and I believe the
 
04:59:00.788 --> 04:59:00.798 align:start position:0%
reasoning to support that um is that you
 
04:59:02.990 --> 04:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
know a penny today will save us a dollar
 
04:59:05.510 --> 04:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
in the future I do believe that this
 
04:59:08.548 --> 04:59:08.558 align:start position:0%
bill is wise for our state's economic
 
04:59:10.628 --> 04:59:10.638 align:start position:0%
future and I hope that you will join the
 
04:59:14.190 --> 04:59:14.200 align:start position:0%
bipartisan co-sponsors as well as bamal
 
04:59:17.310 --> 04:59:17.320 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors of this bill to help uh
 
04:59:19.150 --> 04:59:19.160 align:start position:0%
protect our state moving forward based
 
04:59:23.310 --> 04:59:23.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:26.670 --> 04:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
04:59:29.110 --> 04:59:29.120 align:start position:0%

infants um it really is everywhere but
 
05:00:29.708 --> 05:00:29.718 align:start position:0%
just because it's everywhere that's all
 
05:00:32.510 --> 05:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
the more reason to stop Banning as much
 
05:00:35.910 --> 05:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
as we can from the from the front end
 
05:00:39.110 --> 05:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
and um yes I made certain choices on the
 
05:00:41.110 --> 05:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
products that I've included here but
 
05:00:43.910 --> 05:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
I've explained to you why I did and you
 
05:00:45.670 --> 05:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
know there are other states that
 
05:00:48.548 --> 05:00:48.558 align:start position:0%
considered across the board bands I did
 
05:00:52.548 --> 05:00:52.558 align:start position:0%
not do that so um and we've also removed
 
05:00:55.270 --> 05:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
some some things that were in it uh
 
05:00:58.948 --> 05:00:58.958 align:start position:0%
through the process and commerce so um I
 
05:01:02.110 --> 05:01:02.120 align:start position:0%
can't stress more how important it is to
 
05:01:05.590 --> 05:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
stop the use of p as its source send a
 
05:01:06.868 --> 05:01:06.878 align:start position:0%

05:04:19.110 --> 05:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
um since we've really talked a lot about
 
05:04:22.150 --> 05:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
it in finance too I will be brief also
 
05:04:25.670 --> 05:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
recognizing the time of the day
 
05:04:30.190 --> 05:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
already this bill is U advocated for in
 
05:04:33.470 --> 05:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
the name of U you know helping hungry
 
05:04:36.390 --> 05:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
children get fed what we have not seen
 
05:04:38.548 --> 05:04:38.558 align:start position:0%
at any point is any evidence that at
 
05:04:40.868 --> 05:04:40.878 align:start position:0%
least one kid in one school has been
 
05:04:42.750 --> 05:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
denied food as a result of their
 
05:04:45.990 --> 05:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
inability to pay for lunch what the bill
 
05:04:49.590 --> 05:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
really should be about is making sure
 
05:04:52.990 --> 05:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
that school districts that are
 
05:04:55.670 --> 05:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
serving children who cannot pay for
 
05:05:00.070 --> 05:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
lunch food and do not get paid for it at
 
05:05:02.990 --> 05:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
the end of that school year we should be
 
05:05:06.030 --> 05:05:06.040 align:start position:0%
looking at covering that balance for the
 
05:05:08.430 --> 05:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
school districts that have given food
 
05:05:10.868 --> 05:05:10.878 align:start position:0%
without the expectation that the child
 
05:05:14.750 --> 05:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
you know will pay for it instead we are
 
05:05:17.788 --> 05:05:17.798 align:start position:0%
looking at this bill that greatly
 
05:05:20.830 --> 05:05:20.840 align:start position:0%
expands the eligibility of you know
 
05:05:23.110 --> 05:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
who's eligible for a free and clear meal
 
05:05:25.470 --> 05:05:25.480 align:start position:0%
but shouldn't really make a difference
 
05:05:28.350 --> 05:05:28.360 align:start position:0%
in who gets food or not when I served on
 
05:05:31.310 --> 05:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
the uh joint Senate house committee that
 
05:05:32.830 --> 05:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
uh looked at the impact of direct
 
05:05:32.840 --> 05:05:34.590 align:start position:0%
uh looked at the impact of direct
Medicaid

05:05:34.590 --> 05:05:34.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
05:05:36.868 --> 05:05:36.878 align:start position:0%
certification we did ask this very
 
05:05:38.430 --> 05:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
question because we were also dealing
 
05:05:39.948 --> 05:05:39.958 align:start position:0%
with hunger in schools and the
 
05:05:41.990 --> 05:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Education indicated that
 
05:05:43.868 --> 05:05:43.878 align:start position:0%
at this point in time they do not have
 
05:05:46.190 --> 05:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
data that would show us how much of
 
05:05:49.150 --> 05:05:49.160 align:start position:0%
those balances are left on the shoulders
 
05:05:51.470 --> 05:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
of the local taxpayers to cover for at
 
05:05:53.990 --> 05:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
the end of the year we did ask them to
 
05:05:56.150 --> 05:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
provide that data once that data is
 
05:05:58.510 --> 05:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
available I would fully support the bill
 
05:06:01.230 --> 05:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
that would deal with the fact that you
 
05:06:03.070 --> 05:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
know the state should help the school
 
05:06:05.590 --> 05:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
districts pay for those funds that they
 
05:06:08.270 --> 05:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
cannot collect but since this bill would
 
05:06:12.990 --> 05:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
spend much much more and really not
 
05:06:15.868 --> 05:06:15.878 align:start position:0%
have the ability to show any impact in
 
05:06:18.270 --> 05:06:18.280 align:start position:0%
actually addressing child hanger child
 
05:06:22.190 --> 05:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
child hunger in schools I would advocate
 
05:06:24.548 --> 05:06:24.558 align:start position:0%
for an ideal motion on it I would also
 
05:06:27.670 --> 05:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
point out that um you know this was a
 
05:06:29.868 --> 05:06:29.878 align:start position:0%
bit of a very close call in the house
 
05:06:31.910 --> 05:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
where I believe it failed first and then
 
05:06:35.150 --> 05:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
it was reconsidered or you know sorry
 
05:06:38.390 --> 05:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
yes so U it's not like this is a place
 
05:06:41.350 --> 05:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
where the house has specifically spoken
 
05:06:43.868 --> 05:06:43.878 align:start position:0%
with a broad margin on policy thank
 
05:06:47.788 --> 05:06:47.798 align:start position:0%
you the parts of this bill I recall the
 
05:06:47.798 --> 05:06:49.070 align:start position:0%
you the parts of this bill I recall the
normal

05:06:49.070 --> 05:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
normal
 
05:06:53.110 --> 05:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
um free and reduced meals are based at
 
05:06:56.868 --> 05:06:56.878 align:start position:0%
160% of federal poverty uh levels and
 
05:07:01.750 --> 05:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
for free and 185% for for uh reduced
 
05:07:03.430 --> 05:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
this bill would have increased it to
 
05:07:07.910 --> 05:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
350% of FPL to to bring in more people
 
05:07:09.510 --> 05:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
that sounds wonderful but the ad
 
05:07:11.390 --> 05:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
adustment is you're going from something
 
05:07:14.990 --> 05:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
that is almost more than 50% Federal
 
05:07:18.190 --> 05:07:18.200 align:start position:0%
money to one that would be all the rest
 
05:07:22.350 --> 05:07:22.360 align:start position:0%
would be 100% State money and and and
 
05:07:25.590 --> 05:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
the uh Department of Education I think
 
05:07:27.150 --> 05:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
came in quite a list of people they
 
05:07:29.670 --> 05:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to hire because this takes in a
 
05:07:31.708 --> 05:07:31.718 align:start position:0%
whole group that has never been covered
 
05:07:34.190 --> 05:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
before and would all be covered by state
 
05:07:38.030 --> 05:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
funds rather than a big participation by
 
05:07:40.190 --> 05:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
federal so I think that the reason why
 
05:07:43.510 --> 05:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
it failed in division 2 because it was a
 
05:07:46.910 --> 05:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
big increase in government and there was
 
05:07:48.590 --> 05:07:48.600 align:start position:0%
no thought that there were really that
 
05:07:50.310 --> 05:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
many hungry children it's it's just
 
05:07:52.750 --> 05:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
being used a lot and sometimes it's a
 
05:07:54.708 --> 05:07:54.718 align:start position:0%
choice the child runs out of the house
 
05:07:57.548 --> 05:07:57.558 align:start position:0%
without taking the lunch or whatever or
 
05:07:58.868 --> 05:07:58.878 align:start position:0%
spends the money that they get were
 
05:08:01.750 --> 05:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
given for lunch on candy on the way so
 
05:08:03.708 --> 05:08:03.718 align:start position:0%
we don't know all these things but there
 
05:08:06.510 --> 05:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
was some talk of that and it it failed
 
05:08:09.910 --> 05:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
in in division two further discussion
 
05:08:12.390 --> 05:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
representative Emory yes uh thank you Mr
 
05:08:16.670 --> 05:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
chair to add add to that approach uh
 
05:08:18.990 --> 05:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
this actually was going to create a new
 
05:08:21.670 --> 05:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
Department uh because it doesn't the
 
05:08:24.548 --> 05:08:24.558 align:start position:0%
systems don't exist to manage State
 
05:08:27.470 --> 05:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
money for this application the current
 
05:08:29.110 --> 05:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
systems the electronic systems that
 
05:08:31.390 --> 05:08:31.400 align:start position:0%
exist are for the federal program this
 
05:08:34.350 --> 05:08:34.360 align:start position:0%
was a an advanced program run by the
 
05:08:35.910 --> 05:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
state and we don't have anything in
 
05:08:37.390 --> 05:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
place we don't have Staffing and we
 
05:08:39.590 --> 05:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
don't have a system so we're basically
 
05:08:43.430 --> 05:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
setting up a new Department with a new
 
05:08:46.230 --> 05:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
application representative Heath thank
 
05:08:49.708 --> 05:08:49.718 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um this bill was authored
 
05:08:53.230 --> 05:08:53.240 align:start position:0%
by our former colleague art Ellison um
 
05:08:54.910 --> 05:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
and I I'm sure you all noticed your
 
05:08:57.110 --> 05:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
emails um that
 
05:09:00.470 --> 05:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
hb212 generated quite an amount of
 
05:09:03.548 --> 05:09:03.558 align:start position:0%
emails actually the day that we failed
 
05:09:06.910 --> 05:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
to pass this bill in division 2 um
 
05:09:08.990 --> 05:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative waler and I went to visit
 
05:09:12.310 --> 05:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
our and he got busy on his computer
 
05:09:13.990 --> 05:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
reaching out to as many people as he
 
05:09:16.390 --> 05:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
could to alert them you saw people out
 
05:09:18.548 --> 05:09:18.558 align:start position:0%
here this morning who were standing up
 
05:09:20.070 --> 05:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
for children and their
 
05:09:22.750 --> 05:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
food excuse me I just want to say we
 
05:09:24.548 --> 05:09:24.558 align:start position:0%
have a
 
05:09:28.190 --> 05:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
100,000 poor people in New Hampshire we
 
05:09:30.788 --> 05:09:30.798 align:start position:0%
have hundreds and hundreds of children
 
05:09:33.590 --> 05:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
who come to school every single day and
 
05:09:35.310 --> 05:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
for the most part the only meals they
 
05:09:37.670 --> 05:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
get are the meals that they get at
 
05:09:40.750 --> 05:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
school my years of working in
 
05:09:43.590 --> 05:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
education we were worried so much about
 
05:09:45.788 --> 05:09:45.798 align:start position:0%
kids over the summer because we knew
 
05:09:47.470 --> 05:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't have that regular
 
05:09:50.110 --> 05:09:50.120 align:start position:0%
food program and actually we worked in
 
05:09:52.070 --> 05:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
Manchester to come up with a summer
 
05:09:53.708 --> 05:09:53.718 align:start position:0%
feeding program for
 
05:09:56.470 --> 05:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
children what this bill does is it
 
05:10:00.948 --> 05:10:00.958 align:start position:0%
raises the um poverty level to 350% and
 
05:10:02.750 --> 05:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
I believe we've done that for
 
05:10:07.030 --> 05:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
efas um the poverty rate yes it it's
 
05:10:08.868 --> 05:10:08.878 align:start position:0%
beyond what the federal government
 
05:10:12.070 --> 05:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
allows for and yes there would be some
 
05:10:13.948 --> 05:10:13.958 align:start position:0%
work at the department of Ed they
 
05:10:16.150 --> 05:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to do a whole different
 
05:10:18.110 --> 05:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
department they would have to set up
 
05:10:18.120 --> 05:10:19.190 align:start position:0%
department they would have to set up
different

05:10:19.190 --> 05:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
different
 
05:10:22.510 --> 05:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
systems we know that children who are
 
05:10:24.628 --> 05:10:24.638 align:start position:0%
who are hungry aren't learning to the
 
05:10:26.510 --> 05:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
extent that they should be learning I'm
 
05:10:28.190 --> 05:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
not going to go on and on the hour is
 
05:10:30.350 --> 05:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
late and I know that we all want to get
 
05:10:33.270 --> 05:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
going um but I would like you to think
 
05:10:36.150 --> 05:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
about the importance of this bill and
 
05:10:37.830 --> 05:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
what it brings to the poorest of
 
05:10:40.430 --> 05:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
children in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:10:44.230 --> 05:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
we're a wealthy State for the most part
 
05:10:47.868 --> 05:10:47.878 align:start position:0%
but we do have poor children our young
 
05:10:49.830 --> 05:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
families and I look at them in
 
05:10:52.830 --> 05:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester of which we have
 
05:10:56.230 --> 05:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
many more children would be eligible and
 
05:10:59.190 --> 05:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
those bills that school districts get
 
05:11:01.470 --> 05:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
would be reduced by the fact that more
 
05:11:03.470 --> 05:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
children would be eligible for free and
 
05:11:05.750 --> 05:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch so I hope that you will
 
05:11:08.788 --> 05:11:08.798 align:start position:0%
consider voting against the itl motion
 
05:11:10.910 --> 05:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
so that we can make another motion and
 
05:11:13.548 --> 05:11:13.558 align:start position:0%
thank you to my colleagues further
 
05:11:16.150 --> 05:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
discussion represent hackin Phillips
 
05:11:18.070 --> 05:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and just to bring up
 
05:11:20.628 --> 05:11:20.638 align:start position:0%
a note about some of the fiscal impact
 
05:11:22.830 --> 05:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
that we discussed in
 
05:11:26.830 --> 05:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um on page I guess the last
 
05:11:29.510 --> 05:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
page of the fiscal note the department
 
05:11:33.350 --> 05:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
provides estimate totals for um arrange
 
05:11:36.390 --> 05:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
between 50 and 75 million um to the
 
05:11:40.670 --> 05:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
state as a result of the um possible
 
05:11:43.548 --> 05:11:43.558 align:start position:0%
addition of both of breakfast and lunch
 
05:11:45.990 --> 05:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
being served um to this additional
 
05:11:49.230 --> 05:11:49.240 align:start position:0%
population of students um up to the 350
 
05:11:52.350 --> 05:11:52.360 align:start position:0%
percentage rate of the um federal
 
05:11:55.548 --> 05:11:55.558 align:start position:0%
poverty line and um it was noted in
 
05:11:58.788 --> 05:11:58.798 align:start position:0%
committee that this was a very um
 
05:12:02.990 --> 05:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
expansive range um it was actually what
 
05:12:05.390 --> 05:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
they term to be a conservative
 
05:12:08.190 --> 05:12:08.200 align:start position:0%
estimate and um the department did
 
05:12:10.110 --> 05:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
provide that number but will call the
 
05:12:11.868 --> 05:12:11.878 align:start position:0%
committee's attention to the fact that
 
05:12:14.030 --> 05:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
not every child will take advantage of
 
05:12:16.708 --> 05:12:16.718 align:start position:0%
both breakfast and lunch in some cases
 
05:12:18.990 --> 05:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
the child may only take advantage of one
 
05:12:21.708 --> 05:12:21.718 align:start position:0%
or none at all um so we have to realize
 
05:12:23.430 --> 05:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
that this number could actually be much
 
05:12:26.270 --> 05:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
lower and that um you know the
 
05:12:28.430 --> 05:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
Department's job was to Pro to provide
 
05:12:29.708 --> 05:12:29.718 align:start position:0%
us with the you know the most
 
05:12:31.868 --> 05:12:31.878 align:start position:0%
significant number that could Encompass
 
05:12:34.788 --> 05:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
the whole program um but we know that
 
05:12:38.270 --> 05:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
that's that may not come to fruition um
 
05:12:41.548 --> 05:12:41.558 align:start position:0%
and furthermore um to address the
 
05:12:43.510 --> 05:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
additional employees that would be
 
05:12:46.868 --> 05:12:46.878 align:start position:0%
needed to um administrate this program
 
05:12:48.628 --> 05:12:48.638 align:start position:0%
within the Department of Education it
 
05:12:51.868 --> 05:12:51.878 align:start position:0%
was three so we're talking about three
 
05:12:53.990 --> 05:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
new desks three new computers and three
 
05:12:57.230 --> 05:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
new employees um to to the Department's
 
05:13:00.590 --> 05:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
um conservative um estimations so again
 
05:13:03.350 --> 05:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
it might not be that many people um so I
 
05:13:04.990 --> 05:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
just like to you know tear off the
 
05:13:07.110 --> 05:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid I think a lot of people are
 
05:13:09.910 --> 05:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
seeing big numbers and Afraid of that
 
05:13:11.830 --> 05:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
fact but I want to let you know that the
 
05:13:15.310 --> 05:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
policy has been decided by this um
 
05:13:17.230 --> 05:13:17.240 align:start position:0%
chamber already and that we're really
 
05:13:19.150 --> 05:13:19.160 align:start position:0%
talking about the administrative costs
 
05:13:21.350 --> 05:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
of the state at this point um which I
 
05:13:23.510 --> 05:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
would argue is not that much in order to
 
05:13:25.670 --> 05:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
feed the children
 
05:13:29.190 --> 05:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
thanks further discussion on the uh
 
05:13:31.868 --> 05:13:31.878 align:start position:0%

Priest No representative Wier yes Mr
 
05:14:59.510 --> 05:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
chair the vote is 13 to1 in favor of the
 
05:15:02.948 --> 05:15:02.958 align:start position:0%
motion of itl itl is
 
05:15:05.830 --> 05:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
adopted moving on to
 
05:15:08.150 --> 05:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
division and there will be a Minority
 
05:15:08.160 --> 05:15:10.868 align:start position:0%
division and there will be a Minority
Report

05:15:10.868 --> 05:15:10.878 align:start position:0%
Report
 
05:15:15.910 --> 05:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
okay that is Heath uh m m Mr chair yes I
 
05:15:17.830 --> 05:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
think we're getting ready to get back
 
05:15:20.628 --> 05:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
into division three and and I would ask
 
05:15:24.110 --> 05:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
you to consider bringing up uh 1595
 
05:15:26.750 --> 05:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
before 1573 we have a couple people
 
05:15:33.430 --> 05:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:36.990 --> 05:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
1595 all right without objection we'll
 
05:15:40.708 --> 05:15:40.718 align:start position:0%
go to 1595 next
 
05:15:44.788 --> 05:15:44.798 align:start position:0%
representative um Edwards is
 
05:15:47.310 --> 05:15:47.320 align:start position:0%
recognized right now I think Mr Ripple
 
05:15:49.830 --> 05:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
is handing out the amendment on this
 
05:15:53.670 --> 05:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
it's got my name on it uh uh it's it's
 
05:15:56.070 --> 05:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
actually the uh the Hutchins Amendment
 
05:15:57.470 --> 05:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
I've been calling that that she's
 
05:15:59.590 --> 05:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
probably heard it me say that five times
 
05:16:01.270 --> 05:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
so she probably doesn't think it's cute
 
05:16:03.670 --> 05:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
or funny anymore but it's it's
 
05:16:06.670 --> 05:16:06.680 align:start position:0%
nevertheless true uh earlier when we
 
05:16:09.830 --> 05:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
were doing um
 
05:16:13.390 --> 05:16:13.400 align:start position:0%
1964 I mentioned then that
 
05:16:19.030 --> 05:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
1595 was was tightly related to uh
 
05:16:22.030 --> 05:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
1564 uh because it it hit it hits in the
 
05:16:24.470 --> 05:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
same area if you looked at at the at the
 
05:16:27.150 --> 05:16:27.160 align:start position:0%
two fiscal notes they had exactly the
 
05:16:31.548 --> 05:16:31.558 align:start position:0%
same dollar amount for 105 oh I guess I
 
05:16:34.430 --> 05:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
I I should stop there and and and make a
 
05:16:41.270 --> 05:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:45.030 --> 05:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
1178 is there a second second represent
 
05:16:45.040 --> 05:16:47.670 align:start position:0%
1178 is there a second second represent
a

05:16:47.670 --> 05:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:51.470 --> 05:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
whole may I speak to the motion yes okay
 
05:16:54.150 --> 05:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
so I I already spoke a lot about it but
 
05:16:59.628 --> 05:16:59.638 align:start position:0%
uh to to continue um what um these two
 
05:17:02.628 --> 05:17:02.638 align:start position:0%
bills originated independently they both
 
05:17:05.708 --> 05:17:05.718 align:start position:0%
impacted the same it system they each
 
05:17:08.430 --> 05:17:08.440 align:start position:0%
rolled in with their own fiscal note for
 
05:17:11.830 --> 05:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
exact the same dollar amount um they
 
05:17:14.430 --> 05:17:14.440 align:start position:0%
were initially in conflict with one
 
05:17:16.350 --> 05:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
another you couldn't really do them both
 
05:17:18.868 --> 05:17:18.878 align:start position:0%
you had to pick one or the other and
 
05:17:21.830 --> 05:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
that was a dilemma and so we had a
 
05:17:25.750 --> 05:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
citizen U Miss Rebecca Hutchins do some
 
05:17:31.510 --> 05:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
really nice work to deconflict 64 and 95
 
05:17:34.628 --> 05:17:34.638 align:start position:0%
so that they could coexist well together
 
05:17:38.470 --> 05:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh what in part what she did was she
 
05:17:41.190 --> 05:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
accept accepted the um in the amendment
 
05:17:43.910 --> 05:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
the parenting time definition that was
 
05:17:48.230 --> 05:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
in ' 64 to end that conflict and and and
 
05:17:51.590 --> 05:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
then really the only thing that um uh
 
05:17:55.110 --> 05:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
persisted from the original 95 from a
 
05:17:59.788 --> 05:17:59.798 align:start position:0%
policy perspective was um a formula that
 
05:18:02.590 --> 05:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
would be used in the cases where
 
05:18:06.230 --> 05:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
co-parenting and uh allocation of uh
 
05:18:09.868 --> 05:18:09.878 align:start position:0%
time and and or money was uh being used
 
05:18:13.788 --> 05:18:13.798 align:start position:0%
uh the the recommendation for a formula
 
05:18:16.230 --> 05:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
has showed up in a couple of uh uh
 
05:18:18.788 --> 05:18:18.798 align:start position:0%
reports that the state uh spent
 
05:18:22.230 --> 05:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
considerable time and money on um you'd
 
05:18:24.150 --> 05:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
hope that they were good recommendations
 
05:18:26.430 --> 05:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
but the recommendations for a formula
 
05:18:30.350 --> 05:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
were in multiple reports uh this does
 
05:18:34.510 --> 05:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
that um you would think I would think
 
05:18:36.030 --> 05:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
not working in the
 
05:18:39.548 --> 05:18:39.558 align:start position:0%
Judiciary that um have having a formula
 
05:18:42.110 --> 05:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
to calculate things like co-parenting
 
05:18:46.110 --> 05:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
time and and uh sharing of of resources
 
05:18:48.548 --> 05:18:48.558 align:start position:0%
that having a formula would make it
 
05:18:50.750 --> 05:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
really simple it'd make it transparent
 
05:18:52.628 --> 05:18:52.638 align:start position:0%
everyone would know what to expect it
 
05:18:55.470 --> 05:18:55.480 align:start position:0%
would reduce conflict and and enhance
 
05:18:58.150 --> 05:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
understanding um the the the concern is
 
05:19:00.150 --> 05:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
that in some cases such as domestic
 
05:19:03.868 --> 05:19:03.878 align:start position:0%
violence the the the formula may be
 
05:19:07.110 --> 05:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
inappropriate but nevertheless the judge
 
05:19:09.270 --> 05:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
retains the authority and our current
 
05:19:13.030 --> 05:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
law to make a a different decision based
 
05:19:16.868 --> 05:19:16.878 align:start position:0%
on the best interests of the child so
 
05:19:19.948 --> 05:19:19.958 align:start position:0%
this is a this this amendment brings
 
05:19:25.590 --> 05:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
forth A U is a replace all for 95 it uh
 
05:19:27.990 --> 05:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
um makes it compatible from a
 
05:19:30.948 --> 05:19:30.958 align:start position:0%
definitions perspective it adds a simple
 
05:19:34.750 --> 05:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
to understand and simple to use formula
 
05:19:37.510 --> 05:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
that can be overridden in particular
 
05:19:41.230 --> 05:19:41.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances by the judge anyways so I
 
05:19:43.150 --> 05:19:43.160 align:start position:0%
I think I think it's a really nice
 
05:19:45.030 --> 05:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
compromise it doesn't spend any more
 
05:19:47.708 --> 05:19:47.718 align:start position:0%
money because we accepted
 
05:19:50.910 --> 05:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
1564 this amendment essentially has no
 
05:19:54.510 --> 05:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
dollar cost because the same it CH
 
05:19:57.230 --> 05:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
change can be done for both of them so
 
05:19:59.670 --> 05:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's one charge one time and and we
 
05:20:03.430 --> 05:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
allocated that over to 1564 so this is
 
05:20:05.788 --> 05:20:05.798 align:start position:0%
kind of a freebie in a
 
05:20:09.510 --> 05:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
way thank you further discussion
 
05:20:11.948 --> 05:20:11.958 align:start position:0%
representa tersi thank you Mr
 
05:20:15.750 --> 05:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
chairman um first I just I believe
 
05:20:16.750 --> 05:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
either I
 
05:20:18.788 --> 05:20:18.798 align:start position:0%
misheard representative Edwards or he
 
05:20:21.230 --> 05:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
misspoke he said this was a
 
05:20:24.910 --> 05:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
complete rewrite or replace all of the
 
05:20:27.708 --> 05:20:27.718 align:start position:0%
bill and I think that was incorrect this
 
05:20:30.070 --> 05:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
is not a replace all um so I want to
 
05:20:36.230 --> 05:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
clarify that second on our sheet here um
 
05:20:38.670 --> 05:20:38.680 align:start position:0%
that lists how it came out of division
 
05:20:42.270 --> 05:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
it's listed as the vote as 72 in fact we
 
05:20:44.150 --> 05:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
reconsidered and the final vote on this
 
05:20:46.990 --> 05:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
was 6-3 it's not reflected on our sheet
 
05:20:49.350 --> 05:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure that we're aware of
 
05:20:49.360 --> 05:20:51.110 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure that we're aware of
that

05:20:51.110 --> 05:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:20:53.510 --> 05:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
um I think I have more to say on the
 
05:20:56.708 --> 05:20:56.718 align:start position:0%
bill uh once the amendment is dealt with
 
05:20:58.910 --> 05:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
however um I'll just say that I don't
 
05:21:01.910 --> 05:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
think the amendment actually um
 
05:21:04.070 --> 05:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
addressed some of the concerns that the
 
05:21:06.910 --> 05:21:06.920 align:start position:0%
committee had
 
05:21:10.788 --> 05:21:10.798 align:start position:0%
um but I appre appreciate the effort to
 
05:21:13.670 --> 05:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
try and make
 
05:21:17.510 --> 05:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
um both bills compatible um I just don't
 
05:21:19.910 --> 05:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
believe that it was successful in doing
 
05:21:22.110 --> 05:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
that so I will leave it at that so
 
05:21:23.628 --> 05:21:23.638 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right in both your
 
05:21:25.708 --> 05:21:25.718 align:start position:0%
Corrections thank you for that and and I
 
05:21:27.788 --> 05:21:27.798 align:start position:0%
failed to mention that this uh policy
 
05:21:30.830 --> 05:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
passed the house in the larger version 7
 
05:21:33.990 --> 05:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
to6 or U uh it it passed their committee
 
05:21:37.190 --> 05:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
7 to6 and passed the house already so we
 
05:21:39.110 --> 05:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
we've got an approved policy that no
 
05:21:41.910 --> 05:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
longer costs any
 
05:21:45.350 --> 05:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
money thank you all right further
 
05:21:48.708 --> 05:21:48.718 align:start position:0%
discussion all right uh we have an
 
05:21:51.030 --> 05:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
amendment before us
 
05:21:54.350 --> 05:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
1178 without objection those in favor
 
05:22:03.510 --> 05:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:07.510 --> 05:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
hands 13 those
 
05:22:07.520 --> 05:22:14.350 align:start position:0%
hands 13 those
opposed

05:22:14.350 --> 05:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:18.548 --> 05:22:18.558 align:start position:0%
11 I don't see 11 one two three four I
 
05:22:21.230 --> 05:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
think you only got 12 the first time was
 
05:22:22.948 --> 05:22:22.958 align:start position:0%
it was I wrong on the first count I
 
05:22:26.190 --> 05:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:29.628 --> 05:22:29.638 align:start position:0%
right 1311 1311 the motion pass the
 
05:22:29.638 --> 05:22:31.310 align:start position:0%
right 1311 1311 the motion pass the
motion's

05:22:31.310 --> 05:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
motion's
 
05:22:34.750 --> 05:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
adopted Mr chair I believe it was 1410
 
05:22:37.910 --> 05:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
with rep Heath on a yes all right 14 to
 
05:22:40.868 --> 05:22:40.878 align:start position:0%
10 either way it passes all right motion
 
05:22:45.150 --> 05:22:45.160 align:start position:0%
now before us is House Bill 1595 ought
 
05:22:47.150 --> 05:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
to pass as
 
05:22:51.190 --> 05:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
amended with house with Amendment
 
05:22:55.110 --> 05:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
1178 the motion is by representative
 
05:22:58.310 --> 05:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
Edward seconded by representative Hull
 
05:23:00.190 --> 05:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on the
 
05:23:02.150 --> 05:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
on the bill as amended representative
 
05:23:06.110 --> 05:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
tersi thank you I appreciate the time um
 
05:23:07.548 --> 05:23:07.558 align:start position:0%
for those of you on division 3 know that
 
05:23:10.230 --> 05:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
we spent a lot of lot of time on both of
 
05:23:11.948 --> 05:23:11.958 align:start position:0%
the bills uh the first one that we
 
05:23:15.030 --> 05:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
passed earlier today and this one
 
05:23:18.990 --> 05:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
um my concern is that both bills because
 
05:23:22.030 --> 05:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
they addressed similar uh base issues
 
05:23:23.350 --> 05:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
and because they had the same fiscal
 
05:23:26.150 --> 05:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
note due to the money being spent on um
 
05:23:28.350 --> 05:23:28.360 align:start position:0%
system changes to accommodate those
 
05:23:30.110 --> 05:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
changes that they were thrown in the
 
05:23:32.670 --> 05:23:32.680 align:start position:0%
same basket and were considered two
 
05:23:35.270 --> 05:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
kinds of apples that we could compare
 
05:23:39.868 --> 05:23:39.878 align:start position:0%
and once we really um dug into it
 
05:23:42.430 --> 05:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
I believed that it was not that easy
 
05:23:45.510 --> 05:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
that they were um easily mergeable or a
 
05:23:48.750 --> 05:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
one-size fitall kind of
 
05:23:48.760 --> 05:23:51.830 align:start position:0%
one-size fitall kind of
solution

05:23:51.830 --> 05:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:54.990 --> 05:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
um the biggest part uh representative
 
05:23:57.110 --> 05:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
Edwards alluded to was concerns about
 
05:23:58.830 --> 05:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and situations of
 
05:24:01.190 --> 05:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
abuse um in relation to the parenting
 
05:24:05.990 --> 05:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
time calculator um we heard that uh some
 
05:24:08.990 --> 05:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
Advocates believed that tying um
 
05:24:14.788 --> 05:24:14.798 align:start position:0%
parenting time um directly um to the
 
05:24:17.150 --> 05:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
Child Support guideline in situations of
 
05:24:21.190 --> 05:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
households with abuse um was in and of
 
05:24:24.150 --> 05:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
itself problematic and I don't believe
 
05:24:27.350 --> 05:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
that um the bill as amended successfully
 
05:24:27.360 --> 05:24:28.590 align:start position:0%
that um the bill as amended successfully
address

05:24:28.590 --> 05:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
address
 
05:24:31.590 --> 05:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
that my alternative I will be voting no
 
05:24:33.390 --> 05:24:33.400 align:start position:0%
on the octopath as amended my my
 
05:24:36.948 --> 05:24:36.958 align:start position:0%
alternative motion is not itl I simply
 
05:24:39.990 --> 05:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
believe that a little more time has to
 
05:24:43.070 --> 05:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
be taken to figure out how these two
 
05:24:46.628 --> 05:24:46.638 align:start position:0%
bills can stand together to figure out
 
05:24:50.270 --> 05:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
how those really difficult situations
 
05:24:53.830 --> 05:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
when children are involved between um
 
05:24:55.948 --> 05:24:55.958 align:start position:0%
parents that are not getting along and
 
05:24:58.150 --> 05:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
not coming to agreement how we can put
 
05:25:02.590 --> 05:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
children first so I would
 
05:25:05.750 --> 05:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
um it's late I won't I'll just urge you
 
05:25:08.310 --> 05:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
to please um vote no on the octopath
 
05:25:10.070 --> 05:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
pass is amended so an alternative motion
 
05:25:12.070 --> 05:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
of interim study could be made so that
 
05:25:14.628 --> 05:25:14.638 align:start position:0%
we can make sure that this is the right
 
05:25:17.270 --> 05:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
solution for kids here in the state
 
05:25:17.280 --> 05:25:18.270 align:start position:0%
solution for kids here in the state
thank

05:25:18.270 --> 05:25:18.280 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:25:21.270 --> 05:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
you representative Edwards uh thank you
 
05:25:24.510 --> 05:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
I I think one place I I I was relatively
 
05:25:30.070 --> 05:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
clear is that uh these uh two bills hit
 
05:25:33.470 --> 05:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
the same it system and there they share
 
05:25:37.830 --> 05:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note um and so uh I I don't
 
05:25:41.270 --> 05:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
believe I implied that from a policy
 
05:25:45.670 --> 05:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
perspective they uh were intended to be
 
05:25:49.190 --> 05:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh synergistic or aligned I it's just
 
05:25:53.030 --> 05:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
that we can do both uh with without any
 
05:25:56.868 --> 05:25:56.878 align:start position:0%
additional money uh and that the the
 
05:25:59.590 --> 05:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
finding that this amendment takes care
 
05:26:02.190 --> 05:26:02.200 align:start position:0%
of or this bill will take care of on an
 
05:26:05.310 --> 05:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
otpa has been identified in multiple
 
05:26:08.030 --> 05:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
reports as the right way to go and so it
 
05:26:09.990 --> 05:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
is that we haven't looked at this issue
 
05:26:11.628 --> 05:26:11.638 align:start position:0%
we've looked at this issue we've paid
 
05:26:14.430 --> 05:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
probably a total of $400,000 for
 
05:26:16.788 --> 05:26:16.798 align:start position:0%
multiple reports and I'm told it's more
 
05:26:19.990 --> 05:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
than 400,000 and so I I think we ought
 
05:26:22.830 --> 05:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
to we ought to just go ahead and U pass
 
05:26:25.110 --> 05:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
this now while we can do the
 
05:26:28.430 --> 05:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
implementation at uh at no extra cost so
 
05:26:32.270 --> 05:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
I would uh definitely recommend uh a yes
 
05:26:34.910 --> 05:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
vote on
 
05:26:37.230 --> 05:26:37.240 align:start position:0%
otpa further discussion if you want to
 
05:26:39.590 --> 05:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
keep your job all right we've have we
 
05:26:41.868 --> 05:26:41.878 align:start position:0%

Edwards we now move to House Bill
 
05:29:08.470 --> 05:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
1573 representative Edwards okay okay
 
05:29:12.670 --> 05:29:12.680 align:start position:0%
under the category last but not least um
 
05:29:17.350 --> 05:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
this was uh uh House Bill
 
05:29:20.548 --> 05:29:20.558 align:start position:0%
1573 represented a bill that um
 
05:29:23.030 --> 05:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
encouraged division 3 to spend the most
 
05:29:26.470 --> 05:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
time talking about it and uh and
 
05:29:30.948 --> 05:29:30.958 align:start position:0%
probably the most activity um generated
 
05:29:35.310 --> 05:29:35.320 align:start position:0%
by it uh for the community uh it came to
 
05:29:40.670 --> 05:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
us um from Children and Family law um uh
 
05:29:42.788 --> 05:29:42.798 align:start position:0%
talking to the chairman and the sponsor
 
05:29:42.798 --> 05:29:44.110 align:start position:0%
talking to the chairman and the sponsor
of

05:29:44.110 --> 05:29:44.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:29:47.830 --> 05:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
1573 uh they stated categorically that
 
05:29:49.830 --> 05:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
they never considered the finances as
 
05:29:52.910 --> 05:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
they were putting the bill together uh
 
05:29:56.150 --> 05:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
and they wanted you smart people in
 
05:30:00.310 --> 05:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
finance to figure that out quote so so
 
05:30:02.430 --> 05:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
with that permission
 
05:30:06.830 --> 05:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
um we we reopened the policy portion of
 
05:30:09.830 --> 05:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
the bill because it was important if we
 
05:30:11.868 --> 05:30:11.878 align:start position:0%
were going to do something that we did
 
05:30:15.310 --> 05:30:15.320 align:start position:0%
it in a way in which we got the initial
 
05:30:18.470 --> 05:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
costs down the the initial fiscal note
 
05:30:20.270 --> 05:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
on this I don't I don't remember exactly
 
05:30:23.030 --> 05:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
what it is anymore U Mr Ripple if you do
 
05:30:25.708 --> 05:30:25.718 align:start position:0%
it's like it's over $6 million or
 
05:30:28.548 --> 05:30:28.558 align:start position:0%
something it was it was a fairly large
 
05:30:30.270 --> 05:30:30.280 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal
 
05:30:33.990 --> 05:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
note do you have it I can look it up now
 
05:30:35.830 --> 05:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
I don't remember off the top of my head
 
05:30:40.030 --> 05:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
$7.5 million a year 7 5 million um and
 
05:30:45.470 --> 05:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
and so because we cared about the ocas
 
05:30:48.430 --> 05:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
the office of child Advocates uh
 
05:30:51.868 --> 05:30:51.878 align:start position:0%
recommendations that flowed uh from
 
05:30:54.948 --> 05:30:54.958 align:start position:0%
their investigation at the bledo Academy
 
05:30:56.750 --> 05:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
down in Tennessee you may have read
 
05:30:59.548 --> 05:30:59.558 align:start position:0%
about it in the newspapers uh we had a
 
05:31:01.990 --> 05:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
couple of kids there that according to
 
05:31:06.910 --> 05:31:06.920 align:start position:0%
the OCA report um were uh in in a a
 
05:31:10.868 --> 05:31:10.878 align:start position:0%
fairly abusive environment and it was uh
 
05:31:13.030 --> 05:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
it was bad press and it looked bad
 
05:31:16.230 --> 05:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
because uh DHHS it had sent employees
 
05:31:18.990 --> 05:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
down there uh the week before OCA
 
05:31:23.190 --> 05:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
checked it out and the the our uh DHHS
 
05:31:25.670 --> 05:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
employees didn't find anything uh
 
05:31:29.190 --> 05:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
significantly wrong they they uh but the
 
05:31:32.230 --> 05:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
OCA did there were subsequent
 
05:31:36.948 --> 05:31:36.958 align:start position:0%
third-party uh audits of uh bledo and uh
 
05:31:40.590 --> 05:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
they didn't find the same things that
 
05:31:44.510 --> 05:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
the OCA report did um but uh
 
05:31:47.430 --> 05:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
nevertheless the OCA report is extremely
 
05:31:49.430 --> 05:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
damning and something that we should
 
05:31:53.548 --> 05:31:53.558 align:start position:0%
take cons uh seriously because uh the
 
05:31:57.628 --> 05:31:57.638 align:start position:0%
DCF mandate or or placement of uh kids
 
05:31:59.590 --> 05:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
out of state is a very serious
 
05:32:02.708 --> 05:32:02.718 align:start position:0%
obligation or responsibility on our part
 
05:32:07.190 --> 05:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
so so wanting it to succeed we asked OCA
 
05:32:12.390 --> 05:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
and DH HS to keep working on uh uh an
 
05:32:15.270 --> 05:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
accommodation of each other's interests
 
05:32:17.310 --> 05:32:17.320 align:start position:0%
so that we could
 
05:32:20.708 --> 05:32:20.718 align:start position:0%
streamline the the policy components and
 
05:32:23.030 --> 05:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
try to get the costs down now the the
 
05:32:24.948 --> 05:32:24.958 align:start position:0%
other thing that happened was for the
 
05:32:28.190 --> 05:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
first time after we had begun meeting on
 
05:32:30.948 --> 05:32:30.958 align:start position:0%
it we recognized that the judicial
 
05:32:34.670 --> 05:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
branch had not been involved they had uh
 
05:32:37.628 --> 05:32:37.638 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note in there of of two judges
 
05:32:42.310 --> 05:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
and and nine clerks in order to support
 
05:32:45.150 --> 05:32:45.160 align:start position:0%
1573 which was a huge growth in
 
05:32:48.670 --> 05:32:48.680 align:start position:0%
Workforce and and cost so so we thought
 
05:32:50.310 --> 05:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch ought to get in
 
05:32:52.788 --> 05:32:52.798 align:start position:0%
there and help us figure it out
 
05:32:58.350 --> 05:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
also that resulted in an amendment that
 
05:33:01.430 --> 05:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
dropped the costs down
 
05:33:04.830 --> 05:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
significantly but it left us with a
 
05:33:07.230 --> 05:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
piece of law that would have been highly
 
05:33:07.240 --> 05:33:08.590 align:start position:0%
piece of law that would have been highly
prescriptive

05:33:08.590 --> 05:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
prescriptive
 
05:33:11.350 --> 05:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
highly prescriptive in a way in which
 
05:33:13.548 --> 05:33:13.558 align:start position:0%
it's probably inappropriate for
 
05:33:15.910 --> 05:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
statutory design it just got into too
 
05:33:20.430 --> 05:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
much detail uh it also set up uh some
 
05:33:24.070 --> 05:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
extreme uh not extreme some some
 
05:33:26.670 --> 05:33:26.680 align:start position:0%
significant requirements in terms of uh
 
05:33:28.750 --> 05:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
the number of visits and exactly how the
 
05:33:30.990 --> 05:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
visits would take place and they they
 
05:33:32.708 --> 05:33:32.718 align:start position:0%
didn't want to consider video
 
05:33:35.548 --> 05:33:35.558 align:start position:0%
conferencing to be a legitimate way to
 
05:33:38.430 --> 05:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
to check on a kid uh and so we still
 
05:33:40.750 --> 05:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
ended up with a pretty expensive
 
05:33:43.270 --> 05:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment um and I don't remember how
 
05:33:46.270 --> 05:33:46.280 align:start position:0%
much that amendment was representative
 
05:33:48.310 --> 05:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
Earth do you do you it was we didn't
 
05:33:50.510 --> 05:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
have numbers we didn't have numbers it
 
05:33:53.830 --> 05:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
it it was it I I I think it was still in
 
05:33:57.030 --> 05:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
the5 to6 million range it was it was
 
05:33:59.510 --> 05:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
still pretty intense because it would
 
05:34:03.868 --> 05:34:03.878 align:start position:0%
have required 15 DHHS employees alone to
 
05:34:03.878 --> 05:34:05.110 align:start position:0%
have required 15 DHHS employees alone to
handle

05:34:05.110 --> 05:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
handle
 
05:34:08.510 --> 05:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
this so um
 
05:34:11.910 --> 05:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
so what this amendment does is it it
 
05:34:14.350 --> 05:34:14.360 align:start position:0%
basically concurs with
 
05:34:16.708 --> 05:34:16.718 align:start position:0%
1573 purpose and
 
05:34:20.070 --> 05:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
findings and it does add a critical
 
05:34:23.150 --> 05:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
policy component that it just seems to
 
05:34:27.948 --> 05:34:27.958 align:start position:0%
be smart uh on on page two starting at
 
05:34:30.990 --> 05:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
line nine that said it shall be the
 
05:34:33.868 --> 05:34:33.878 align:start position:0%
policy of DHHS that any placement of a
 
05:34:36.310 --> 05:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
child outside of New England shall
 
05:34:38.708 --> 05:34:38.718 align:start position:0%
require the approval of the division for
 
05:34:41.510 --> 05:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
children youth and families directors
 
05:34:43.430 --> 05:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
prior to that placement with specific
 
05:34:46.430 --> 05:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
findings of the need for that placement
 
05:34:49.350 --> 05:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
so that that that part of what was in
 
05:34:52.190 --> 05:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
the statute uh as proposed was was
 
05:34:56.470 --> 05:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
really good and we kept it other vast
 
05:34:59.470 --> 05:34:59.480 align:start position:0%
amounts of the other parts of the
 
05:35:03.510 --> 05:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
proposed bill um have already been
 
05:35:06.910 --> 05:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
implemented by DHHS DHHS has taken the
 
05:35:08.750 --> 05:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
findings very seriously they've put it
 
05:35:11.510 --> 05:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
into policy they're consuming resources
 
05:35:14.150 --> 05:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
to execute in a more intensive
 
05:35:16.868 --> 05:35:16.878 align:start position:0%
certification process and and visitation
 
05:35:19.510 --> 05:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
process so so they're already doing the
 
05:35:22.788 --> 05:35:22.798 align:start position:0%
work and so the question for the
 
05:35:25.590 --> 05:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
legislature is to what extent do we
 
05:35:29.628 --> 05:35:29.638 align:start position:0%
trust the commissioner to do her job um
 
05:35:33.030 --> 05:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
know having had an opportunity to to see
 
05:35:36.110 --> 05:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
the problems and and she has implemented
 
05:35:38.390 --> 05:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
new policies to meet this this and
 
05:35:41.110 --> 05:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
because they're burning resources uh in
 
05:35:45.230 --> 05:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
excess of their original budget um the
 
05:35:48.830 --> 05:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
Appropriations for from line 12 down to
 
05:35:52.150 --> 05:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
17 gave them a million dollars to use
 
05:35:53.868 --> 05:35:53.878 align:start position:0%
pretty much at the commissioner's
 
05:35:56.430 --> 05:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
discretion and uh I've since talked to
 
05:36:01.788 --> 05:36:01.798 align:start position:0%
her and uh she appreciates the approach
 
05:36:04.910 --> 05:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh she she she's committed she committed
 
05:36:06.868 --> 05:36:06.878 align:start position:0%
to me that this is a serious issue the
 
05:36:08.548 --> 05:36:08.558 align:start position:0%
Departments work working on it it's got
 
05:36:10.868 --> 05:36:10.878 align:start position:0%
everyone's focus and they need the
 
05:36:13.510 --> 05:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
additional resources so so that million
 
05:36:16.350 --> 05:36:16.360 align:start position:0%
dollars is a is a is a is a good thing
 
05:36:19.788 --> 05:36:19.798 align:start position:0%
it's a complete wag uh you know what wag
 
05:36:25.590 --> 05:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
is um wild ass guess uh based on um the
 
05:36:28.310 --> 05:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
number of additional visits and all um
 
05:36:30.070 --> 05:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
she said it would not exceed a million
 
05:36:33.110 --> 05:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
dollars but we can work that out in more
 
05:36:35.590 --> 05:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
detail with the Senate I've since also
 
05:36:39.350 --> 05:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
talked to the Senate uh chair of finance
 
05:36:41.190 --> 05:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
and when I told him it was a million
 
05:36:43.470 --> 05:36:43.480 align:start position:0%
dollar he said we don't have a million
 
05:36:46.030 --> 05:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
dollars I you know that's fiscally
 
05:36:47.830 --> 05:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
irresponsible to ask for a million
 
05:36:49.628 --> 05:36:49.638 align:start position:0%
dollars at this point in the process and
 
05:36:53.310 --> 05:36:53.320 align:start position:0%
I pointed out that the alternative was
 
05:36:55.510 --> 05:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
multiples of millions you know five or
 
05:36:57.470 --> 05:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
six million and that a million dollars
 
05:36:59.948 --> 05:36:59.958 align:start position:0%
was pretty fiscally responsible so so
 
05:37:03.310 --> 05:37:03.320 align:start position:0%
I'm I begun advocating for this position
 
05:37:07.190 --> 05:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
um um and I I I I I I don't think we're
 
05:37:10.150 --> 05:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
done I think this continues the process
 
05:37:14.230 --> 05:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
so uh I I never I never made a motion
 
05:37:19.868 --> 05:37:19.878 align:start position:0%
for us to uh adopt 1309 um Mr chair um
 
05:37:22.390 --> 05:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
but I would need a second if that's a
 
05:37:22.400 --> 05:37:23.230 align:start position:0%
but I would need a second if that's a
good

05:37:23.230 --> 05:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
good
 
05:37:26.830 --> 05:37:26.840 align:start position:0%
motion okay motion by representative
 
05:37:29.230 --> 05:37:29.240 align:start position:0%
Edwards second by representative F to
 
05:37:31.788 --> 05:37:31.798 align:start position:0%
adopt Amendment
 
05:37:34.788 --> 05:37:34.798 align:start position:0%
1309 and and so this is a more of a
 
05:37:38.708 --> 05:37:38.718 align:start position:0%
replace all than the other one so
 
05:37:42.708 --> 05:37:42.718 align:start position:0%
um and I'm I'm done discussing this if
 
05:37:42.718 --> 05:37:44.230 align:start position:0%
um and I'm I'm done discussing this if
representa

05:37:44.230 --> 05:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
representa
 
05:37:48.590 --> 05:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:52.948 --> 05:37:52.958 align:start position:0%
you so this was a bill that came to us
 
05:37:55.270 --> 05:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
um from the children and family law
 
05:37:57.430 --> 05:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
committee and they voted it out 15 to
 
05:37:59.830 --> 05:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
zero and it was a Voice vote on the
 
05:38:01.150 --> 05:38:01.160 align:start position:0%
floor of the
 
05:38:05.470 --> 05:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
house and this is a response to a really
 
05:38:08.150 --> 05:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
concerning issue that happened
 
05:38:11.868 --> 05:38:11.878 align:start position:0%
um when the child advocate went to
 
05:38:15.070 --> 05:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
Tennessee to visit two boys that were in
 
05:38:17.270 --> 05:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State custody and had been
 
05:38:21.830 --> 05:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:25.948 --> 05:38:25.958 align:start position:0%
facility she wrote a report which any of
 
05:38:29.430 --> 05:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
you can read and I think if you read it
 
05:38:31.750 --> 05:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
you too will probably be
 
05:38:34.030 --> 05:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
concerned um I think one of the most
 
05:38:35.590 --> 05:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
serious things we
 
05:38:38.110 --> 05:38:38.120 align:start position:0%
do as a
 
05:38:42.310 --> 05:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
state is when we take custody of
 
05:38:46.390 --> 05:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
people's children for whatever reason it
 
05:38:49.628 --> 05:38:49.638 align:start position:0%
is and when we place them in facilities
 
05:38:51.948 --> 05:38:51.958 align:start position:0%
I think the state has a real
 
05:38:55.270 --> 05:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility to be sure that those
 
05:38:58.750 --> 05:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
places are safe and the children are
 
05:39:01.070 --> 05:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
receiving the treatment that the state
 
05:39:04.310 --> 05:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
is paying those facilities for that is
 
05:39:07.070 --> 05:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
not what um the child advocate found
 
05:39:09.110 --> 05:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
when she went to
 
05:39:12.110 --> 05:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
Tennessee there are probably
 
05:39:12.120 --> 05:39:13.628 align:start position:0%
Tennessee there are probably
other

05:39:13.628 --> 05:39:13.638 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:39:17.708 --> 05:39:17.718 align:start position:0%
facilities that also are not meeting the
 
05:39:21.468 --> 05:39:21.478 align:start position:0%
um obligations to children that they
 
05:39:24.868 --> 05:39:24.878 align:start position:0%
have placed with them by the state what
 
05:39:26.030 --> 05:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
05:39:26.040 --> 05:39:28.230 align:start position:0%
the bill
does

05:39:28.230 --> 05:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
does
 
05:39:28.240 --> 05:39:29.830 align:start position:0%
does
is

05:39:29.830 --> 05:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:39:32.468 --> 05:39:32.478 align:start position:0%
prescribe as a representative Edwards
 
05:39:33.990 --> 05:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
said it does
 
05:39:38.030 --> 05:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
prescribe um a road map for the
 
05:39:40.788 --> 05:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
department on the things that would be
 
05:39:42.868 --> 05:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
expected and I don't think there's
 
05:39:45.150 --> 05:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
anything the child advocate and the
 
05:39:48.990 --> 05:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
department actually worked very hard for
 
05:39:51.948 --> 05:39:51.958 align:start position:0%
the last several months on coming up
 
05:39:55.190 --> 05:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
with a position that they could both um
 
05:39:59.390 --> 05:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
feel maybe not not 100% but they got
 
05:40:01.788 --> 05:40:01.798 align:start position:0%
pretty close they're probably at about
 
05:40:06.070 --> 05:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
97% in agreement um on a on an amendment
 
05:40:08.548 --> 05:40:08.558 align:start position:0%
that was brought to us last
 
05:40:11.910 --> 05:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
Friday doing things such as requiring
 
05:40:16.548 --> 05:40:16.558 align:start position:0%
that there be two visits a year two
 
05:40:18.830 --> 05:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
visits to
 
05:40:18.840 --> 05:40:20.868 align:start position:0%
visits to
um

05:40:20.868 --> 05:40:20.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:23.868 --> 05:40:23.878 align:start position:0%
places on a regular uh two visits I'm
 
05:40:26.548 --> 05:40:26.558 align:start position:0%
sorry on a regular basis but one of them
 
05:40:26.558 --> 05:40:27.788 align:start position:0%
sorry on a regular basis but one of them
being

05:40:27.788 --> 05:40:27.798 align:start position:0%
being
 
05:40:30.788 --> 05:40:30.798 align:start position:0%
unannounced so that the facility would
 
05:40:34.548 --> 05:40:34.558 align:start position:0%
not know that um that someone was coming
 
05:40:37.350 --> 05:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
and that's probably when you really
 
05:40:41.390 --> 05:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
learn a lot each child would receive a
 
05:40:44.270 --> 05:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
visit every month by their case
 
05:40:46.670 --> 05:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
worker the bill that they came up with
 
05:40:48.670 --> 05:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
on Friday the amendment that the
 
05:40:51.110 --> 05:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
department came up with on Friday with
 
05:40:56.628 --> 05:40:56.638 align:start position:0%
the child advocate um actually has in it
 
05:40:59.910 --> 05:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
the uh Appropriations lined out as to
 
05:41:02.788 --> 05:41:02.798 align:start position:0%
what the finances would be spent on and
 
05:41:05.390 --> 05:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
the bill as it came to us on Friday the
 
05:41:09.708 --> 05:41:09.718 align:start position:0%
amendment is about $1.9 million and you
 
05:41:12.548 --> 05:41:12.558 align:start position:0%
can read for your I've got copies of
 
05:41:15.670 --> 05:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
this amendment also you can read here
 
05:41:20.110 --> 05:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
exactly how the money would be spent
 
05:41:23.070 --> 05:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
and in the amendment before you right
 
05:41:25.670 --> 05:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
now you're just giving the department a
 
05:41:25.680 --> 05:41:26.788 align:start position:0%
now you're just giving the department a
million

05:41:26.788 --> 05:41:26.798 align:start position:0%
million
 
05:41:31.110 --> 05:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
dollars you are not prescribing at all
 
05:41:34.430 --> 05:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
what they will do with it yes I know the
 
05:41:37.948 --> 05:41:37.958 align:start position:0%
department of course wants to
 
05:41:40.830 --> 05:41:40.840 align:start position:0%
do a good job attending to this but I
 
05:41:42.150 --> 05:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
think it's the legislature's
 
05:41:45.310 --> 05:41:45.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility to be sure we we do some
 
05:41:47.670 --> 05:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
direction of how we want to see the
 
05:41:51.350 --> 05:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
funds expended and in the amendment
 
05:41:53.310 --> 05:41:53.320 align:start position:0%
before you right now there's not even a
 
05:41:55.948 --> 05:41:55.958 align:start position:0%
report at the end you know in a year or
 
05:41:57.990 --> 05:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
so there's not even a report back to the
 
05:42:01.548 --> 05:42:01.558 align:start position:0%
legislature as to what is a what has
 
05:42:04.150 --> 05:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
happened over the time that they've had
 
05:42:06.110 --> 05:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
the um New
 
05:42:09.708 --> 05:42:09.718 align:start position:0%
requirements I hope that the finance
 
05:42:11.788 --> 05:42:11.798 align:start position:0%
committee will really think seriously
 
05:42:16.150 --> 05:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
about whether the way we operate here is
 
05:42:17.430 --> 05:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
just to give
 
05:42:20.150 --> 05:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
departments blank checks basically and
 
05:42:23.990 --> 05:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
say here hope you can get the job done I
 
05:42:25.590 --> 05:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
think the legislature has a
 
05:42:30.788 --> 05:42:30.798 align:start position:0%
responsibility for um prescribing how we
 
05:42:34.510 --> 05:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
want to see these funds used and um
 
05:42:36.708 --> 05:42:36.718 align:start position:0%
certainly the department and the child
 
05:42:40.030 --> 05:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
advocates have worked long and hard to
 
05:42:44.310 --> 05:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
come up with um a proposal that they
 
05:42:49.190 --> 05:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
they can both um work from last week the
 
05:42:52.390 --> 05:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
um director of the division of Children
 
05:42:55.190 --> 05:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
and Families came before us his name is
 
05:42:58.868 --> 05:42:58.878 align:start position:0%
Jeff Fletcher and he's pretty new and he
 
05:43:01.270 --> 05:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
came before us and he told us the
 
05:43:03.868 --> 05:43:03.878 align:start position:0%
division how much the department really
 
05:43:07.868 --> 05:43:07.878 align:start position:0%
feels he feels they need this uh
 
05:43:12.510 --> 05:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
legislation and um following his
 
05:43:16.030 --> 05:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
following his guidance I think that um
 
05:43:19.310 --> 05:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
the approach that this amendment is
 
05:43:24.230 --> 05:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
before us right now takes is um not what
 
05:43:25.830 --> 05:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
he needs for his
 
05:43:29.788 --> 05:43:29.798 align:start position:0%
Department if the the amendment is goes
 
05:43:35.110 --> 05:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
down I do have the um an amendment that
 
05:43:37.230 --> 05:43:37.240 align:start position:0%
addresses the agreement between between
 
05:43:39.390 --> 05:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
the child advocate and the department
 
05:43:41.830 --> 05:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
that they came to last
 
05:43:43.590 --> 05:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
week thank
 
05:43:47.110 --> 05:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
you for the discussion representative
 
05:43:49.510 --> 05:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
tersi thank you very much Mr chairman I
 
05:43:51.628 --> 05:43:51.638 align:start position:0%
just wanted to add a couple quick points
 
05:43:53.430 --> 05:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
that maybe representative wner didn't
 
05:43:57.670 --> 05:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
touch on um we started with two groups
 
05:44:01.788 --> 05:44:01.798 align:start position:0%
really far apart really far apart and it
 
05:44:04.390 --> 05:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
was clear that they both had an idea of
 
05:44:07.390 --> 05:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
where they needed to go and as the work
 
05:44:09.628 --> 05:44:09.638 align:start position:0%
happened I applaud the people who were
 
05:44:11.990 --> 05:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
on that subcommittee who worked on that
 
05:44:14.948 --> 05:44:14.958 align:start position:0%
they got closer and closer no neither
 
05:44:16.830 --> 05:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
one really got what they wanted but in
 
05:44:19.948 --> 05:44:19.958 align:start position:0%
the end they were 97% there both the
 
05:44:21.468 --> 05:44:21.478 align:start position:0%
office of child advocate and the
 
05:44:24.830 --> 05:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
department sat there and they both said
 
05:44:28.190 --> 05:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
we need guidelines we're doing it but we
 
05:44:31.390 --> 05:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
want to be have it itemized and guard
 
05:44:33.948 --> 05:44:33.958 align:start position:0%
rails put down so that everyone's clear
 
05:44:36.830 --> 05:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
on what we're doing this amendment right
 
05:44:39.708 --> 05:44:39.718 align:start position:0%
here here with a blank check in node gar
 
05:44:42.510 --> 05:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
rails this is fiscally irresponsible to
 
05:44:45.270 --> 05:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
just say I hope you can get it done you
 
05:44:47.468 --> 05:44:47.478 align:start position:0%
say you're doing it when they're asking
 
05:44:49.110 --> 05:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
for us to give them those
 
05:44:53.270 --> 05:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
guidelines so again I hope you can
 
05:44:56.150 --> 05:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
support um the argument that we have
 
05:44:57.948 --> 05:44:57.958 align:start position:0%
here for the other amendment that
 
05:44:59.510 --> 05:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
actually sets up the structure that the
 
05:45:01.990 --> 05:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
Departments are asking us for and please
 
05:45:03.590 --> 05:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
vote no on this amendment so another one
 
05:45:04.708 --> 05:45:04.718 align:start position:0%
can be
 
05:45:08.190 --> 05:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
introduced representative Edwards
 
05:45:09.948 --> 05:45:09.958 align:start position:0%
as I said I I spoke with the
 
05:45:12.110 --> 05:45:12.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner about this and I've spoken
 
05:45:14.990 --> 05:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
with her many times before we have a
 
05:45:18.390 --> 05:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
very good collegial relationship and uh
 
05:45:21.430 --> 05:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
we both applauded the the work of Miss
 
05:45:24.030 --> 05:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
Morris and and working out a tremendous
 
05:45:26.750 --> 05:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
amount of detail um but I think
 
05:45:30.948 --> 05:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
ultimately the commissioner is perfectly
 
05:45:33.868 --> 05:45:33.878 align:start position:0%
fine with my Amendment she doesn't need
 
05:45:35.708 --> 05:45:35.718 align:start position:0%
a lot of guidelines because they've
 
05:45:37.430 --> 05:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
already implemented
 
05:45:40.190 --> 05:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
the guidelines that have been drafted
 
05:45:43.350 --> 05:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
into policies they are already doing the
 
05:45:47.910 --> 05:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
work based on their own set of policies
 
05:45:51.868 --> 05:45:51.878 align:start position:0%
and when we had the new DCF guy come in
 
05:45:54.350 --> 05:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
the director come in uh he's he's he's
 
05:45:56.990 --> 05:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
from New Jersey and and apparently he
 
05:45:59.310 --> 05:45:59.320 align:start position:0%
wrote a very similar uh piece of
 
05:46:01.948 --> 05:46:01.958 align:start position:0%
legislation to this for New Jersey and I
 
05:46:04.390 --> 05:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
think that was a source of much of the
 
05:46:07.750 --> 05:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
initial set of guidelines it it came in
 
05:46:10.030 --> 05:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
heavy I mean even after all the great
 
05:46:12.628 --> 05:46:12.638 align:start position:0%
work that the representative just cited
 
05:46:15.548 --> 05:46:15.558 align:start position:0%
we still had 15 brand new
 
05:46:18.270 --> 05:46:18.280 align:start position:0%
FTE you know and when you ask the
 
05:46:20.070 --> 05:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
director what he thought about it he
 
05:46:23.110 --> 05:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
said this is a cool Bill and he said and
 
05:46:26.868 --> 05:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
oh by the way I'm coming back because we
 
05:46:30.868 --> 05:46:30.878 align:start position:0%
need to build more capacity in state so
 
05:46:35.190 --> 05:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
that we don't send people out so frankly
 
05:46:37.310 --> 05:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
we went about a process that was
 
05:46:40.548 --> 05:46:40.558 align:start position:0%
backwards instead of building the the
 
05:46:43.190 --> 05:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
the inspection outplacement end of this
 
05:46:44.788 --> 05:46:44.798 align:start position:0%
we should have been focusing on what's
 
05:46:47.030 --> 05:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
it going to take to build the instate
 
05:46:49.788 --> 05:46:49.798 align:start position:0%
capacity to reduce the demand this is
 
05:46:51.868 --> 05:46:51.878 align:start position:0%
sort of poor systems design what this
 
05:46:55.548 --> 05:46:55.558 align:start position:0%
bill represents and I I'm I'm I'm I'm
 
05:46:58.510 --> 05:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
convinced that uh with the Senate
 
05:47:02.110 --> 05:47:02.120 align:start position:0%
working on a companion bill that this is
 
05:47:04.150 --> 05:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
not the last that the house has seen of
 
05:47:07.270 --> 05:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
it this is this is our going back to
 
05:47:09.468 --> 05:47:09.478 align:start position:0%
being able to get back to the Senate to
 
05:47:11.788 --> 05:47:11.798 align:start position:0%
work continue working on this because
 
05:47:14.230 --> 05:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
this this this bill was not cooked when
 
05:47:15.948 --> 05:47:15.958 align:start position:0%
it came out of Children and Family Law
 
05:47:17.708 --> 05:47:17.718 align:start position:0%
they didn't even consider the financial
 
05:47:20.788 --> 05:47:20.798 align:start position:0%
impact they said that right I mean and
 
05:47:23.070 --> 05:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
they said you guys you smart people have
 
05:47:26.230 --> 05:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
to figure that out so so this this is an
 
05:47:29.868 --> 05:47:29.878 align:start position:0%
attempt to avoid
 
05:47:33.468 --> 05:47:33.478 align:start position:0%
building an empire that should be aged
 
05:47:36.030 --> 05:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
out rapidly because we're instead
 
05:47:38.670 --> 05:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
focusing on building capacity in New
 
05:47:41.030 --> 05:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you can only spend a
 
05:47:43.230 --> 05:47:43.240 align:start position:0%
dollar once you can't keep spending the
 
05:47:45.468 --> 05:47:45.478 align:start position:0%
same dollar over and over if we had
 
05:47:48.468 --> 05:47:48.478 align:start position:0%
unlimited resources this would be among
 
05:47:51.350 --> 05:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
the limited wants I would support but we
 
05:47:54.910 --> 05:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
don't have unlimited resources thank you
 
05:47:57.510 --> 05:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
further discussion on adoption of
 
05:47:57.520 --> 05:47:59.990 align:start position:0%
further discussion on adoption of
amendment

05:47:59.990 --> 05:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:48:03.110 --> 05:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
1309 representative McGuire thank you Mr
 
05:48:06.548 --> 05:48:06.558 align:start position:0%
chairman it seems to me that that giving
 
05:48:08.190 --> 05:48:08.200 align:start position:0%
the Department
 
05:48:11.830 --> 05:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
flexibility um would have a better
 
05:48:14.110 --> 05:48:14.120 align:start position:0%
outcome because they can then use their
 
05:48:17.548 --> 05:48:17.558 align:start position:0%
own judgment as to which
 
05:48:20.230 --> 05:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
facilities uh maybe they're new and
 
05:48:22.548 --> 05:48:22.558 align:start position:0%
therefore need a little extra attention
 
05:48:24.750 --> 05:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
which facilities have been run by the
 
05:48:27.270 --> 05:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
the same competent people for a very
 
05:48:29.510 --> 05:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
long time maybe they need a little less
 
05:48:32.310 --> 05:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
things like that but if we if we have if
 
05:48:34.910 --> 05:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
we micromanage exactly how they run
 
05:48:38.788 --> 05:48:38.798 align:start position:0%
their Department uh costs are inevitably
 
05:48:41.788 --> 05:48:41.798 align:start position:0%
going to be higher thank you further
 
05:48:43.150 --> 05:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
discussion on the
 
05:48:46.708 --> 05:48:46.718 align:start position:0%
amendment represent PRI thank you Mr
 
05:48:50.510 --> 05:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
chairman again I I uh refer back to the
 
05:48:54.030 --> 05:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
testimony and the statements made by my
 
05:48:54.040 --> 05:48:55.390 align:start position:0%
testimony and the statements made by my
fellow

05:48:55.390 --> 05:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
fellow
 
05:48:59.430 --> 05:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
Representatives um who who are citing
 
05:49:02.590 --> 05:49:02.600 align:start position:0%
that both the department and the child
 
05:49:04.910 --> 05:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
advocacy were
 
05:49:08.750 --> 05:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
wanting more guidance and
 
05:49:12.910 --> 05:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
structure to this problem and since this
 
05:49:15.830 --> 05:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
problem is so serious and we are dealing
 
05:49:19.030 --> 05:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
with the custody of children that are
 
05:49:19.040 --> 05:49:20.430 align:start position:0%
with the custody of children that are
our

05:49:20.430 --> 05:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:49:23.430 --> 05:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities we have to make sure
 
05:49:27.030 --> 05:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
that the structure is in place and the
 
05:49:29.948 --> 05:49:29.958 align:start position:0%
alternative that that uh representative
 
05:49:32.510 --> 05:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
walner was going to propose and is
 
05:49:37.030 --> 05:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
proposing should be considered before we
 
05:49:39.750 --> 05:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
we should uh move on this bill and so
 
05:49:42.190 --> 05:49:42.200 align:start position:0%
therefore I recommend that we oppose
 
05:49:44.670 --> 05:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
this amendment and consider another
 
05:49:48.150 --> 05:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
amendment which clearly addresses the
 
05:49:51.670 --> 05:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
concerns of both the department and the
 
05:49:54.190 --> 05:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
child advocacy thank
