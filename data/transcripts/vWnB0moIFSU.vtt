00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
board of veterinary medicine met
 
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 align:start position:0%

chairman I don't believe so okay I I
 
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
have one copy and I'm happy to give it
 
00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 align:start position:0%
to you but I'll read what they said and
 
00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 align:start position:0%
again I don't represent them I'm just
 
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
stating the facts
 
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
statement on House Bill 258 and again
 
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
this is from the board of veterinary
 
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 align:start position:0%
medicine the board opposes this bill as
 
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
written the practice of using human
 
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 align:start position:0%
modalities on animals needs to be
 
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
addressed as a whole and this bill is
 
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 align:start position:0%
not sufficient an animal can currently
 
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 align:start position:0%
receive Chiropractic Care from a
 
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 align:start position:0%
licensed veterinarian so trained
 
00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
should the committee still desire to
 
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 align:start position:0%
pursue this bill we propose the
 
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
committee adopt the amendment attached
 
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
the board would add referral language as
 
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 align:start position:0%
follows and here's what they recommend
 
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 align:start position:0%
amend 258
 
00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
by replacing the bill entirely with the
 
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
following New Hampshire veterinary
 
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
Practice Act license required and
 
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
exceptions amend RSA 332b colon 2 to add
 
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
the following after subsection X and
 
00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 align:start position:0%
this is the meat of it a chiropractor
 
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 align:start position:0%
licensed under RSA 316a that's our scope
 
00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
of practice
 
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
providing chiropractic care to animals
 
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 align:start position:0%
that's what the bills trying to do
 
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
provided the animal chiropractor Prior
 
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 align:start position:0%
to treating receives a referral from a
 
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
veterinarian licensed under RSA
 
00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
332-b again that's what the board of
 
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
veterinary medicine would like to see we
 
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 align:start position:0%
are fine with that language as a
 
00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic Association because what it
 
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 align:start position:0%
does is it we get a referral from
 
00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 align:start position:0%
somebody who's licensed and trained to
 
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
care for animals saying they need to
 
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
have chiropractic care and so that's in
 
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
any chiropractor can can then do that
 
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
all right thank you if you can leave
 
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
that up actually first if any does
 
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 align:start position:0%
so for clarification you're saying that
 
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
human chiropractors will not treat
 
00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 align:start position:0%
animals unless they have a referral from
 
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
a veterinarian that says that that's
 
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 align:start position:0%
what they would that's what my
 
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
Association would like to see yes okay
 
00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 align:start position:0%
and then the only other thing I'll
 
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
mention if if I may is there was some
 
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 align:start position:0%
talk about another uh Amendment
 
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
um again provided by oplc
 
00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 align:start position:0%
um same same section of the law statute
 
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
this is just a different wording an
 
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
individual certified to provide animal
 
00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic Services by a board
 
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
recognized National certification body
 
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
that's the other thing that we would be
 
00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
fine with the problem with that is the
 
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
veterinarians don't want to be uh
 
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 align:start position:0%
responsible for certifying whatever
 
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
National Organization is so I think
 
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
that's why they preferred their language
 
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 align:start position:0%
that I read to you probably okay any
 
00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.670 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
So when you say human chiropractor I
 
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
only have one I'll give I'll bring it
 
00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
closer you know I have when you say
 
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
human chiropractor I assume the animal
 
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
chiropractor and human chiropractors are
 
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
both human So when you say when you say
 
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
human chiropractor do you mean
 
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
I think she means people people who are
 
00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 align:start position:0%
licensed one that works on people or one
 
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 align:start position:0%
or an animal chiropractor who is a human
 
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
come on
 
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
no I'm not trying to be funny I was I
 
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
yeah all right yeah so
 
00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 align:start position:0%
I mean clearly clearly
 
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
this is animal chiropractors people who
 
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
are like sorry people who are licensed
 
00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
to practice Chiropractic and human
 
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.170 align:start position:0%
to practice Chiropractic and human
humans

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
humans
 
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
um and presumably they have some other
 
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
training to practice on animals as well
 
00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
maybe certification but uh
 
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
apparently the veterinary board would
 
00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 align:start position:0%
like a situation where if anybody is
 
00:05:58.249 --> 00:05:58.259 align:start position:0%
going to do Chiropractic on animals
 
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
they'd want to referral from a vet I
 
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
think that's that's the position so
 
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.950 align:start position:0%
think that's that's the position so
um

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
and you know I assume that's the correct
 
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
but if not correct me right the only
 
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 align:start position:0%
thing I would just maybe correct a
 
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
little bit is there is I mean there is
 
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
chiropractors out there that do get
 
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
training for for treating animals but
 
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 align:start position:0%
that's few and far between
 
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
um so that's why the majority of
 
00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:25.139 align:start position:0%
chiropractors and that's from both
 
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
organizations uh would support this
 
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 align:start position:0%
because they don't mind letting
 
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
chiropractors Care for Animals they just
 
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
want a veterinarian to refer them or to
 
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
have some sort of national certification
 
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 align:start position:0%
prior to being able to treat because
 
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220 align:start position:0%
they have no training most chiropractors
 
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 align:start position:0%
have no training to care for animals so
 
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
if somebody just brings an animal in and
 
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
this chiropractor
 
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
treats it and does something wrong with
 
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
no certification or no referral from a
 
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
vet that's going to be a black mark on
 
00:06:58.129 --> 00:06:58.139 align:start position:0%
the industry represent goalie Schmidt
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so what I'm hearing
 
00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
is we want both the referral and some
 
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
sort of certification in animal
 
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic because that would be ideal
 
00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
two totally different
 
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
and and and and and again I can provide
 
00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:13.139 align:start position:0%
this language both both amendments where
 
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:14.340 align:start position:0%
you would be where you would put that
 
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
which again is under the Veterinarian
 
00:07:19.089 --> 00:07:19.099 align:start position:0%
Practice Act thank you
 
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt thank you Mr
 
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
chairman well uh there are two questions
 
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
that immediately arise
 
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:31.340 align:start position:0%
uh what is the referring
 
00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
referring vet going to charge if
 
00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:35.290 align:start position:0%
referring vet going to charge if
anything

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:35.300 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
uh for this referral and secondly if
 
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:42.060 align:start position:0%
it's as we've been told very difficult
 
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
to get a an appointment to see a vet now
 
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:49.860 align:start position:0%
we're talking about an animal that is
 
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
suffering uh and and there is a there is
 
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
relief available on in the on the per in
 
00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
the person or the on the part of a
 
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
trained certified animal chiropractor uh
 
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
and that person uh is is going to be
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
hanging out there unable to act until
 
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:14.340 align:start position:0%
they get this referral
 
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
how many how many days or weeks is the
 
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
animal supposed to suffer while that
 
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:22.620 align:start position:0%
referral process goes through and what
 
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
is the cost going to be I don't see that
 
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
that's really not either workable at all
 
00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.830 align:start position:0%
that's really not either workable at all
or

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:34.140 align:start position:0%
not bound up in a lot of delays and and
 
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
in the meantime it could go
 
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
you go to the animal chiropractor as
 
00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:42.419 align:start position:0%
soon as he or she's available you get
 
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
the service and this
 
00:08:47.329 --> 00:08:47.339 align:start position:0%
so so if I may the workability is very
 
00:08:48.889 --> 00:08:48.899 align:start position:0%
much in doubt in my mind if I may
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
address that and just to be clear again
 
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:52.740 align:start position:0%
I I do not speak for the veterinarians
 
00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
so I can't answer what it would cost to
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
get a referral or the time frame
 
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
into representative goalie's point a
 
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.150 align:start position:0%
into representative goalie's point a
question

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
if you don't want the referral
 
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
from the veterinarian you think that's
 
00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
too unworkable then then language that
 
00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:12.180 align:start position:0%
would still be under the Veterinarian
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
Practice Act that states an individual
 
00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:17.399 align:start position:0%
certified to provide animal Chiropractic
 
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
Services by a board recognized National
 
00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:21.779 align:start position:0%
certification body then we're fine again
 
00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:24.959 align:start position:0%
you don't want somebody to just bring an
 
00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:26.820 align:start position:0%
animal into a chiropractor who's not had
 
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
any training or certification treating a
 
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
chiropractor that's not what we want
 
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
okay just I'll get your mom I just have
 
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
a quick question that is
 
00:09:38.329 --> 00:09:38.339 align:start position:0%
um so if we just said any nationally
 
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:40.740 align:start position:0%
certified or nationally recognized
 
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
certification body for animal
 
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic they don't want to get in
 
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
the business of picking one or
 
00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
overseeing it or anything but if we said
 
00:09:50.449 --> 00:09:50.459 align:start position:0%
anyone or we specified one then that
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
would be that that board and the
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic people would be okay with
 
00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:56.339 align:start position:0%
that again I can't speak for the
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
veterinarian board but we would be okay
 
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
with that again under making sure that
 
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
it's under the Veterinarian Practice Act
 
00:10:05.329 --> 00:10:05.339 align:start position:0%
which is RSA 332b representative goalie
 
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair my only concern
 
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
without having a referral is we're now
 
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.730 align:start position:0%
without having a referral is we're now
having

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:10.740 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:10:13.009 --> 00:10:13.019 align:start position:0%
individual pet owners trying to diagnose
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
the problem with their animal and the
 
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
chiropractic care may not be what's best
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
for that animal at the time and that's
 
00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:20.519 align:start position:0%
the concern I have with no referral or
 
00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:23.339 align:start position:0%
no looking at the animal before sending
 
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic Care thank you I understand
 
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
that and uh
 
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.509 align:start position:0%
that and uh
but

00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
what I would say is I mean people end up
 
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
in effect diagnosing the animals before
 
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
they decide to take them anywhere and if
 
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
the I would think if the person
 
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
practicing animal Chiropractic was
 
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
certified they could should be able to
 
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:43.380 align:start position:0%
recognize that they're not able to help
 
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
this animal
 
00:10:47.569 --> 00:10:47.579 align:start position:0%
that's you know if I may Mr chair that's
 
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
that's a good point I mean if your dog's
 
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
limping and you think it's you know pull
 
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
the muscle or something and you bring it
 
00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:54.839 align:start position:0%
in and it's actually a tumor because
 
00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
it's cancer you know the chiropractor is
 
00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to figure that out
 
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh unless they've had the proper
 
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
training and certification that opens up
 
00:11:05.449 --> 00:11:05.459 align:start position:0%
a big amount of liability okay
 
00:11:05.459 --> 00:11:06.170 align:start position:0%
a big amount of liability okay
um

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:07.980 align:start position:0%
I saw you but is there anyone else here
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.069 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:21.060 align:start position:0%
I was just gonna if you will I'll leave
 
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
this with you yeah I think I have one of
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
them but I'm not sure I have the other
 
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.110 align:start position:0%
them but I'm not sure I have the other
one

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
good morning uh and thank you for
 
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.090 align:start position:0%
good morning uh and thank you for
hearing

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
um my testimony I am here on behalf of
 
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
the board of veterinary medicine my name
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
is Elizabeth Eaton I am board Council
 
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
and I work for oplc
 
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
we had a meeting on Wednesday during
 
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:55.940 align:start position:0%
which the the veterinarian board
 
00:11:59.690 --> 00:11:59.700 align:start position:0%
discussed this at length so I can speak
 
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
a little bit I did share with Simon and
 
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
so I think he uh spoke a little bit on
 
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
what the the veterinarian board
 
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
provided for written testimony but I can
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
answer some questions based on their
 
00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:14.579 align:start position:0%
discussion as well
 
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
Reverend Schmidt or well were you here
 
00:12:25.009 --> 00:12:25.019 align:start position:0%
for my questions uh I was here let's
 
00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:26.220 align:start position:0%
hear some of your questions towards the
 
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
end you're
 
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.569 align:start position:0%
end you're
referral

00:12:29.569 --> 00:12:29.579 align:start position:0%
referral
 
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
correct well I'm troubled by by the
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
potential unlikely delay that would be
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
involved we heard in when the bill was
 
00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
first heard that it's very difficult to
 
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
get an appointment with a Veterinary
 
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
that's what we heard okay so secondly
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
even if it's even if you can get one
 
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
it's likely going to be a delay involved
 
00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:57.959 align:start position:0%
and and this is going to be the Cairo
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
the veterinarian presumably is going to
 
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
examine the uh the animal and then make
 
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
the referral if this is something which
 
00:13:05.399 --> 00:13:06.310 align:start position:0%
the referral if this is something which
is

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:09.180 align:start position:0%
something which we would require or
 
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
benefit from this animal chiropractor
 
00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.250 align:start position:0%
benefit from this animal chiropractor
right

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:13:15.949 --> 00:13:15.959 align:start position:0%
but the delay aspect for an animal is
 
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
suffering it was it troubles me as much
 
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
as for a human being that's suffering
 
00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
that's sitting in the waiting room or
 
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
can't get the appointment
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
suffering is not a good idea we want to
 
00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
alleviate that eliminate that we can so
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
the delay aspect is troubling uh and and
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
the question is uh what is the the what
 
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:38.700 align:start position:0%
is the cost going to be for the
 
00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:41.700 align:start position:0%
veterinarian to uh to observe something
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
and it could could well be now that you
 
00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:48.180 align:start position:0%
have somebody who knows what the
 
00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
situation is because it has occurred in
 
00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
the past they know that they need the
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
animal chiropractor right so the
 
00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
referral is probably not really
 
00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:02.700 align:start position:0%
necessary at least hypothetically and so
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
forth so the workability aspect of the
 
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
proposal of getting from here to
 
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
Manchester by way of Los Angeles uh is
 
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
is of serious concern and and and I
 
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
think there are several of us on the
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
committee I'm not on the subcommittee
 
00:14:21.889 --> 00:14:21.899 align:start position:0%
but we're allowed to participate
 
00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:23.339 align:start position:0%
nevertheless as a member of the
 
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
committee uh that really want to see
 
00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839 align:start position:0%
this animal Chiropractic be available
 
00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
expeditiously and without additional
 
00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
unreasonable cost so and I would like to
 
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
hear from my colleagues
 
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
as well first but first I completely
 
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
agree with you I have the same concerns
 
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.449 align:start position:0%
agree with you I have the same concerns
um

00:14:44.449 --> 00:14:44.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
and at least offhand maybe somebody has
 
00:14:49.129 --> 00:14:49.139 align:start position:0%
another data I see um
 
00:14:52.129 --> 00:14:52.139 align:start position:0%
two solutions I'm not sure who they
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
would make happy or unhappy but um one
 
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
is to put something in the the
 
00:14:58.970 --> 00:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
veterinary act saying basically that the
 
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
veterinary board
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
does not uh regulate in any way uh
 
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
people in the practice of animal
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic period
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
and then it's going to be a matter of
 
00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
you know if people want to check if
 
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:13.740 align:start position:0%
someone who's practicing animal
 
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic is nationally certified
 
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
they can do that or have a referral for
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
someone else who's had good experience
 
00:15:21.769 --> 00:15:21.779 align:start position:0%
with their animal and if they're not
 
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
happy they can not go back and if
 
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
they're really not happy and think their
 
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:27.660 align:start position:0%
animal got harmed they can sue them like
 
00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:15:31.129 --> 00:15:31.139 align:start position:0%
similarly if you're you know you get
 
00:15:32.569 --> 00:15:32.579 align:start position:0%
your car repaired in a car shop and you
 
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
think they did a terrible job
 
00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
it's really no difference and I think
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
the risk in the animal side if anything
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
is less because not going to cause a car
 
00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:42.839 align:start position:0%
accident it's going to kill people
 
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:45.180 align:start position:0%
so that's one option I see the other
 
00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:46.389 align:start position:0%
so that's one option I see the other
option

00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
option
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
would be to um
 
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.710 align:start position:0%
would be to um
require

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
some form of the nationally recognized
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
certification and I I do not want to get
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
into a whole occupational licensing for
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
animal chiropractors I just don't want
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
to go there see what other people think
 
00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:05.930 align:start position:0%
to go there see what other people think
um

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:05.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:08.519 align:start position:0%
so either we could just say you know and
 
00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you because you're the only
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
person I think here from oplc you might
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
have some input
 
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
um either say any nationally recognized
 
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
um the outfit that certifies people who
 
00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:23.459 align:start position:0%
do animal Chiropractic and maybe some
 
00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
language or leave it up to oplc you know
 
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:27.660 align:start position:0%
the administrative side not the board
 
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:29.220 align:start position:0%
because the vet board doesn't want to do
 
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
this to to name ones I know there are
 
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:34.860 align:start position:0%
some okay
 
00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:35.509 align:start position:0%
some okay
um

00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
or name them in statute but that's
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
generally a bad idea because then the
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
names change and more come up and all
 
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
that so what's your take on that yeah
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I agree with you on on not
 
00:16:45.889 --> 00:16:45.899 align:start position:0%
putting into the statute whether there's
 
00:16:47.449 --> 00:16:47.459 align:start position:0%
any kind of certifications but to back
 
00:16:47.459 --> 00:16:48.290 align:start position:0%
any kind of certifications but to back
up

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:50.759 align:start position:0%
um to your to your first
 
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:56.569 --> 00:16:56.579 align:start position:0%
um to to back up to your first proposal
 
00:16:58.610 --> 00:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
that would be the the vet board's ideal
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
situation to just have
 
00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
um nothing to do with animal
 
00:17:04.429 --> 00:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic in their practice act
 
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
whatsoever however
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
um just to back up even further
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
um currently in the The Practice Act for
 
00:17:14.809 --> 00:17:14.819 align:start position:0%
the board of veterinary medicine there's
 
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
a statute that deals with animal
 
00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
Physical Therapy already so
 
00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:23.579 align:start position:0%
um using human modalities on animals is
 
00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
becoming more and more common first
 
00:17:27.289 --> 00:17:27.299 align:start position:0%
Physical Therapy appears in The Practice
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
Act and now animal Chiropractic is is
 
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:31.799 align:start position:0%
proposed appear in the in the Practice
 
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
Act uh the the board of veterinary
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
medicine made it clear that these
 
00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
modalities are are already being used by
 
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
licensed veterinarians
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
a referral may not be necessary if the
 
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
the veterinarian themselves already does
 
00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
animal chiropractic care or animal
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
Physical Therapy the board would like to
 
00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
address these human modalities as a
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
whole rather than piecemeal Physical
 
00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
Therapy here Chiropractic Care here and
 
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
um perhaps there could be a more General
 
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
statutory amendment that would allow
 
00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
rulemaking to address these human
 
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
modalities used with animals the board
 
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
is concerned about just exempting animal
 
00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:20.700 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic Care from the the
 
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
definition of veterinary medicine
 
00:18:24.409 --> 00:18:24.419 align:start position:0%
without some sort of referral and in the
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
physical therapy statute
 
00:18:30.289 --> 00:18:30.299 align:start position:0%
the the animal has to have a referral to
 
00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
get animal physical therapy and there's
 
00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:34.860 align:start position:0%
a whole process by which that referral
 
00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:37.799 align:start position:0%
is made it can be uh called in on the
 
00:18:37.799 --> 00:18:38.630 align:start position:0%
is made it can be uh called in on the
phone

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
phone
 
00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
very quickly and Then followed up with a
 
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
written referral uh so it it I do
 
00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:45.900 align:start position:0%
understand the time constraint and and
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
watching an animal suffer or anyone
 
00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
suffer is not anything that the
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
veterinarian board wants they do just
 
00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:55.980 align:start position:0%
want a high standard of care
 
00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
for these animals wherever they're being
 
00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.250 align:start position:0%
for these animals wherever they're being
seen

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:00.260 align:start position:0%
seen
 
00:19:03.169 --> 00:19:03.179 align:start position:0%
representative goalie oh sorry I don't
 
00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
know who went well representative a bear
 
00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:16.020 align:start position:0%
in today's current law with oplc in who
 
00:19:20.289 --> 00:19:20.299 align:start position:0%
you license you license doctors yes
 
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
correct you license chiropractors yes
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
and today if I want to go to
 
00:19:33.529 --> 00:19:33.539 align:start position:0%
a chiropractor as a human being I do not
 
00:19:36.409 --> 00:19:36.419 align:start position:0%
need a referral is that correct
 
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
I I can't speak to each individual
 
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
chiropractor and some insurance
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
companies do require referrals from
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
Physicians so it depends I can answer
 
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
that question for you if you don't mind
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
certainly so I am a patient for
 
00:19:53.039 --> 00:19:54.230 align:start position:0%
certainly so I am a patient for
the

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
um for a chiropractor in Salem and I
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
can't remember the name of it right now
 
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
it's a chain
 
00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
um but I can go in there without a
 
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
doctor's referral and I can be treated
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
I don't see where there's any alignment
 
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
if humans are in the hierarchy of
 
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
um humans and animals right
 
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.490 align:start position:0%
um humans and animals right
um

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:25.980 align:start position:0%
I don't see a problem with not having a
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
referral for an animal as these
 
00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
chiropractors are all certified
 
00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:35.690 align:start position:0%
chiropractors are all certified
they

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
when you go into a chiropractor they
 
00:20:42.169 --> 00:20:42.179 align:start position:0%
will not treat you if they think you
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
have a potential corroded artery right
 
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%
they want to send you for a
 
00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:53.940 align:start position:0%
ultrasound or whatever they may so I
 
00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.490 align:start position:0%
ultrasound or whatever they may so I
I

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
am just trying to say that we should
 
00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
align the law with exactly where we are
 
00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:02.700 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire now without a referral
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
I don't disagree with you except that
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
the the chiropractors are licensed and
 
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
under the jurisdiction of the board of
 
00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
chiropractic care and animals
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
fall under the board of veterinary
 
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:20.660 align:start position:0%
medicine for most
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
situations there there are some that are
 
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.210 align:start position:0%
situations there there are some that are
exempt

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:25.220 align:start position:0%
exempt
 
00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
specifically horse massage equine
 
00:21:33.289 --> 00:21:33.299 align:start position:0%
um other equine modalities
 
00:21:35.149 --> 00:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
there's a very few things that are
 
00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
exempt from the the practice of
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
veterinary medicine but the the rest is
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
under their jurisdiction and so if any
 
00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:43.810 align:start position:0%
under their jurisdiction and so if any
um

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:43.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:46.919 align:start position:0%
an animal suffers at the hand of a vet
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
veterinarian their owner or someone else
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
can file a complaint with the board of
 
00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
veterinary medicine and and they may
 
00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:55.669 align:start position:0%
veterinary medicine and and they may
um

00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:59.450 --> 00:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
follow up with that licensing board
 
00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
for accountability the chiropractors
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
additionally can have are accountable to
 
00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
the board of chiropractic medicine
 
00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:10.980 align:start position:0%
in an animal chiropractor would
 
00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.070 align:start position:0%
in an animal chiropractor would
would be

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
you know under this statute as uh
 
00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:19.340 align:start position:0%
as introduced
 
00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:22.520 align:start position:0%
would fall under neither
 
00:22:24.649 --> 00:22:24.659 align:start position:0%
or if there were
 
00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
an exemption it would fall under
 
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
licensed chiropractors so it's it's
 
00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:31.860 align:start position:0%
really unclear who would be holding
 
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:38.820 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and
 
00:22:42.169 --> 00:22:42.179 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure I heard
 
00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:43.860 align:start position:0%
correctly so for physical therapy and
 
00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:46.919 align:start position:0%
modalities they need referrals correct
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
and Chiropractic Care would be similar
 
00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.930 align:start position:0%
and Chiropractic Care would be similar
to

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:50.940 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
physical therapy and working on
 
00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:55.500 align:start position:0%
modalities and that nature
 
00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
are similar I've been chiropractic care
 
00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
and physical therapies are are similar
 
00:23:03.289 --> 00:23:03.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt let's just thank
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so
 
00:23:08.159 --> 00:23:10.909 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so
um

00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:13.549 --> 00:23:13.559 align:start position:0%
the thing is that it strikes me that if
 
00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:16.220 align:start position:0%
we can figure out some kind of a a
 
00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
modality whereby the
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
the veterinary
 
00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:24.179 align:start position:0%
field in the practice of veterinary
 
00:23:24.179 --> 00:23:25.090 align:start position:0%
field in the practice of veterinary
medicine

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:25.100 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
perhaps could be involved for an initial
 
00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.529 align:start position:0%
perhaps could be involved for an initial
referral

00:23:29.529 --> 00:23:29.539 align:start position:0%
referral
 
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
and then subsequently
 
00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
they would they would never have to go
 
00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
back to the chiropra to the vet again
 
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:40.280 align:start position:0%
for an additional referral
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
uh then and that would solve some of the
 
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
problem because one of the things that
 
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
we've heard is that in the past
 
00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:51.980 align:start position:0%
and not recent past as I understand it
 
00:23:54.649 --> 00:23:54.659 align:start position:0%
the some of these animal chiropractors
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
were getting cease and desist letters
 
00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
from vets or veterinarian like the board
 
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:04.980 align:start position:0%
boards whatever
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
um and they that they were the animal
 
00:24:09.289 --> 00:24:09.299 align:start position:0%
chiropractors were getting intimidated
 
00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
because they were getting threatened by
 
00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:12.860 align:start position:0%
it all
 
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:15.780 align:start position:0%
uh and so that's not a good situation
 
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
but but what I've heard is it's not
 
00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
happening currently there haven't been
 
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
any of these decent resist orders
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
recently so
 
00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
is this a is this really a problem that
 
00:24:30.529 --> 00:24:30.539 align:start position:0%
needs to be fixed
 
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
that we that should lurk in the back of
 
00:24:36.169 --> 00:24:36.179 align:start position:0%
our minds as a as a fact that we we want
 
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
to consider I think what we did here was
 
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
that um there are people doing animal
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic who are
 
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
concerned about their status they aren't
 
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
expanding their business they're not
 
00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.169 align:start position:0%
expanding their business they're not
advertising

00:24:48.169 --> 00:24:48.179 align:start position:0%
advertising
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
um because there is a history of of that
 
00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
and they're concerned um
 
00:24:59.570 --> 00:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
so let me ask you again if we decided to
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
not have
 
00:25:01.679 --> 00:25:02.450 align:start position:0%
not have
um

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
animal Chiropractic under the vet board
 
00:25:07.789 --> 00:25:07.799 align:start position:0%
and not do licensing for it but
 
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
require that if somebody's going to
 
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
practice it they uh have some nationally
 
00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:15.140 align:start position:0%
recognized certification
 
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
is there a place where that could fit in
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
in the oplc statute and with oplc you
 
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:22.490 align:start position:0%
in the oplc statute and with oplc you
know

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:25:24.409 --> 00:25:24.419 align:start position:0%
be okay just
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
you know picking ones that seem to be
 
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
functional or competent
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
I I can't speak to oplc as an agency in
 
00:25:36.529 --> 00:25:36.539 align:start position:0%
general I'm I'm only here on behalf of
 
00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
the board of veterinary medicine and not
 
00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:41.220 align:start position:0%
oplc as an agency
 
00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:44.700 align:start position:0%
um if you're if you're
 
00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:48.020 align:start position:0%
I I don't see putting it anywhere
 
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
besides either the veterinary Practice
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
Act or the chiropractor Practice Act I
 
00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
don't see it having a place in the oplc
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
Statute in general
 
00:25:59.039 --> 00:26:00.230 align:start position:0%
Statute in general
um

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
at this point but I can't speak for the
 
00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
agency okay thank you
 
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
um any other discussion
 
00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
yep representative crota
 
00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
so it looks like
 
00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:16.740 align:start position:0%
your situation we have two boards that
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
really don't want to
 
00:26:21.529 --> 00:26:21.539 align:start position:0%
take on the responsibility as requested
 
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
in the legislature
 
00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:25.380 align:start position:0%
and this
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
sort of puts us in a quandary
 
00:26:28.559 --> 00:26:31.130 align:start position:0%
sort of puts us in a quandary
so

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:31.140 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
I do feel that your question about
 
00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.769 align:start position:0%
I do feel that your question about
certification

00:26:36.769 --> 00:26:36.779 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
is a legitimate one and my
 
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
recommendation is that we wait for oplc
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
to respond to that
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
because this is not an early I mean you
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
know we've got to actually I you know
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
that makes a lot of sense
 
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah I could see I know
 
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.789 align:start position:0%
um yeah I could see I know
representative

00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
trouble hearing um
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
so what I can do what I'll do if people
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
are okay with it is I will uh contact
 
00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
Lindsay Courtney
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
raise the issue and uh see if
 
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
you know that's something that they
 
00:27:09.769 --> 00:27:09.779 align:start position:0%
could do to to pick a board
 
00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:11.940 align:start position:0%
um or you know certification outfit one
 
00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
or more of them and then get her a
 
00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
suggestion if they will do that on on
 
00:27:18.289 --> 00:27:18.299 align:start position:0%
where to put the language and what the
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
language would be
 
00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:21.900 align:start position:0%
represent goalie thank you Mr chair and
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
I'd also like to see copies of the
 
00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:25.860 align:start position:0%
suggested language that we had before
 
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
from Simon
 
00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:31.460 align:start position:0%
if you have those in electronic form
 
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
uh you could just send it to the whole
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
committee actually probably work
 
00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
well I guess uh Diane wants to speak as
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
well that's fine once again Simon
 
00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:49.860 align:start position:0%
Thompson with the New Hampshire State
 
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic Society just want to
 
00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
reference what representative a bear
 
00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
said and that's not a that's not an
 
00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
Apples to Apples comparison when you say
 
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
a human can go to a chiropractor without
 
00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:01.860 align:start position:0%
a referral from a doctor that is correct
 
00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
that is true
 
00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:05.820 align:start position:0%
chiropractors go to school to learn how
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
to treat humans that's the only training
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
they get
 
00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
so if you now say that a chiropractor
 
00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
with zero training can see animals
 
00:28:18.769 --> 00:28:18.779 align:start position:0%
without a referral that is not what the
 
00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
industry wants and the industry would be
 
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
totally against that I understand that
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
great and representative uh thank you
 
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
and and then and then just I'll
 
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
reiterate I think you've heard it but I
 
00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:29.940 align:start position:0%
got to read it we do not want the
 
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:31.980 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic scope of care opened up and
 
00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:33.900 align:start position:0%
put anything it's not looking to do that
 
00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr I'm not all right
 
00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:40.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:48.769 --> 00:28:48.779 align:start position:0%
I apologize this is a passionate subject
 
00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:49.740 align:start position:0%
of mine
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to address a couple of
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
points um can you bring that closer yeah
 
00:28:56.289 --> 00:28:56.299 align:start position:0%
Pull It Forward and yeah I have this
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
mortifying fear of microphones
 
00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:02.700 align:start position:0%
um so yes indeed human chiropractors are
 
00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:03.890 align:start position:0%
um so yes indeed human chiropractors are
considered

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:03.900 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:04.549 align:start position:0%
considered
um

00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:06.649 --> 00:29:06.659 align:start position:0%
human chiropractors are considered
 
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:08.700 align:start position:0%
primary care doctors and therefore don't
 
00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:11.340 align:start position:0%
you don't need a referral but one of the
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
things that just strikes me is so absurd
 
00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:15.900 align:start position:0%
while there are so many is that one can
 
00:29:18.049 --> 00:29:18.059 align:start position:0%
take one's five-year-old child to a
 
00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:20.220 align:start position:0%
chiropractor you can take a two-year-old
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
child to a chiropractor without
 
00:29:24.409 --> 00:29:24.419 align:start position:0%
pediatric referral and the two-year-old
 
00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:26.700 align:start position:0%
isn't communicating any better than my
 
00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:29.580 align:start position:0%
dog possibly less well my dog
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
communicates really well
 
00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.389 align:start position:0%
communicates really well
um

00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:32.399 --> 00:29:33.190 align:start position:0%
um
um

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
so so that's one issue just to address
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
that first I mean
 
00:29:39.889 --> 00:29:39.899 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:29:42.649 --> 00:29:42.659 align:start position:0%
you know other people who testified said
 
00:29:45.049 --> 00:29:45.059 align:start position:0%
the difference is and and actually I'm
 
00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:46.860 align:start position:0%
on board with you as far as medium
 
00:29:48.769 --> 00:29:48.779 align:start position:0%
referrals or even any kind of Licensing
 
00:29:48.779 --> 00:29:50.570 align:start position:0%
referrals or even any kind of Licensing
but

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:29:53.149 --> 00:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
um the difference is that the
 
00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic person who practices on
 
00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:56.990 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic person who practices on
humans

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
humans
 
00:29:59.930 --> 00:29:59.940 align:start position:0%
has had training as under opl Cena's
 
00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
license and all of that whereas uh
 
00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
currently the people that are doing
 
00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic on animals are not and so
 
00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
that I think they're and let me know if
 
00:30:12.409 --> 00:30:12.419 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking you know wrong for you but
 
00:30:15.409 --> 00:30:15.419 align:start position:0%
uh I think their view is that
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
um you don't need the referral for the
 
00:30:19.549 --> 00:30:19.559 align:start position:0%
human because the person they're going
 
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
to is licensed and has to be trained in
 
00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:23.220 align:start position:0%
all of that or is the one for the animal
 
00:30:26.029 --> 00:30:26.039 align:start position:0%
may not be right and so I'm perfectly on
 
00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:28.740 align:start position:0%
board with the idea not crazy about it
 
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
because I prefer your method but I am on
 
00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
board with the idea of requiring
 
00:30:35.149 --> 00:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
chiropractors to who treat animals to
 
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
have some sort of training or
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
certification in animal treatment I
 
00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
personally I've seen many animal
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
chiropractors I mean I had my dog has
 
00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
and I have never dealt with one who is
 
00:30:48.409 --> 00:30:48.419 align:start position:0%
not either certified in animal
 
00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:50.820 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic or
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
um was a veterinarian who also had
 
00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
animal chiropractic training so I can't
 
00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
speak to the the idea that there are
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
people out there homeless people who
 
00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
wander into a shop and rent a place and
 
00:31:03.889 --> 00:31:03.899 align:start position:0%
say let me treat animals so I'm on board
 
00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:08.220 align:start position:0%
with the idea of of treatment but I I
 
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
bristled a little bit at the idea of
 
00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:12.740 align:start position:0%
choosing one because I think there are
 
00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:16.860 align:start position:0%
several good board-certified animal
 
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
chiropractic training things so that's
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
one it was mentioned that let me get on
 
00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
that one if I can deal with them you
 
00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:25.500 align:start position:0%
know individually and again if anybody
 
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
else wants to speak that let me know I
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
think the deal there is we we don't want
 
00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:31.980 align:start position:0%
to be doing that and what I'm looking to
 
00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
do and I'll ask executive director
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
Courtney if it would work would be to
 
00:31:42.169 --> 00:31:42.179 align:start position:0%
leave it to oplc to list come up with a
 
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:43.740 align:start position:0%
list of acceptable
 
00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
um certification organizations I mean
 
00:31:48.409 --> 00:31:48.419 align:start position:0%
assuming there are more than one which I
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
guess there are
 
00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
um it was mentioned that veterinarians
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
can do some of these modalities well
 
00:31:56.269 --> 00:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
currently veterinarians or
 
00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
other chiropractors I believe can do a I
 
00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
think it's four to five hour training
 
00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
program and call themselves
 
00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:04.980 align:start position:0%
chiropractors and I I've seen the
 
00:32:06.769 --> 00:32:06.779 align:start position:0%
difference it's not the same the
 
00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:08.700 align:start position:0%
training they get is not the same thing
 
00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
that quick training is not the same
 
00:32:12.409 --> 00:32:12.419 align:start position:0%
thing as a qualified chiropractor so
 
00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:13.740 align:start position:0%
that's that
 
00:32:15.529 --> 00:32:15.539 align:start position:0%
um and then another thing that just
 
00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
drives me nuts in the world of animals
 
00:32:18.769 --> 00:32:18.779 align:start position:0%
is that currently
 
00:32:24.049 --> 00:32:24.059 align:start position:0%
you can take a dog who's limping and
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
ignore them until it's so bad you have
 
00:32:27.649 --> 00:32:27.659 align:start position:0%
to have them put to sleep or something
 
00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:29.940 align:start position:0%
you don't with a five-year-old in
 
00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:31.860 align:start position:0%
kindergarten if the child's in pain and
 
00:32:33.289 --> 00:32:33.299 align:start position:0%
they go to a public school someone's
 
00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
going to see it and parents will be
 
00:32:36.409 --> 00:32:36.419 align:start position:0%
required to treat it or whatever but I'm
 
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
Blown Away Tony knows I happen to be
 
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
vegan and and really into animals and I
 
00:32:44.029 --> 00:32:44.039 align:start position:0%
but the point is and and I wish everyone
 
00:32:45.889 --> 00:32:45.899 align:start position:0%
on the planet were like me and if I
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
could be king everyone would be but
 
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:50.220 align:start position:0%
since they're not Tony's like thank God
 
00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.250 align:start position:0%
since they're not Tony's like thank God
but

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919 align:start position:0%
um but the fact is animals are not
 
00:32:58.490 --> 00:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
we don't regulate Animal Care the same
 
00:33:00.409 --> 00:33:00.419 align:start position:0%
way if I have a dog who's limping I'm
 
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
free to just choose to ignore it until
 
00:33:05.389 --> 00:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
at some point there may be animal
 
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
cruelty laws I don't know the details on
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement on that very true but right
 
00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
now currently I guarantee you there are
 
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
people in rural areas of New Hampshire
 
00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
whose dogs are limping and they can't
 
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
afford a vet so they take them out and
 
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:20.820 align:start position:0%
shoot them to remove their pain and we
 
00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:23.640 align:start position:0%
don't have sheriffs and animal cruelty
 
00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:25.980 align:start position:0%
people and whatever showing up like oh
 
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
my gosh someone just did it animals most
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
people don't even care about them and
 
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
here we are talking about people who
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
genuinely want to get kids this is
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
speculative it is it is a testimony I'm
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
sorry that's fine no no uh yeah this
 
00:33:44.509 --> 00:33:44.519 align:start position:0%
really isn't to the bill and actually I
 
00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
think you know we all agree that we'd
 
00:33:48.409 --> 00:33:48.419 align:start position:0%
like to see animals be taken care of and
 
00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
give good care and that's what we're
 
00:33:51.409 --> 00:33:51.419 align:start position:0%
working on so if you have any other
 
00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:53.220 align:start position:0%
comments that are specific to either the
 
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
bill or what we've talked about
 
00:33:57.889 --> 00:33:57.899 align:start position:0%
specifically doing I guess just the
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
point is that
 
00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:02.460 align:start position:0%
under this bill it seems like what
 
00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:04.140 align:start position:0%
mostly what we're dealing with is people
 
00:34:06.049 --> 00:34:06.059 align:start position:0%
who care enough about their animals to
 
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
want to get care that as we heard in
 
00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
testimony they want to get care quickly
 
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
and as inexpensively as possibly and I
 
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
agree that animal chiropractors can and
 
00:34:19.369 --> 00:34:19.379 align:start position:0%
probably should be certified in some way
 
00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:21.899 align:start position:0%
to recognize pain but you can go to a
 
00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
vet without referral and have the same
 
00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:27.300 align:start position:0%
thing they sometimes misdiagnose and
 
00:34:29.089 --> 00:34:29.099 align:start position:0%
treat an animal we're not we're not
 
00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:30.599 align:start position:0%
dealing with vets
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
um and in fact my hope that we're not
 
00:34:34.849 --> 00:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
dealing with that anyway so thank you
 
00:34:37.849 --> 00:34:37.859 align:start position:0%
very much and uh there's nothing else
 
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
I'd like to give something else or
 
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
you've already indicated an intended
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
course of action with regard to this and
 
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:48.780 align:start position:0%
I I'm completely copacetic with that
 
00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
sorry I'll do that when I hear back I'll
 
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:53.220 align:start position:0%
let people know and uh I mean if we
 
00:34:54.589 --> 00:34:54.599 align:start position:0%
actually come up with an amendment then
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
we can have another subcommittee meeting
 
00:34:59.870 --> 00:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
discuss it and vote on that
 
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
all right if there's nothing else I'll
 
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
close the uh subcommittee work session
 
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 258 and I'd like to open
 
00:35:12.589 --> 00:35:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh
 
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
yeah right I mean representative growth
 
00:35:19.069 --> 00:35:19.079 align:start position:0%
I was trying to think about just where I
 
00:35:19.079 --> 00:35:24.710 align:start position:0%
I was trying to think about just where I
was

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:25.609 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:35:25.609 --> 00:35:25.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:32.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
so I mean as I recall
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
we had a lot of uh testimony on either
 
00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
side on this one and um
 
00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
I don't recall
 
00:35:47.329 --> 00:35:47.339 align:start position:0%
any discussion of a proposed change
 
00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
I mean I will yeah you know president
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
yes so I just want to give the history
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
of this bill because I think I've been
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
on the committee every year it's been
 
00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:01.500 align:start position:0%
so the Bono contention between the
 
00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:02.940 align:start position:0%
speech therapists and the music
 
00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:05.220 align:start position:0%
therapist now this was the 644 which is
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
the blow dry bar thing oh I'm so sorry I
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
stepped back step back it's okay
 
00:36:13.849 --> 00:36:13.859 align:start position:0%
I mean last time when we dealt with it
 
00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
there was concern about uh I think we
 
00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:17.700 align:start position:0%
passed in the house and there was
 
00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:20.460 align:start position:0%
concern in the Senate about the gluing
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
the eyelid thing and the eyelashes on
 
00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:23.940 align:start position:0%
and that was removed from this version
 
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
so I just
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
before we get going to see who wants to
 
00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:30.599 align:start position:0%
speak I was wondering if there any
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
thoughts or questions or whatever that
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
so uh I've been looking at this and
 
00:36:42.589 --> 00:36:42.599 align:start position:0%
thinking about this and and I you've all
 
00:36:44.329 --> 00:36:44.339 align:start position:0%
heard me say that I'm very concerned
 
00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:46.980 align:start position:0%
about the aspect of uh hygiene and so
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
forth and
 
00:36:52.849 --> 00:36:52.859 align:start position:0%
um and they're the other aspects uh so
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
the blow drying shampooing and so forth
 
00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:57.300 align:start position:0%
is very straightforward I don't have a
 
00:36:59.089 --> 00:36:59.099 align:start position:0%
problem with that at all but when they
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
start monking near the eyes then I'm
 
00:37:05.329 --> 00:37:05.339 align:start position:0%
concerned about contamination or
 
00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:07.640 align:start position:0%
our sanitation
 
00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
but also my information is that this
 
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
threading thing does lead to some
 
00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.849 align:start position:0%
threading thing does lead to some
bleeding

00:37:16.849 --> 00:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
bleeding
 
00:37:19.849 --> 00:37:19.859 align:start position:0%
that's what I've heard okay that that
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
when you pull eyebrow out
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
that it with through threading that it
 
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.589 align:start position:0%
that it with through threading that it
it

00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
there is some blood that comes out
 
00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
that's what I've heard we'll see if I
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
don't have no expertise personally on
 
00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.950 align:start position:0%
don't have no expertise personally on
that

00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know if anyone else here
 
00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:36.829 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know if anyone else here
does

00:37:36.829 --> 00:37:36.839 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
um so I will point out that people do
 
00:37:40.849 --> 00:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
manage to cut themselves shaving as well
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
right so right and the world hasn't
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
ended right how would you know anything
 
00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
about shaving Mr chairman I've observed
 
00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
it but so the thing is that but also the
 
00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:57.300 align:start position:0%
makeup aspect is also subject to not
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
that I use any but but I understand that
 
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
you have to be very careful with regard
 
00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
to you don't get contamination and
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
transfer and and infecting somebody I
 
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
understand representative crota or oh
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
sorry representative a bear thank you
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
I have a few different thoughts shut me
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
down whenever you'd like to shut me down
 
00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
but I don't want to shut anyone down
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
so my problem with this bill is just one
 
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
fact and the fact is that the
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
the language says that we will include
 
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
renting a chair
 
00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:43.380 align:start position:0%
I believe
 
00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
coming from the business background that
 
00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
there is a big difference between
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
me owning my business certified by
 
00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.430 align:start position:0%
me owning my business certified by
as9100

00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
as9100
 
00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
and having employees that I control
 
00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:01.130 align:start position:0%
and having employees that I control
monitor

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
um discipline
 
00:39:05.089 --> 00:39:05.099 align:start position:0%
and there's a difference between me
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
having a subcontractor in my plant
 
00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
a subcontractor is not as controlled
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
a subcontractor does not have to hold
 
00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
the MSDS sheets that a salon owner
 
00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:21.540 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist licensed cosmetologist has
 
00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:22.250 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist licensed cosmetologist has
to

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
control they have to have MSDS sheets
 
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.349 align:start position:0%
control they have to have MSDS sheets
available

00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:39:27.359 --> 00:39:29.089 align:start position:0%
available
the

00:39:29.089 --> 00:39:29.099 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
if I rent a chair
 
00:39:34.609 --> 00:39:34.619 align:start position:0%
in a salon I am bringing with me my bag
 
00:39:34.619 --> 00:39:36.410 align:start position:0%
in a salon I am bringing with me my bag
of

00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
hair dryer
 
00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
um product yeah
 
00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:43.740 align:start position:0%
right I get it all the gear I need
 
00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:46.740 align:start position:0%
everything so those MSDS sheets that
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
have to be held by the licensed
 
00:39:49.079 --> 00:39:50.569 align:start position:0%
have to be held by the licensed
cosmetologists

00:39:50.569 --> 00:39:50.579 align:start position:0%
cosmetologists
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
could prevent could present an issue
 
00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:55.740 align:start position:0%
caught licensed cosmetologists in school
 
00:39:59.089 --> 00:39:59.099 align:start position:0%
every single day are drilled on the
 
00:40:02.089 --> 00:40:02.099 align:start position:0%
cleanliness sanitation and so I had an
 
00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
um to talk about the sanitation to
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
understand that and so I'm going to go
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
back to the control of the employee
 
00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:12.300 align:start position:0%
versus the subcontractor
 
00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:13.790 align:start position:0%
versus the subcontractor
so

00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
lice herpes warts Phyllis colitis and
 
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
fungal infection can all happen from
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
lack of Sanitation so back to control I
 
00:40:26.089 --> 00:40:26.099 align:start position:0%
would rather see that rental chair come
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
out of the bill and give the power to
 
00:40:31.609 --> 00:40:31.619 align:start position:0%
the licensed cosmetologist to oversee
 
00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:38.060 align:start position:0%
his or her full Salon than to risk
 
00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:41.820 align:start position:0%
the required
 
00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:45.020 align:start position:0%
the the requirements by oh
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
PLC I'm gonna get it right sometime so
 
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.109 align:start position:0%
PLC I'm gonna get it right sometime so
look

00:40:50.109 --> 00:40:50.119 align:start position:0%
look
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
let me at least see give in one one more
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
one more one more Point
 
00:40:58.370 --> 00:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
um and I think the better question is
 
00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
that oplc just changed their licensing
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
on salons from
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
two from four years they would re-licens
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
them every four years to every two years
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
now so if we're talking about
 
00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
relinquishing licensing I believe that
 
00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:19.740 align:start position:0%
we really need to start with oplc and
 
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
ask them why are you shrinking down the
 
00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
licensing down to every two years now
 
00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:27.300 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so actually the last
 
00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:28.740 align:start position:0%
point I mean that's not part of this
 
00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:31.140 align:start position:0%
bill and that's something we can you can
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
certainly uh contact uh executor
 
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
Courtney and ask her what what led to
 
00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:38.460 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to know the answer hang on
 
00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:39.290 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to know the answer hang on
um

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:39.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
just to give my view of of what's going
 
00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
on here and then people can correct me
 
00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:46.700 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
I see that there's at least three
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
different situations here
 
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:51.710 align:start position:0%
different situations here
um

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:53.569 --> 00:41:53.579 align:start position:0%
and by the way the the uh the rental
 
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
chair thing was added not by the sponsor
 
00:41:58.010 --> 00:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
originally but by it was a request of
 
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
oplc and so she added it to the bill
 
00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.089 align:start position:0%
oplc and so she added it to the bill
um

00:42:02.089 --> 00:42:02.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
so as far as the rental thing goes
 
00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
you know either that spot is being
 
00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
rented to a licensed Barbara
 
00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist esthetician
 
00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:16.190 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist esthetician
um

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
who can practice anything under their
 
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
scope of practice and in that case not
 
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
only is the practitioner licensed by
 
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
oplc and subject to any checking
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action or whatever but also
 
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
the Solano you know the person running
 
00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
the salon is a facility license and they
 
00:42:38.089 --> 00:42:38.099 align:start position:0%
also have the responsibility to oversee
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
what's going on in their salon
 
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
um you know that person is running the
 
00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
chair could go and you know open it up
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere else I mean if local zoning
 
00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
allowed it to do it in their home and
 
00:42:52.849 --> 00:42:52.859 align:start position:0%
they're the right equipment
 
00:42:55.849 --> 00:42:55.859 align:start position:0%
um with no oversight from anybody so if
 
00:42:59.050 --> 00:42:59.060 align:start position:0%
anything doing it in a licensed Salon
 
00:43:01.849 --> 00:43:01.859 align:start position:0%
provides more oversight than that person
 
00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:05.940 align:start position:0%
is already allowed to do now so if
 
00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
anything it increases the level of
 
00:43:10.609 --> 00:43:10.619 align:start position:0%
oversight that's possible than today so
 
00:43:10.619 --> 00:43:11.390 align:start position:0%
oversight that's possible than today so
that's

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:43:14.089 --> 00:43:14.099 align:start position:0%
that's that one if this bill were to
 
00:43:14.099 --> 00:43:14.930 align:start position:0%
that's that one if this bill were to
pass

00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:14.940 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:17.460 align:start position:0%
then you know in the salon the salon
 
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
owner could rent the chair out to
 
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
somebody who's not licensed as long as
 
00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:23.690 align:start position:0%
somebody who's not licensed as long as
they

00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:23.700 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:28.140 align:start position:0%
um confine themselves to the procedures
 
00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
that are permitted that this bill went
 
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
through to be not licensed so
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
um you know the styling the Cosmetics
 
00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:38.460 align:start position:0%
blow drying and all that
 
00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
um and then the other one would be that
 
00:43:41.569 --> 00:43:41.579 align:start position:0%
person could practice separately not you
 
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
know in a salon you know anywhere would
 
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
be legal for them to do it
 
00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:47.630 align:start position:0%
be legal for them to do it
but

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
I don't see how being able to rent it
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
puts creates any more risk than exists
 
00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:57.180 align:start position:0%
today because the person renting that
 
00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
spot could operate somewhere else not
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
even in a salon at all
 
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else on this on anything
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
actually representative okay so one of
 
00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:15.660 align:start position:0%
the things is my understanding is that
 
00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
that the industry and the the
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial types that we heard we
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
had a whole slew of them uh Institute
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
for justice and you know all this kind
 
00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
of stuff all pushing the idea of the
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
salons where they're just going to be
 
00:44:33.119 --> 00:44:34.210 align:start position:0%
salons where they're just going to be
doing

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:34.220 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
shampooing and non
 
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
cosmetology types of operations they're
 
00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
going to be doing shampooing and styling
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
and so forth and if we permit it makeup
 
00:44:49.849 --> 00:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
and threading
 
00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:52.980 align:start position:0%
and I don't think they it that's what
 
00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:54.300 align:start position:0%
they want to do they want to be able to
 
00:44:58.910 --> 00:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
open up these non-licensed salons for
 
00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
for just the simple stuff not doing
 
00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:03.180 align:start position:0%
cosmetology although I suppose they
 
00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
could have a cosmetologist working for
 
00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
them uh because that person has their
 
00:45:10.609 --> 00:45:10.619 align:start position:0%
individual license already
 
00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:12.300 align:start position:0%
I don't know whether they have to work
 
00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:14.220 align:start position:0%
in an individual Salon you've already
 
00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
addressed I don't know the details on
 
00:45:17.809 --> 00:45:17.819 align:start position:0%
that before we go further I want to ask
 
00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
one question is anyone else here to
 
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
speak on 644 okay thank you
 
00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
representative bear thank you um so
 
00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
if if that were true
 
00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:34.940 align:start position:0%
the MSDS sheets that these license Salon
 
00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
has to have
 
00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:43.140 align:start position:0%
filed for review by oplc
 
00:45:46.609 --> 00:45:46.619 align:start position:0%
how would that work if you just open
 
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
a non-licensed place would oplc
 
00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
take away the MSDS requirement by salons
 
00:45:57.170 --> 00:45:57.180 align:start position:0%
what else would they take away from
 
00:46:01.609 --> 00:46:01.619 align:start position:0%
salons I can't answer that my
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
you know there's no one here that I know
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
can speak on this but uh
 
00:46:07.609 --> 00:46:07.619 align:start position:0%
you know my take is that if they're
 
00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
licensing the facility they respond the
 
00:46:11.329 --> 00:46:11.339 align:start position:0%
person running it is responsible what
 
00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
happens in that facility
 
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes
 
00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:19.740 align:start position:0%
and so furthering or moreover
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
then it becomes a fairness issue I
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
believe if if
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
they need to to run an alignment so
 
00:46:29.089 --> 00:46:29.099 align:start position:0%
whatever we
 
00:46:31.849 --> 00:46:31.859 align:start position:0%
we push through that's not licensed then
 
00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
for the salon we need to
 
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
undo parts of their
 
00:46:41.809 --> 00:46:41.819 align:start position:0%
oversight I don't
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
get that
 
00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.150 align:start position:0%
get that
um

00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:46.849 --> 00:46:46.859 align:start position:0%
there is licensing required to do I mean
 
00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
assuming this bill passes they're
 
00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
licensing to do some of these procedures
 
00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
still and not like licensing not
 
00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
required for others
 
00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:55.790 align:start position:0%
required for others
um

00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:58.130 --> 00:46:58.140 align:start position:0%
the salon owner's response for what goes
 
00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
in there they can choose to rent to a
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
person who's not licensed or not
 
00:47:05.329 --> 00:47:05.339 align:start position:0%
um presumably they're responsible to
 
00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
make sure that person
 
00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
you know follows reasonable practice and
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything that would require
 
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.430 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything that would require
licensing

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
00:47:17.569 --> 00:47:17.579 align:start position:0%
but as to the details of the
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
the ACT licensing salons I am not an
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
expert so I can't answer that follow-up
 
00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
sure follow-up
 
00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:29.660 align:start position:0%
um so my my question then is
 
00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:33.780 align:start position:0%
if we push this bill through then
 
00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
anybody can go and open
 
00:47:38.329 --> 00:47:38.339 align:start position:0%
anywhere that we're we're not talking
 
00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
that they would rent a chair they could
 
00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:42.300 align:start position:0%
just rent a place right I believe the
 
00:47:44.329 --> 00:47:44.339 align:start position:0%
chair rental thing is basically separate
 
00:47:46.849 --> 00:47:46.859 align:start position:0%
from the others issues in the bill so
 
00:47:46.859 --> 00:47:48.710 align:start position:0%
from the others issues in the bill so
yes

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
and so that just goes back to my MSDS
 
00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
and all of the other requirements I
 
00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
think the basic idea behind the bill is
 
00:47:55.319 --> 00:47:56.270 align:start position:0%
think the basic idea behind the bill is
that

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:59.329 --> 00:47:59.339 align:start position:0%
I know there's some concerns but that
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
the activities that are being permitted
 
00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
without a license are low enough risk
 
00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:04.380 align:start position:0%
and they're things that people do in
 
00:48:07.069 --> 00:48:07.079 align:start position:0%
their own homes regularly that worrying
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
about that is is not
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
something we would if we pass the Bill
 
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
we're choosing not to do I mean my view
 
00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:15.660 align:start position:0%
is to require a license for someone to
 
00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:17.569 align:start position:0%
is to require a license for someone to
work

00:48:17.569 --> 00:48:17.579 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
um the only justification is a
 
00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
significant risk to health and safety
 
00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
and at least in my view and other people
 
00:48:26.569 --> 00:48:26.579 align:start position:0%
have different views uh the threshold
 
00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
for that is fairly high and I don't see
 
00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:31.380 align:start position:0%
myself the risk of the operations there
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
they would allow to be unlicensed to be
 
00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
high enough to justify licensing
 
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
and so I I think my final point last
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
point is just that oplc made these
 
00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:46.020 align:start position:0%
salons put in eye wash units now as well
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
they have to have eye wash units in case
 
00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:51.950 align:start position:0%
they have to have eye wash units in case
they

00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:54.300 align:start position:0%
put something near somebody's eye too
 
00:48:57.890 --> 00:48:57.900 align:start position:0%
so so now they have to be so once you
 
00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
put an eye wash unit in it has to be
 
00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:01.490 align:start position:0%
put an eye wash unit in it has to be
um

00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:01.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
reviewed every I forget how many months
 
00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
we have eye wash units in our own
 
00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:08.220 align:start position:0%
facility they have to to be we have to
 
00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:10.500 align:start position:0%
have people come in and check them and
 
00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:12.180 align:start position:0%
it just it's another well this doesn't
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
change any of that
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
um and and I'm this is speculation I'm
 
00:49:17.809 --> 00:49:17.819 align:start position:0%
not an expert but I believe the concern
 
00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
with the iwash stations is that people
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
are licensed to doing other operations
 
00:49:24.349 --> 00:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
are handling
 
00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:26.460 align:start position:0%
um some chemicals that really could be
 
00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
very bad if they got in somebody's eyes
 
00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
I mean you got dyes and bleaching I
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
don't know what else they have so I
 
00:49:33.650 --> 00:49:33.660 align:start position:0%
think that's more aimed
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
at them and this is not touching any of
 
00:49:37.609 --> 00:49:37.619 align:start position:0%
that whatsoever
 
00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:39.780 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with it so anybody
 
00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:40.740 align:start position:0%
else want to speak in this
 
00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
I will say when I when I look at this it
 
00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:49.270 align:start position:0%
I will say when I when I look at this it
includes

00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
includes
 
00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:50.930 align:start position:0%
includes
airbrushing

00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:50.940 align:start position:0%
airbrushing
 
00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:54.180 align:start position:0%
which is the spraying of chemicals to
 
00:49:55.309 --> 00:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
the face
 
00:49:57.950 --> 00:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
that could at some point or another
 
00:49:59.329 --> 00:49:59.339 align:start position:0%
enter the eye
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
and we don't know what all those
 
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
chemicals are that they're applying to
 
00:50:04.609 --> 00:50:04.619 align:start position:0%
the face and that's my concern
 
00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:07.380 align:start position:0%
the other concern I have is with
 
00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:09.300 align:start position:0%
what we've talked about is sanitation
 
00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
and with the threading portion of
 
00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:14.210 align:start position:0%
and with the threading portion of
Sanitation

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
when you read
 
00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:18.660 align:start position:0%
the definition of threading
 
00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
method of removing hair from the
 
00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
eyebrows upper lip or other parts of the
 
00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
body using a cotton thread to pull hair
 
00:50:26.329 --> 00:50:26.339 align:start position:0%
from follicles threading also includes
 
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:28.140 align:start position:0%
the use of over-the-counter powdered
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
shells and scissors and tweezers
 
00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:33.660 align:start position:0%
and there's nothing saying about the
 
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
sanitation of those instruments that are
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
being used
 
00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:39.300 align:start position:0%
as they're pulling the follicles
 
00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:41.220 align:start position:0%
and when you pull a follicle you're
 
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:46.740 align:start position:0%
through some sort of contamination to
 
00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
enter the body and my concern is
 
00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
there'll be no requirement for any
 
00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:54.980 align:start position:0%
sanitation on the instruments used
 
00:50:57.049 --> 00:50:57.059 align:start position:0%
anyone else want to speak on this
 
00:50:58.910 --> 00:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt one of the things
 
00:51:01.549 --> 00:51:01.559 align:start position:0%
that we haven't discussed is uh it was
 
00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
it was referenced in the hearing but
 
00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:05.940 align:start position:0%
this threading apparently is something
 
00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:09.180 align:start position:0%
that most people learn it's a it's kind
 
00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
of a cultural thing in some uh I I don't
 
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
even know whether it's like Arabic the
 
00:51:18.109 --> 00:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
Arabic world or Haitian or whatever but
 
00:51:20.089 --> 00:51:20.099 align:start position:0%
the thing is it's most of the people
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
that do this I think learn it from their
 
00:51:22.319 --> 00:51:23.750 align:start position:0%
that do this I think learn it from their
families

00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:24.890 align:start position:0%
families
okay

00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:24.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:51:28.849 --> 00:51:28.859 align:start position:0%
and so it it seems like it's something
 
00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
that it may be not very widespread in
 
00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:33.900 align:start position:0%
terms of how many people are out there
 
00:51:36.349 --> 00:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
that could do this but as I said I'm
 
00:51:38.089 --> 00:51:38.099 align:start position:0%
okay with that with the salon where
 
00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
they're going to do shampooing and
 
00:51:42.829 --> 00:51:42.839 align:start position:0%
styling and so forth and so on where the
 
00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
lady comes in and she's going to go out
 
00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:47.220 align:start position:0%
that night to a dance or an event or
 
00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:48.900 align:start position:0%
whatever and she wants to have her hair
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
nicely styled and shampooed I get that
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
and apparently that's a big deal and
 
00:51:56.089 --> 00:51:56.099 align:start position:0%
that's spreading all over the universe
 
00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
uh just not here yet but it's the the
 
00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:02.940 align:start position:0%
threading and the and the makeup I'm
 
00:52:05.809 --> 00:52:05.819 align:start position:0%
much more concerned and uh and
 
00:52:07.549 --> 00:52:07.559 align:start position:0%
representative goalie raises the issue
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
about plucking and so forth and using
 
00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
instruments because you're not going to
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
do with your fingertips okay
 
00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:16.140 align:start position:0%
um unless somebody's got something new I
 
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
think we're kind of going in circles
 
00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:18.780 align:start position:0%
here a little bit uh representative a
 
00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:20.930 align:start position:0%
here a little bit uh representative a
bear

00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:20.940 align:start position:0%
bear
 
00:52:23.089 --> 00:52:23.099 align:start position:0%
I'd like to get to
 
00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
I they're not here for I like they're
 
00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
here for the music therapy I believe
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
I know I that's why I'm trying to that's
 
00:52:33.049 --> 00:52:33.059 align:start position:0%
why I'm trying to I'll close out my
 
00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
comments I'll close out my comments um
 
00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:38.700 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chairman so I am
 
00:52:41.329 --> 00:52:41.339 align:start position:0%
absolutely for this bill and I think it
 
00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
was best said by one of my colleagues
 
00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:44.460 align:start position:0%
that we just need some guard rails on
 
00:52:47.170 --> 00:52:47.180 align:start position:0%
this that we put the Power
 
00:52:50.089 --> 00:52:50.099 align:start position:0%
in I'm pro-business it put the Power
 
00:52:52.609 --> 00:52:52.619 align:start position:0%
with the cosmetologists and give them
 
00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:54.780 align:start position:0%
the power to have and hire people that
 
00:52:57.770 --> 00:52:57.780 align:start position:0%
are unlicensed to help prep answer the
 
00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:00.300 align:start position:0%
phone and help prep the next
 
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
client for the coloring and etc etc
 
00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:05.940 align:start position:0%
thank you all right
 
00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:06.770 align:start position:0%
thank you all right
um

00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:06.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
I'd like to I'm going to make a motion
 
00:53:11.809 --> 00:53:11.819 align:start position:0%
of ought to pass on House Bill 644 or do
 
00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:19.730 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:22.140 align:start position:0%
um so any further discussion that we
 
00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:23.150 align:start position:0%
um so any further discussion that we
haven't

00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
haven't
 
00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:24.900 align:start position:0%
dealt with all that uh representative
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you Mr chair I'll just
 
00:53:29.089 --> 00:53:29.099 align:start position:0%
state that I will be voting against this
 
00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:31.740 align:start position:0%
for those reasons that I stated earlier
 
00:53:34.609 --> 00:53:34.619 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else
 
00:53:34.619 --> 00:53:36.349 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else
okay

00:53:36.349 --> 00:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:53:36.359 --> 00:53:37.010 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
like take the vote and I don't know what
 
00:53:41.329 --> 00:53:41.339 align:start position:0%
order representative goli I
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
said no representative uh Wilhelm
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
um representative Bailey
 
00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:51.180 align:start position:0%
uh representative a bear no and I vote
 
00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:52.250 align:start position:0%
uh representative a bear no and I vote
Yes

00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:52.260 align:start position:0%
Yes
 
00:53:56.329 --> 00:53:56.339 align:start position:0%
so it looks like three to two all right
 
00:53:59.390 --> 00:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
I mean uh sorry two to three
 
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
so that fails would anybody want to make
 
00:54:05.329 --> 00:54:05.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
I'll move in expedient to legislate
 
00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:11.940 align:start position:0%
okay anybody want that okay
 
00:54:14.089 --> 00:54:14.099 align:start position:0%
give me a moment here
 
00:54:20.809 --> 00:54:20.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
no it's fine
 
00:54:25.609 --> 00:54:25.619 align:start position:0%
uh he's there people can sit in on that
 
00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:27.780 align:start position:0%
but they can't we can't vote that's
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
I I think that there's still some open
 
00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:37.980 align:start position:0%
questions I I think you guys might want
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
to think in terms of retaining moving to
 
00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:42.540 align:start position:0%
retain the bill
 
00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:45.349 align:start position:0%
retain the bill
um

00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:48.589 --> 00:54:48.599 align:start position:0%
let's do this and then
 
00:54:51.049 --> 00:54:51.059 align:start position:0%
yeah and and the full committee can do
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
something else so uh
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh sure what's up any comments on the
 
00:54:57.650 --> 00:54:57.660 align:start position:0%
ITIL motion
 
00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:00.839 align:start position:0%
so I I like the bill where we're going
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
but it needs guardrails so I won't be
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
supporting a itl and to my colleague I
 
00:55:08.930 --> 00:55:08.940 align:start position:0%
hope that somebody makes a motion for
 
00:55:12.049 --> 00:55:12.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:14.220 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I'll withdraw my motion and
 
00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
move to retain
 
00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:17.990 align:start position:0%
move to retain
okay

00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
um okay you do as well all right fine so
 
00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.069 --> 00:55:31.079 align:start position:0%
okay representative goalie motion is to
 
00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
retain uh Hospital 644.
 
00:55:36.829 --> 00:55:36.839 align:start position:0%
okay representative Wilhelm yes
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
representative Bailey
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative a bear yes you know the
 
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
chair boats yes and so it's five to zero
 
00:55:45.290 --> 00:55:45.300 align:start position:0%
to retain
 
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:47.990 align:start position:0%
to retain
okay

00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
so I'll close the work session on House
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
Bill 644 and open the work session on
 
00:55:59.170 --> 00:55:59.180 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
532 relative to licensure and regulation
 
00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
music therapists
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt thank you Mr
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
chairman well
 
00:56:12.109 --> 00:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
um I I this is a bill that's already
 
00:56:15.049 --> 00:56:15.059 align:start position:0%
passed the house a couple of times uh
 
00:56:16.849 --> 00:56:16.859 align:start position:0%
but it hasn't made it through the whole
 
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
process in the Senate uh and but the
 
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
thing is that
 
00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
this is a a viable profession that has
 
00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
existed for some time it is a beneficial
 
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
profession uh we have a lady here who's
 
00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
operates the salon in Dover I assume
 
00:56:42.589 --> 00:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
it's not a salon but music therapy or
 
00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:43.980 align:start position:0%
unless they're called salons it's an
 
00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:46.010 align:start position:0%
unless they're called salons it's an
entity

00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:46.020 align:start position:0%
entity
 
00:56:49.609 --> 00:56:49.619 align:start position:0%
practice practice okay I apologize for
 
00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
the inappropriate word uh she operates a
 
00:56:54.890 --> 00:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
business I've been there
 
00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
um and the and so forth and she has one
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
of her colleagues here and and so I
 
00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
would like to see is get this going
 
00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
because uh the the problem is not that
 
00:57:10.609 --> 00:57:10.619 align:start position:0%
that it's it's not out there the problem
 
00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
is it that most insurance companies will
 
00:57:17.089 --> 00:57:17.099 align:start position:0%
not pay for the service
 
00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
um unless the uh the practitioners have
 
00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:22.740 align:start position:0%
a license that's the issue I understand
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
and actually I I recognize that music
 
00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:27.180 align:start position:0%
therapy can be very valuable
 
00:57:30.770 --> 00:57:30.780 align:start position:0%
um I had a wife of a good friend former
 
00:57:32.450 --> 00:57:32.460 align:start position:0%
rep actually and who was also a good
 
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
friend who did cancer did Hospice at
 
00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
home and she had people I mean they
 
00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
weren't licensed music therapists but
 
00:57:42.109 --> 00:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
people who came and the porch and played
 
00:57:43.849 --> 00:57:43.859 align:start position:0%
music for it from a music group she used
 
00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
to be in so and it helped her and and
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
you know and I'm not challenging
 
00:57:49.609 --> 00:57:49.619 align:start position:0%
anything about the value of music
 
00:57:49.619 --> 00:57:51.170 align:start position:0%
anything about the value of music
therapy

00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:51.180 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
um what I will say I mean before we go
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
on and I will have them come up and
 
00:58:00.109 --> 00:58:00.119 align:start position:0%
speak but uh my objection is that given
 
00:58:00.119 --> 00:58:00.710 align:start position:0%
speak but uh my objection is that given
um

00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:04.370 --> 00:58:04.380 align:start position:0%
that licensing a profession limits
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
people that can get into it it's having
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
the government say you can't do this
 
00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:08.940 align:start position:0%
unless you follow our rules
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
I do not see creating a license for the
 
00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
purpose of allowing you know permitting
 
00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:15.490 align:start position:0%
purpose of allowing you know permitting
insurance

00:58:15.490 --> 00:58:15.500 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:58:18.049 --> 00:58:18.059 align:start position:0%
reimbursement is a I see that as a
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
misuse of the whole idea of Occupational
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
licensing maybe something else needs to
 
00:58:23.210 --> 00:58:23.220 align:start position:0%
be done
 
00:58:25.370 --> 00:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
somewhere else dealing with insurance
 
00:58:26.930 --> 00:58:26.940 align:start position:0%
companies or something else but I mean
 
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
that that's my position on that but
 
00:58:35.089 --> 00:58:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
can you give me your uh name uh yes so
 
00:58:43.609 --> 00:58:43.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:45.660 align:start position:0%
um I'm the chair of the New Hampshire
 
00:58:47.930 --> 00:58:47.940 align:start position:0%
music therapy task force for State
 
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
recognition and I do also own a business
 
00:58:56.410 --> 00:58:56.420 align:start position:0%
a music therapy practice I have 10
 
00:58:59.930 --> 00:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
employees I believe eight of us are
 
00:59:03.490 --> 00:59:03.500 align:start position:0%
music therapy uh board certified
 
00:59:07.309 --> 00:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
and we serve probably about 3 500 people
 
00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559 align:start position:0%
across the state of New Hampshire
 
00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:12.900 align:start position:0%
um so I I want to
 
00:59:14.809 --> 00:59:14.819 align:start position:0%
I want to take time most of the time to
 
00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
really answer questions that you have
 
00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
but I just want to say
 
00:59:21.049 --> 00:59:21.059 align:start position:0%
um I hear what you're saying that the
 
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
insurance shouldn't be the only reason
 
00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:23.690 align:start position:0%
insurance shouldn't be the only reason
why

00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:23.700 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
why someone passes a licensure but the
 
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
other really big piece of this is
 
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
protecting the public from people using
 
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
the term music therapy and you know
 
00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:38.450 align:start position:0%
the term music therapy and you know
um

00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:38.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:40.500 align:start position:0%
and there's a there is a potential for
 
00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
harm so music has actual there's loads
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
and loads of research on this uh music
 
00:59:49.309 --> 00:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
has actual physical effects on our body
 
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
so music can lower or increase your
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
heart rate music can lower your
 
00:59:57.289 --> 00:59:57.299 align:start position:0%
respiration rate
 
00:59:59.329 --> 00:59:59.339 align:start position:0%
um music can
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
um cause your like neurological
 
01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:05.700 align:start position:0%
stimulation that certain people with
 
01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
certain abilities or disabilities I
 
01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:11.460 align:start position:0%
should say are not able to process
 
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
um and can be like put them in a state
 
01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:18.660 align:start position:0%
of a medical emergency people anyone can
 
01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
use music in a therapeutic way but board
 
01:00:24.890 --> 01:00:24.900 align:start position:0%
certified music therapists are trained
 
01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
to respond to the first of all we're
 
01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
trained not to use music in a way that's
 
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
going to be harmful to recognize when
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
we're working with someone who is at
 
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
risk for you know using music at a
 
01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
certain decibel or to recognize when
 
01:00:43.930 --> 01:00:43.940 align:start position:0%
we're working with someone who has
 
01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.609 align:start position:0%
we're working with someone who has
experienced

01:00:45.609 --> 01:00:45.619 align:start position:0%
experienced
 
01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:49.980 align:start position:0%
trauma that certain Like lyrics and
 
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
music could be triggering and could
 
01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:54.410 align:start position:0%
music could be triggering and could
um

01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:56.460 align:start position:0%
could put that person into a state of
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
psychosis that you know we're just
 
01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
really trained in how to respond to all
 
01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
of those things whereas you know
 
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
somebody who is a well-trained musician
 
01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
and loves people and loves caring for
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
people could go into you know
 
01:01:18.970 --> 01:01:18.980 align:start position:0%
a nursing home and like play music
 
01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:22.380 align:start position:0%
kindly for a group of dementia patients
 
01:01:24.370 --> 01:01:24.380 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
they could be kind of triggered into a
 
01:01:30.589 --> 01:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
state of like dis like disorientation
 
01:01:32.809 --> 01:01:32.819 align:start position:0%
um which could have multiple physical
 
01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:35.220 align:start position:0%
effects on their body and and then that
 
01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:37.079 align:start position:0%
person is kind of like oh I don't I
 
01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:38.220 align:start position:0%
don't know what to do with this because
 
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
I just came here to make some nice music
 
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
for people and so the licensure piece
 
01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:48.660 align:start position:0%
really takes the state saying okay like
 
01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
there is a potential for harm here
 
01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
for an untrained person
 
01:01:56.270 --> 01:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
and so these people are trained they're
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
educated they've gone through rigorous
 
01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
clinical experience and they
 
01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
um they are able to call themselves call
 
01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
this music therapy they are able to say
 
01:02:09.370 --> 01:02:09.380 align:start position:0%
this is music therapy
 
01:02:12.289 --> 01:02:12.299 align:start position:0%
the having somebody walk into a hospital
 
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
and say oh yeah I I don't know how many
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
times I have encountered someone in the
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
grocery store and told them I'm a music
 
01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
therapist and they've said oh I do music
 
01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:21.530 align:start position:0%
therapist and they've said oh I do music
therapy

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
I put music I put music on my car I'm a
 
01:02:26.809 --> 01:02:26.819 align:start position:0%
music therapist and that's not what
 
01:02:29.089 --> 01:02:29.099 align:start position:0%
we're trained for we don't go to I don't
 
01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:31.700 align:start position:0%
have hundreds of thousands of dollars in
 
01:02:35.870 --> 01:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
Masters in like School Education Loans
 
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
because I play music in my car or like I
 
01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:39.780 align:start position:0%
tell someone I don't tell people to like
 
01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
lay on a couch and listen to music and
 
01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:43.140 align:start position:0%
you're going to be all better that's not
 
01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
what we're trained for it's it's more
 
01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
rigorous it's more intentional than that
 
01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:50.220 align:start position:0%
um and so there you know
 
01:02:54.410 --> 01:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't go to like a dentist and
 
01:02:58.250 --> 01:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
I guess like ask them to like look at
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
the bones in your fingers
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
um and so like what we do is really
 
01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.069 align:start position:0%
um and so like what we do is really
specific

01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:15.589 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
so I want to provide some history to
 
01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
this Cruise committee on this bill so
 
01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:21.900 align:start position:0%
this has been
 
01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
um a bill that has been before the
 
01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.130 align:start position:0%
um a bill that has been before the
committee

01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:25.140 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
and the original
 
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
um issue with the bill was that speech
 
01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.569 align:start position:0%
um issue with the bill was that speech
pathologists

01:03:32.569 --> 01:03:32.579 align:start position:0%
pathologists
 
01:03:36.049 --> 01:03:36.059 align:start position:0%
and music therapists the lines of
 
01:03:38.569 --> 01:03:38.579 align:start position:0%
demarcation were fuzzy
 
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
and the speech pathologists were
 
01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
concerned and so this language that's in
 
01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
the bill that's been amended
 
01:03:51.289 --> 01:03:51.299 align:start position:0%
is agreeable to the speech pathologists
 
01:03:54.770 --> 01:03:54.780 align:start position:0%
and to the
 
01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
um music therapists so I think that this
 
01:04:01.069 --> 01:04:01.079 align:start position:0%
is a big step that was taken
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:04:06.829 --> 01:04:06.839 align:start position:0%
I think so it's the only change to is to
 
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
eliminate some conflict
 
01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:12.780 align:start position:0%
right well yeah that's a big deal right
 
01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
because we want the music therapists and
 
01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
the speech pathologists to
 
01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
at least have an idea of where their
 
01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:24.900 align:start position:0%
fields separate and where they can work
 
01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
together and that was the issue that
 
01:04:29.569 --> 01:04:29.579 align:start position:0%
because oftentimes speech pathologists
 
01:04:32.270 --> 01:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
and music therapists work together
 
01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
to address
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
issues that children might have for
 
01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
example what I'd like to do is just
 
01:04:41.329 --> 01:04:41.339 align:start position:0%
proceed with the the underlying issue of
 
01:04:43.069 --> 01:04:43.079 align:start position:0%
Licensing or not licensing music
 
01:04:43.079 --> 01:04:44.329 align:start position:0%
Licensing or not licensing music
therapists

01:04:44.329 --> 01:04:44.339 align:start position:0%
therapists
 
01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
and then you know we could consider the
 
01:04:47.930 --> 01:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
amendment if we choose to go down to
 
01:04:50.690 --> 01:04:50.700 align:start position:0%
licensing route
 
01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
sense so what you're saying is you're
 
01:04:54.410 --> 01:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
going to ignore the amendment and you're
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
just going to try to handle the bill as
 
01:05:00.289 --> 01:05:00.299 align:start position:0%
it is which is applaud my
 
01:05:02.270 --> 01:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
I mean my intent is to offer an itl
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
motion on the bill and I would offer the
 
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
same if it were amended because my
 
01:05:09.049 --> 01:05:09.059 align:start position:0%
objection to the bill has got nothing to
 
01:05:11.329 --> 01:05:11.339 align:start position:0%
do with the conflict between music
 
01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
therapy and speech therapy
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that would make sense I
 
01:05:18.170 --> 01:05:18.180 align:start position:0%
mean and maybe I'll lose and maybe then
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
we'll go on to take care of the
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
amendment or maybe that'll be done in
 
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
the full committee
 
01:05:22.799 --> 01:05:24.470 align:start position:0%
the full committee
um

01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:31.609 --> 01:05:31.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
yes you're you're first yeah right may I
 
01:05:39.890 --> 01:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
address your first question would you
 
01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
please introduce yourself first yes my
 
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
answer is Rebecca gilday I am a Music
 
01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
therapist in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:05:47.950 --> 01:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
and what was your last name gilday
 
01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
g-i-l-d-e-a okay thank you yeah
 
01:05:53.569 --> 01:05:53.579 align:start position:0%
um so the one of the things that you
 
01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
said was
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
um you're concerned that licensure would
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
um prevent music therapists from working
 
01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:02.940 align:start position:0%
in the state and
 
01:06:06.289 --> 01:06:06.299 align:start position:0%
um actually what our our issue currently
 
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
is that music therapists are having a
 
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
really hard time working in the state at
 
01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:10.549 align:start position:0%
really hard time working in the state at
all

01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
um it's very difficult to have a job in
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
um because of the sources of payment for
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
music therapy services
 
01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:20.630 align:start position:0%
music therapy services
um

01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:23.930 --> 01:06:23.940 align:start position:0%
it has the the growth rate for music
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
therapists for jobs in music therapy has
 
01:06:30.410 --> 01:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
been unbelievably slow in the state in
 
01:06:32.569 --> 01:06:32.579 align:start position:0%
comparison to other states especially in
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
comparison to States who have passed
 
01:06:37.309 --> 01:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
music therapy licensure their their jobs
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
have increased significantly once
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
licensure was passed
 
01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
um and it's not because music therapy is
 
01:06:47.809 --> 01:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
not effective it's not because it's not
 
01:06:47.819 --> 01:06:48.589 align:start position:0%
not effective it's not because it's not
um

01:06:48.589 --> 01:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
efficacious and and medically necessary
 
01:06:53.690 --> 01:06:53.700 align:start position:0%
for some folks it's because there are
 
01:06:55.490 --> 01:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
barriers to
 
01:06:57.650 --> 01:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
um seeking services and primarily that
 
01:06:59.329 --> 01:06:59.339 align:start position:0%
comes around
 
01:06:59.339 --> 01:06:59.930 align:start position:0%
comes around
um

01:06:59.930 --> 01:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:04.490 --> 01:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
the it comes around either having
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh private pay
 
01:07:08.809 --> 01:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
or some kind of grant funding which is
 
01:07:13.309 --> 01:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
severely limited and if we are if we're
 
01:07:15.289 --> 01:07:15.299 align:start position:0%
wanting to bolster business and bolster
 
01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
young people coming to our state
 
01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:18.230 align:start position:0%
young people coming to our state
um

01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
we want to make that job growth and job
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
Avenue as as helpful as possible
 
01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:26.819 align:start position:0%
um and so this licensure bill is going
 
01:07:26.819 --> 01:07:27.710 align:start position:0%
um and so this licensure bill is going
to

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
to help that and it's not saying that
 
01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
um like to become a music therapist you
 
01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:35.220 align:start position:0%
already have a set of regulations you
 
01:07:38.510 --> 01:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
have to meet that's already set by the
 
01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:39.170 align:start position:0%
have to meet that's already set by the
um

01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:40.789 --> 01:07:40.799 align:start position:0%
by the certification board of Music
 
01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
therapists it's a national accreditation
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
agency so anyone wanting to go into the
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
field already has a set of standards
 
01:07:48.890 --> 01:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
that they have to do
 
01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
um but when after they do all of that
 
01:07:52.609 --> 01:07:52.619 align:start position:0%
when they have to look at what the job
 
01:07:56.270 --> 01:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
market is the they travel out they they
 
01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
don't come back to New Hampshire because
 
01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
we have what three four agencies for
 
01:08:04.730 --> 01:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
music therapy agencies three in the
 
01:08:07.069 --> 01:08:07.079 align:start position:0%
entire State and there's only 48 music
 
01:08:09.529 --> 01:08:09.539 align:start position:0%
therapists working here either privately
 
01:08:12.529 --> 01:08:12.539 align:start position:0%
or through those agencies
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:17.209 --> 01:08:17.219 align:start position:0%
and to follow up and comment on that the
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
we have at least 60 percent of our music
 
01:08:23.329 --> 01:08:23.339 align:start position:0%
therapists in the state living in New
 
01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:26.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and working in in other states
 
01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:29.100 align:start position:0%
driving and working in other states
 
01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
because they just can't get reimbursed
 
01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:34.140 align:start position:0%
for their work here okay I have a
 
01:08:36.349 --> 01:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
question that maybe you folks can answer
 
01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
in states where it is licensed Does
 
01:08:41.689 --> 01:08:41.699 align:start position:0%
Medicare or Medicaid provide
 
01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:43.799 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for music therapy yes okay
 
01:08:45.349 --> 01:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
um oh also
 
01:08:50.150 --> 01:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
um I mean just there is a music
 
01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.590 align:start position:0%
um I mean just there is a music
therapist

01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
therapist
 
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
um and I am bling I'm totally forgetting
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
what state it is but I have it in an
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
email somewhere who works in a hospital
 
01:08:59.630 --> 01:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
setting they're employed by the hospital
 
01:09:02.450 --> 01:09:02.460 align:start position:0%
and when their state passed licensure
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
the hospital gave them a 40
 
01:09:06.650 --> 01:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
000 raise
 
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
just because they had a license so like
 
01:09:10.669 --> 01:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
that's just showing you why people are
 
01:09:12.829 --> 01:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
wanting to go to places that have
 
01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
licensure because if you had the choice
 
01:09:17.930 --> 01:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
of like oh I can maybe make ten thousand
 
01:09:19.849 --> 01:09:19.859 align:start position:0%
dollars a year or I can make fifty
 
01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year I'm gonna go to
 
01:09:23.809 --> 01:09:23.819 align:start position:0%
the place where I can make an actual
 
01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
living I'm gonna go
 
01:09:29.150 --> 01:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
I have you know I understand yeah any
 
01:09:31.249 --> 01:09:31.259 align:start position:0%
question my represent goalie
 
01:09:33.650 --> 01:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
not really question Mr chair just a
 
01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
comment if I may certainly
 
01:09:39.470 --> 01:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
as we heard in testimony when this came
 
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
before us
 
01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
a number of folks testified that this
 
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
helped out
 
01:09:47.209 --> 01:09:47.219 align:start position:0%
and we heard in testimony that
 
01:09:47.219 --> 01:09:48.349 align:start position:0%
and we heard in testimony that
doing

01:09:48.349 --> 01:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
the wrong type of therapy
 
01:09:52.669 --> 01:09:52.679 align:start position:0%
can have
 
01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
bad effects on individuals
 
01:09:58.850 --> 01:09:58.860 align:start position:0%
and the most moving for me was when you
 
01:10:01.790 --> 01:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
have a Vietnam veteran up there looking
 
01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
for care
 
01:10:05.689 --> 01:10:05.699 align:start position:0%
and having to pay out of his own pocket
 
01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
for that care that obviously is helping
 
01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
him and he told us it was helping him
 
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
and it was very helpful
 
01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
is the reason why I will support this
 
01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:16.130 align:start position:0%
is the reason why I will support this
okay

01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:10:18.719 --> 01:10:19.970 align:start position:0%
anyone else
okay

01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:19.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:21.229 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:10:21.229 --> 01:10:21.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:23.450 --> 01:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
I mean I mentioned earlier what my view
 
01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
is and just want to say that it's not
 
01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
it's not just me I'm not this a mean
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
person over here there are quite a
 
01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
number of states I don't know the number
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
who before a new um
 
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
occupational life a new profession can
 
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
be licensed by the state before law can
 
01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:43.020 align:start position:0%
go in place to create an occupational
 
01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:44.169 align:start position:0%
go in place to create an occupational
license

01:10:44.169 --> 01:10:44.179 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:10:46.970 --> 01:10:46.980 align:start position:0%
and before the legislature can consider
 
01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
it there's a requirement and this is
 
01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
kind of like you know we have fiscal
 
01:10:53.290 --> 01:10:53.300 align:start position:0%
notes on the bills there's a requirement
 
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
that a um a group which is
 
01:10:58.729 --> 01:10:58.739 align:start position:0%
it's under the executive branch but as
 
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
independent as possible
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
looks you know it looks into well first
 
01:11:04.729 --> 01:11:04.739 align:start position:0%
of all the legislature is set up what
 
01:11:06.169 --> 01:11:06.179 align:start position:0%
are the justifications for having
 
01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
general justifications for creating you
 
01:11:10.669 --> 01:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
know requiring a license for a
 
01:11:10.679 --> 01:11:12.229 align:start position:0%
know requiring a license for a
profession

01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
profession
 
01:11:14.810 --> 01:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
and so what they're tasked with is
 
01:11:17.149 --> 01:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
taking a look at the new profession
 
01:11:18.669 --> 01:11:18.679 align:start position:0%
looking for license
 
01:11:22.490 --> 01:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
and seeing if that if the license is
 
01:11:24.770 --> 01:11:24.780 align:start position:0%
Justified under
 
01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
um you know under that list of
 
01:11:27.770 --> 01:11:27.780 align:start position:0%
requirements and they get people to come
 
01:11:30.290 --> 01:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
in and give testimony and and all of
 
01:11:33.709 --> 01:11:33.719 align:start position:0%
that and generate reports I've skimmed
 
01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
through some of them
 
01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
I didn't read them all there's one of
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
them it's almost 300 Pages because it's
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
got everybody's testimony but uh just to
 
01:11:43.370 --> 01:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
give an ex there are eight states
 
01:11:47.570 --> 01:11:47.580 align:start position:0%
that have done this kind of a review on
 
01:11:50.330 --> 01:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
occupational licensing poor music
 
01:11:52.189 --> 01:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
therapists specifically
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
one of the states actually did it twice
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
and in all but one case they their
 
01:11:59.689 --> 01:11:59.699 align:start position:0%
conclusion was there was not a
 
01:11:59.699 --> 01:12:01.130 align:start position:0%
conclusion was there was not a
justification

01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
justification
 
01:12:03.290 --> 01:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
for licensing occupational therapists
 
01:12:06.169 --> 01:12:06.179 align:start position:0%
and and those are
 
01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
I mean Colorado they did it twice
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
because there was a second attempt Utah
 
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
Washington West Virginia Nebraska and
 
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
even our neighbor Vermont rejected
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
licensing for music therapy
 
01:12:24.169 --> 01:12:24.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:24.179 --> 01:12:25.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:12:25.070 --> 01:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
one of the criteria that makes it
 
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
Justified to have
 
01:12:31.729 --> 01:12:31.739 align:start position:0%
a license was set up
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement issue none of the
 
01:12:35.689 --> 01:12:35.699 align:start position:0%
states included the reimbursement issue
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
and and my view is that that is a
 
01:12:40.669 --> 01:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
completely there I recognize there's a
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
problem uh maybe it needs to be fixed
 
01:12:44.450 --> 01:12:44.460 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
01:12:46.729 --> 01:12:46.739 align:start position:0%
but in my view it's a complete it's
 
01:12:48.770 --> 01:12:48.780 align:start position:0%
abuse of the concept of Occupational
 
01:12:51.050 --> 01:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
licensing to create an occupational
 
01:12:54.530 --> 01:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
license largely for the purpose of
 
01:12:57.050 --> 01:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
Permitting reimbursement and all of
 
01:13:00.050 --> 01:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
those States actually did look at
 
01:13:02.689 --> 01:13:02.699 align:start position:0%
um the risk issue on occupational
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
licensing and actually I'll I'll forward
 
01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
a thing that has links out to all of
 
01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
them for anybody who wants to look at
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
them some of them actually have
 
01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
uh you know each individual small
 
01:13:16.610 --> 01:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
concern raised by music therapists to
 
01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:18.780 align:start position:0%
justify the license and their analysis
 
01:13:22.090 --> 01:13:22.100 align:start position:0%
of it and also at least one maybe more
 
01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
uh did a survey of every incident where
 
01:13:27.410 --> 01:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
there was any report of somebody having
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
any kind of a harm
 
01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
based on occupational therapy in the
 
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
dinner analysis of that
 
01:13:36.050 --> 01:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
um so I will send that around sorry I
 
01:13:37.370 --> 01:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
didn't do it earlier I just got access
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
to it in the last couple days
 
01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
so anyway unless there's more discussion
 
01:13:44.330 --> 01:13:44.340 align:start position:0%
um I'll make them I'll actually I'll
 
01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
make a motion of itl on House Bill 532
 
01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:56.090 --> 01:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
representative goalie thank you Mr chair
 
01:13:58.010 --> 01:13:58.020 align:start position:0%
and I will once again say we heard
 
01:13:59.750 --> 01:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
numerous testimony
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:07.490 --> 01:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that
 
01:14:10.490 --> 01:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
a lot of those individuals if unless
 
01:14:12.890 --> 01:14:12.900 align:start position:0%
they can pay out of pocket will not get
 
01:14:15.290 --> 01:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
the services they need or we'll have to
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
travel to another state that offers that
 
01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:18.470 align:start position:0%
travel to another state that offers that
service

01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
and it's also sorry interrupt I I
 
01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
neglect to get a second somebody second
 
01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:24.229 align:start position:0%
neglect to get a second somebody second
that

01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
really okay thank you sorry continue and
 
01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:28.910 align:start position:0%
really okay thank you sorry continue and
it's

01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:30.350 align:start position:0%
it's
also

01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:14:33.050 --> 01:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that we are losing a number
 
01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
of workers here in this state because of
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
that reason and they are leaving the
 
01:14:39.770 --> 01:14:39.780 align:start position:0%
state for that and
 
01:14:43.130 --> 01:14:43.140 align:start position:0%
in doing so leaves a hole in a very
 
01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
important service to a number of
 
01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
individuals including our veterans okay
 
01:14:50.209 --> 01:14:50.219 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else represent Wilhelm
 
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I I find it really
 
01:14:56.090 --> 01:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
troubling that in the middle of a mental
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
health crisis in our state we would not
 
01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:00.970 align:start position:0%
health crisis in our state we would not
recognize

01:15:00.970 --> 01:15:00.980 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
uh qualified therapists uh who can help
 
01:15:09.229 --> 01:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
in a different way to increase access to
 
01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
resources to a whole variety of folks
 
01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
that need it whether we're talking about
 
01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
veterans whether we're talking about
 
01:15:16.010 --> 01:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
young people whether we're talking about
 
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
Hospice Care
 
01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
um I I just find it uh really uh sad to
 
01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:25.370 align:start position:0%
um I I just find it uh really uh sad to
to

01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
think that not increasing the number of
 
01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:31.010 align:start position:0%
think that not increasing the number of
professionals

01:15:31.010 --> 01:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
um you know knowing that sixty percent
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
of uh therapists live who who are
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
qualified in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
are leaving the state uh to provide
 
01:15:45.530 --> 01:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
therapy that's a lack of therapeutic
 
01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:46.669 align:start position:0%
therapy that's a lack of therapeutic
resources

01:15:46.669 --> 01:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh that could be in the state of New
 
01:15:50.209 --> 01:15:50.219 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's that's leaving the
 
01:15:51.890 --> 01:15:51.900 align:start position:0%
state every day
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
um and so I'll be voting against the
 
01:15:54.890 --> 01:15:54.900 align:start position:0%
ideal motion all right thank you and I
 
01:15:57.290 --> 01:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
just want to make clear that I mean my
 
01:16:01.130 --> 01:16:01.140 align:start position:0%
position is in no way an indication that
 
01:16:03.410 --> 01:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
I don't think music therapy can be
 
01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:05.090 align:start position:0%
I don't think music therapy can be
valuable

01:16:05.090 --> 01:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
valuable
 
01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:05.689 align:start position:0%
valuable
um

01:16:05.689 --> 01:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:07.370 --> 01:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
but I would explain my reason I don't
 
01:16:10.910 --> 01:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
I too find it puzzling and not just in
 
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
this case but we've heard dozens of
 
01:16:17.209 --> 01:16:17.219 align:start position:0%
these things that we need a license to
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
get reimbursed it seems like at some
 
01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
point we should be following that up to
 
01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
what causes that and make it stop
 
01:16:26.209 --> 01:16:26.219 align:start position:0%
I I agree
 
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure you turn
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
um we're not at this point actually if
 
01:16:31.729 --> 01:16:31.739 align:start position:0%
you turn the mic off and thank you for
 
01:16:31.739 --> 01:16:33.950 align:start position:0%
you turn the mic off and thank you for
Testimony

01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
Testimony
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
um yeah representative Wilhelm thank you
 
01:16:39.169 --> 01:16:39.179 align:start position:0%
chairman you know I guess without some
 
01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
sort of other mechanism to
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
you know it's like we're we're working
 
01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
within the system that is and so uh you
 
01:16:49.729 --> 01:16:49.739 align:start position:0%
know just another reason why I'm gonna
 
01:16:52.010 --> 01:16:52.020 align:start position:0%
post the idea I understand certainly
 
01:16:54.830 --> 01:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:56.810 --> 01:16:56.820 align:start position:0%
um representative a bear
 
01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my question to one
 
01:17:02.450 --> 01:17:02.460 align:start position:0%
of my colleagues questions is is is
 
01:17:06.970 --> 01:17:06.980 align:start position:0%
there anything on the horizon to
 
01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
to be able to accept insurance through
 
01:17:12.169 --> 01:17:12.179 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
legislature I'll give you my answer and
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
if anybody else has more and that is I
 
01:17:20.090 --> 01:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
I mean in in theory uh you know we
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
regulate insurance companies and we
 
01:17:24.530 --> 01:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
could do something about that maybe
 
01:17:26.450 --> 01:17:26.460 align:start position:0%
uh say they had to require it not just
 
01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
for someone's license but maybe if they
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
had nationally certified uh sort of
 
01:17:32.570 --> 01:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
recognized certification
 
01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
um however I and the legislature don't
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
have a lot of influence on the federal
 
01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
government and they're an issue as well
 
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
a representative Schmidt
 
01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:48.060 align:start position:0%
I think one of the reasons that uh
 
01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
you have to have a license in order to
 
01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:54.060 align:start position:0%
get paid by the insurance companies so
 
01:17:56.090 --> 01:17:56.100 align:start position:0%
that you get people who are actually
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
trained and qualified because it is a
 
01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:01.270 align:start position:0%
trained and qualified because it is a
profession

01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
profession
 
01:18:05.149 --> 01:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
they won't pay just like if you've got a
 
01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
Doctor Who's got all the training in the
 
01:18:09.649 --> 01:18:09.659 align:start position:0%
world but he's had his or her license
 
01:18:13.970 --> 01:18:13.980 align:start position:0%
revoked for moral turpitude
 
01:18:16.189 --> 01:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
financial fraud or whatever I think we
 
01:18:18.649 --> 01:18:18.659 align:start position:0%
got the idea and I I understand that um
 
01:18:20.689 --> 01:18:20.699 align:start position:0%
I mean there are ways other than
 
01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
um licensing to deal with it so
 
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know is there anybody have
 
01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
anything else I think it's we need to
 
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
move on if that's all right because we
 
01:18:31.970 --> 01:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
have other things to deal with
 
01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
okay so uh representative goalie
 
01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
no representative Wilhelm no represent
 
01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:41.270 align:start position:0%
no representative Wilhelm no represent
Bailey

01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:44.930 --> 01:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
representative a bearer no and uh I vote
 
01:18:46.490 --> 01:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
no so that's
 
01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
three to two
 
01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
um we've adopted the itl and and I
 
01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
understand others disagree and I
 
01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:55.140 align:start position:0%
understand the reasons why and
 
01:18:55.140 --> 01:18:56.270 align:start position:0%
understand the reasons why and
um

01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:59.930 --> 01:18:59.940 align:start position:0%
we can what happens
 
01:19:02.810 --> 01:19:02.820 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry you voted no on the ITIL I
 
01:19:05.090 --> 01:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
am just confused sorry
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
it's that you had itl no no no all that
 
01:19:12.890 --> 01:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
okay all right so the motion fails let's
 
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
find anyone might make another motion
 
01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:17.510 align:start position:0%
find anyone might make another motion
yeah

01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman I I'd like to uh
 
01:19:23.810 --> 01:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
introduce Amendment uh zero four
 
01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:28.790 align:start position:0%
 
second

01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:31.010 align:start position:0%
second
okay

01:19:31.010 --> 01:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:37.090 --> 01:19:37.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:38.630 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:40.189 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:19:40.189 --> 01:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
representative grotta if that's if this
 
01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
is the amendment you came up with if you
 
01:19:45.169 --> 01:19:45.179 align:start position:0%
can kind of give a little more of an
 
01:19:46.729 --> 01:19:46.739 align:start position:0%
overview of just of course thank you
 
01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
this um this amendment was submitted by
 
01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:50.209 align:start position:0%
this um this amendment was submitted by
both

01:19:50.209 --> 01:19:50.219 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:19:53.810 --> 01:19:53.820 align:start position:0%
um Asha which is the speech pathologist
 
01:19:57.110 --> 01:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
group and the music therapist and it was
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
there um
 
01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
and they both support this amendment and
 
01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:03.420 align:start position:0%
it does talk about
 
01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
um the different delineations between
 
01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
the two professions and where they work
 
01:20:13.130 --> 01:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
together so it's it's it is a it was the
 
01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
first time actually that we've had this
 
01:20:17.450 --> 01:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
Clarity between the two professional
 
01:20:19.490 --> 01:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
groups and so I I hope that the
 
01:20:21.890 --> 01:20:21.900 align:start position:0%
committee will adopt it because it is
 
01:20:24.250 --> 01:20:24.260 align:start position:0%
important thank you
 
01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:27.300 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:20:33.410 --> 01:20:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:35.810 --> 01:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
let me tell you where it yeah how does
 
01:20:36.890 --> 01:20:36.900 align:start position:0%
it differ
 
01:20:38.630 --> 01:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
um you know I mean not and it doesn't
 
01:20:40.010 --> 01:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
have to be an enormous detail but some
 
01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
idea I can tell you where there it takes
 
01:20:46.970 --> 01:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
the the current bill thing
 
01:20:50.090 --> 01:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
so it takes the current bill and adds
 
01:20:51.770 --> 01:20:51.780 align:start position:0%
section three
 
01:20:54.490 --> 01:20:54.500 align:start position:0%
where it says um
 
01:20:57.050 --> 01:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
collaborating with the individualized
 
01:20:59.149 --> 01:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
family services where is this I'm so
 
01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
sorry it's line

um

01:21:40.010 --> 01:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:42.590 --> 01:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
you know maybe has either on their own
 
01:21:44.689 --> 01:21:44.699 align:start position:0%
starting new or they've had music
 
01:21:47.149 --> 01:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
therapy in the past and they want to see
 
01:21:49.250 --> 01:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
a music therapist and you know however
 
01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
it's going to be paid for would this
 
01:21:53.570 --> 01:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
require would this prevent them from
 
01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
doing that if they don't have a
 
01:21:59.570 --> 01:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
no it's only if they had this was the
 
01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
issue oh there's an or yes exactly and
 
01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
this was one of the issues that we had
 
01:22:08.450 --> 01:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
come across in previous in the previous
 
01:22:11.450 --> 01:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
bills was because there were there was
 
01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:12.470 align:start position:0%
bills was because there were there was
no

01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:22:15.229 --> 01:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
statement as to how these would they
 
01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
would interweave during in these
 
01:22:19.490 --> 01:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
positions where there was a treatment
 
01:22:22.970 --> 01:22:22.980 align:start position:0%
team this is new language to the
 
01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:23.770 align:start position:0%
team this is new language to the
um

01:22:23.770 --> 01:22:23.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
I just caught the ore which takes okay
 
01:22:29.209 --> 01:22:29.219 align:start position:0%
sorry I just don't didn't want that to
 
01:22:32.330 --> 01:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
be a requirement in all cases correct
 
01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:35.330 align:start position:0%
be a requirement in all cases correct
and

01:22:35.330 --> 01:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
and this and the rest and this the
 
01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
change to RSA 360 but that change about
 
01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
um not representing the public is that
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
the same basically yes
 
01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:47.510 align:start position:0%
the same basically yes
okay

01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
those are the only changes really that
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
were made um
 
01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:54.360 --> 01:23:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
line

01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:07.610 --> 01:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
all right actually I'm fine with it and
 
01:23:09.169 --> 01:23:09.179 align:start position:0%
uh I mean I intend to vote for the
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
amendment whatever I think of the
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
underlying bill I think this you know
 
01:23:14.870 --> 01:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
is a good change in case the bill does
 
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
pass so
 
01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
right any other discussion well the
 
01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
thing is that there was always objection
 
01:23:24.169 --> 01:23:24.179 align:start position:0%
an opposition as you know from speech
 
01:23:26.270 --> 01:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
pathologist because it's kind of like
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
you're doing this no we're not yes you
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
are I understand conflict of scope of
 
01:23:34.370 --> 01:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
practice Yeah
 
01:23:37.149 --> 01:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative a bear
 
01:23:40.970 --> 01:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:23:43.729 --> 01:23:43.739 align:start position:0%
um I am planning on supporting this for
 
01:23:45.770 --> 01:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
a couple of reasons but I I want to be
 
01:23:48.050 --> 01:23:48.060 align:start position:0%
on record for why I'm rep why I'm
 
01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
supporting it
 
01:23:51.950 --> 01:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
um so number one you know most people
 
01:23:53.870 --> 01:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
don't come in and ask to be licensed
 
01:23:56.689 --> 01:23:56.699 align:start position:0%
they ask to not be licensed
 
01:23:56.699 --> 01:23:58.010 align:start position:0%
they ask to not be licensed
um

01:23:58.010 --> 01:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
what I mean is by regulated more
 
01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
regulation more we want less regulation
 
01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
than more right I think the experience
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
of the committee is that most licenses
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
come about because the people in the
 
01:24:13.130 --> 01:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
profession has to be licensed okay
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the correction no no at
 
01:24:17.810 --> 01:24:17.820 align:start position:0%
least not all I would say lately we've
 
01:24:20.930 --> 01:24:20.940 align:start position:0%
had a good number of releasing the
 
01:24:23.689 --> 01:24:23.699 align:start position:0%
licensing or really look at the hair
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
blowing thing and the you know and the
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
let's read let's get rid of licenses all
 
01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
together I get that you know but but I
 
01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
think a new license is at least as long
 
01:24:34.189 --> 01:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
I haven't been here as long as others
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
but from what I've seen for new ones
 
01:24:37.850 --> 01:24:37.860 align:start position:0%
that tends to be people in the business
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
coming in looking for it
 
01:24:44.030 --> 01:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm I'm wrong but anyway sorry
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:24:51.890 --> 01:24:51.900 align:start position:0%
I I am pro-business I I agree with that
 
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
I agree with one of my colleagues
 
01:24:56.930 --> 01:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
regarding mental health if it helps
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
um and this does not hit our taxpayers
 
01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
because you would be paying the
 
01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
licensing fees as a business
 
01:25:05.330 --> 01:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
so I am
 
01:25:07.970 --> 01:25:07.980 align:start position:0%
um for Less taxes
 
01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
um so pro-business less taxes and
 
01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
um freedom to want to do this is why I
 
01:25:19.550 --> 01:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
will support this thank you okay thank
 
01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
you anyone else
 
01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:22.910 align:start position:0%
you anyone else
okay

01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
um so the motion
 
01:25:27.890 --> 01:25:27.900 align:start position:0%
yes sir I just wanted to say I I think
 
01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
this amendment represents a a real big
 
01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
step forward given the uh the agreement
 
01:25:40.130 --> 01:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
um you know between other providers and
 
01:25:44.090 --> 01:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
music therapists and I agree and um
 
01:25:46.610 --> 01:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
I mean I know were you the one who was
 
01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
involved in negotiating this deal with
 
01:25:48.239 --> 01:25:50.390 align:start position:0%
involved in negotiating this deal with
them

01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:25:54.110 --> 01:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:57.050 --> 01:25:57.060 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's uh that's laudable
 
01:25:59.870 --> 01:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
certainly yes and I guess just to wrap
 
01:26:02.330 --> 01:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
up my point it's it what it says is
 
01:26:04.610 --> 01:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
there's a need for more
 
01:26:08.149 --> 01:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
licensed therapists and I think given
 
01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
everything that we're dealing with with
 
01:26:11.330 --> 01:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
the Mental Health crisis I I think this
 
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
is a big step in the right direction all
 
01:26:15.169 --> 01:26:15.179 align:start position:0%
right that's fine
 
01:26:16.490 --> 01:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
um if you know are there any other
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
comments I don't wanna all right so um
 
01:26:21.649 --> 01:26:21.659 align:start position:0%
we're voting on whether or not to adopt
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh zero four eight zero h
 
01:26:28.370 --> 01:26:28.380 align:start position:0%
