00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:01.839 align:start position:0%
purposes so that that was a great
 
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
commitment on his part
 
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
and in that was about 1.2 million
 
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
dollars for electric
 
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
school buses
 
00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 align:start position:0%
a few years back
 
00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
we tried to issue an rfp uh covet hit
 
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
and other things intervened and it just
 
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
didn't work out so well and then des
 
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
decided to focus primarily on putting
 
00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
out the
 
00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:26.150 align:start position:0%
out the
rfp

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
rfp
 
00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 align:start position:0%
for the charging on the travel
 
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
corridors which is a prime
 
00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 align:start position:0%
recommendation that came out of the
 
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle infrastructure
 
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
commission that we had for a couple of
 
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.790 align:start position:0%
commission that we had for a couple of
years

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
so now it's time to come back to this
 
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
using this funding that we have from the
 
00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
volkswagen settlement for
 
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
the electric school bus pilot program
 
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
but in a way it's serendipity because
 
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
some things have changed
 
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
the buses themselves have matured and
 
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
then also this vehicle vehicle-to-grid
 
00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
technology has become something that
 
00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
really can be seen as a way to monetize
 
00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 align:start position:0%
the size of the batteries in these
 
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
vehicles and make some money potentially
 
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.190 align:start position:0%
vehicles and make some money potentially
for

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
school school districts by doing that
 
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
and i'll explain that in a little bit
 
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.350 align:start position:0%
and i'll explain that in a little bit
later

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
later
 
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
on the other thing that's happened is
 
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
that we're getting more money for
 
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle
 
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
charging infrastructure there's 17
 
00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 align:start position:0%
million dollars in
 
00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:20.710 align:start position:0%
million dollars in
the

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
the transportation bill that's coming to
 
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
the state for electric vehicle charging
 
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.469 align:start position:0%
the state for electric vehicle charging
infrastructure

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
and then also there's a two and a half
 
00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 align:start position:0%
to five billion dollar grant program
 
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
that is in the infrastructure bill and
 
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to apply
 
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh for those funds uh and that can
 
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
include uh particularly money designated
 
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.710 align:start position:0%
include uh particularly money designated
for

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
electric buses so that puts us in a good
 
00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 align:start position:0%
shape now to use the funding that we
 
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
have for an electric
 
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
school bus pilot program
 
00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 align:start position:0%
conversations on the bill that we know
 
00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 align:start position:0%
that des has the money it is going to
 
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
move forward so the point of this bill
 
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
right do it efficiently to take
 
00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 align:start position:0%
advantage of the vehicle to grid
 
00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 align:start position:0%
technology and i i think you know truly
 
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
set us up to save a lot of money for
 
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.309 align:start position:0%
set us up to save a lot of money for
local

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
local
 
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
school districts as they transition
 
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
their fleet to
 
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
electric school buses
 
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
right now across the country and you can
 
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
go online i sent you a
 
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
link to some presentations um the
 
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
jessica wilcox of you know new hampshire
 
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
des clean energy uh and others gave
 
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
about electric school bus programs um
 
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
recently over in vermont but doesn't
 
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
you'll find a lot of information out
 
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.790 align:start position:0%
you'll find a lot of information out
there

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
about them they're about 1 500 on on
 
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
order or in
 
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.030 align:start position:0%
order or in
service

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.790 align:start position:0%
service
many

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
many
 
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
communities including boston have
 
00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
committed to transitioning their fleets
 
00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.589 align:start position:0%
committed to transitioning their fleets
eventually

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
eventually
 
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
entirely to electric
 
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
school buses
 
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
blue bird
 
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
just had its largest order and
 
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
anticipated saving a lot of money for
 
00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 align:start position:0%
the school district that
 
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
that ordered them there are pilot
 
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
programs in other
 
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
other states as well very similar to
 
00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 align:start position:0%
this massachusetts has a couple
 
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
communities in their pilot program that
 
00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
have their
 
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
their buses um so we have a lot we can
 
00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
we can learn from that so let me turn to
 
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
the bill mr chairman um
 
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
there is a variety of definitions here
 
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
as as one would need for
 
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
a program with electric school bus pilot
 
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
program i'll point to lines 11 uh
 
00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
starting line 11 on the
 
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
first page here
 
00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
this notion of incremental cost because
 
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
here's here's the uh kind of true
 
00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
here's the way we're going to use this
 
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh volkswagen settlement
 
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
and other funding um currently
 
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
a bus
 
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
conventionally fueled diesel bus might
 
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.949 align:start position:0%
conventionally fueled diesel bus might
cost

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
i know a couple hundred thousand dollars
 
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
you know you see a lot of different
 
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
prices depending on the size and and so
 
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
forth uh whereas an electric
 
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
um school bus might be a couple hundred
 
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars more i mean that cost
 
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
differential is coming down but um like
 
00:03:59.429 --> 00:03:59.439 align:start position:0%
a bluebird 84-seater it might be that
 
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
kind of incremental cost
 
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
difference and that's the cost that the
 
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.190 align:start position:0%
difference and that's the cost that the
bill

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
will cover
 
00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
grant funding
 
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
then the other thing the bill does is
 
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
this definitions of the vehicle to grid
 
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
and interconnection facilities
 
00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
because now the bus is paid for
 
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
the electric utility can come in do the
 
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
make ready work to get the charging in
 
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.030 align:start position:0%
make ready work to get the charging in
there

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
through the mouse that will be developed
 
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
that the capacity to use these batteries
 
00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
as storage can be monetized
 
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
so they're large batteries
 
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
they sit most of the
 
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
most of the evening in the lot or in a
 
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
lot of the summer
 
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
so they can be charged up
 
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
when the electricity is cheap
 
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
and then when peak comes at the uh you
 
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
know the end of the day
 
00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
that power can go back into the grid
 
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
and so it can save the utilities from
 
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
having to
 
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
pay expensive for expensive power during
 
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
peak demand
 
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.310 align:start position:0%
peak demand
and

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
that's something that could be monetized
 
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
so that the school district can receive
 
00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
some some payment for that i think we're
 
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
going to hear more about vehicle-to-grid
 
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire
 
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
electric electric co-op which is kind of
 
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
pioneering in the states some of this
 
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
technology but this is this is what
 
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
other school districts are doing
 
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
i'll say you know maryland baltimore
 
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
county uh has just started 150 million
 
00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
dollars of these buses and this vehicle
 
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
to grid technology is at the at the
 
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
center of why that order is going
 
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
through and how they figure they're
 
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
going to save um quite a bit of money
 
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.310 align:start position:0%
going to save um quite a bit of money
so

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
after the definitions on page two you'll
 
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.390 align:start position:0%
after the definitions on page two you'll
see

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:45.759 align:start position:0%
what we do the department of
 
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
environmental services
 
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
can take that volkswagen mitigation
 
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
trust fund and other federal funding
 
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
that comes in through those grant
 
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
programs to create and administer
 
00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 align:start position:0%
the program i'll put out an rfp as
 
00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.270 align:start position:0%
the program i'll put out an rfp as
you'll

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
you'll
 
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
see and then on line eight there here's
 
00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
the amount of funding that's available
 
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
to offset the intermittent cost so this
 
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
is what the grant
 
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
um will do is it'll cover that integra
 
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.309 align:start position:0%
um will do is it'll cover that integra
incremental

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
incremental
 
00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:13.990 align:start position:0%
incremental
cost

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
um and what this will do for schools
 
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's not just that i think that you
 
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
know these these are great vehicles
 
00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:21.759 align:start position:0%
they're going to save money but also
 
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
let's talk about children's health um
 
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
that diesel
 
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
fine particulate matter
 
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
particles we know are one of the you
 
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.790 align:start position:0%
particles we know are one of the you
know

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
very very deleterious particularly on
 
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
children's lungs in terms of asthma and
 
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
other damaging diseases
 
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
and studies show that the
 
00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
level of those fumes is about twice as
 
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
high inside the bus
 
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
as outside the bus
 
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
so this is and there's no idling either
 
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
you know you see the line of school
 
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
buses outside the school idling and that
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
that electric school buses don't sit
 
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
there and idle so that is an ancillary
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
benefit for for sure in terms of um
 
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
children's help so the qualifying uh
 
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
program pilot um
 
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
will allow uh proposals by the group
 
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
that you
 
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
see here um i have an amendment for you
 
00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:15.759 align:start position:0%
um it was pointed out we we need to
 
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
change line 13
 
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
line a
 
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
qualities because that's the definition
 
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
of let new hampshire electric co-op it's
 
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
not investor owned it's a co-op
 
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't go through the puc so
 
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
that change in definition would mean
 
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
that they could participate in the
 
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
program as well as eversource and and
 
00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
unitil liberty the others who have
 
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
expressed their interest in it is as
 
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.510 align:start position:0%
expressed their interest in it is as
well

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.950 align:start position:0%
well
um

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
so then uh here's the um
 
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
what the mou
 
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
would need to do
 
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
and i think it's important starting on
 
00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
20 because here's the agreement that
 
00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
will empower
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
the school districts to monetize this
 
00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
and to to make some money so
 
00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
the local electric utility to access and
 
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
utilize the energy stored in the
 
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
batteries um at times when such action
 
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
is necessary to meet current power
 
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
demand or when utilized the energy and
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
the stored batteries can lower the cost
 
00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:23.919 align:start position:0%
of supplying power to customers
 
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
um provided that the school district
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
determines they're not needed at those
 
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
hours at which the power might uh be be
 
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.589 align:start position:0%
hours at which the power might uh be be
drawn

00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
drawn
 
00:08:31.599 --> 00:08:32.630 align:start position:0%
drawn
um

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
then you'll see in line 26 uh as is done
 
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
in other states and you know eversource
 
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
this is kind of the usual boilerplate um
 
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
after review from the department of
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
energy um the cost to utility for the
 
00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:46.959 align:start position:0%
make ready transmission or distribution
 
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
to a facility
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
that's important because the make radio
 
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
costs uh some money to bring the the
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
power lines in there
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
for the charging
 
00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
um charging stations and
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
if we don't do the cost recovery there
 
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:04.240 align:start position:0%
it means we have much less funding to
 
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
spend on the buses themselves
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
and that's a good investment for the
 
00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:10.959 align:start position:0%
future of course too because as the
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
fleet slowly transitions to more and
 
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
more electric you've got the charging
 
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure there so you've made that
 
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
base investment already
 
00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:20.959 align:start position:0%
and then i just another thing that came
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
out very importantly
 
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
in the senate
 
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
hearing on this is starting on lines 31.
 
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
you go out on
 
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
online and you're going to find concerns
 
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.470 align:start position:0%
online and you're going to find concerns
about

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.269 align:start position:0%
about
well

00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
you know what happens with these buses
 
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
in the winter can they keep warm
 
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
or not and
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
does it reduce the battery range
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
to the point that that creates a problem
 
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
will the students be kept warm enough
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
and so that's why
 
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
we put the lines in here that not only
 
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
does it have to comply with the
 
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations the national
 
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
transportation safety board as all
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
school buses have to do
 
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
but also provide for adequate interior
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
heat for winter
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
operations now i've got an electric car
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
and it's clear when it you know on a
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
standard 20 below zero the battery range
 
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
goes down
 
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
one way that the electric vehicle
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturers are dealing with this is
 
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
that instead of using a heating element
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
as in a conventional vehicle
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
that heats up draws a lot of juice to
 
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
heat the car they're moving to heat
 
00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.190 align:start position:0%
heat the car they're moving to heat
pumps

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
pumps
 
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
and heat pumps draw a lot less
 
00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.350 align:start position:0%
and heat pumps draw a lot less
electricity

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
but the point here the mou you'd have to
 
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
you know ensure
 
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:10:37.509 --> 00:10:37.519 align:start position:0%
supplier that you're buying the
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
vehicles from and i'm actually the
 
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
bluebird cummings which is the largest
 
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:41.910 align:start position:0%
bluebird cummings which is the largest
diesel

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
diesel
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturer in the country for diesel
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
engines is committed to going
 
00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
all-electric for its manufacturing and
 
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
it is it is providing the electric um
 
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
engines for these these buses so they
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
it's coming as a great company if you
 
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
know and they and uh
 
00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
mac and peterbilt and the other
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
companies that make heavy diesel engines
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
are all going all electric so they're
 
00:11:03.509 --> 00:11:03.519 align:start position:0%
you know the technology is going to
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
going to be good here if an average
 
00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
school bus maybe maybe does 120 miles a
 
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.069 align:start position:0%
school bus maybe maybe does 120 miles a
day

00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
um the range here is 100 you know can be
 
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
150 180 miles on a charge uh of course
 
00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
you can top off the charge during the
 
00:11:18.079 --> 00:11:18.790 align:start position:0%
you can top off the charge during the
day

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of you know and you would
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
determine which school bus is going out
 
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
when and and so on so that's how that
 
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
gets dealt with i thought it was
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
important to point that out because you
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
know that's a concern you'll find that
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
in the internet and so on um
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
and then the rest of the bill
 
00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
kind of um talks about data and analysis
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
importantly again costs and benefits and
 
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
costs of the pallet program is it
 
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
working right you know because the money
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
actually being saved are the buses
 
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
functioning the way they're supposed to
 
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
do that's why you do pilot programs
 
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.509 align:start position:0%
do that's why you do pilot programs
right

00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
um and so they'll be reporting as you'll
 
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
see on page three
 
00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
um the costs and benefits uh auto
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
language here um senator birdsall was
 
00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.629 align:start position:0%
language here um senator birdsall was
particularly

00:11:58.629 --> 00:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
00:12:00.389 --> 00:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
interested in here and you know how is
 
00:12:02.069 --> 00:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
the vehicle to grid technology working
 
00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:03.519 align:start position:0%
out you'll see that on line eight on
 
00:12:03.519 --> 00:12:04.790 align:start position:0%
out you'll see that on line eight on
page

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.670 align:start position:0%
page
three

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
and uh then
 
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know this the get a successful grant
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
epa funding it'll be a new rfp so that
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
we give new people an opportunity to
 
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
compete for whatever funding we get um
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
beyond what is authorized in the first
 
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.550 align:start position:0%
beyond what is authorized in the first
rfp

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
rfp
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
so mr chairman
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
there it is
 
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
i'd be glad to take any questions before
 
00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.389 align:start position:0%
i'd be glad to take any questions before
i

00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
head off to another bill introduction
 
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
thank you senator any questions from the
 
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
committee representative talersky thank
 
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
you thank you senator for taking my
 
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
question thanks for being here um this
 
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
is really exciting
 
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
um possibility that uh we can consider i
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
am curious is there any idea of how many
 
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
buses will actually fit into this
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
initial pilot program or how many
 
00:12:59.829 --> 00:12:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
well you know we have in hand the 1.1 or
 
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
1.2 million
 
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.710 align:start position:0%
1.2 million
um

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
if the incremental cost is a couple
 
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand
 
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
so maybe we can do six yeah um but
 
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
you know that other money that other
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
that that two and a half to five billion
 
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
dollars is is going to flow they're
 
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
writing their rules and regulations on
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
it now in washington at some point
 
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
they'll be
 
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
what you can re request so um
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
my my feeling is that you know that's a
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
good start and although the pilot
 
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
program you know we'll see how do these
 
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
work yeah what kind of mu now there
 
00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:35.839 align:start position:0%
there are several school districts that
 
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
are quite interested
 
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
in this um i don't know if you have any
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
communication from over here from from
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
today but uh the house
 
00:13:44.399 --> 00:13:46.310 align:start position:0%
today but uh the house
nashua

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
uh manchester i think we're going to
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
hear from some communities up north in
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
the electric new hampshire electric
 
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
co-op that they're interested in doing
 
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
this so i think we'll have people lining
 
00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.110 align:start position:0%
this so i think we'll have people lining
up

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
for this rfp
 
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.829 align:start position:0%
for this rfp
thank

00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:14:02.949 --> 00:14:02.959 align:start position:0%
you and thanks for your question
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
representative o'hara thank you mr
 
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you senator for taking my
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
question i know you're really busy today
 
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know i don't mean i'm sorry i
 
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
shouldn't even mention it i'm happy to
 
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
answer questions um so the cost for the
 
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
department of energy additional
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
employees is that covered under the vw
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
trust and federal grants as well
 
00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:21.189 align:start position:0%
trust and federal grants as well
um

00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
i think it's there's a line in here i
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
don't know if i can find it right away
 
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh that says that
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
the des costs
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
yeah you see online three
 
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
page two
 
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of funding and
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
administering this program
 
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
and um becky owers
 
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:52.790 align:start position:0%
and um becky owers
here

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
from des you can talk about that there's
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
going to be maintenance involved in in
 
00:14:59.110 --> 00:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
some of these buses and i'm assuming the
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
school districts would be responsible
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
for that or maybe that's covered
 
00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.430 align:start position:0%
for that or maybe that's covered
under

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
this initial
 
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
pilot program funding but i'm also
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
curious about the
 
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.949 align:start position:0%
curious about the
storage

00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
storage
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
using the batteries for storage during
 
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
that time who pays who pays for that
 
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
electricity to uh to go into those
 
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
storage batteries
 
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
and how is that
 
00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
apportioned if for some reason the
 
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
school department wants to use it during
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
that time period that it's full versus
 
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
just using it for
 
00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:35.839 align:start position:0%
for storage how is how does that system
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks for the thanks for your
 
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
question and you know it's just it's a
 
00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
it's really fascinating how you know
 
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
we're moving into the ear of uh just you
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
know changing distribute energy
 
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
distribution right and these these kind
 
00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:49.759 align:start position:0%
of local arrangements we you know we
 
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
have community
 
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
aggregation now
 
00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
um we have net metering we have all
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
kinds of ways and you know schools are
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
putting solar on their roofs and
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
and so on and so that's the point of the
 
00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.829 align:start position:0%
and so on and so that's the point of the
mou

00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:01.839 align:start position:0%
mou
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
because that's where you figure that out
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
that you know um it's it's gonna be a
 
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
meter and the meter reads both ways
 
00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
power coming in power coming out and the
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
idea is you're putting cheap power in
 
00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
and then selling more expensive power
 
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
back to the
 
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
back to the grid so it's a question of
 
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.230 align:start position:0%
back to the grid so it's a question of
metering

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
metering
 
00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:19.839 align:start position:0%
and i would think that if the school
 
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
decides if they're in a community
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
aggregation situation which you know we
 
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
passed that last year it's getting
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
implemented a bunch of communities have
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
signed up for it
 
00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
that i would think this would be a
 
00:16:29.839 --> 00:16:30.870 align:start position:0%
that i would think this would be a
suitable

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
suitable
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
qualifier under under that so that you
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
get to use the power that's in community
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
aggregation locally and
 
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
and you can save the power for your
 
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.949 align:start position:0%
and you can save the power for your
community

00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:40.959 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
it's a pilot program i mean these are
 
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
these are you know great questions and
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
this whole landscape is kind of changing
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
about vehicle to grid and we're learning
 
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
from a lot of other places so the mou
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
and the pilot program and that's why the
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
reporting is saying how is that working
 
00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
how is it working financially um and
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
again i from what i've seen from other
 
00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.310 align:start position:0%
again i from what i've seen from other
communities

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
is that this can be a
 
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
an income stream
 
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
now for the maintenance thing the way
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
the mou's have also been set up is to
 
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
say that
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
the you know the winner of the rfp
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
has to provide the training
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
on the vehicle to grid the electrical
 
00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
things and any necessary training on the
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle maintenance um but let us note
 
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.150 align:start position:0%
vehicle maintenance um but let us note
that

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons you know my best move
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
that's the california i just saw a
 
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
recent report they're figuring they're
 
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
gonna save like three hundred thousand
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
not just with fuel we'll get to look at
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
the price of diesel today right versus
 
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
the price the price of what you'd get
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
for you know per gallon equivalent of
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
the energy you're putting in i'll tell
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
you in my car you know gas is what i saw
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
like 395 410 on the way over here i'm
 
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
paying about a dollar or 10 or dollar 20
 
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
of a gallon gas equivalent when i charge
 
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
up so if you're charging charging up the
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
cheap you're gonna you're saving money
 
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
there but the maintenance costs right no
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
there's no fluids
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay there's no there's no um muffler
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
system um the
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
there's there's
 
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't know what it takes in one
 
00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.150 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't know what it takes in one
of

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
these um
 
00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
one of these uh engines and there then
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
there is in a conventionally fueled
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
vehicle so the maintenance cost is one
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
big kind of cost savings area of this
 
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
yep follow-up
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you i um
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering too whether
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
the areas that you've talked about that
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
have these programs in place has any
 
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
gone full cycle meaning that they've had
 
00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.510 align:start position:0%
gone full cycle meaning that they've had
to

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.110 align:start position:0%
to
replace

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
replace
 
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
batteries or or engines or anything like
 
00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.029 align:start position:0%
batteries or or engines or anything like
that

00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
or are we still in that first
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
initial phase when you're using
 
00:18:51.679 --> 00:18:53.029 align:start position:0%
initial phase when you're using
the

00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
equipment that comes with it thanks for
 
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
your question i'm not aware of any
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
in north america um
 
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
because you know these buses last for a
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
long time
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
i mean i've been reading lately they've
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
seen some of these battery packs my last
 
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
500 000 miles you know um you know the
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
epa said you got to put a radio on so
 
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
i've said 100 000 miles but the
 
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
experience is that they're lasting for a
 
00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.350 align:start position:0%
experience is that they're lasting for a
lot

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
lot
 
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
longer now i know that these buses have
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
been running
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
overseas for a long time
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
10 15 years so i there may be there
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
but here um
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
you know the the 1500 vehicles on order
 
00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
are in service so it's relatively new um
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
lion which is one of the largest
 
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of diesel engines canadian
 
00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:37.919 align:start position:0%
company and buses
 
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
they've been deploying them up in canada
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
for a few years
 
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
it's relatively new still so we'll see
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
pilot program thank you we'll see
 
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
cnn thank you very much thank you so
 
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
much and i'll be seeing you a little bit
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
later won't i see you thanks again and
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
and if any other questions come up um in
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
subsequent testimony i'd be glad to
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
answer or anybody offline can please
 
00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
please be in touch thanks again thank
 
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
you chair recognizes griffin roberge
 
00:20:12.149 --> 00:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:19.029 --> 00:20:19.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman uh members of

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
is neutral on standard waters 417.
 
00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.430 align:start position:0%
is neutral on standard waters 417.
um

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
as amended by the senate the bill does
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
as senator water mentioned creates an
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
electric school bus pilot program to be
 
00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
administered by the department of
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
environmental services
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
however there are a few references to
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
the department of energy in the bill to
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
determine if a local electric utility
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
can access and utilize the energy stored
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
on these bus batteries
 
00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:54.799 align:start position:0%
to allow utility to recover reasonably
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
incurred costs in the pilot program
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
and require selected pilot applicants to
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
provide information data and analysis
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
that the department requires
 
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%
the department wanted to raise a few
 
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
technical concerns with the bill
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
specifically page 2
 
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.149 align:start position:0%
specifically page 2
lines

00:21:13.149 --> 00:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
lines
 
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
22 i'm sorry i should say lines 21-22
 
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
it indicates that the department must
 
00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
review and approve efforts
 
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
utility to access and utilize the energy
 
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
stored in electric school bus batteries
 
00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:43.039 align:start position:0%
quote at times when such action is
 
00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:45.919 align:start position:0%
necessary to meet current power demand
 
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
the department is unsure how it would
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
measure and quantify at what times it
 
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
would be suitable to meet current power
 
00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.710 align:start position:0%
would be suitable to meet current power
demand

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
demand
 
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
i think holistically how and when energy
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
use energy storage or electric school
 
00:22:00.149 --> 00:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
bus batteries for that matter utility
 
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
may following review by the department
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
recover costs for make-ready
 
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
transmission distribution to a facility
 
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
and other costs reasonably incurred in
 
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
support of the pilot program um the
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
language doesn't clearly specify who the
 
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
the costs from i think we would all
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
agree it might be from
 
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
a utility's customers but that's just
 
00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
not abundantly clear
 
00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
additionally the department
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
per the language of the bill would only
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
have review authority it would not have
 
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
approval authority
 
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
over the recovery of those costs
 
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
additionally the public utilities
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
commission maybe not the department may
 
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
be the more suitable body to fully
 
00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:54.559 align:start position:0%
review and approve the recovery of those
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
costs as the puc regularly does that
 
00:22:59.430 --> 00:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
through an adjudicative process and open
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
dockets and through a public process
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
so those are just a few technical
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
concerns that the department wanted to
 
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
raise on the bill
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
that really concludes my testimony and
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
uh happy to take any questions that the
 
00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:12.559 align:start position:0%
committee might have
 
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
were these issues brought up when this
 
00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
bill was still in the senate i have to
 
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
look back you have to forgive me me and
 
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
another staffer split responsibility
 
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
between the senate and the house i don't
 
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.669 align:start position:0%
between the senate and the house i don't
believe

00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
those concerns were specifically
 
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the hearing report
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
specifically brought up in the senate
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
but i would like the opportunity to just
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
double check with that staffer and make
 
00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:36.549 align:start position:0%
double check with that staffer and make
sure

00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.510 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.029 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.000 align:start position:0%

sorry about that is that better
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is michael akata
 
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
representing new hampshire electric
 
00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.390 align:start position:0%
representing new hampshire electric
co-op

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
co-op
 
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
we serve 85 000 members with electric
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
distribution service in 118 communities
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
across new hampshire
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
as the chair said in support of the bill
 
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
very much appreciate senator waters hard
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
this is an area that actually the co-op
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
has done quite a bit of work in
 
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
vehicle-to-grid charging
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
electric school buses we've had a number
 
00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
of conversations with school districts
 
00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
across our service territory as well as
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
bus distributors and vehicle-to-grid
 
00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.789 align:start position:0%
bus distributors and vehicle-to-grid
vendors

00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
vendors
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
this is an exciting area where
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
the batteries went idle could be used to
 
00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
export back to the grid which could be a
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
benefit to
 
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
all of our members by reducing uh
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
transmission and capacity charges that
 
00:25:16.149 --> 00:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
the co-op uh has to pay in order to
 
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
provide service to our members so
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
i'll be brief because i know senator
 
00:25:21.669 --> 00:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
waters covered quite a bit of this
 
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
ground and you have a full slate
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
but in support of the bill um
 
00:25:45.909 --> 00:25:45.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
representative hill
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
um can you comment on the
 
00:25:54.789 --> 00:25:54.799 align:start position:0%
the amount of infrastructure and or the
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
condition of the infrastructure
 
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
necessary to
 
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
to do more than just the pilot program
 
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
but to do
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
a fleet sure it it really is site
 
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
specific um
 
00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.230 align:start position:0%
specific um
so

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
every utility when
 
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.430 align:start position:0%
every utility when
um

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
additional development or a solar
 
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
project or if this was sort of
 
00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:18.559 align:start position:0%
large-scale charging
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
needs to do a review it's called an
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
interconnection study to determine
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
whether the local infrastructure can
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
accommodate that load and if not what
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
upgrades new transformers need to be
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
installed in order to accommodate it so
 
00:26:36.549 --> 00:26:36.559 align:start position:0%
it really is site-specific
 
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
that would be a study that would be done
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
um these would be significant
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
charges obviously school bus is a large
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle a fleet of vehicles would be
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
significant chargers
 
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
the chargers themselves
 
00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
the sort of fast chargers level three
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
and above
 
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:56.799 align:start position:0%
are you know significant pieces of
 
00:26:56.799 --> 00:26:58.789 align:start position:0%
are you know significant pieces of
infrastructure

00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
just ballpark in the range of you know
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
in excess of a hundred thousand dollars
 
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
but of course
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
you know there are different payment
 
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
structures to uh
 
00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.279 --> 00:27:14.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
is it safe to say
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:20.799 align:start position:0%
if with this pilot program we don't have
 
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
that infrastructure or would there be
 
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:24.799 align:start position:0%
needing to
 
00:27:27.909 --> 00:27:27.919 align:start position:0%
to expand the capacity now
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh it would really depend on the the
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
specific capacity of a line
 
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
what the bill contemplates in the pilot
 
00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
program contemplates is
 
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
funding to be made available to
 
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
support the purchase of the charging the
 
00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
chargers themselves the vehicle-to-grid
 
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
chargers themselves
 
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
as well as some of those additional
 
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
expenses so um there is capacity you
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
know obviously we're interconnecting
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
people every day um and interconnecting
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
solar facilities every day uh so it
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
really is site specific and utility
 
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.830 align:start position:0%
really is site specific and utility
specific

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
but i don't want to leave the impression
 
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
that we have a constrained system
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
because many areas can accommodate
 
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
without grid infrastructure i'd
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
recommend getting in touch with the
 
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
if this passes and is adopted if this
 
00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
amendment is adopted it'll still be
 
00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:31.039 align:start position:0%
returning for concurrence so there will
 
00:28:32.789 --> 00:28:32.799 align:start position:0%
be other opportunities just want to let
 
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
you know that we'll be acting on it
 
00:28:35.909 --> 00:28:35.919 align:start position:0%
today excellent thank you very much
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
thank you

and i should mention that as part of our
 
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
organization we founded and managed

granite state as well as to
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
increase the availability of the
 
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
charging infrastructure necessary for
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
these vehicles
 
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
so this issue is close to our mission
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
and we are excited to support the bill
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
because it is appropriately timed and
 
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
exceptionally well designed
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
there are several school districts in
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
new hampshire already very interested in
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
this to name two in particular
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
that are actively exploring that would
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
include the oyster
 
00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
river cooperative school district as
 
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
well as the national regional planning
 
00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:01.990 align:start position:0%
well as the national regional planning
commission

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
both of those entities are exploring
 
00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
electric school buses as we speak
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
it's important to mention that the
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
funding for this this pilot is already
 
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:12.559 align:start position:0%
available to us and here in new
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
hampshire there's a lot of funding
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
coming down from the federal level that
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
would support this as well
 
00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:20.799 align:start position:0%
and it's important to note that ev's
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
school buses provide an enormous cost
 
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
savings opportunity in the form of
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
lower maintenance costs as well as less
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
cost on the fuel side
 
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
they also provide an enormous air
 
00:30:34.149 --> 00:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
quality benefit to children
 
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
the amount of diesel emissions that
 
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
exist within school buses today is
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
detrimental and especially to asthma
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
rates so switching to evs would improve
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
that that air quality element
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
and as senator waters mentioned there
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
there has been some concerns expressed
 
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
on the senate side about these vehicles
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
keeping warm
 
00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
from experience i can say that they they
 
00:30:57.029 --> 00:30:57.039 align:start position:0%
do just fine
 
00:30:57.039 --> 00:31:01.350 align:start position:0%
do just fine
so

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
we are also in support of the
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
vehicle-to-grid technology that could
 
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
result as a result of this pilot program
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
this is an excellent way to further
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
study how ev school buses could be both
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
an asset to getting children to school
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
as well as to the grid and to provide
 
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
some support in times of high demand to
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
the electric grid
 
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
having these school buses charge up
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
overnight typically on a level two
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
charger so a charger that moves a little
 
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
more slowly and is a little more
 
00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.029 align:start position:0%
more slowly and is a little more
affordable

00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
affordable
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
could provide a benefit later in the day
 
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
when we reach a peak demand event and
 
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
that battery could be discharged to the
 
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
grid to reduce rates for customers in
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
general in a specific utilities
 
00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:41.919 align:start position:0%
district so
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
with that i would be glad to take any
 
00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.509 align:start position:0%
with that i would be glad to take any
questions

00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your time this morning
 
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.149 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
 
00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.909 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
um

00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:57.509 --> 00:31:57.519 align:start position:0%
i live
 
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
in far northern new hampshire
 
00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:01.350 align:start position:0%
in far northern new hampshire
and

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
our school buses up there
 
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
they get down to 40 below zero
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
we have temperatures at 40 below zero as
 
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
a matter of fact up until recently the
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
the only time that the colebrook school
 
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
district has ever
 
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
canceled school was because it was 42
 
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
below and the buses wouldn't start
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
what are we going to
 
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
what is our expectation for electric
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
buses in extreme conditions
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
sure and i think it's like any other
 
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
vehicle right you know it is a little
 
00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:34.799 align:start position:0%
the efficiency does go down in extreme
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
temperatures especially in the cold but
 
00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
those are all things that you can
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
account for in your operation and i
 
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
really have no other expectation that
 
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
these buses would be comfortable and
 
00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.990 align:start position:0%
these buses would be comfortable and
operational

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
operational
 
00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:53.519 align:start position:0%
the normal route of business you know 40
 
00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
below is quite extreme and i hope kids
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
get to stay home from school in that
 
00:32:58.630 --> 00:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
sort of situation
 
00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
but i would expect that they would
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
operate entirely normally in
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
cold conditions
 
00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:07.519 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
representative oregon
 
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
and we are running late
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
what is the range of these electric
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
school buses
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
it's a good question um and it's not one
 
00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
i have at the top of my mind
 
00:33:21.679 --> 00:33:23.029 align:start position:0%
i have at the top of my mind
unfortunately

00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:33:23.039 --> 00:33:25.190 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
um

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps rebecca ohler from the
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
00:33:30.149 --> 00:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
could answer that for you okay thanks
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you very
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
much thank you
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
last person i have signed up to speak
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
rebecca olaf from new hampshire
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you very much for the
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
record rebecca ohler department of
 
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
environmental services and i'm actively
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
the department has not taken a position
 
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
on this bill but obviously we are very
 
00:34:03.029 --> 00:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
happy to be
 
00:34:05.909 --> 00:34:05.919 align:start position:0%
included in the in the proposal to
 
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
operate this program we are the agency
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
that's been
 
00:34:12.069 --> 00:34:12.079 align:start position:0%
tasked with distributing the vw
 
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
mitigation trust
 
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
that was passed over to des when the
 
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
former office of strategic initiatives
 
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
became was merged with the new
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
we actually explored an electric school
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
bus proposal um probably five years ago
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
and it was just simply too stupid too
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
soon the the school districts weren't
 
00:34:36.149 --> 00:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
quite ready to be considering that the
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
technology was not as advanced as it is
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
now the number of vehicles being offered
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
was was um you know there's basically
 
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
one choice and one choice only
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
we now have
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
multiple bus companies that are
 
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
developing and and actively selling
 
00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
electric buses across the country so
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
this is definitely a a much better time
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
exploring this
 
00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.150 align:start position:0%
exploring this
um

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:05.349 --> 00:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of questions that
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
were floated to to senator waters and i
 
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
thought i might just um offer
 
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
my take on those and uh one the first
 
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
one was about what is the maintenance of
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
these buses and i think senator waters
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
did address this to the extent that the
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
maintenance is actually far less on an
 
00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:21.599 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle any type of electric
 
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
counterpart because there are no there
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
there are no oil changes there's no fuel
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
system to maintain
 
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
um you know it's an electric motor there
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
is no engine
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
uh there's also less wear and tear on
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
brakes because the electric motor is
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
serves to to
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
slow the the vehicle much of the time
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
the the brakes actually engage fairly
 
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
infrequently because the electric motor
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
runs in reverse to slow the vehicle down
 
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
in in the process of doing that it's
 
00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
recharging its battery bank so while
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's driving and doing stop and go the
 
00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599 align:start position:0%
way school buses do it it actually
 
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
partially recharges itself it's one of
 
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
the reasons why
 
00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:07.599 align:start position:0%
electric is such a great solution for
 
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
things like transit buses and and school
 
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
buses because of the and garbage trucks
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
for that matter because they're
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
constantly starting and stopping and so
 
00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:17.599 align:start position:0%
they recapture a lot of energy as they
 
00:36:17.599 --> 00:36:19.510 align:start position:0%
they recapture a lot of energy as they
stop

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
stop
 
00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:23.670 align:start position:0%
stop
um

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
there was there was also a question
 
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
about whether there's any projects old
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
enough to require the replacement of the
 
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
of the electric
 
00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.069 align:start position:0%
of the electric
um

00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:32.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
motor or the batteries and i'm not
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
aware of any the
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
folks in massachusetts
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
have some of the earliest electric bus
 
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
projects in this part of the country
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
those buses are now probably
 
00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
eight or nine years old and
 
00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
i haven't gotten recent data from them
 
00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.430 align:start position:0%
i haven't gotten recent data from them
but

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
um at last conversation they were not
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
having any issues with having to to do
 
00:36:59.910 --> 00:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
wholesale replacement of batteries
 
00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.270 align:start position:0%
wholesale replacement of batteries
um

00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.310 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.750 align:start position:0%
so
uh

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:08.079 --> 00:37:10.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
there was also a question about some of
 
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
the costs to upgrade the uh
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
the electric infrastructure and
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
while i can't share details because it's
 
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
an open request for proposals right now
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
currently evaluating proposals under the
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
vw mitigation trust
 
00:37:30.079 --> 00:37:31.589 align:start position:0%
vw mitigation trust
for

00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:31.599 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
installation of electric charging
 
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
infrastructure around the state and as
 
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
was noted it really is dependent on the
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
location we're seeing some areas where
 
00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost less than ten
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to do the connection of
 
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
a high-powered charger to the grid and
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
other places where the estimates are
 
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
over two hundred thousand dollars so
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
it's really completely dependent on on
 
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
where the where the project is located
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
and i think that that would probably be
 
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
a significant consideration when
 
00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:01.750 align:start position:0%
a significant consideration when
deciding

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
deciding
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
where to do a pilot project for this i
 
00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:05.839 align:start position:0%
think it would be
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
likely to be done in an area that's
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
ready for it
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions from
 
00:38:13.349 --> 00:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
just a quick question um is the
 
00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.230 align:start position:0%
just a quick question um is the
infrastructure

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure costs that you see
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
regional like is it more northern area
 
00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.270 align:start position:0%
regional like is it more northern area
needs

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
needs
 
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
more infrastructure costs for this type
 
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
of program than the south or
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
no um it's just really dependent on
 
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
whether you're on the west side of town
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
or the east side of town so it doesn't
 
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
i will note that
 
00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:41.829 align:start position:0%
i will note that
some

00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
potentially easy fixes to language are
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
are have been floated in the back of the
 
00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
room here and we may be able to i'm i'm
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
reluctant to propose them right now uh
 
00:38:55.349 --> 00:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
coming from des but i will share
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
no you can have the conversation with
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
the others that are going to do the same
 
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
thing so okay yeah
 
00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
so thank you any other questions from
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
seeing done thank you very much thank
 
00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:06.310 align:start position:0%
seeing done thank you very much thank
you

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
anybody else wish to speak on senate
 
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
bill 417
 
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
seeing that i'm going to close the
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
give us a minute to reset next bill up
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:42.870 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:42.880 --> 00:41:02.950 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:10.150 align:start position:0%
 
cheers

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:46.790 align:start position:0%
 
it's

00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:46.800 --> 00:42:18.550 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:41.109 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:42:41.109 --> 00:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:41.119 --> 00:42:42.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna open up the public hearing on
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
senate bill 442. the chair recognizes
 
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:53.589 align:start position:0%
 
442.

00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
442.
 
00:42:53.599 --> 00:42:55.750 align:start position:0%
442.
sorry

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
i was just in the middle of a
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
conversation let me get my wits back
 
00:43:01.589 --> 00:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
about me i'm pretty sure that's not
 
00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
the verdict i wasn't even looking up
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
i thought okay
 
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
senator senator waters
 
00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.030 align:start position:0%
senator senator waters
no

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
no i'm right yeah oh it is me okay no
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
it's not we're we're on senator bill
 
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
442 so the chair recognizes senator
 
00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
birdsale please prime sponsor
 
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
i know you're an anxious senator
 
00:43:25.829 --> 00:43:25.839 align:start position:0%
this is relative to the suspension of
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
vehicle registrations as a result of
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
mr chair thank you committee for
 
00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
hearing 4-2
 
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
my name is regina bartzel state senator
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
for district 19 which encompasses the
 
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
towns of
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
derry hampstead and windham
 
00:43:50.309 --> 00:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
and i am the prime sponsor of 442. this
 
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
was brought to me by the department of
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
transportation they had they have had
 
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
some issue major issues with people
 
00:43:59.910 --> 00:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
running the tolls not paying the tolls
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
and you'll hear some of the information
 
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
from d.o.t
 
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
but this bill would allow the director
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
of the department of motor vehicles to
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
suspend an owner's vehicle registration
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
until the any unpaid tolls and
 
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
administrative fees are paid and there's
 
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
quite a lengthy lengthy way for them to
 
00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:22.870 align:start position:0%
quite a lengthy lengthy way for them to
um

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:23.670 align:start position:0%
um
to

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:25.839 align:start position:0%
try and get that money back before they
 
00:44:25.839 --> 00:44:27.030 align:start position:0%
try and get that money back before they
suspend

00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
suspend
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
the registration
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
the senate amended it to because there
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
was some concern from
 
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
the auto dealers
 
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
so we did amend it to say that because
 
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
there were there are some some concerns
 
00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.510 align:start position:0%
there were there are some some concerns
of

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
individuals who have transferred their
 
00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
vehicles over to family members
 
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
and continue to rack up those unpaid
 
00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
tolls so the senate did amend it to
 
00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
not allow
 
00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
family members who live in the same
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
household family members or those who
 
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
live in the same household to have the
 
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
vehicle transferred over
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
you'll hear a little bit of information
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
about that when dmv
 
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
gets up as well as d.o.t so with that
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
i'll try and answer any questions but i
 
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:16.960 align:start position:0%

kathy mulcahy hamson i'm the legislative
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
liaison for the department of
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%

00:45:59.829 --> 00:45:59.839 align:start position:0%
examiner and with me this morning is mr
 
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
john corcoran who's the administrator
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
for the bureau of turnpikes who oversees
 
00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
um the toll collection in the e-z pass
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
system um i'd like to thank senator
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
birdsell for working on this bill with
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
us and sponsoring
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
senate bill 442. the purpose of the bill
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
is to close loopholes
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
in the current law on
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
essentially toll evaders
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
we were looking for two changes
 
00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
to the current law the turnpike system
 
00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
is maintained and operated with
 
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
toll revenue
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
we need to maintain a system that's fair
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
that has credibility so when a user
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
chooses to use the turnpike system they
 
00:46:44.309 --> 00:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
know they have to pay the toll and if
 
00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
they choose not to pay the toll or can't
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
pay the toll then they have to use an
 
00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
the purpose of
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
the pending bill senate bill 442
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
is for better toll collection
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement in dealing with those who
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
choose to use the turnpike system but
 
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
not pay the tolls
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
i think to
 
00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
understand why we're looking for these
 
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
changes i'd like to explain a little
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
about how the toll collection works
 
00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
pay at the time of use you pay with a
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
transponder with an easy pass account or
 
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
you pay cash in
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
at the time of use
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
if you don't pay at the time of use
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
the user has the option of paying online
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
within seven days of the transaction
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
just the toll no additional fee
 
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
so just the toll within seven days
 
00:47:41.829 --> 00:47:41.839 align:start position:0%
if the individual doesn't pay within
 
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
seven days then we begin an invoicing
 
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
process and we'd send an first invoice
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
requesting payment of the toll plus a
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
dollar fee and that's payable in 30 days
 
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
if the individual doesn't pay in 30 days
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
we send a second notice requesting
 
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
payment of the toll and a dollar 50 fee
 
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
again 30 days to pay
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
so the user's getting a lot of notices
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
if they don't pay the second notice when
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
30 days it escalates to a violation and
 
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
they receive a third notice a violation
 
00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
notice requesting payment of the toll
 
00:48:20.309 --> 00:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
plus a 25 dollar fee
 
00:48:23.589 --> 00:48:23.599 align:start position:0%
if an individual incurs 10 or more
 
00:48:23.599 --> 00:48:25.190 align:start position:0%
if an individual incurs 10 or more
violations

00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
violations
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
before that happens when they become
 
00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
eligible for d and b hold
 
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
the department reaches out through to
 
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
the individual through the department of
 
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.910 align:start position:0%
the individual through the department of
turnpikes

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
turnpikes
 
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
and tries to resolve the issue you you
 
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
have too many violations we're going to
 
00:48:49.109 --> 00:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
send you to dmv holds
 
00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:50.559 align:start position:0%
if you don't clear these you won't be
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
able to register your vehicle so a lot
 
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
of people will clear them up at that
 
00:48:56.549 --> 00:48:56.559 align:start position:0%
point some won't
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
so the person goes to dmv hold what that
 
00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
means is the department of
 
00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
transportation sends the information
 
00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:05.839 align:start position:0%
over to our partners at dmv under the
 
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
department of safety
 
00:49:11.109 --> 00:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
dmv sends a letter out to the individual
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
a notice that says you have 30 days to
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
clear these e-pass violations
 
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
if you don't your privileges to renew
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
your registration will be denied
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
that is when their birth month usually
 
00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:26.559 align:start position:0%
rolls around and they're due for
 
00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
the department seeking to change that
 
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
part of the law from the renewal to an
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
actual suspension so that when dmv sends
 
00:49:43.829 --> 00:49:43.839 align:start position:0%
their notice out it will say you have 30
 
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
days to
 
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
clear the easy pass violations or your
 
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
registration is suspended it's more
 
00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:53.510 align:start position:0%
registration is suspended it's more
immediate

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:56.079 align:start position:0%
as a senior hearings examiner i have
 
00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
some top violators who come to me and
 
00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
ask that their
 
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
fees be reviewed and you're talking some
 
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
people can owe 500 700 i've had
 
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
people who owe a thousand dollars in
 
00:50:10.829 --> 00:50:10.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
um and they they they asked me well why
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
did you let my total get so high
 
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
we don't have a way to keep them off the
 
00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:20.470 align:start position:0%
we don't have a way to keep them off the
road

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
road
 
00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
um they they can keep driving on the
 
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
turnpike system and and we don't have a
 
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
way to stop that
 
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
if their registration is suspended
 
00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
suspended and they're
 
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
not legally able to operate their
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
vehicle that's a more effective method
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
to stop it so that's the first um
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
request we're changing where you'll see
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
up in the
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
the bill on line
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
eight it
 
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
goes from it's crossing out the word
 
00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
renewal privileges so that instead of in
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
their birth month when they go to renew
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
their registration
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
it's that their
 
00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.069 align:start position:0%
it's that their
registration

00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
registration
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
is suspended
 
00:51:01.589 --> 00:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
so they can't operate within 30 days of
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
the dmv notice so that's the first
 
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
the second change we're requesting um
 
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
is um to address people who have become
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
very creative in circumventing the dmv
 
00:51:19.349 --> 00:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
hold process
 
00:51:19.359 --> 00:51:20.230 align:start position:0%
hold process
um

00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:24.069 --> 00:51:24.079 align:start position:0%
they had um gone before and gotten a new
 
00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:26.720 align:start position:0%
plate um and letting the old plate
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
expire we closed that loophole they're
 
00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
no longer able to get a new plate
 
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
now we have people who transfer
 
00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
ownership a husband transfers ownership
 
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
to his wife or his fiancee
 
00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
so that's the
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
basis for the second change we're asking
 
00:51:41.839 --> 00:51:45.270 align:start position:0%
basis for the second change we're asking
that

00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
the transfer of ownership on that
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle that incurred the violations
 
00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
would be prohibited
 
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of transferring to a family
 
00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
member or someone who lives at the same
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
address per dmv records
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
and i want to
 
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
let the committee know that in
 
00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
discussing this this morning with dmv
 
00:52:10.069 --> 00:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
they took a closer look at this and
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
have an issue in terms of
 
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
prohibiting transfer among family
 
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
members but i will let them address that
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
because that has to do with their
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
dmv systems
 
00:52:23.829 --> 00:52:23.839 align:start position:0%
but those are the two
 
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
changes that we were looking at to
 
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
tighten up this system keep it credible
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
and make people pay the tolls if they
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
so i thank you for your time
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
and if there's any questions we'd be
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
happy to answer
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
representative telersky
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question very
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
quickly can you give us an idea of the
 
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
number of um
 
00:52:53.589 --> 00:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
people we're talking about in the course
 
00:52:55.109 --> 00:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
of a year that you're dealing with in
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
these extreme situations that hit that
 
00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:00.390 align:start position:0%
these extreme situations that hit that
point

00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with approximately 50 000
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
to 48 000 plates
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
every year
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
that are going to be going to hold
 
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
now some of those are these duplicate
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
two where
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's the same plate that goes into hole
 
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
because they just keep repeating
 
00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:20.309 align:start position:0%
because they just keep repeating
repeating

00:53:20.309 --> 00:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
repeating
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
but overall
 
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
i mean this past
 
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
year in fiscal year 21 we dealt with
 
00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
38 33
 
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
000 plates and getting payments and
 
00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:32.790 align:start position:0%
000 plates and getting payments and
stuff

00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up
 
00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
follow-up and do you have an idea of the
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
00:53:39.109 --> 00:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
money we're talking about then that's in
 
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
arrears that
 
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
i i don't have that with me it's a lot
 
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:49.829 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:53:49.829 --> 00:53:49.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
it took 10 minutes to explain this
 
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
process how long does it take to enact
 
00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:55.270 align:start position:0%
process how long does it take to enact
it

00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
and what are the costs involved in doing
 
00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:58.470 align:start position:0%
and what are the costs involved in doing
that

00:53:58.470 --> 00:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:01.829 --> 00:54:01.839 align:start position:0%
to go through all the steps that you
 
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
described to us to
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
get someone to
 
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
pony up the money
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
approximately four months from the date
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
they violate through the tolls until we
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:54:24.319 --> 00:54:25.270 align:start position:0%
follow up
um

00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
it just seems to me like
 
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
you give them way too many breaks that
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
this this legislation should be cut
 
00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
much shorter
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
um to save the department time
 
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
and money
 
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
to the state taxpayers
 
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
i wonder if you recoup all the money
 
00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
that you
 
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
spend in time
 
00:54:49.829 --> 00:54:49.839 align:start position:0%
by collecting these tolls
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
yes we do recruit i mean i'll say we're
 
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
in the positive from the money that we
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
spend on our staff the
 
00:54:57.119 --> 00:54:57.910 align:start position:0%
spend on our staff the
our

00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:54:59.910 --> 00:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
vendors cubic who sends out all these
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
invoices and the postage we pay
 
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
we are in a positive from collecting
 
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair um
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
what happens and this doesn't seem to be
 
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
directly addressed by the new language
 
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
the bill if the
 
00:55:26.549 --> 00:55:26.559 align:start position:0%
car is in fact owned by a
 
00:55:28.789 --> 00:55:28.799 align:start position:0%
well it could be a trust many people
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
have their cars owned by a
 
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
revocable trust although those could i
 
00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:34.799 align:start position:0%
suppose that that could be construed as
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
individual or if they
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
if it's owned by a corporation it seems
 
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
like they could actually even if we
 
00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
passed this bill they could still
 
00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
transfer it to an llc or a trust and
 
00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:44.630 align:start position:0%
transfer it to an llc or a trust and
then

00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
um run out the clock a little bit more
 
00:55:48.549 --> 00:55:48.559 align:start position:0%
that way thanks
 
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
representative oregon we do have um in
 
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
fact there's one that comes to mind
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
a certain corporation that has taken the
 
00:55:59.910 --> 00:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
company vehicles and they've created
 
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
i think three or four llc's in the past
 
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
couple years and they transfer the
 
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
vehicles amongst the corporations so
 
00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
they can avoid paying the tolls but they
 
00:56:11.109 --> 00:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
are a legal entity and it is um this law
 
00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
would apply to them as it does to an
 
00:56:13.119 --> 00:56:15.270 align:start position:0%
would apply to them as it does to an
individual

00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%

00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
for many that i haven't met here on the
 
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
committee my name is john marasco i'm
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
the new division of motor vehicles
 
00:56:59.910 --> 00:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
director i'm happy to be in the position
 
00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
and working with so many great people
 
00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
i just completed my first month so some
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
of the bills that are coming before you
 
00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
i'm still getting up to speed on this
 
00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
one included and i just stepped out to
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
make a few additional phone calls on it
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
we actually i know it's informational
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
testimony i would say we support the
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
bill at this point and the reason i say
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
that is um there's there's just one
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
section in there uh the family portion
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
of it where it says family member for
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
our systems at the dmv that might be a
 
00:57:30.789 --> 00:57:30.799 align:start position:0%
little difficult to configure i just
 
00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:32.559 align:start position:0%
spoke with our
 
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
doit contractor who advised me that as
 
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:37.839 align:start position:0%
far as legal address goes
 
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
we can tether that to last name and if
 
00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
that last name is the last name of that
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
relevant family member then we're going
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
to be able to configure the system to uh
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
to capture that
 
00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
so that's what we can do if it's a
 
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
family member that lives in a different
 
00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:52.710 align:start position:0%
family member that lives in a different
jurisdiction

00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
in a different house that that would be
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
difficult for us to uh to ascertain but
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
as far as the portion of the bill that
 
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
talks about address we can we can
 
00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
conform to that and um
 
00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
and probably conform to that relatively
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
quickly so
 
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
i think it's a good bill we want to help
 
00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:10.150 align:start position:0%
i think it's a good bill we want to help
uh

00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
dot where we can with these easy pass
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
violations um certainly there's a lot of
 
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
money there i would just caution the
 
00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:17.839 align:start position:0%
committee the one thing that we maybe
 
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
cannot commit to at this point is the
 
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
family member that overreaching
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
wording that part of the bill but as far
 
00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:25.670 align:start position:0%
wording that part of the bill but as far
as

00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
address and last name tethered to the
 
00:58:28.319 --> 00:58:29.349 align:start position:0%
address and last name tethered to the
address

00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
representative o'hara thank you mr
 
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and just um a quick question
 
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
along the family member line
 
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
would it be possible to do a sworn
 
00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
affidavit davis for the buyer i'm just
 
00:58:47.109 --> 00:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
worried about buyer someone buying a
 
00:58:48.789 --> 00:58:48.799 align:start position:0%
vehicle from someone that's been running
 
00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
tolls and they now have a car that they
 
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
can't register
 
00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:53.190 align:start position:0%
can't register
but

00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
i still want to be able to stop the
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
loophole from the family members
 
00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:57.670 align:start position:0%
loophole from the family members
right

00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
it's a good point i guess that would
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
require further conversation i'm not
 
00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
sure on the affidavit offhand
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
think i think what we have here is a
 
00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction based on
 
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
what dodot testified to the chance to
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
actually identify the address where the
 
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
violator is and anybody else that lives
 
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
at that address who may or may not be a
 
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
family member but lives at the address
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
to start curtailing the uh the behavior
 
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
that way to it's a good step in the
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
right direction
 
00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
but i agree with you representative at
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
least it doesn't open up the scope
 
00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
beyond that it's really the address that
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
we're focused on
 
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
for the questions from the committee
 
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
representative telersky this is very
 
00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
quick it might actually be for you mr
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
chair i'm having i'm you just raised a
 
00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
is this preventing someone with these
 
00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
violations from transferring ownership
 
00:59:45.589 --> 00:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
in a private sale to someone who's not a
 
00:59:47.589 --> 00:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
family member does it prevent sale of
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
the vehicle
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
no no it's just the transfer okay thank
 
00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
you i want to clarify good question
 
00:59:56.309 --> 00:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'll just be i just wanted
 
00:59:59.750 --> 00:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
to be clear did
 
01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
because i was just brought brought to my
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
attention a possible issue a few minutes
 
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
ago before we started the hearing are
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
you saying now the department after you
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
making a few more phone calls is
 
01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the language is
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
currently in the bill we are sir we're
 
01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the language with
 
01:00:14.309 --> 01:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
regards to the address and family
 
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
members residing at that address the
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
only part i would say that
 
01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
might be
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
something for conversation in the bill
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
is the just family member in general we
 
01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
can't do a sweeping family member check
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
across the board but as long as it's
 
01:00:29.109 --> 01:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
tethered to that address our contractors
 
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
can configure to that okay thank you
 
01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you sir um
 
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:35.280 align:start position:0%

public hearing
 
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%

01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
i'm going to open up the public hearing

on senate bill 447 establishing the
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle and infrastructure fund
 
01:01:41.829 --> 01:01:41.839 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes the prime sponsor
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
senator watters good morning again thank
 
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman members of the committee
 
01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
senator david waters district 4
 
01:01:49.349 --> 01:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
introducing senate bill 447 which
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
establishes an electric vehicle
 
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
an infrastructure fund
 
01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:54.549 align:start position:0%
an infrastructure fund
and

01:01:54.549 --> 01:01:54.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
you know as you know we have received 17
 
01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars from the federal
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
government for electric vehicle
 
01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.230 align:start position:0%
government for electric vehicle
infrastructure

01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:03.190 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
and

01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
it is quite likely we'll be receiving
 
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
well i'd say we would have a good chance
 
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
at receiving more from the two and a
 
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
half to five billion dollar grant
 
01:02:12.630 --> 01:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
program that is set up
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
for this purpose as well so i had um
 
01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:17.039 align:start position:0%
pretty extensive conversations with the
 
01:02:17.039 --> 01:02:18.309 align:start position:0%
pretty extensive conversations with the
commissioner

01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:21.039 align:start position:0%
and uh with bill cass and others about
 
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be convenient and help us to
 
01:02:25.589 --> 01:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
have a dedic a fund that was set up to
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
receive these and potentially
 
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
other monies
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
and that'll do that'll do a few things
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%
for us um it will
 
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
mean that
 
01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
there is a fund
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
that has a purpose
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
for expenditures that is outlined by
 
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
the legislative legislature it also as
 
01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
you notice on lines um
 
01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
15 to 16 suggested by senator birdsall
 
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
wants to make sure that as funds go out
 
01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
the legislature has a look through
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
probably joint physical
 
01:03:01.109 --> 01:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
um at what the purpose of those those
 
01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
funds are
 
01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
and then um if you look down to what
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
these things can be what that can be
 
01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
used for the abc's here starting online
 
01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.390 align:start position:0%
used for the abc's here starting online
23.

01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
23.
 
01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
these were written to match what
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
governor sununu
 
01:03:16.079 --> 01:03:17.829 align:start position:0%
governor sununu
specified

01:03:17.829 --> 01:03:17.839 align:start position:0%
specified
 
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
in the acceptance of the volkswagen fund
 
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
so these these general buckets here
 
01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
are ones that through the electric
 
01:03:27.029 --> 01:03:27.039 align:start position:0%
vehicle infrastructure
 
01:03:29.829 --> 01:03:29.839 align:start position:0%
commission and its report and um
 
01:03:29.839 --> 01:03:30.950 align:start position:0%
commission and its report and um
through

01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
um work with then oh
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
then uh
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
was it before his department of energy
 
01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
oh i something anyways working working
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
with those folks and some of the same
 
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
folks the department of energy these
 
01:03:43.829 --> 01:03:43.839 align:start position:0%
these uh in particular these seem to be
 
01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
categories that the the governor
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
suggested and um
 
01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:48.230 align:start position:0%
suggested and um
so

01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
it was good to have these priorities
 
01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
here uh and um this is what the funds
 
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
are receiving are probably meant for as
 
01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
well so we want to make sure that we
 
01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
finish building out the fast charge
 
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
system now that's identifies the highest
 
01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
need for the state that's where
 
01:04:05.029 --> 01:04:05.039 align:start position:0%
volkswagen funding on the current rfp
 
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
that is out and
 
01:04:08.549 --> 01:04:08.559 align:start position:0%
proposals that have come in for that are
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
being reviewed now and we pretty soon i
 
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
hope we'll be hearing about who's been
 
01:04:15.029 --> 01:04:15.039 align:start position:0%
selected to get that work going but the
 
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
money from the volkswagen fund isn't
 
01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
going to do it all and that's why this
 
01:04:21.029 --> 01:04:21.039 align:start position:0%
funding coming in from the um
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
the interest the infrastructure bill is
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
going to be important to help
 
01:04:28.309 --> 01:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
work on that and then also
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
other transportation corridors besides
 
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
the interstates and 101 and and 16 so
 
01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
some of the secondary highways pick up
 
01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
the north country to make sure that they
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
get some infrastructure
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
up there
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
and then secondly i
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
this vehicle infrastructure could be on
 
01:04:50.549 --> 01:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
commercial property in new hampshire
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
downtowns are crying out for it
 
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
campgrounds at exits
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
shopping deposited exits as well so
 
01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
that's a priority that was also
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
identified through the infrastructure
 
01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:04.069 align:start position:0%
identified through the infrastructure
commission

01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:05:07.109 --> 01:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
in c
 
01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
state agencies and again that's a bucket
 
01:05:11.109 --> 01:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
that the governor identified through the
 
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
volkswagen funds and it's good to have
 
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
that here as as well
 
01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
now i want to note that this bill does
 
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
not tie
 
01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.349 align:start position:0%
not tie
the

01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner's hands in terms the
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner needs to have flexibility
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
in uh getting funding out and deciding
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
okay we've done enough of this now that
 
01:05:32.789 --> 01:05:32.799 align:start position:0%
you know we ought to put a little more
 
01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
into that or if they write a grant and
 
01:05:37.349 --> 01:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
get a grant funded that will specify
 
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
certain areas of emphasis as well
 
01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
but what it also does though is it
 
01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.230 align:start position:0%
but what it also does though is it
explicitly

01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
explicitly
 
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
says on page two
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
that we can contract with private
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
entities and this is something that was
 
01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
learned through the rfpu process through
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
des and elsewhere there are companies
 
01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
out there as you know who do this work
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
and they do it well
 
01:06:01.270 --> 01:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
and um so we're not going to rely on dod
 
01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
personnel to develop the expertise or
 
01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
you know to have staffing that can do
 
01:06:07.109 --> 01:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
that so you've been able to
 
01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
bring in private contractors which again
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
the commissioner can do that but it's
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
good to specify it um here
 
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
as as well
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
and then uh if additional funds come in
 
01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
on lines 2018 to 20 yeah so new new rfps
 
01:06:26.789 --> 01:06:26.799 align:start position:0%
um let everybody be have a chance to to
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
to compete um for that as well and then
 
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
finally import and importantly starting
 
01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
lines 21 that we're going to get a we're
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
going to reporting on you know how the
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
funding is doing
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
uh what what the needs are and what
 
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
additional funds have have come in so
 
01:06:43.109 --> 01:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i think this would be useful
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
and um it's also some sense that having
 
01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
this in place will
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
help us in applying for competitive
 
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
grant funds because we'll have a
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund that has some purposes
 
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
outlined for it and that can help give
 
01:06:57.990 --> 01:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
us a leg up as we're applying for those
 
01:07:00.069 --> 01:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
some federal and other funds as well
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman god to take any
 
01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.190 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman god to take any
questions

01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
thank you senator any questions from the
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
committee representative good morning
 
01:07:08.789 --> 01:07:08.799 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you mr chairman thank
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
you senator for taking my question i
 
01:07:11.589 --> 01:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
just want to get clarity but you
 
01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know we're getting 17
 
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
million from the feds and then you
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know the infrastructure
 
01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:18.390 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know the infrastructure
bill

01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
are those two different
 
01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
things are they one and the same
 
01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question um so
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
there is a an amount as a portion to the
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
states and on various forms we've got 17
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
million for that
 
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
there's also 2.5 to 5 billion dollars in
 
01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:36.150 align:start position:0%
there's also 2.5 to 5 billion dollars in
there

01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
and it has that variable range because
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
it's one of those ones where well if you
 
01:07:40.789 --> 01:07:40.799 align:start position:0%
don't use it all in this then you can
 
01:07:42.870 --> 01:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
use it on that but that is also in the
 
01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:43.670 align:start position:0%
use it on that but that is also in the
bill

01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
and that's identified for these kinds of
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
purposes plus for electric uh buses um
 
01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
so it's a it's a big pot of money and uh
 
01:07:53.349 --> 01:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
states will be able to apply
 
01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799 align:start position:0%
for that funding
 
01:07:56.549 --> 01:07:56.559 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's they're both in the
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%

buchanan with clean energy new hampshire
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
i did share some written testimony with
 
01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
you today so i will be very brief clean
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
energy new hampshire is in support of

senate bill 447
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
it is a prudent step to prepare for the
 
01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
amount of federal funding that we are
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
receiving in the state and will help new
 
01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire retain its competitive edge in
 
01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
this market space
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
we are especially glad to see that in
 
01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
terms of siding of any ev infrastructure
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
for charging that the appropriate
 
01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:20.799 align:start position:0%
stakeholders are being brought to the
 
01:09:20.799 --> 01:09:21.749 align:start position:0%
stakeholders are being brought to the
table

01:09:21.749 --> 01:09:21.759 align:start position:0%
table
 
01:09:21.759 --> 01:09:23.110 align:start position:0%
table
including

01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
including
 
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%

transportation as well as drive electric
 
01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
and this collection of folks will really
 
01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
do a good job in citing all of that
 
01:09:33.679 --> 01:09:35.030 align:start position:0%
do a good job in citing all of that
appropriately

01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
and with the right input
 
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
the only other thing i'll mention is
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
that setting up this fund for
 
01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
acquisition in particular of evs will be
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
helpful in the very tight
 
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle market that we've been
 
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
experiencing it is challenging for new
 
01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire to get evs
 
01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
partly because of our current policy as
 
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
compared to other states and so anything
 
01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
that we can do in that realm to help
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
assist new hampshire
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
have access to the ev market is
 
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
excellent and much appreciated in terms
 
01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:06.870 align:start position:0%
excellent and much appreciated in terms
of

01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:10:09.189 --> 01:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
accessing this technology so with that i
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
would be glad to take any questions
 
01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:15.510 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
representative fenton hi thank you for
 
01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question can you elaborate on
 
01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
the policies that kind of restrict us
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
from getting evs
 
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
sure so some other states in
 
01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
the us have policies that
 
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
make them more competitive in terms of
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
getting evs to dealerships new hampshire
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
does not have those and so typically
 
01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
that's referred to as a zev mandate
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
because we don't have that in the state
 
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of folks currently go down to
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
massachusetts to get evs and other
 
01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
states that have more availability in
 
01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
terms of their stock and i know it's
 
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
hard to get a vehicle in general right
 
01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:50.950 align:start position:0%
hard to get a vehicle in general right
now

01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
but anything we can do in terms of
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
setting up a process for
 
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
funding in new hampshire that would make
 
01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
this easier would be helpful to the
 
01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:01.350 align:start position:0%
this easier would be helpful to the
state

01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:05.600 align:start position:0%

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:11.189 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
okay being 914. we're starting it caught

bill 308 relative to driver's license
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
for certain visa holders um this bill
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
was brought forward by
 
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
to me by by the farm bureau because of
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
issues that had arisen
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
under this program for
 
01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.709 align:start position:0%
under this program for
agricultural

01:12:46.709 --> 01:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
agricultural
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
businesses in the state that take
 
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
advantage of the h2a workers these
 
01:12:52.390 --> 01:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
agricultural workers who come in
 
01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
seasonally and uh have sometimes
 
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
long-term relationships with the farms
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
at which they they work and because we
 
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
didn't have in statute this kind of
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
reciprocity of what permits that we were
 
01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
recognizing the situation arose that
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
somebody who might be driving you know
 
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
working at a farm in maine or in
 
01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
vermont if they come and work for a farm
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire um that
 
01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
they could you know they're driving farm
 
01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
equipment on the farm or more locally
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
that they that the farmer could get in
 
01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:20.950 align:start position:0%
that they that the farmer could get in
trouble

01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
about that because we didn't have this
 
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
recognition and potentially they could
 
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
be investigated or
 
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
the workers might have difficulty just
 
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
performing the work that they've been
 
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
hired to do so it puts it in statute um
 
01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
that we recognize uh these uh licenses
 
01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:38.149 align:start position:0%
that we recognize uh these uh licenses
or

01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
permits from another another
 
01:13:41.679 --> 01:13:43.910 align:start position:0%
permits from another another
jurisdiction

01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
or has a permit from a jurisdiction
 
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
outside the united states and then 18
 
01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
years lawfully present
 
01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
present for less than a year
 
01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
and has an international driver permit
 
01:13:58.229 --> 01:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
if their license issued from a
 
01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction outside the united states
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
is not written in english
 
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
so um fairly simple it brings us into
 
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
conformity with other states are doing
 
01:14:08.229 --> 01:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
and make sure that
 
01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
agriculture workers
 
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
and their employers in new hampshire
 
01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to employ these folks
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
they've had for for many years working
 
01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:20.320 align:start position:0%

my entire life
 
01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
um and for the last 30 years or so we
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
have relied on a handful of gentlemen
 
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
from jamaica to do most of the
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
fundamental work or a lot of the
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
fundamental work at the farm
 
01:15:52.229 --> 01:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
some of them have driver's licenses we
 
01:15:54.070 --> 01:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
have always thought it was legal for
 
01:15:55.590 --> 01:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
them with
 
01:15:57.669 --> 01:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
a driver's license from another country
 
01:15:59.350 --> 01:15:59.360 align:start position:0%

to drive in the state of new hampshire
 
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
in the same way that i can drive in
 
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
another jurisdiction with my new
 
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire license
 
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
this year um we were surprised by a u.s
 
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
department of labor inspection
 
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
in which we are the the initial fine was
 
01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.310 align:start position:0%
in which we are the the initial fine was
800

01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
800
 
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
for um
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
for having uh uh unlicensed
 
01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:22.870 align:start position:0%
for having uh uh unlicensed
drivers

01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
drivers
 
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
driving our crew around well the the man
 
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
who drives our crew around not only has
 
01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
a current
 
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
jamaican license for a very long time
 
01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
he's had a current international license
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
we need this bill please folks this i
 
01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:38.709 align:start position:0%
we need this bill please folks this i
mean

01:16:38.709 --> 01:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
most of us thought this was already the
 
01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:41.830 align:start position:0%
most of us thought this was already the
law

01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
um but this is an exposure that
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
unfair of us would be unfair of me to
 
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
put this exposure on our gentleman
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
and i don't think we should be exposed
 
01:16:58.870 --> 01:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
to this either it is amusing that
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
poverty lane the lebanon police stations
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
on poverty lane
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
the police just waved to these guys
 
01:17:08.950 --> 01:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
and when when when this same gentleman
 
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about uh he hit a deer in
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
plainfield that jumped out in front of
 
01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:13.669 align:start position:0%
plainfield that jumped out in front of
him

01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
him
 
01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
and the policeman called me up to make
 
01:17:17.669 --> 01:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
sure that i didn't think it was the
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
man's fault
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
so there are some people in enforcement
 
01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
who may not exactly know
 
01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
that this is not the law now but i
 
01:17:30.070 --> 01:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
implore you to make it the law thank you
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%

lane and um so
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
everything you say about where the
 
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:48.400 align:start position:0%

back from like 1996 to 2001 when i lived
 
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
in lebanon so
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%

representative oregon
 
01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:04.950 align:start position:0%
representative oregon
representative

01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr wood for taking my question
 
01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:11.030 align:start position:0%
thank you mr wood for taking my question
um

01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
as part of your business operations um
 
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
you're you you try to use the same
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
workers year after year after year
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that as i understand
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
it is that they have skill sets that are
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
really important that help you bring in
 
01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
a more effective crop is that a true
 
01:18:29.669 --> 01:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
statement it is true it's true most of
 
01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
my colleagues as well i mean we try to
 
01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:32.310 align:start position:0%
my colleagues as well i mean we try to
keep

01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
keep
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
we try to keep the same workers this is
 
01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
the one place where we have no
 
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
authority about this
 
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
the the the the government ultimately
 
01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
our government determines together with
 
01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
the jamaican government determines
 
01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
whether we actually get the people we
 
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
ask for but we have had the good luck
 
01:18:51.669 --> 01:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
touchwood uh since 1992 of
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
we've we've got the people we we've
 
01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
requested and we've had very
 
01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
low turnover the
 
01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
some of these people have worked for us
 
01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
for 30 years um they're starting to die
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
they're getting old so yes and we
 
01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely rely on them they they are
 
01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
skilled long-term valuable employees
 
01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
that are not replaceable
 
01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
by by somebody anybody else it would be
 
01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
a whole nother training process
 
01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:20.070 align:start position:0%

and
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's you know we we feel we feel a
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility to
 
01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
these workers
 
01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:29.920 align:start position:0%

violation and and
 
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%

apple growers dread the era
occasional

01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%

cruise missile
 
01:19:56.310 --> 01:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
audit by the u.s department of labor
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
and unlike
 
01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:00.719 align:start position:0%
most audits
 
01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
seen for years that
 
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
those inspectors are looking to bust us
 
01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
for something
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
um and in fact representative sykes
 
01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:12.629 align:start position:0%
um and in fact representative sykes
question

01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
what they're doing is looking to punish
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
us for taking jobs away from worthy
 
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
americans and giving them to offshore
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
workers which whether it's we may find
 
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
that ludicrous and even offensive but it
 
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't really matter so it was it was a
 
01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
u.s department of labor inspection
 
01:20:30.239 --> 01:20:31.350 align:start position:0%
u.s department of labor inspection
that

01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh was announced two days before it came
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
um we opened all of our books they had
 
01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
access to all of our vehicles and all of
 
01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
our buildings and they have the right to
 
01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
interview the crew without anyone
 
01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:44.629 align:start position:0%
interview the crew without anyone
present

01:20:44.629 --> 01:20:44.639 align:start position:0%
present
 
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
01:20:48.629 --> 01:20:48.639 align:start position:0%
fortunately i wasn't there my wife was
 
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
there i think our fines might have been
 
01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
a little higher if i'd been there
 
01:20:52.239 --> 01:20:53.189 align:start position:0%
a little higher if i'd been there
but

01:20:53.189 --> 01:20:53.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
but uh uh
 
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
and the money went to the u.s department
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
and where they're from and get wet i
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
have no idea sir
 
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
do you want to follow up vote
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
the the violation was a new hampshire
 
01:21:12.550 --> 01:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
law correct
 
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
the violation was the observation that
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
that our
 
01:21:23.189 --> 01:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
the laws of my state of new hampshire
 
01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
did not allow a driver
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
a a a a temporary
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
alien driver
 
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
to drive on the on their own license but
 
01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
that it that it required
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
that these people get new hampshire
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses which would be pretty
 
01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
tough because they're not new hampshire
 
01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
residents um
 
01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
anyway that's yes it was a new hampshire
 
01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
statute apparently
 
01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
or the absence of one the absence of a
 
01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law and and
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
is there any uh restriction if you if
 
01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
they were driving
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
on farm property
 
01:21:59.189 --> 01:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
and there's no restriction
 
01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
there's no distinction made for
 
01:22:04.149 --> 01:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
locally versus
 
01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
no anywhere
 
01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
we don't worry about driver's licenses
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
when we're driving
 
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
tractors on farm property we worry only
 
01:22:17.110 --> 01:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
about competence
 
01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
but once we go out on the public
 
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
highways whether they're
 
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
local state or federal
 
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
roads um
 
01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:26.790 align:start position:0%
roads um
we

01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
we understand that you're required to
 
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
have a license to drive on those roads
 
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
but again we have always understood
 
01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
that a a a valid foreign driver's
 
01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:38.719 align:start position:0%
license written in beautifully clear
 
01:22:40.709 --> 01:22:40.719 align:start position:0%
english current
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
was was sufficient
 
01:22:44.950 --> 01:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
cnn thank you very much thank you thank
 
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:51.040 align:start position:0%

farm bureau in support of the bill
 
01:22:59.350 --> 01:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
looking for four to five minutes but if
 
01:23:00.550 --> 01:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
you could shorten that up a little bit
 
01:23:02.629 --> 01:23:02.639 align:start position:0%
it would be appreciated okay mr chef
 
01:23:04.149 --> 01:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for the record rob johnson
 
01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
representing the new hampshire farm
 
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
bureau as a federation's policy director
 
01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:09.189 align:start position:0%
bureau as a federation's policy director
we

01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
we asked
 
01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
this bill to be introduced after the
 
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
incident with with mr wood last fall and
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
we approached senator waters as we were
 
01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
at the house deadline it closed and and
 
01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh he had he had served on a study
 
01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
committee that looked at the licensure
 
01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
of non-citizen drivers that on recent
 
01:23:27.030 --> 01:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
history what i wanted to do mr chairs is
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
give you a little brief on the what the
 
01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
h2a program is
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's a federal program
 
01:23:33.910 --> 01:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
administered by the u.s department of
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
labor homeland security and the state
 
01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
department so these workers are vetted
 
01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
by three agencies
 
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
it started in 1952 as an h2 program in
 
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
in 1986 which is named towards h2a
 
01:23:48.629 --> 01:23:48.639 align:start position:0%
it allows agricultural workers who lack
 
01:23:51.030 --> 01:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me agriculture employers who lack
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
available domestic workers to bring
 
01:23:54.390 --> 01:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
foreign workers to the to the u.s to
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
perform and it's for seasonal work
 
01:23:58.870 --> 01:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
that's tied to a certain time frame
 
01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
of year an event or pattern or temporary
 
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
work lasting less than a year
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
and it includes primarily as planting
 
01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
cultivating and harvesting of crops
 
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
ag employers they must post the job
 
01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
outlining the terms and conditions of
 
01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:13.990 align:start position:0%
outlining the terms and conditions of
employment

01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
employment
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
they have to advertise locally
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
and the employers pay the cost for
 
01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
travel of the employees to the to the
 
01:24:23.189 --> 01:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
united states and in their housing while
 
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
they're here
 
01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
and also they pay their workers comp
 
01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
and they must they have to follow a play
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
at minimum it's what is referred to as
 
01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
an uh adverse effect wage rate
 
01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
and it varies by state in in new
 
01:24:39.310 --> 01:24:39.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire and in in this region it's now
 
01:24:42.390 --> 01:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
1566 an hour
 
01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
there are nationwide we're talking over
 
01:24:47.910 --> 01:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
300 000 h2a workers that are certified
 
01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:50.719 align:start position:0%
uh that were in in 2021.
 
01:24:53.110 --> 01:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
um and that that's a huge jump back in
 
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
2013 it was about a hundred thousand
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we're only talking
 
01:24:59.510 --> 01:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
about my best guess is in the range of
 
01:25:02.629 --> 01:25:02.639 align:start position:0%
200 to 250 workers
 
01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
on about 40 farms the the largest being
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
we have a couple farms that are in the
 
01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:10.390 align:start position:0%
we have a couple farms that are in the
uh

01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
and as mr woods said
 
01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
it it uh
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
it not only provides
 
01:25:22.709 --> 01:25:22.719 align:start position:0%
our farms with with we're farm workers
 
01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
the incident that mr wood experienced
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
again but i want to stress that it was
 
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
an audit it wasn't where the the
 
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
employee was out driving it was it was a
 
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
paper audit and it's from our
 
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
knowledge it's the second farm in the
 
01:25:42.629 --> 01:25:42.639 align:start position:0%
states that's been cited and again it
 
01:25:44.709 --> 01:25:44.719 align:start position:0%
was because they were not following as
 
01:25:47.110 --> 01:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
the question was asked it was state law
 
01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
and and we're getting just simply asking
 
01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
for reciprocity here
 
01:25:54.229 --> 01:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll i'll finish up with saying i
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
mean it is in order for the
 
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
um to to to get a
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
if they don't have if we don't have this
 
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
reciprocity then our employers then have
 
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
to take the workers and the only place
 
01:26:08.310 --> 01:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
that does it in state is at the concord
 
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh dmv and it's a it's a burden uh to
 
01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
you know spend a day doing that i'll
 
01:26:14.790 --> 01:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
i'll leave it at that mr chairman thank

01:27:20.470 --> 01:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
with coming to concord the dmv a full
 
01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:21.510 align:start position:0%
with coming to concord the dmv a full
day

01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
jeff and i have talked about some
 
01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
different opportunities there to uh
 
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
either in newport to cut down on the
 
01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
travel time or other opportunities maybe
 
01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
to even go to some of the locations um
 
01:27:33.189 --> 01:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
depending on the the number of workers
 
01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
that are there so we're we're open to
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
that anything we can do to assist
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
a few things that have uh that have been
 
01:27:40.629 --> 01:27:40.639 align:start position:0%
highlighted um
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
263 39a
 
01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
which already establishes parameters for
 
01:27:47.669 --> 01:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
international students at colleges and
 
01:27:50.149 --> 01:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
universities and the fact that
 
01:27:52.709 --> 01:27:52.719 align:start position:0%
you know upon 60 days of residency in
 
01:27:53.669 --> 01:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire you have to get a new
 
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire driver's license
 
01:27:58.149 --> 01:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
the same thing for guest workers
 
01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:00.639 align:start position:0%
so this bill appears to
 
01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
carve out from an industry standard um a
 
01:28:06.149 --> 01:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
little different scenario for for one
 
01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
industry versus um another industry and
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
so that that would just be one thing
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
that that we would highlight the other
 
01:28:12.629 --> 01:28:12.639 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we notice in the
 
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
bill is when you talk about driver's
 
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
licenses from other countries
 
01:28:19.189 --> 01:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
reciprocity issues and we don't have
 
01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
reciprocity with very many countries so
 
01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
what are the standards for that person
 
01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
having a driver's license from a
 
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
different country and then driving on
 
01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
the roads here in new hampshire for an
 
01:28:31.110 --> 01:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
indefinite period of time
 
01:28:33.189 --> 01:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
beyond the 60 days because they're
 
01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
working in a particular industry
 
01:28:38.709 --> 01:28:38.719 align:start position:0%
and so i think
 
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
what we would like to do is work with
 
01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
the the farming industry here we want to
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
see it thrive we certainly don't want to
 
01:28:47.189 --> 01:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
be an obstacle to any of the uh the work
 
01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
that's going on here but that being said
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
those are just some things that we would
 
01:28:51.430 --> 01:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
want to bring to the committee's
 
01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
attention and we'll take any questions
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
and certainly would be interested in the
 
01:28:57.270 --> 01:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
sidebar with the gentlemen that are here
 
01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:01.590 align:start position:0%
sidebar with the gentlemen that are here
today

01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:03.030 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:29:05.669 --> 01:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
question can you just give us a little
 
01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
more information about
 
01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
if the international it was testimony
 
01:29:12.629 --> 01:29:12.639 align:start position:0%
that the uh worker had an international
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
driver's license does that actually
 
01:29:18.870 --> 01:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
count for anything here in new hampshire
 
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative the international driver
 
01:29:23.830 --> 01:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
permit is simply in an interpretation of
 
01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
the current license that you hold and as
 
01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
a matter of fact they're offered by aaa
 
01:29:30.629 --> 01:29:30.639 align:start position:0%
it's not a licensing entity there is no
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
standard set forth we have a very
 
01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:34.629 align:start position:0%
standard set forth we have a very
uh

01:29:34.629 --> 01:29:34.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:29:36.629 --> 01:29:36.639 align:start position:0%
i would say strict and regimented driver
 
01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
licensing process throughout the united
 
01:29:40.229 --> 01:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
states and canada and that's why we have
 
01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
that reciprocal agreement with canada
 
01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
but the international license is just an
 
01:29:45.669 --> 01:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the card you hold in
 
01:29:47.590 --> 01:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
your hand and that be something that you
 
01:29:49.110 --> 01:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
would do before you take a vacation or
 
01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:56.629 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
um

01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
gentlemen thank you for taking my
 
01:29:59.669 --> 01:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
question i just want to be clear about
 
01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
this though
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
is it not true that
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
you can only get an international
 
01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
driver's license from the country from
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
which you come from in other words if
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
one of
 
01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
poverty lane workers came here they
 
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
could could not get an international
 
01:30:17.669 --> 01:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
driver's license from aaa here in the
 
01:30:19.910 --> 01:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
u.s they would have to do that in their
 
01:30:21.669 --> 01:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
own country that's my understanding
 
01:30:23.910 --> 01:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
correct and not all countries and a
 
01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up please
 
01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
and not all countries
 
01:30:29.830 --> 01:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
have programs
 
01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
as like the aaa where an international
 
01:30:34.149 --> 01:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
driver's license could be obtained
 
01:30:38.149 --> 01:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative hill
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:44.709 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

01:30:44.709 --> 01:30:44.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
is there
 
01:30:48.629 --> 01:30:48.639 align:start position:0%
any opportunity to um
 
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
create a driving permit rather than a
 
01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
license um for that period of time that
 
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
that known period of time that they've
 
01:30:59.669 --> 01:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
signed up for this
 
01:31:02.229 --> 01:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
and and whether it would be able to be
 
01:31:05.350 --> 01:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
issued for the purpose of their their
 
01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
work rather than a um
 
01:31:08.790 --> 01:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
the weekend trips places is that is that
 
01:31:13.110 --> 01:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
even possible within our current
 
01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
structure that already exists that's
 
01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
what we do today so the length of your
 
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
visa determines the length of your
 
01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:19.510 align:start position:0%
visa determines the length of your
license

01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
so if you're a permanent resident card
 
01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
holder you would get the standard
 
01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
five-year license because those are
 
01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
typically good for 10 years or greater
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
if you're hearing a temporary work or
 
01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
student visa would be for the term that
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
you're going to be in school or the term
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
that you're going to be employed by a
 
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
particular company so in this instance
 
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
if you were to be employed for the
 
01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
growing season that would be the length
 
01:31:41.189 --> 01:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
of the license that we would give you
 
01:31:46.149 --> 01:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up follow-up so what does
 
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
this do that that that we don't
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
currently have
 
01:31:54.149 --> 01:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
this would take our driver licensing
 
01:31:55.830 --> 01:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
process out of the system you wouldn't
 
01:31:57.510 --> 01:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
test here we wouldn't maintain your
 
01:31:59.110 --> 01:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
driving record
 
01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be paying attention to
 
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily what you're doing it would
 
01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
fall back on that home country or that
 
01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and i think to what the
 
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
director was pointing to is if we don't
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
have a reciprocal agreement i heard
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
jamaica used earlier if there were
 
01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
infractions that happened on that
 
01:32:16.149 --> 01:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
international license we have no way of
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
reporting that back to your home country
 
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
if we maintain your driving record
 
01:32:24.550 --> 01:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
because we license you we have a way to
 
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
track and maintain your driving record
 
01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
for purposes of maybe at some point the
 
01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
points get too high and we have to take
 
01:32:32.709 --> 01:32:32.719 align:start position:0%
that license
 
01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
maybe it counts towards insurance
 
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
ratings or those things but when you go
 
01:32:38.709 --> 01:32:38.719 align:start position:0%
to this where there is no reporting
 
01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
method back to those countries we don't
 
01:32:45.270 --> 01:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:49.669 align:start position:0%
any other questions
representative

01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
in that particular instance would these
 
01:32:57.430 --> 01:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
farm workers need to apply and get a
 
01:32:59.430 --> 01:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
driver's license every single year that
 
01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
they return to work
 
01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
they have to go through the application
 
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
process absolutely
 
01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
the testing process would be something
 
01:33:08.229 --> 01:33:08.239 align:start position:0%
that would be done initially and for
 
01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
somebody that's coming here every year
 
01:33:11.910 --> 01:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have to do the test every
 
01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:14.950 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have to do the test every
year

01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
they would just have to fill out another
 
01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
application and pay the fees or whatever
 
01:33:22.950 --> 01:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
is involved correct
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:33:25.679 --> 01:33:26.790 align:start position:0%
any other questions
representative

01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
does the does the doe a dol or anyone
 
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
when when people are approved to come
 
01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
here for agricultural purposes do they
 
01:33:41.110 --> 01:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
ever issue driving permits or anything
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
like that we are the only authority to
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
issue driver licenses here in the state
 
01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:48.149 align:start position:0%
issue driver licenses here in the state
insane

01:33:48.149 --> 01:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:50.790 --> 01:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
yeah and i i guess just a different
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
angle of looking at it i mean obviously
 
01:33:55.590 --> 01:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we we consider driving
 
01:33:57.030 --> 01:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
a privilege
 
01:33:58.390 --> 01:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
and if you
 
01:34:00.629 --> 01:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
violate any of the laws you can lose
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
that privilege
 
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
and lose your new hampshire driver's
 
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
license if this were to become law
 
01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
how would you be able to or what would
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
you be
 
01:34:12.149 --> 01:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
removing from somebody who broke the law
 
01:34:14.229 --> 01:34:14.239 align:start position:0%
with an uh say out of
 
01:34:16.390 --> 01:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
united states license
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's a great question without having a
 
01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
reciprocal agreement there is nothing
 
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
that we could do
 
01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
seeing and thank you again both um
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%

01:38:32.070 --> 01:38:32.080 align:start position:0%

thank mr chairman senator david waters
 
01:38:38.709 --> 01:38:38.719 align:start position:0%
district four to introduce senate bill
 
01:38:38.719 --> 01:38:39.910 align:start position:0%
district four to introduce senate bill
389

01:38:39.910 --> 01:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
389
 
01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
defining mobile service garages and
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
relative to vehicle inspections this
 
01:38:47.109 --> 01:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
might be a little deja vu for folks um
 
01:38:48.790 --> 01:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
this version of this bill was before you
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
before and then as they say you got
 
01:38:53.109 --> 01:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
covertized right so you know kobet came
 
01:38:54.629 --> 01:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
and uh this
 
01:38:56.709 --> 01:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
this uh had come through the senate and
 
01:38:58.390 --> 01:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
it you know kind of happened to what
 
01:39:01.030 --> 01:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
happened to a lot of bills
 
01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
and so what the bill basically does is
 
01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
that it
 
01:39:06.550 --> 01:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
provides the
 
01:39:08.629 --> 01:39:08.639 align:start position:0%
definitions and the parameters so that
 
01:39:11.910 --> 01:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
the mobile service garage can do state
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle inspections
 
01:39:16.870 --> 01:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
now for that purpose um the other
 
01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
language is here we're going to hear i
 
01:39:20.950 --> 01:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
hope you'll call peter bragdon next
 
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
about the garage and get out there to
 
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
take a look at one on the state house
 
01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
state house plaza but what these would
 
01:39:30.070 --> 01:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
be done is be brought in under contract
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
with a private employer for the
 
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
convenience of their employees so they
 
01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
can get this inspection work and maybe
 
01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
other work done in their car at the at
 
01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
the place of place of work so that's the
 
01:39:43.590 --> 01:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
convenience involved but um if it's
 
01:39:45.109 --> 01:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
going to be authorized then we had to
 
01:39:46.629 --> 01:39:46.639 align:start position:0%
make darn sure
 
01:39:48.310 --> 01:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
in the definitions and in the other
 
01:39:50.229 --> 01:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
parts of the language that this really
 
01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
did function the way any other garage
 
01:39:55.109 --> 01:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
would function and would have the
 
01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
inspections would have the internet
 
01:39:59.109 --> 01:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
capabilities for
 
01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
the reporting of information on um you
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
know exhaust fumes and the other things
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
you have to report when you're doing a
 
01:40:08.709 --> 01:40:08.719 align:start position:0%
state estate inspection um and that
 
01:40:10.709 --> 01:40:10.719 align:start position:0%
basically is recognizing that we need a
 
01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:12.159 align:start position:0%
level playing field that if this is
 
01:40:13.270 --> 01:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
going to be mobile rather than a
 
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
stationary garage you need to make sure
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
can perform these functions
 
01:40:20.310 --> 01:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
um so you'll see that's why all the
 
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
definitions here you've got to be able
 
01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
you've got to be able to take care of
 
01:40:29.350 --> 01:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
any hazardous wastes
 
01:40:31.510 --> 01:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
that might be involved in a garage
 
01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:32.950 align:start position:0%
that might be involved in a garage
operation

01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
operation
 
01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
function gps tracking advice so that the
 
01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
inspectors if they want to do us
 
01:40:38.790 --> 01:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
inspection the
 
01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
folks at motor vehicles know where they
 
01:40:42.709 --> 01:40:42.719 align:start position:0%
are and do their surprise
 
01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
inspection if they want to do that the
 
01:40:46.629 --> 01:40:46.639 align:start position:0%
internet connectivity have to make sure
 
01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
they have that so that the continuous
 
01:40:51.030 --> 01:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
data can be reported as it as is
 
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
required to be on certain kinds of
 
01:40:55.830 --> 01:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
tests performed on the
 
01:40:58.950 --> 01:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
on the engine and then is large enough
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
as you'll see out there
 
01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:01.830 align:start position:0%
as you'll see out there
to

01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:41:05.430 --> 01:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
have a capacity to handle vehicles um
 
01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
appropriately or work an appropriately
 
01:41:10.229 --> 01:41:10.239 align:start position:0%
wide work area um again these are some
 
01:41:11.910 --> 01:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
the statutory language kind of matches
 
01:41:13.510 --> 01:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
what we have for other for regular
 
01:41:17.109 --> 01:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
garages as well and is going to have
 
01:41:17.119 --> 01:41:18.870 align:start position:0%
garages as well and is going to have
insurance

01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
and is registered as a business has even
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
though this is mobile that there will be
 
01:41:25.669 --> 01:41:25.679 align:start position:0%
an actual
 
01:41:28.149 --> 01:41:28.159 align:start position:0%
office that's staffed so that again
 
01:41:30.149 --> 01:41:30.159 align:start position:0%
dmv and others can know where to go to
 
01:41:32.229 --> 01:41:32.239 align:start position:0%
an office and if there are documents and
 
01:41:34.229 --> 01:41:34.239 align:start position:0%
records that have to be
 
01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
looked at as as well
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
so then
 
01:41:39.910 --> 01:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
you know given those definitions and you
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
see the bold here the existing language
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
about inspections being authorized
 
01:41:46.629 --> 01:41:46.639 align:start position:0%
except as provided in paragraph 12 um so
 
01:41:49.109 --> 01:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
it means okay these kinds of facilities
 
01:41:51.750 --> 01:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
as defined up above can do this uh
 
01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:52.950 align:start position:0%
as defined up above can do this uh
inspection

01:41:52.950 --> 01:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
work and this is um how you do it and
 
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
these are the fees and that stuff is no
 
01:42:00.390 --> 01:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
different from what we do
 
01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:02.709 align:start position:0%
different from what we do
already

01:42:02.709 --> 01:42:02.719 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
and then into procedures and rules
 
01:42:07.350 --> 01:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
around this um the decision was that the
 
01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:08.149 align:start position:0%
around this um the decision was that the
the

01:42:08.149 --> 01:42:08.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
the director would be the person who
 
01:42:13.830 --> 01:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
would make sure that these kind of rules
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh and the methods of in
 
01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:17.669 align:start position:0%
uh and the methods of in
inspection

01:42:17.669 --> 01:42:17.679 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
um these aren't going to be driving
 
01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
around and poaching inspections from
 
01:42:23.430 --> 01:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
other folks it's going to be under
 
01:42:26.149 --> 01:42:26.159 align:start position:0%
contract with uh with an employer and on
 
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
that employer's
 
01:42:31.189 --> 01:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
premises and
 
01:42:31.199 --> 01:42:32.229 align:start position:0%
premises and
then

01:42:32.229 --> 01:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
the obd testing
 
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
ordinances should be displayed as they
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
are displayed in a regular garage
 
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i'll say one issue has come
 
01:42:43.270 --> 01:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
up here about the definition of mobile
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
service garage you'll see in lines three
 
01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:46.790 align:start position:0%
service garage you'll see in lines three
to

01:42:46.790 --> 01:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
five and then continuing
 
01:42:51.109 --> 01:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh there and and the question is raised
 
01:42:53.030 --> 01:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
by the the auto dealers was that well
 
01:42:54.550 --> 01:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
what's really mobile i mean if this
 
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
thing is going to be sitting there for
 
01:42:58.390 --> 01:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
six months to 12 months it's not really
 
01:42:59.590 --> 01:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
a mobile
 
01:43:02.070 --> 01:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
garage anymore it's a permanent garage
 
01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
and uh and that's a that's a good point
 
01:43:05.350 --> 01:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
so i think that we're gonna have some
 
01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
discussion about perhaps an amendment
 
01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
there that says you know maybe for a
 
01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
certain number of continuous calendar
 
01:43:13.990 --> 01:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
days um and i think that that would
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
provide some reassurance
 
01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:16.709 align:start position:0%
provide some reassurance
uh

01:43:16.709 --> 01:43:16.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
to motor vehicles and others that we're
 
01:43:21.030 --> 01:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
not you know just trying to create a new
 
01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
garage and it's going to be there
 
01:43:24.390 --> 01:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
forever that this has really meant that
 
01:43:26.070 --> 01:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
an employer can bring it in a large a
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
large employer can bring this in for the
 
01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
convenience of their employees or
 
01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise might have to have time off
 
01:43:33.750 --> 01:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
for work or deal with daycare or
 
01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
whatever to get their uh state
 
01:43:38.550 --> 01:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
inspection done so i will stop with that
 
01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
mr chairman we've got to take any
 
01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
questions but i do recommend that you
 
01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
call um mr bragdon
 
01:43:46.229 --> 01:43:46.239 align:start position:0%
next because uh he represents the
 
01:43:47.590 --> 01:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
the businesses and can tell you a lot of
 
01:43:50.070 --> 01:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
the technical details thank you
 
01:43:51.270 --> 01:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
committee representative oregon
 
01:43:56.229 --> 01:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
01:43:58.390 --> 01:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
well i'm thinking back to my days with a
 
01:44:00.229 --> 01:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
large employer in dover which was
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
measured progress which is now have some
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
other name having been acquired but
 
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
um they had
 
01:44:08.950 --> 01:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
they had like a large number of people
 
01:44:11.510 --> 01:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
on their campus as many uh
 
01:44:13.590 --> 01:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
many operations do who are either
 
01:44:15.430 --> 01:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
working for temp agencies or for
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
contractors and um
 
01:44:20.229 --> 01:44:20.239 align:start position:0%
this looks like this bill is written and
 
01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
this isn't the kind of thing that
 
01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
particular employer would have wanted to
 
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
offer its workers i don't think but um
 
01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
would only be able to offer that
 
01:44:28.229 --> 01:44:28.239 align:start position:0%
particular inspection service to people
 
01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
who are direct employees of the uh of
 
01:44:33.270 --> 01:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
the company
 
01:44:34.470 --> 01:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question and yes
 
01:44:36.310 --> 01:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's the idea yeah it has to be
 
01:44:38.870 --> 01:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
the you know contract with an employer
 
01:44:40.870 --> 01:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh you know the facility is just like
 
01:44:42.629 --> 01:44:42.639 align:start position:0%
you know just like a regular garage but
 
01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
the contract with the employer would
 
01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
specify that it's on the player's
 
01:44:47.669 --> 01:44:47.679 align:start position:0%
premises for that
 
01:44:50.470 --> 01:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
yeah that empowers employees so
 
01:44:52.709 --> 01:44:52.719 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thanks
 
01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:57.510 --> 01:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative fenton thank
 
01:44:59.430 --> 01:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
you senator waters i have a question on
 
01:45:01.109 --> 01:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
page two about
 
01:45:03.189 --> 01:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
the employers so if i'm a business of
 
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
one could i hire this
 
01:45:06.870 --> 01:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
mobile station to come what's stopping
 
01:45:09.590 --> 01:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
this mobile station from going to
 
01:45:11.430 --> 01:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
quote businesses of one non-stop instead
 
01:45:12.709 --> 01:45:12.719 align:start position:0%
of these large employers like you're
 
01:45:15.189 --> 01:45:15.199 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:45:16.709 --> 01:45:16.719 align:start position:0%
well thanks for your thanks for your
 
01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
question um
 
01:45:20.550 --> 01:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure anything the language
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
would prevent that but i will just
 
01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:24.149 align:start position:0%
would prevent that but i will just
would

01:45:24.149 --> 01:45:24.159 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:45:26.310 --> 01:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
note the economics of this you're going
 
01:45:28.709 --> 01:45:28.719 align:start position:0%
to hear from the business folks
 
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
and it's hard for me to imagine that it
 
01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
would be a good business plan
 
01:45:34.629 --> 01:45:34.639 align:start position:0%
to set this thing up and you know go see
 
01:45:37.109 --> 01:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
it you'll see you got to set it up um
 
01:45:39.189 --> 01:45:39.199 align:start position:0%
it's staffed and if you're going to do
 
01:45:41.510 --> 01:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
one car for i don't know how many
 
01:45:42.870 --> 01:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
dollars it is and then you're going to
 
01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
have to drive to another employer
 
01:45:47.189 --> 01:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
and drive to another
 
01:45:49.270 --> 01:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not really sure that's something
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
that one of these vehicles would do but
 
01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:54.070 align:start position:0%
that one of these vehicles would do but
um

01:45:54.070 --> 01:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:58.310 --> 01:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's my sense of it
 
01:46:00.709 --> 01:46:00.719 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
01:46:02.709 --> 01:46:02.719 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
 
01:46:02.719 --> 01:46:03.669 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
um

01:46:03.669 --> 01:46:03.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:03.679 --> 01:46:05.310 align:start position:0%
um
on

01:46:05.310 --> 01:46:05.320 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:46:10.070 --> 01:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
page 1 line 12 it says the
 
01:46:12.310 --> 01:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle needs to have a minimum overall
 
01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:17.669 --> 01:46:17.679 align:start position:0%
in my business
 
01:46:19.510 --> 01:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
if we have to haul something that's 12
 
01:46:22.229 --> 01:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
feet wide we have to have over over with
 
01:46:22.239 --> 01:46:23.510 align:start position:0%
feet wide we have to have over over with
permits

01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
permits
 
01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:24.310 align:start position:0%
permits
and

01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:26.790 --> 01:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
commercial licenses but i don't see any
 
01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
of that in the bill
 
01:46:30.229 --> 01:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question so if you go
 
01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
out there and take a look what it does
 
01:46:33.750 --> 01:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
is that when it arrives at a site it's a
 
01:46:36.629 --> 01:46:36.639 align:start position:0%
you know regular van
 
01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
the sides
 
01:46:41.109 --> 01:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
fold down
 
01:46:44.070 --> 01:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
and at the level of the lift floor
 
01:46:46.790 --> 01:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
and then a canopy goes up
 
01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
and then curtains come down so it's
 
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
fully enclosed
 
01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
but you got your width
 
01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
that way and then when it's folded up
 
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
it's just you know like a van going down
 
01:46:58.149 --> 01:46:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah thank you similar to a camper
 
01:47:02.550 --> 01:47:02.560 align:start position:0%

stands for rick mcclay is here with me
 
01:48:00.470 --> 01:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
as well who is the principal of tcsnh
 
01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:02.480 align:start position:0%

idea started as an idea from an mba
 
01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:16.709 align:start position:0%
idea started as an idea from an mba
student

01:48:16.709 --> 01:48:16.719 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.480 align:start position:0%

passenger vehicles uh within an enclosed
 
01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
area that was a little more portable
 
01:48:35.189 --> 01:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
the economics of it however and this
 
01:48:36.629 --> 01:48:36.639 align:start position:0%
goes to the question that representative
 
01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
fenton raised
 
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
these are very expensive capital
 
01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
investments to put one of these together
 
01:48:44.709 --> 01:48:44.719 align:start position:0%
and the economics don't make sense if
 
01:48:46.790 --> 01:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
you're going to move it around do one
 
01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle then move it somewhere else and
 
01:48:49.830 --> 01:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
do another vehicle
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make a lot of sense but where
 
01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
it does make a lot of sense is if you
 
01:48:56.709 --> 01:48:56.719 align:start position:0%
bring it to a large employer that has a
 
01:48:57.990 --> 01:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
lot of people
 
01:49:00.950 --> 01:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
at one place at one time and then can
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
schedule the vehicle services for those
 
01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
people as you see at the bottom of the
 
01:49:04.159 --> 01:49:05.189 align:start position:0%
people as you see at the bottom of the
handout

01:49:05.189 --> 01:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
handout
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
a number of large new hampshire
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
companies have used or currently use
 
01:49:11.910 --> 01:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
this including dartmouth's on their
 
01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:13.189 align:start position:0%
this including dartmouth's on their
hypertherm

01:49:13.189 --> 01:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
hypertherm
 
01:49:15.589 --> 01:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
harvard pilgrim healthcare has used it
 
01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
large employers when i was in the state
 
01:49:18.390 --> 01:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
senate the largest employer in my
 
01:49:19.830 --> 01:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
district was one of the largest in the
 
01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
states that being fidelity
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
with several hundred
 
01:49:25.990 --> 01:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
employed many hundreds of employees
 
01:49:27.430 --> 01:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
at one location
 
01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:30.719 align:start position:0%
and the company provided the ability to
 
01:49:32.790 --> 01:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
do this to its employees as a perk
 
01:49:35.109 --> 01:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
because how convenient is it for an
 
01:49:37.109 --> 01:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
employee not to have to worry about
 
01:49:39.030 --> 01:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
shuffling around on the weekends or
 
01:49:40.870 --> 01:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
moving cars around before after work or
 
01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
getting daycare while you move cars
 
01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:43.350 align:start position:0%
getting daycare while you move cars
around

01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:49:44.790 --> 01:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
it was very good for the employees
 
01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
obviously the employees paid for the car
 
01:49:48.790 --> 01:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
service but the fact that the employer
 
01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
made it available was a great was a
 
01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
great perk
 
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
and so in the course of doing this it
 
01:49:55.910 --> 01:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
was a great business model that took off
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
had a bit of a bump during covid when a
 
01:49:59.350 --> 01:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
lot of large companies started having
 
01:50:01.910 --> 01:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
people not work at the office anymore uh
 
01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
but that of course will will turn back
 
01:50:05.189 --> 01:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
around to some degree
 
01:50:07.189 --> 01:50:07.199 align:start position:0%
but the number one request that they had
 
01:50:09.270 --> 01:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
from their customers was hey while my
 
01:50:10.310 --> 01:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle is there and while you're
 
01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
changing the oil can you do a state
 
01:50:13.350 --> 01:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
inspection too
 
01:50:16.229 --> 01:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
as it turns out our state statutes on
 
01:50:18.149 --> 01:50:18.159 align:start position:0%
state inspections were developed at a
 
01:50:20.709 --> 01:50:20.719 align:start position:0%
time when uh the idea was a brick and
 
01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
mortar station so the the current rules
 
01:50:25.510 --> 01:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
and laws that we have on motor vehicle
 
01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:27.679 align:start position:0%
inspections contemplate there being a
 
01:50:29.910 --> 01:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
brick and mortar location so we worked
 
01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:30.790 align:start position:0%
brick and mortar location so we worked
with

01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:31.910 align:start position:0%
with
the

01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire department of
 
01:50:35.350 --> 01:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
safety division of motor vehicles
 
01:50:36.790 --> 01:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
and the auto dealers as well just in
 
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
terms of addressing some of their
 
01:50:39.270 --> 01:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
concerns and i'm sure they'll be
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
testifying afterwards i don't want to
 
01:50:42.390 --> 01:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
speak for them but i think the biggest
 
01:50:44.790 --> 01:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
concern was all right this is a nice
 
01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
concept but we certainly want to have a
 
01:50:49.589 --> 01:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
level playing field we don't want some
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
guy in a pickup truck with a bag of
 
01:50:53.830 --> 01:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
tools uh coming to a company and saying
 
01:50:55.990 --> 01:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
hang on doing your inspections so there
 
01:50:58.229 --> 01:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
has to be some criteria that make it as
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
similar process as it can be for a brick
 
01:51:02.149 --> 01:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
and mortar location and so if you look
 
01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
at the bill
 
01:51:04.950 --> 01:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
it's kind of set up that way first of
 
01:51:06.870 --> 01:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
all the first thing we do is define what
 
01:51:09.430 --> 01:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
a mobile service garage is uh senator
 
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
waters covered some of those things i
 
01:51:12.870 --> 01:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
think one of the the key things is roman
 
01:51:15.270 --> 01:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
numeral number one on on line six has to
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
have a lift involved you have to be able
 
01:51:19.589 --> 01:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
to pick up the vehicle to be able to
 
01:51:21.830 --> 01:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
look underneath it so a vehicle lift of
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
at least nine thousand pounds a guy in a
 
01:51:25.669 --> 01:51:25.679 align:start position:0%
pickup truck with a bag of tools is not
 
01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
gonna have that as a part of his uh his
 
01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:28.790 align:start position:0%
gonna have that as a part of his uh his
vehicle

01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
01:51:30.790 --> 01:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh various other things i'll point out
 
01:51:33.589 --> 01:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
line uh 12 which is roman numeral five i
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
think representative thompson asked this
 
01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
question about the uh that data there
 
01:51:41.350 --> 01:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
the current rules on inspection stations
 
01:51:44.470 --> 01:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
say they have to be 12 feet by 25 feet
 
01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
so again to make a level playing field
 
01:51:49.589 --> 01:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
we copied that um but yes the sides fold
 
01:51:51.030 --> 01:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
out the vehicle as it goes down the
 
01:51:53.430 --> 01:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
street is a typical trailer pulled by in
 
01:51:55.830 --> 01:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
this case the one out front is a
 
01:51:57.350 --> 01:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
1 500
 
01:51:58.870 --> 01:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
i assume it's a
 
01:52:00.390 --> 01:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
dodge 1500
 
01:52:03.430 --> 01:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
f150 i mean 3500 i'm sorry so um either
 
01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
an f-350 or a 3500 type pickup truck
 
01:52:08.229 --> 01:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
uh it's one ton truck
 
01:52:11.589 --> 01:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
so um so in the trailer uh when expanded
 
01:52:13.990 --> 01:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
when the sides come out uh is 12 feet by
 
01:52:15.589 --> 01:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
25 feet
 
01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
the the next one down roman numeral 6
 
01:52:19.350 --> 01:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
talks about unobstructed work areas
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
which is also addressed in the current
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
rule so tried to make these so they
 
01:52:25.030 --> 01:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
address all the rules that a brick and
 
01:52:26.709 --> 01:52:26.719 align:start position:0%
mortar inspection station would have to
 
01:52:29.669 --> 01:52:29.679 align:start position:0%
cover as well in addition line 16 talks
 
01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
about insurance policy with liability
 
01:52:34.470 --> 01:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
limits of a million dollars at least um
 
01:52:35.830 --> 01:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
and the business has to have an
 
01:52:37.510 --> 01:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
insurance policy those are actually
 
01:52:39.350 --> 01:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
requirements that do not apply to brick
 
01:52:40.709 --> 01:52:40.719 align:start position:0%
and mortar stations but they make a lot
 
01:52:44.470 --> 01:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
of sense and then importantly on line 22
 
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
the business that operates the mobile
 
01:52:48.070 --> 01:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
service garage has to have an office a
 
01:52:50.149 --> 01:52:50.159 align:start position:0%
physical office located somewhere that's
 
01:52:52.629 --> 01:52:52.639 align:start position:0%
staffed at regular posted hours
 
01:52:54.709 --> 01:52:54.719 align:start position:0%
and provides access to the state
 
01:52:56.470 --> 01:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
inspection records so the department of
 
01:52:58.149 --> 01:52:58.159 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles can go check and see
 
01:53:00.390 --> 01:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
what's been done but also importantly
 
01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
that has a schedule for the next seven
 
01:53:04.950 --> 01:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
days so a inspection officer can
 
01:53:07.589 --> 01:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
actually go pay an unannounced visit to
 
01:53:09.030 --> 01:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
one of these units
 
01:53:10.390 --> 01:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
and it could be anytime in the next
 
01:53:13.109 --> 01:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
seven days or it could not happen at all
 
01:53:14.470 --> 01:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
but they have the ability to look ahead
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
and see for the next seven days where
 
01:53:18.149 --> 01:53:18.159 align:start position:0%
they're going to be so they can help
 
01:53:19.669 --> 01:53:19.679 align:start position:0%
you know stop by and just check things
 
01:53:21.669 --> 01:53:21.679 align:start position:0%
out randomly so
 
01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh the rest of page one just deals with
 
01:53:27.830 --> 01:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
signage and then um the the last page
 
01:53:29.589 --> 01:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
deals with um
 
01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
how it works operationally and this is
 
01:53:33.430 --> 01:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
where it talks about line uh you know
 
01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
five and six says the director can
 
01:53:37.669 --> 01:53:37.679 align:start position:0%
establish allow these mobile service
 
01:53:40.709 --> 01:53:40.719 align:start position:0%
garages to do state inspections um
 
01:53:43.030 --> 01:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
seven and eight says has to be
 
01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
why the mobile service garage is at the
 
01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
employer's location uh and we don't have
 
01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
a problem by the way with any changes to
 
01:53:51.350 --> 01:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
that that might restrict it to a you
 
01:53:53.830 --> 01:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
know certain number of contiguous days
 
01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
it would certainly even for the largest
 
01:53:57.750 --> 01:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
company you'd be normal in five days
 
01:53:59.350 --> 01:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
because obviously the weekend things are
 
01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:00.790 align:start position:0%
because obviously the weekend things are
done

01:54:00.790 --> 01:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:54:03.589 --> 01:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
so uh item b there is the inspections
 
01:54:05.430 --> 01:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
can only be done on vehicles registered
 
01:54:07.830 --> 01:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
to employees of the company so i can't
 
01:54:10.229 --> 01:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
bring my neighbor's car uh to work with
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
me one day and have work done on them
 
01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
for that um if the company happens to
 
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
have vehicles that could be done on
 
01:54:18.790 --> 01:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
those vehicles as well though um and
 
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
then um
 
01:54:24.229 --> 01:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
the have to post the uh the costs and um
 
01:54:25.830 --> 01:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
that's the last part of it so try to
 
01:54:27.189 --> 01:54:27.199 align:start position:0%
make it a level playing field for
 
01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
existing auto dealers while also
 
01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
providing a service uh and a benefit to
 
01:54:33.270 --> 01:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
employees of large companies
 
01:54:35.109 --> 01:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
and uh i'd be happy to answer any
 
01:54:36.229 --> 01:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
questions or if you want to hear from mr
 
01:54:37.990 --> 01:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
mcclay first and we can both answer
 
01:54:41.109 --> 01:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:43.189 --> 01:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
we'll do questions first sure if there
 
01:54:46.629 --> 01:54:46.639 align:start position:0%
are any any questions from the committee
 
01:54:46.639 --> 01:54:48.229 align:start position:0%
are any any questions from the committee
representative

01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:54:49.830 --> 01:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:54:53.189 --> 01:54:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:56.790 --> 01:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
are these these mobile units how often
 
01:54:58.390 --> 01:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
well first of all
 
01:55:01.189 --> 01:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
who is certifies that
 
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:06.310 align:start position:0%
 
units

01:55:06.310 --> 01:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
units
 
01:55:08.070 --> 01:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
and how often are they a second question
 
01:55:09.350 --> 01:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
is how often
 
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
are they inspected
 
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
so the certification as of right now so
 
01:55:14.709 --> 01:55:14.719 align:start position:0%
these are currently operating doing
 
01:55:16.629 --> 01:55:16.639 align:start position:0%
regular maintenance on vehicles um and
 
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
there's a little to no regulation on
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
them for that regard in terms of
 
01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
performing state inspections they would
 
01:55:24.629 --> 01:55:24.639 align:start position:0%
have to be one authorized by the
 
01:55:27.510 --> 01:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
department of motor vehicles
 
01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:29.910 align:start position:0%
department of motor vehicles
and

01:55:29.910 --> 01:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:55:32.229 --> 01:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
then subject to all auditing and
 
01:55:34.950 --> 01:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
inspections that any car dealer or
 
01:55:37.189 --> 01:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
inspection station now would be and i
 
01:55:38.709 --> 01:55:38.719 align:start position:0%
don't know and i'm they're here to
 
01:55:40.470 --> 01:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
testify afterwards i'm not sure if
 
01:55:42.070 --> 01:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
there's a regular annual thing that has
 
01:55:43.669 --> 01:55:43.679 align:start position:0%
to happen or just subject to random
 
01:55:46.470 --> 01:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
inspections thank you
 
01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
01:55:49.270 --> 01:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
you have a question representative
 
01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:50.229 align:start position:0%
you have a question representative
horrigan

01:55:50.229 --> 01:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
horrigan
 
01:55:52.629 --> 01:55:52.639 align:start position:0%
yes or an opinion actually it's kind of
 
01:55:54.310 --> 01:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
a repeat of what i asked senator waters
 
01:55:56.470 --> 01:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
but you may be in better
 
01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
better position to answer it so i
 
01:55:59.270 --> 01:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
noticed in
 
01:56:01.589 --> 01:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
mr mclay's later letter he
 
01:56:03.910 --> 01:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
he uh mentioned he's been working with
 
01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:05.430 align:start position:0%
he uh mentioned he's been working with
um

01:56:05.430 --> 01:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:07.589 --> 01:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
at dartmouth-hitchcock medical center
 
01:56:08.790 --> 01:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
which is a place i've a little bit
 
01:56:10.629 --> 01:56:10.639 align:start position:0%
familiar with because i worked there for
 
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
a few months and that has
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
very many many different entities who
 
01:56:16.950 --> 01:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
employ people actually in my case i was
 
01:56:18.550 --> 01:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
just working for a temp agency but they
 
01:56:19.430 --> 01:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
have like
 
01:56:20.950 --> 01:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
dartmouth hitchcock medical center the
 
01:56:23.830 --> 01:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
dartmouth medical school a host of other
 
01:56:25.510 --> 01:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
entities so
 
01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:26.550 align:start position:0%
entities so
um

01:56:26.550 --> 01:56:26.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:28.950 --> 01:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
i guess you what we would envision is um
 
01:56:30.950 --> 01:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
they would probably they could probably
 
01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
would they be able to contract with uh
 
01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
multiple entities that are co-located at
 
01:56:37.270 --> 01:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
the same location if they're working at
 
01:56:39.430 --> 01:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
a place like that so that each each of
 
01:56:40.950 --> 01:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
those different um
 
01:56:43.109 --> 01:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
employers could contract separately with
 
01:56:45.109 --> 01:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
this vendor to provide the inspection
 
01:56:47.990 --> 01:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
services um
 
01:56:48.709 --> 01:56:48.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative horgan and i'll
 
01:56:53.109 --> 01:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
let rick if he wants to after he goes
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
through his
 
01:56:56.870 --> 01:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
testimony address that as it's written
 
01:56:58.790 --> 01:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
now it has to be certainly be it's one
 
01:57:02.550 --> 01:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
employer so if there are employees of a
 
01:57:03.990 --> 01:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
temporary employees that belong to
 
01:57:05.669 --> 01:57:05.679 align:start position:0%
another company they wouldn't be
 
01:57:07.510 --> 01:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
eligible as it's written and if it was
 
01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
dartmouth college versus
 
01:57:11.189 --> 01:57:11.199 align:start position:0%
dartmouth-hitchcock medical center
 
01:57:13.990 --> 01:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
then i believe those are two separate
 
01:57:16.149 --> 01:57:16.159 align:start position:0%
clients that we have and obviously with
 
01:57:18.470 --> 01:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
two distinct but
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:28.070 --> 01:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question follow
 
01:57:30.149 --> 01:57:30.159 align:start position:0%
up on rep horrigans so on the second
 
01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
page you said um
 
01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh only employers
 
01:57:36.629 --> 01:57:36.639 align:start position:0%
uh registered to the employee who's
 
01:57:39.589 --> 01:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
enforcing that
 
01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh that's a good question in fact that's
 
01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:42.070 align:start position:0%
uh that's a good question in fact that's
uh

01:57:42.070 --> 01:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:57:44.149 --> 01:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
that's a good question
 
01:57:47.350 --> 01:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
i don't know i don't know if there's a
 
01:57:49.350 --> 01:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
good way
 
01:57:51.669 --> 01:57:51.679 align:start position:0%
and i think the dmv had raised this in
 
01:57:52.870 --> 01:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
in the senate hearing and i think we
 
01:57:56.629 --> 01:57:56.639 align:start position:0%
discussed that a number of issues that
 
01:57:57.910 --> 01:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
are outstanding could be probably
 
01:57:59.750 --> 01:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
addressed by rules but that would be one
 
01:58:01.910 --> 01:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
of the trickier ones is you probably
 
01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
need the
 
01:58:06.629 --> 01:58:06.639 align:start position:0%
employer to somehow certify that
 
01:58:08.550 --> 01:58:08.560 align:start position:0%
employee ids would work a larger company
 
01:58:10.790 --> 01:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
obviously you'd have that situation so i
 
01:58:12.070 --> 01:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
ran a number of small companies and
 
01:58:17.030 --> 01:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:18.229 --> 01:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
it's a good rule-making issue though
 
01:58:19.510 --> 01:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question for the
 
01:58:22.390 --> 01:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:58:25.510 --> 01:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
good afternoon and uh thank you for
 
01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't this business have a somewhat
 
01:58:35.189 --> 01:58:35.199 align:start position:0%
limited um
 
01:58:35.199 --> 01:58:36.629 align:start position:0%
limited um
potential

01:58:36.629 --> 01:58:36.639 align:start position:0%
potential
 
01:58:38.310 --> 01:58:38.320 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:58:39.910 --> 01:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many companies there
 
01:58:41.270 --> 01:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
are in new hampshire currently and
 
01:58:43.350 --> 01:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
probably you do if you've done any
 
01:58:45.109 --> 01:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
market research
 
01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
that would avail themselves of this
 
01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:49.270 align:start position:0%
that would avail themselves of this
service

01:58:49.270 --> 01:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:58:50.709 --> 01:58:50.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i i
 
01:58:53.830 --> 01:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
personally don't know um and perhaps mr
 
01:58:55.830 --> 01:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
mcclay certainly isn't from the upper
 
01:58:57.350 --> 01:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
valley so he has a good sense of what's
 
01:58:58.870 --> 01:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
going on in the upper valley but yeah
 
01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
there are um you're talking you have to
 
01:59:02.870 --> 01:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
have a you know a certain base of
 
01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
employees to make this
 
01:59:06.470 --> 01:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh worthwhile for the mobile service
 
01:59:09.189 --> 01:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
garage to stop by for let's say a day uh
 
01:59:11.669 --> 01:59:11.679 align:start position:0%
and try to shoot them all in and i know
 
01:59:13.990 --> 01:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
that they currently do that different
 
01:59:15.430 --> 01:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
companies they will have it for
 
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
different periods of time so perhaps mr
 
01:59:18.790 --> 01:59:18.800 align:start position:0%
mcclay can address that as he talks
 
01:59:19.910 --> 01:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
about it
 
01:59:22.790 --> 01:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
and one follow-up sir follow-up
 
01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:24.550 align:start position:0%
and one follow-up sir follow-up
um

01:59:24.550 --> 01:59:24.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:26.229 --> 01:59:26.239 align:start position:0%
what is the uh
 
01:59:28.390 --> 01:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
what is the potential
 
01:59:30.550 --> 01:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
that you could do in a day with one of
 
01:59:33.189 --> 01:59:33.199 align:start position:0%
these units how many
 
01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
valid inspections could you do i'll let
 
01:59:37.189 --> 01:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
mr mcclay address that too as he goes
 
01:59:38.870 --> 01:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
through his presentation okay
 
01:59:40.229 --> 01:59:40.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that means i don't
 
01:59:40.239 --> 01:59:40.570 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that means i don't
know

01:59:40.570 --> 01:59:40.580 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:59:40.580 --> 01:59:43.030 align:start position:0%

02:00:01.589 --> 02:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:00:05.189 --> 02:00:05.199 align:start position:0%
the ability to offer employer partners
 
02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:06.719 align:start position:0%
their employees
 
02:00:10.229 --> 02:00:10.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire safety inspections
 
02:00:12.870 --> 02:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
look i've handed out i won't go through
 
02:00:15.589 --> 02:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
it line by line but i'm an automotive uh
 
02:00:18.070 --> 02:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
person i've owned new car dealerships in
 
02:00:19.510 --> 02:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
the state of vermont
 
02:00:21.830 --> 02:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
i've been certified for state inspection
 
02:00:23.430 --> 02:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
so i know a lot about
 
02:00:28.310 --> 02:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
how how all inspections work in 20
 
02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
2020 i had the opportunity to purchase
 
02:00:31.199 --> 02:00:32.070 align:start position:0%
2020 i had the opportunity to purchase
the

02:00:32.070 --> 02:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:00:34.470 --> 02:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
upper valley or the
 
02:00:36.390 --> 02:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
which is the only where i operated is
 
02:00:38.550 --> 02:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
out of the upper valley oh by the way i
 
02:00:43.669 --> 02:00:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
so in
 
02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:48.870 align:start position:0%
so in
in

02:00:48.870 --> 02:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
2020 i purchased this operation because
 
02:00:53.430 --> 02:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
i thought being a car person it was a
 
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
great thing for
 
02:00:57.189 --> 02:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
me i always had customers had to come to
 
02:00:57.199 --> 02:00:58.870 align:start position:0%
me i always had customers had to come to
me

02:00:58.870 --> 02:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
they in other words you build a building
 
02:01:02.229 --> 02:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
and they come to you and you spend all
 
02:01:03.990 --> 02:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
this money trying to get
 
02:01:05.669 --> 02:01:05.679 align:start position:0%
them to come to you
 
02:01:08.950 --> 02:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
so i like the concept of going to them
 
02:01:10.550 --> 02:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
i also like i
 
02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:11.430 align:start position:0%
i also like i
don't

02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
don't
 
02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:13.030 align:start position:0%
don't
i

02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:01:15.990 --> 02:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
we do some home visits we do detailing
 
02:01:18.870 --> 02:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
but we don't use big trailers for that
 
02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
we we don't use the big trailers for
 
02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
doing mechanical we have box trucks for
 
02:01:25.750 --> 02:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
that that go to mechanical for small you
 
02:01:27.430 --> 02:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
know one on
 
02:01:30.229 --> 02:01:30.239 align:start position:0%
the trailers are not good at all
 
02:01:33.669 --> 02:01:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:35.350 --> 02:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
a piecemeal
 
02:01:36.950 --> 02:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
the concept is you go somewhere where
 
02:01:39.109 --> 02:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
you can aggregate customers
 
02:01:41.189 --> 02:01:41.199 align:start position:0%
and those customers keep that trailer
 
02:01:43.030 --> 02:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
and that personnel assigned to that
 
02:01:45.510 --> 02:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
trailer uh busy
 
02:01:47.430 --> 02:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
because otherwise it's not economically
 
02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:48.629 align:start position:0%
because otherwise it's not economically
feasible

02:01:48.629 --> 02:01:48.639 align:start position:0%
feasible
 
02:01:50.149 --> 02:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
to have that very expensive trailer
 
02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
sitting there doing nothing
 
02:01:55.030 --> 02:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh so our challenge is to try to find a
 
02:01:56.790 --> 02:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
way to aggregate
 
02:01:56.800 --> 02:01:57.990 align:start position:0%
way to aggregate
customers

02:01:57.990 --> 02:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
customers
 
02:02:00.470 --> 02:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh and as as
 
02:02:03.750 --> 02:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh peter had mentioned the this was uh
 
02:02:06.070 --> 02:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
this particular business model was born
 
02:02:09.669 --> 02:02:09.679 align:start position:0%
at dartmouth college at the tuck
 
02:02:12.310 --> 02:02:12.320 align:start position:0%
school of business
 
02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:13.430 align:start position:0%
school of business
and

02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
what they did is they came up with the
 
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
idea of
 
02:02:20.229 --> 02:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
having agreements with employers
 
02:02:22.870 --> 02:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
and the employer would want to do it as
 
02:02:24.950 --> 02:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
an hr in other words they'd want to do
 
02:02:26.709 --> 02:02:26.719 align:start position:0%
it as a benefit they could say well you
 
02:02:29.589 --> 02:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
work here we can get your car fixed
 
02:02:31.350 --> 02:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
along that line
 
02:02:33.750 --> 02:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
we don't bil our employer
 
02:02:36.310 --> 02:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
partners do not pay us
 
02:02:39.030 --> 02:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
the employees pay us
 
02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:40.149 align:start position:0%
the employees pay us
so

02:02:40.149 --> 02:02:40.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:02:43.030 --> 02:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
so we so we are able to work an
 
02:02:45.430 --> 02:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
agreement where they're willing to allow
 
02:02:48.229 --> 02:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
us to come on their facility
 
02:02:51.270 --> 02:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
with restrictions we do have uh fairly i
 
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
got i got one here
 
02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
our our partner agreement is i don't
 
02:02:59.270 --> 02:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
know how many pages this is but it's
 
02:03:01.990 --> 02:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
15 20 page 10 15 pages or something like
 
02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
that it's very legalistic it's it tries
 
02:03:09.030 --> 02:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
to foresee any possible problem
 
02:03:12.149 --> 02:03:12.159 align:start position:0%
it didn't foresee it doesn't foresee um
 
02:03:13.910 --> 02:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
being licensed by the state to do a
 
02:03:16.709 --> 02:03:16.719 align:start position:0%
particular restricted
 
02:03:19.830 --> 02:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
process or uh like the state inspection
 
02:03:22.870 --> 02:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
so when we enter so so we're already
 
02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
doing business with people for example
 
02:03:26.950 --> 02:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
today uh we communicate with our
 
02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
customers by text and software
 
02:03:30.629 --> 02:03:30.639 align:start position:0%
through an app
 
02:03:33.270 --> 02:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh this morning just might have been an
 
02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
act of god or something i don't know i
 
02:03:36.950 --> 02:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
got a text from a customer asking if
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
they could get a range first inspection
 
02:03:41.589 --> 02:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
this is not unusual
 
02:03:43.589 --> 02:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
so we already have people that come to
 
02:03:45.109 --> 02:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
us it'd be like
 
02:03:46.709 --> 02:03:46.719 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i was in vermont and i
 
02:03:48.390 --> 02:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
was inspect i was servicing a new
 
02:03:49.750 --> 02:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire car
 
02:03:52.229 --> 02:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
i couldn't do a new hampshire inspection
 
02:03:53.589 --> 02:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
in vermont
 
02:03:55.350 --> 02:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
so that vermont that new hampshire
 
02:03:57.109 --> 02:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
customer that was loyal to me had to go
 
02:03:59.510 --> 02:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire had to leave me so the
 
02:04:02.310 --> 02:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
same thing is true now i have loyal
 
02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:03.669 align:start position:0%
same thing is true now i have loyal
customers

02:04:03.669 --> 02:04:03.679 align:start position:0%
customers
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
um that
 
02:04:07.430 --> 02:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
are at employ most again we do some
 
02:04:09.669 --> 02:04:09.679 align:start position:0%
at-home stuff but not much
 
02:04:11.589 --> 02:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
these employers
 
02:04:13.030 --> 02:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
allow us
 
02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:15.430 align:start position:0%
allow us
um

02:04:15.430 --> 02:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
so what happens with that type of
 
02:04:19.510 --> 02:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
customer that is our loyal customer
 
02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:20.709 align:start position:0%
customer that is our loyal customer
they

02:04:20.709 --> 02:04:20.719 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:04:23.030 --> 02:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
we actually oftentimes have us look at
 
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
the car we do a health check and we find
 
02:04:28.550 --> 02:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
safety issues right and then they can
 
02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
either get it fixed but we can't put it
 
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
we can't inspect it we can't fail it or
 
02:04:35.430 --> 02:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
pass it we can only say this is a safety
 
02:04:36.950 --> 02:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
issue would you like your brakes are bad
 
02:04:41.270 --> 02:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
or you know that kind of thing so um um
 
02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
so what our customers have to do is
 
02:04:44.550 --> 02:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
either they get it fixed and they go to
 
02:04:46.470 --> 02:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
an inspection station and either it
 
02:04:48.790 --> 02:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
passes or it doesn't pass
 
02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh and then they've either got to get it
 
02:04:52.790 --> 02:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
fixed there so it's it's sort of
 
02:04:54.229 --> 02:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
in the long and short of it very
 
02:04:56.069 --> 02:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
inconvenient for the person who owns the
 
02:04:56.079 --> 02:04:57.030 align:start position:0%
inconvenient for the person who owns the
car

02:04:57.030 --> 02:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
car
 
02:05:00.069 --> 02:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
uh the the the employee of these uh
 
02:05:02.550 --> 02:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
business partners we have and i think
 
02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
i'll rather than ramble on i think i
 
02:05:06.149 --> 02:05:06.159 align:start position:0%
think it's to me it's about do you want
 
02:05:07.189 --> 02:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
me to try to answer some of these
 
02:05:09.109 --> 02:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
questions okay um
 
02:05:11.109 --> 02:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
so the employer partners is very
 
02:05:13.589 --> 02:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
structured uh and
 
02:05:13.599 --> 02:05:17.589 align:start position:0%
structured uh and
um

02:05:17.589 --> 02:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:18.870 --> 02:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
well first of all if you went to a
 
02:05:21.830 --> 02:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
single a person that had two employees
 
02:05:24.550 --> 02:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
and and and
 
02:05:25.810 --> 02:05:25.820 align:start position:0%
said here's a 15
 
02:05:25.820 --> 02:05:27.030 align:start position:0%
said here's a 15

lawyer
 
02:05:29.830 --> 02:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
agreement right
 
02:05:31.510 --> 02:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
he'd probably go no no we'll just we
 
02:05:33.189 --> 02:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
just come by and take you know inspect
 
02:05:35.030 --> 02:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
so we don't do that we would if they
 
02:05:36.870 --> 02:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
don't want to engage in our contract
 
02:05:39.350 --> 02:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
then we won't engage with them and
 
02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
there's no echo
 
02:05:42.390 --> 02:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
it's like going to somebody's house and
 
02:05:44.629 --> 02:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
doing two cars you could not afford to
 
02:05:46.310 --> 02:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
bring these trailers
 
02:05:49.510 --> 02:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
um to do that uh um the
 
02:05:52.550 --> 02:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
the question i think was um um
 
02:05:54.390 --> 02:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
so for example in the upper valley we
 
02:05:56.470 --> 02:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
have dartmouth college
 
02:05:57.750 --> 02:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
we have a separate agreement with
 
02:05:59.430 --> 02:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
dartmouth college
 
02:06:02.950 --> 02:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
we have a dartmouth uh dartmouth medical
 
02:06:05.270 --> 02:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
center um uh
 
02:06:06.629 --> 02:06:06.639 align:start position:0%
mary hitchcock
 
02:06:08.629 --> 02:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
we have a separate agreement
 
02:06:08.639 --> 02:06:09.830 align:start position:0%
we have a separate agreement
uh

02:06:09.830 --> 02:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:11.750 align:start position:0%
uh
dartmouth

02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
dartmouth
 
02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
mary hitchcock um dartmouth it's called
 
02:06:16.229 --> 02:06:16.239 align:start position:0%
dartmouth hitchcock so i've separate
 
02:06:17.750 --> 02:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
agreement with dartmouth
 
02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
that stands by itself and i have a
 
02:06:21.830 --> 02:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
separate agreement with uh hitchcock
 
02:06:25.589 --> 02:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
um and then they they have a aspect day
 
02:06:26.950 --> 02:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
in lebanon new hampshire which is
 
02:06:30.310 --> 02:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
another hospital which is operated by
 
02:06:33.030 --> 02:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
mary hitchcock i have an addendum to the
 
02:06:34.390 --> 02:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
mary hitchcock
 
02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
agreement that allows those people there
 
02:06:39.510 --> 02:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
at apd we have other companies that are
 
02:06:44.550 --> 02:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
listed hypertherm uh adamab uh by excel
 
02:06:44.560 --> 02:06:45.430 align:start position:0%
listed hypertherm uh adamab uh by excel
are

02:06:45.430 --> 02:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:06:48.709 --> 02:06:48.719 align:start position:0%
really small relatively s i mean
 
02:06:51.430 --> 02:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
they're not big uh hitchcock is big
 
02:06:54.229 --> 02:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
right and hitchcock would be the their
 
02:06:56.390 --> 02:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
5000 cars there three to five thousand
 
02:06:56.400 --> 02:06:57.510 align:start position:0%
5000 cars there three to five thousand
cars

02:06:57.510 --> 02:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
cars
 
02:06:59.350 --> 02:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
seven days a week we're open five days a
 
02:07:00.629 --> 02:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
week but
 
02:07:02.470 --> 02:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
that's the target
 
02:07:05.669 --> 02:07:05.679 align:start position:0%
that that particular large employer and
 
02:07:10.950 --> 02:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:13.750 --> 02:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
we pick up the cars at stake hitchcock
 
02:07:15.510 --> 02:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
or dartmouth
 
02:07:18.149 --> 02:07:18.159 align:start position:0%
we the car the key exchange is done
 
02:07:21.910 --> 02:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
through a kiosk which is on site
 
02:07:23.910 --> 02:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
so and they park
 
02:07:25.830 --> 02:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
in permitted parking in other words you
 
02:07:27.669 --> 02:07:27.679 align:start position:0%
can't park in any of those facilities
 
02:07:29.750 --> 02:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
without a permit in fact we even have
 
02:07:31.510 --> 02:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
shuttle vehicles that quite often get
 
02:07:34.550 --> 02:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
ticketed unless we put a sign in because
 
02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:35.270 align:start position:0%
ticketed unless we put a sign in because
that

02:07:35.270 --> 02:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:07:37.270 --> 02:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
identifies us because we have a multiple
 
02:07:39.510 --> 02:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
vehicles running around so we they don't
 
02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
require us to have a sticker for each
 
02:07:43.830 --> 02:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
vehicle but anyway so if a
 
02:07:45.990 --> 02:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
a citizen of
 
02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:46.709 align:start position:0%
a citizen of
a

02:07:46.709 --> 02:07:46.719 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:07:49.510 --> 02:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
town down the 30 miles away decided they
 
02:07:52.149 --> 02:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to pretend to be a
 
02:07:53.750 --> 02:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
hitchcock customer
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
they would have to park their car
 
02:07:57.830 --> 02:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
because you can't come our our stations
 
02:08:00.310 --> 02:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
we don't receive customers it's all
 
02:08:01.830 --> 02:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
it's all um
 
02:08:05.669 --> 02:08:05.679 align:start position:0%
no contact um so it's all done online uh
 
02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
we we
 
02:08:09.750 --> 02:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
in the case of the employee partners
 
02:08:12.149 --> 02:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
there's kiosk exchanges that they've so
 
02:08:14.229 --> 02:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
they've got not only got to park there
 
02:08:15.990 --> 02:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
they've got to get in the building and i
 
02:08:17.109 --> 02:08:17.119 align:start position:0%
don't know if you've been into any of
 
02:08:17.119 --> 02:08:18.149 align:start position:0%
don't know if you've been into any of
the

02:08:18.149 --> 02:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:08:20.229 --> 02:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
well i don't know here it seems easier
 
02:08:21.830 --> 02:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
to get in a building than it does back
 
02:08:21.840 --> 02:08:22.550 align:start position:0%
to get in a building than it does back
in

02:08:22.550 --> 02:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:08:24.870 --> 02:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
in hanover
 
02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
you can't get in in hitchcock you cannot
 
02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:28.149 align:start position:0%
you can't get in in hitchcock you cannot
get

02:08:28.149 --> 02:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
get
 
02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
you can't get three feet into the
 
02:08:31.030 --> 02:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
building before somebody's turning you
 
02:08:32.709 --> 02:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
away if you don't have an appointment
 
02:08:34.950 --> 02:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
hitchcock everything's dartmouth is all
 
02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
locked up i mean you know you can't
 
02:08:39.910 --> 02:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
anyways it's very restrictive the other
 
02:08:42.629 --> 02:08:42.639 align:start position:0%
travel which doesn't works well for us
 
02:08:46.310 --> 02:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
because we're no no we're no non-contact
 
02:08:47.990 --> 02:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
so i don't know uh so
 
02:08:50.229 --> 02:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
i think that they're all good questions
 
02:08:51.910 --> 02:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
and i think probably
 
02:08:54.149 --> 02:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
probably uh dmv will probably come up
 
02:08:56.709 --> 02:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
with some ways to word it so
 
02:08:58.790 --> 02:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
like i'm telling you what we do
 
02:09:00.870 --> 02:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
now this law would allow anybody to do
 
02:09:02.470 --> 02:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
what we do
 
02:09:05.910 --> 02:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
and i guess but we wouldn't have uh the
 
02:09:07.669 --> 02:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
inspection process was a question you
 
02:09:07.679 --> 02:09:08.629 align:start position:0%
inspection process was a question you
had

02:09:08.629 --> 02:09:08.639 align:start position:0%
had
 
02:09:10.870 --> 02:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
um it takes and i
 
02:09:13.189 --> 02:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
it takes an hour to an hour and a half
 
02:09:15.430 --> 02:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
to perform a state inspection
 
02:09:18.229 --> 02:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
um i suppose if it's a brand new car you
 
02:09:19.910 --> 02:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
might be able to trim that a bit
 
02:09:22.470 --> 02:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
right if it's an older car it could take
 
02:09:25.030 --> 02:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
longer so if you're working uh you
 
02:09:26.870 --> 02:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
usually these trailers only have one
 
02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:28.629 align:start position:0%
usually these trailers only have one
person

02:09:28.629 --> 02:09:28.639 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:09:31.430 --> 02:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
so and and he's got that one person's
 
02:09:34.310 --> 02:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
got to go get the cars right so he's if
 
02:09:36.069 --> 02:09:36.079 align:start position:0%
he's working eight hours
 
02:09:39.270 --> 02:09:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh he's probably got an hour or two just
 
02:09:40.870 --> 02:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
shuttling cars
 
02:09:43.350 --> 02:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
so i guess it leaves four or five right
 
02:09:44.790 --> 02:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:09:48.709 --> 02:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
and then of course if the car fails
 
02:09:51.109 --> 02:09:51.119 align:start position:0%
inspection it needs break work and other
 
02:09:51.119 --> 02:09:51.990 align:start position:0%
inspection it needs break work and other
stuff

02:09:51.990 --> 02:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh that that all take time so it's not
 
02:09:55.189 --> 02:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
like it's
 
02:09:57.270 --> 02:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
we we would we would probably assume
 
02:10:01.189 --> 02:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
we're gonna do one or two a day right um
 
02:10:01.199 --> 02:10:02.629 align:start position:0%
we're gonna do one or two a day right um
but

02:10:02.629 --> 02:10:02.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:10:04.550 --> 02:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
again it's it's um
 
02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
yeah we
 
02:10:06.950 --> 02:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
same sections don't really work that way
 
02:10:08.229 --> 02:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
you know you just don't line them up
 
02:10:10.390 --> 02:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
most most dealerships
 
02:10:11.990 --> 02:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
they're doing other stuff they're doing
 
02:10:14.149 --> 02:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
oil changes and they're doing whatever
 
02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh and then i think i don't know did i
 
02:10:17.990 --> 02:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
miss any i think you i think you've got
 
02:10:19.430 --> 02:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
all the questions i think you did a
 
02:10:20.870 --> 02:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
great job thank you
 
02:10:22.470 --> 02:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
um i think he did a good job answering
 
02:10:23.669 --> 02:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
all the questions that were raised
 
02:10:25.910 --> 02:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
before are there any others from the
 
02:10:25.920 --> 02:10:27.030 align:start position:0%
before are there any others from the
committee

02:10:27.030 --> 02:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:10:28.709 --> 02:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
representative gorski thank you mr
 
02:10:29.910 --> 02:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
02:10:31.910 --> 02:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
question yeah um you mentioned you know
 
02:10:34.149 --> 02:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
when inspection sometimes if it's brakes
 
02:10:35.750 --> 02:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
you can repair them but what happens if
 
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
it's uh a ball tire i don't think these
 
02:10:40.229 --> 02:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
trailers have you know tires for all
 
02:10:41.510 --> 02:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
vehicles so what would happen in that
 
02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:43.030 align:start position:0%
vehicles so what would happen in that
instance

02:10:43.030 --> 02:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
instance
 
02:10:45.510 --> 02:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
we don't have any parts on the trailer
 
02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
so what we have is local parts vendors
 
02:10:49.669 --> 02:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
we call them up or text them or order
 
02:10:52.069 --> 02:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
online tires brakes and they deliver
 
02:10:54.629 --> 02:10:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:56.470 --> 02:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
representative hill
 
02:10:58.870 --> 02:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um just a quick
 
02:11:00.950 --> 02:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
question um my
 
02:11:03.910 --> 02:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
my question is uh do you need um
 
02:11:06.870 --> 02:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
inter uh internet in order to connect
 
02:11:09.589 --> 02:11:09.599 align:start position:0%
with dmv or something like that and and
 
02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
how are you doing that in
 
02:11:13.109 --> 02:11:13.119 align:start position:0%
some of the areas that are
 
02:11:15.030 --> 02:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
somewhat spotty
 
02:11:17.430 --> 02:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
well again that goes to mobile if we're
 
02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:19.430 align:start position:0%
well again that goes to mobile if we're
out

02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:11:21.189 --> 02:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
if we're at a major employer the major
 
02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
employers especially the ones i'm
 
02:11:25.990 --> 02:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
talking about in my area they all have
 
02:11:28.629 --> 02:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
the internet is not a problem if i was
 
02:11:30.790 --> 02:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
go you know 20 miles out internet's a
 
02:11:33.589 --> 02:11:33.599 align:start position:0%
problem and we're not likely to go
 
02:11:37.270 --> 02:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
there's no big employers 20 miles out
 
02:11:39.030 --> 02:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
now we just
 
02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
our plan is to probably do what we do
 
02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:42.629 align:start position:0%
our plan is to probably do what we do
here

02:11:42.629 --> 02:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:48.470 --> 02:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
somewhere near nashua we'll have another
 
02:11:50.069 --> 02:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
operation that will start up in
 
02:11:52.629 --> 02:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
nashville that general area
 
02:11:55.589 --> 02:11:55.599 align:start position:0%
which have bigger employers and and
 
02:11:57.189 --> 02:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
some of the economics work out a little
 
02:11:58.629 --> 02:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
better than in the upper valley the
 
02:12:00.069 --> 02:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
reason it's in the upper valleys that's
 
02:12:02.390 --> 02:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
where it was started
 
02:12:05.189 --> 02:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:07.350 --> 02:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
i just have one question sometimes don
 
02:12:09.589 --> 02:12:09.599 align:start position:0%
needs to break over marblehead but
 
02:12:11.030 --> 02:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
you say you've been doing this you have
 
02:12:12.709 --> 02:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
contracts you have contracts with this
 
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
people those people these people how can
 
02:12:16.310 --> 02:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
you be doing all these inspections
 
02:12:18.709 --> 02:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
before we even pass this law
 
02:12:20.310 --> 02:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
we don't do inspections you're not so
 
02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%
you're doing all these agreements right
 
02:12:23.350 --> 02:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
now just for service yep
 
02:12:25.589 --> 02:12:25.599 align:start position:0%
really okay interesting
 
02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
 
02:12:31.189 --> 02:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
um i guess my question is how
 
02:12:33.990 --> 02:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
are your employees compensated is this
 
02:12:35.430 --> 02:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
piece work
 
02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:37.109 align:start position:0%
piece work
hourly

02:12:37.109 --> 02:12:37.119 align:start position:0%
hourly
 
02:12:40.870 --> 02:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
hourly hourly okay
 
02:12:42.470 --> 02:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's my question thank you very
 
02:12:44.069 --> 02:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
much thank you did you have your hand up
 
02:12:44.079 --> 02:12:45.430 align:start position:0%
much thank you did you have your hand up
representative

02:12:45.430 --> 02:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:12:46.950 --> 02:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question two
 
02:12:48.790 --> 02:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
quick questions how many companies are
 
02:12:51.030 --> 02:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
currently doing this right now are you
 
02:12:53.030 --> 02:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
the are you the sole company doing this
 
02:12:55.510 --> 02:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
doing state section doing this mobile
 
02:12:57.350 --> 02:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
no i think they're a lot but i mean
 
02:12:59.109 --> 02:12:59.119 align:start position:0%
around the country no i'm talking about
 
02:13:01.430 --> 02:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:13:03.669 --> 02:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
i don't know that i know we i don't know
 
02:13:06.310 --> 02:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
that i know that i know other people
 
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
have purchased trailers
 
02:13:09.750 --> 02:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
and what they're doing with them i don't
 
02:13:11.510 --> 02:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
know um but
 
02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:12.709 align:start position:0%
know um but
um

02:13:12.709 --> 02:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:14.390 --> 02:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
so i don't i don't know
 
02:13:15.990 --> 02:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
just one more one more question so you
 
02:13:18.310 --> 02:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
said you had one technician
 
02:13:20.629 --> 02:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
in the the van um brick and mortar
 
02:13:22.629 --> 02:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
stores often have a technician and then
 
02:13:24.149 --> 02:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
a service advisor double checks their
 
02:13:25.750 --> 02:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
work to make sure nothing was missed or
 
02:13:27.189 --> 02:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
make sure maybe they didn't need that
 
02:13:28.870 --> 02:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
part is there anyone double checking the
 
02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
work or is this the sole person saying
 
02:13:31.910 --> 02:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
hey you need brakes
 
02:13:33.270 --> 02:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
and maybe they missed something so it
 
02:13:34.870 --> 02:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
totally relies on them
 
02:13:37.589 --> 02:13:37.599 align:start position:0%
yeah the model is not a brick and mortar
 
02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
model it's not a we're not i'm not a
 
02:13:42.790 --> 02:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
brick i no longer have a brick operation
 
02:13:44.550 --> 02:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
some people may have a brick operation
 
02:13:46.870 --> 02:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
and they use the mobile as a way to
 
02:13:50.310 --> 02:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
retain customers or to be competitive or
 
02:13:52.870 --> 02:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
like i said if you could go if when i
 
02:13:54.550 --> 02:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
had brick if i had
 
02:13:56.550 --> 02:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
the trailer design and all the software
 
02:13:59.270 --> 02:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
and the processes to do this that would
 
02:14:01.189 --> 02:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
have been something i could have done
 
02:14:02.790 --> 02:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
so somebody could be in the brick
 
02:14:04.950 --> 02:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
business and then have the
 
02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question about
 
02:14:07.750 --> 02:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
personnel though
 
02:14:10.709 --> 02:14:10.719 align:start position:0%
so the model is that the trailer or the
 
02:14:13.030 --> 02:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
box truck or the van or whatever the
 
02:14:14.709 --> 02:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
person's working out of
 
02:14:14.719 --> 02:14:16.310 align:start position:0%
person's working out of
uh

02:14:16.310 --> 02:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:14:18.310 --> 02:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
the customer schedules their own
 
02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:19.430 align:start position:0%
the customer schedules their own
appointments

02:14:19.430 --> 02:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
appointments
 
02:14:20.950 --> 02:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
so we don't you don't call up and
 
02:14:23.109 --> 02:14:23.119 align:start position:0%
schedule an appointment you create a you
 
02:14:25.030 --> 02:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
go online you create a
 
02:14:27.510 --> 02:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
customer profile
 
02:14:28.709 --> 02:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
and you
 
02:14:29.910 --> 02:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
select from a
 
02:14:31.189 --> 02:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
list of
 
02:14:33.669 --> 02:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
services and you choose what you want
 
02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
and then you choose your schedule
 
02:14:37.830 --> 02:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
right so you don't sorry to interrupt
 
02:14:39.589 --> 02:14:39.599 align:start position:0%
that so the question was basically who's
 
02:14:41.589 --> 02:14:41.599 align:start position:0%
double checking the technician's work so
 
02:14:42.629 --> 02:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
we've had
 
02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
safety inspection bills come through and
 
02:14:46.390 --> 02:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
the issue was you know they're charging
 
02:14:47.750 --> 02:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
more for you know brakes when the car
 
02:14:49.189 --> 02:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
didn't need brakes who's checking this
 
02:14:50.709 --> 02:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
one individual
 
02:14:52.229 --> 02:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
doing the service if i can answer that
 
02:14:53.750 --> 02:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
forum just to save some time there are a
 
02:14:55.669 --> 02:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
lot of shops excuse me sir
 
02:14:57.030 --> 02:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of shops that are just
 
02:14:58.550 --> 02:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
individual proprietors as well there's
 
02:15:00.229 --> 02:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
nobody checking their work either so i
 
02:15:02.390 --> 02:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
don't know that this this this business
 
02:15:04.390 --> 02:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
i guess it would be me or my right
 
02:15:06.069 --> 02:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
exactly my mechanic nobody's checking
 
02:15:08.390 --> 02:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
over his uh his work yeah because we
 
02:15:10.069 --> 02:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
would know by complaining well we know
 
02:15:12.629 --> 02:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
if by complaints from customers
 
02:15:14.390 --> 02:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
if a customer was to complain to a third
 
02:15:16.550 --> 02:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
party let's say in this case dmv
 
02:15:19.270 --> 02:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
right the hope would be we knew about it
 
02:15:21.750 --> 02:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
before they had to complain to be in tv
 
02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
but sometimes customers
 
02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:24.470 align:start position:0%
but sometimes customers
um

02:15:24.470 --> 02:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:26.229 --> 02:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
are frustrated so they'll reach out to a
 
02:15:28.790 --> 02:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
higher power and then usually what
 
02:15:30.550 --> 02:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
happens is we get engaged with the
 
02:15:33.189 --> 02:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
customer and our people are human they
 
02:15:34.950 --> 02:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
make mistakes the question is whether
 
02:15:37.750 --> 02:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
they're mistakes that
 
02:15:39.510 --> 02:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
if they're reoccurring for example we
 
02:15:41.830 --> 02:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
would know dmv wouldn't know but if we
 
02:15:43.750 --> 02:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
know we have a problem with somebody
 
02:15:46.149 --> 02:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
then we have to manage it otherwise it
 
02:15:48.310 --> 02:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
becomes our problem and
 
02:15:50.790 --> 02:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
okay yeah thank you very much
 
02:15:52.950 --> 02:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
representative value
 
02:15:54.310 --> 02:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you for
 
02:15:57.030 --> 02:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question um do we really want
 
02:16:00.069 --> 02:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
to restrict this to just
 
02:16:01.669 --> 02:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
contracted services
 
02:16:02.950 --> 02:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
or i mean it sounds like it would be a
 
02:16:05.030 --> 02:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
great idea for like jiffy lube or
 
02:16:06.790 --> 02:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
dealers to
 
02:16:09.109 --> 02:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
get one of these vehicles and contract
 
02:16:10.709 --> 02:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
with walmart and set up in the parking
 
02:16:12.310 --> 02:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
lot and
 
02:16:15.430 --> 02:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
do a remote service on occasion
 
02:16:16.870 --> 02:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
do we really want to
 
02:16:18.709 --> 02:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
have some kind of a protectionist
 
02:16:20.149 --> 02:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
clause in there that restricts us to
 
02:16:23.350 --> 02:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
just that contracted services
 
02:16:26.229 --> 02:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question so uh this
 
02:16:28.310 --> 02:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
idea has come up before about and i
 
02:16:29.430 --> 02:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
remember a conversation with
 
02:16:30.870 --> 02:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
representative hunt
 
02:16:32.309 --> 02:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
who at the time i was in senate was one
 
02:16:34.549 --> 02:16:34.559 align:start position:0%
of my constituents out in rindge
 
02:16:34.559 --> 02:16:35.349 align:start position:0%
of my constituents out in rindge
and

02:16:35.349 --> 02:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:16:36.870 --> 02:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
he thought it'd be great if anybody
 
02:16:39.030 --> 02:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
could just do this um
 
02:16:40.790 --> 02:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
drive around with a trailer and a pickup
 
02:16:43.589 --> 02:16:43.599 align:start position:0%
truck and a box of tools so i understand
 
02:16:43.599 --> 02:16:44.469 align:start position:0%
truck and a box of tools so i understand
the

02:16:44.469 --> 02:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:16:46.469 --> 02:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
desire by some but it also has to be
 
02:16:48.150 --> 02:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
something that is
 
02:16:51.030 --> 02:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh the dmv feels that they can regulate
 
02:16:53.110 --> 02:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
and oversee and still maintains a level
 
02:16:55.830 --> 02:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
playing field so those are certainly
 
02:16:58.549 --> 02:16:58.559 align:start position:0%
ideas for consideration um
 
02:17:00.230 --> 02:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
but at least the the model that's
 
02:17:01.509 --> 02:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
currently being used seemed to be the
 
02:17:03.429 --> 02:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
one to imitate first and then see how
 
02:17:06.150 --> 02:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:07.750 --> 02:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
if i may miss the chair just addressed a
 
02:17:09.589 --> 02:17:09.599 align:start position:0%
couple of things that came up quickly so
 
02:17:10.870 --> 02:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
are there others in new hampshire that
 
02:17:13.110 --> 02:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
are doing this so prior to covid uh the
 
02:17:14.709 --> 02:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
company that founded this the the
 
02:17:16.389 --> 02:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
company that came out of dartmouth tuck
 
02:17:18.790 --> 02:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
school of business was called zipity
 
02:17:20.629 --> 02:17:20.639 align:start position:0%
and they were doing work in the upper
 
02:17:23.509 --> 02:17:23.519 align:start position:0%
valley in the nashua area the seacoast
 
02:17:26.309 --> 02:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
area also massachusetts and texas
 
02:17:29.349 --> 02:17:29.359 align:start position:0%
when the pandemic hit um business
 
02:17:32.709 --> 02:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
uh dried up uh or significantly um and
 
02:17:34.629 --> 02:17:34.639 align:start position:0%
they carved off very various pieces of
 
02:17:36.150 --> 02:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
it and so rick's company now has the
 
02:17:38.469 --> 02:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
upper valley area other people have
 
02:17:41.349 --> 02:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
bought other units uh what they plan to
 
02:17:42.790 --> 02:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
do with them i don't know but i'm gonna
 
02:17:44.230 --> 02:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
guess if they've invested in the units
 
02:17:46.309 --> 02:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
they plan to use them uh and some of
 
02:17:47.589 --> 02:17:47.599 align:start position:0%
them i know have been bought by actual
 
02:17:50.389 --> 02:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
dealerships um so there are others going
 
02:17:51.589 --> 02:17:51.599 align:start position:0%
on in new hampshire whether they're
 
02:17:52.870 --> 02:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
active now or not i think they're
 
02:17:55.429 --> 02:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
preparing to be and that regards the
 
02:17:57.110 --> 02:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
question about internet connectivity
 
02:17:59.270 --> 02:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's why line 11 is there on the first
 
02:18:01.349 --> 02:18:01.359 align:start position:0%
page uh it has to have internet
 
02:18:03.429 --> 02:18:03.439 align:start position:0%
connectivity to be able to do state
 
02:18:05.349 --> 02:18:05.359 align:start position:0%
inspections if it doesn't can't do state
 
02:18:05.359 --> 02:18:10.230 align:start position:0%
inspections if it doesn't can't do state
inspections

02:18:10.230 --> 02:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:13.750 --> 02:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:16.309 --> 02:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh next up fair recognizes dan bennett
 
02:18:17.509 --> 02:18:17.519 align:start position:0%
from the hampshire auto dealers
 
02:18:17.519 --> 02:18:18.790 align:start position:0%
from the hampshire auto dealers
association

02:18:18.790 --> 02:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
association
 
02:18:20.309 --> 02:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill looking for two
 
02:18:20.319 --> 02:18:25.030 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill looking for two
minutes

02:18:25.030 --> 02:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:28.870 --> 02:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:33.990 --> 02:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:35.509 --> 02:18:35.519 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon or morning member of
 
02:18:36.709 --> 02:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
the committee dan bennett new hampshire
 
02:18:38.469 --> 02:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
auto dealers association as you know our
 
02:18:40.309 --> 02:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
trade association representing the motor
 
02:18:41.589 --> 02:18:41.599 align:start position:0%
vehicle industry
 
02:18:44.790 --> 02:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
about 500 businesses um statewide both
 
02:18:47.190 --> 02:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
franchised and independent folks in the
 
02:18:49.270 --> 02:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle industry um
 
02:18:52.709 --> 02:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
so we do support sb389 um but with a
 
02:18:55.190 --> 02:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
concern or suggestion that senator wan
 
02:18:57.589 --> 02:18:57.599 align:start position:0%
waters mentioned earlier um we do
 
02:19:00.629 --> 02:19:00.639 align:start position:0%
appreciate all the um the amendments and
 
02:19:02.549 --> 02:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
changes and considerations that have
 
02:19:04.790 --> 02:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
have been made in this bill over the
 
02:19:06.549 --> 02:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
three or so years that it's been
 
02:19:08.870 --> 02:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
discussed um they're focused on consumer
 
02:19:11.669 --> 02:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
protection uh level playing field and
 
02:19:13.750 --> 02:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
importantly um agency accountability and
 
02:19:16.309 --> 02:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement so um we are very sensitive
 
02:19:17.990 --> 02:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
to how this bill has evolved over the
 
02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:19.110 align:start position:0%
to how this bill has evolved over the
years

02:19:19.110 --> 02:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:19:20.709 --> 02:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
but the concern of suggestion that we'd
 
02:19:22.549 --> 02:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
like to bring up is that a mobile
 
02:19:25.110 --> 02:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
inspection unit should be truly mobile
 
02:19:26.629 --> 02:19:26.639 align:start position:0%
um and that's something that should be
 
02:19:29.589 --> 02:19:29.599 align:start position:0%
defined uh if a food truck
 
02:19:31.429 --> 02:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
goes and and camps out in front of a
 
02:19:33.589 --> 02:19:33.599 align:start position:0%
local restaurant in town for six months
 
02:19:35.910 --> 02:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
they'd probably say something right so
 
02:19:38.469 --> 02:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
um we just want to um and provide it for
 
02:19:40.870 --> 02:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
for dmv um you know there's gonna be an
 
02:19:42.389 --> 02:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
intense amount of rule making that's
 
02:19:44.709 --> 02:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
gonna have to go into this
 
02:19:44.719 --> 02:19:45.589 align:start position:0%
gonna have to go into this
um

02:19:45.589 --> 02:19:45.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:47.589 --> 02:19:47.599 align:start position:0%
to making you know this this bill and
 
02:19:51.110 --> 02:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
law become a reality on on the ground um
 
02:19:52.630 --> 02:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
you've mentioned some of them already to
 
02:19:55.030 --> 02:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
be addressed in rule making so
 
02:19:58.309 --> 02:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
to make it you know easier on dmv um
 
02:20:00.469 --> 02:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
please set the policy to determine what
 
02:20:03.349 --> 02:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
is truly mobile
 
02:20:05.190 --> 02:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
and how often it does need to move or
 
02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
return to home base
 
02:20:10.150 --> 02:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
we have no issue with mobile units
 
02:20:11.590 --> 02:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
mobile service
 
02:20:14.070 --> 02:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
as mentioned it happens all the time
 
02:20:15.830 --> 02:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
heavy trucks construction and farm
 
02:20:17.910 --> 02:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
equipment are repaired in the field
 
02:20:17.920 --> 02:20:19.590 align:start position:0%
equipment are repaired in the field
uh

02:20:19.590 --> 02:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:20:23.670 --> 02:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
so mobile service does occur um
 
02:20:25.750 --> 02:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
so that would be one of the things uh
 
02:20:27.030 --> 02:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative fenton raises a good
 
02:20:28.550 --> 02:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
concern also to be considered for
 
02:20:31.349 --> 02:20:31.359 align:start position:0%
rulemaking um and and you may want to
 
02:20:33.349 --> 02:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
entertain that as well is how do you
 
02:20:34.870 --> 02:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
ensure that i don't just grab my
 
02:20:37.190 --> 02:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
neighbor's car and bring it in with me
 
02:20:38.710 --> 02:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:20:41.590 --> 02:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
rather than having 235 236 towns set
 
02:20:43.590 --> 02:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
their own definition of mobile
 
02:20:45.910 --> 02:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
please provide that guidance to the dmv
 
02:20:47.990 --> 02:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
and let them know what those constraints
 
02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:49.030 align:start position:0%
and let them know what those constraints
um

02:20:49.030 --> 02:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:51.670 --> 02:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
constraints should be um and then just
 
02:20:53.830 --> 02:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
to mention one of the comments that i've
 
02:20:55.590 --> 02:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
heard from the video
 
02:20:57.830 --> 02:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that you don't just
 
02:21:00.309 --> 02:21:00.319 align:start position:0%
want someone doing a pop-up shop in
 
02:21:03.110 --> 02:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
walmart is because of of customer
 
02:21:05.270 --> 02:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
consumer protection and and customer
 
02:21:07.429 --> 02:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
accountability so what if that person
 
02:21:09.830 --> 02:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
does or that inspection does do
 
02:21:11.429 --> 02:21:11.439 align:start position:0%
something um
 
02:21:14.950 --> 02:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
you know uh as a violation um there's
 
02:21:16.469 --> 02:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
there's nowhere to go back to how do you
 
02:21:19.349 --> 02:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
find them um if it's just a pop-up so
 
02:21:21.190 --> 02:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
that's the one of the reasons i believe
 
02:21:22.950 --> 02:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
consumer protection was a concern in the
 
02:21:25.030 --> 02:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
various different versions of this bill
 
02:21:27.270 --> 02:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
to get there to not have that that wide
 
02:21:27.280 --> 02:21:29.750 align:start position:0%
to get there to not have that that wide
open

02:21:29.750 --> 02:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:29.760 --> 02:21:31.270 align:start position:0%
 
option

02:21:31.270 --> 02:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
option
 
02:21:34.469 --> 02:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:36.550 --> 02:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
i guess i will in trying to move through
 
02:21:39.590 --> 02:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
my testimony as as quickly as i can um i
 
02:21:41.349 --> 02:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
guess i'll just end there and let you
 
02:21:42.950 --> 02:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
know again
 
02:21:45.349 --> 02:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
we do support the legislation uh we just
 
02:21:47.270 --> 02:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
would like to see uh some further
 
02:21:50.070 --> 02:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
definitions put in there so that the the
 
02:21:51.990 --> 02:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
dmv can undertake that rulemaking and
 
02:21:53.830 --> 02:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
have your guidance in setting that with
 
02:21:55.429 --> 02:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
that policy
 
02:21:55.439 --> 02:21:56.550 align:start position:0%
that policy
okay

02:21:56.550 --> 02:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:21:57.990 --> 02:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative o'hara
 
02:21:59.110 --> 02:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:22:01.030 --> 02:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question just a quick question
 
02:22:03.190 --> 02:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
to uh for your association what would be
 
02:22:05.349 --> 02:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
a fair number of
 
02:22:08.389 --> 02:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
days for this to be a truly mobile
 
02:22:08.399 --> 02:22:10.150 align:start position:0%
days for this to be a truly mobile
entity

02:22:10.150 --> 02:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
entity
 
02:22:12.389 --> 02:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
uh i think that's probably a discussion
 
02:22:13.349 --> 02:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
so i don't have an answer to that
 
02:22:14.550 --> 02:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
question representative thank you for
 
02:22:16.309 --> 02:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
the question uh i think that's probably
 
02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
something to be discussed um
 
02:22:21.670 --> 02:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
for you all as committee policy members
 
02:22:23.270 --> 02:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
but also maybe the
 
02:22:25.990 --> 02:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
one of the vendors who's here um you

03:58:35.110 --> 03:58:35.120 align:start position:0%
tied up
 
03:58:38.469 --> 03:58:38.479 align:start position:0%
that would introduce it but we do have a
 
03:58:41.110 --> 03:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
suitable representation representative
 
03:58:42.950 --> 03:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
for the senator
 
03:58:45.990 --> 03:58:46.000 align:start position:0%

businesses meet certain restrictions
 
03:59:30.309 --> 03:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
regarding the collection retention and
 
03:59:32.550 --> 03:59:32.560 align:start position:0%

03:59:46.710 --> 03:59:46.720 align:start position:0%

we do have
 
03:59:59.429 --> 03:59:59.439 align:start position:0%
two pink cards at this moment um
 
04:00:04.070 --> 04:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:07.830 --> 04:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
and welcome him to house transportation
 
04:00:12.309 --> 04:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:13.910 --> 04:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
04:00:15.990 --> 04:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
i'm neil kirk i live in the town of
 
04:00:18.870 --> 04:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
where and i'm here representing myself
 
04:00:18.880 --> 04:00:20.950 align:start position:0%
where and i'm here representing myself
um

04:00:20.950 --> 04:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:24.229 --> 04:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
i oppose um senate bill 311
 
04:00:26.630 --> 04:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
for the following reasons
 
04:00:28.150 --> 04:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh first you'll notice that there are
 
04:00:29.990 --> 04:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
two parts
 
04:00:32.950 --> 04:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh of substantive changes
 
04:00:36.710 --> 04:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
um page 1 line 25 section d which deals
 
04:00:36.720 --> 04:00:37.670 align:start position:0%
um page 1 line 25 section d which deals
with

04:00:37.670 --> 04:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:00:39.590 --> 04:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
access to motor vehicle records for
 
04:00:41.510 --> 04:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
quote motor vehicle related business
 
04:00:41.520 --> 04:00:42.790 align:start position:0%
quote motor vehicle related business
purposes

04:00:42.790 --> 04:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
04:00:43.910 --> 04:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:00:48.229 --> 04:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
part e on page 2 line 14
 
04:00:50.150 --> 04:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
which deals with access to the same
 
04:00:52.469 --> 04:00:52.479 align:start position:0%
records for health care business
 
04:00:52.479 --> 04:00:53.670 align:start position:0%
records for health care business
purposes

04:00:53.670 --> 04:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
04:00:53.680 --> 04:00:55.349 align:start position:0%
purposes
okay

04:00:55.349 --> 04:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:00:57.590 --> 04:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:01:00.309 --> 04:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
in statute we have very carefully
 
04:01:02.229 --> 04:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
restricted access to driver's records
 
04:01:04.550 --> 04:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
for privacy reasons
 
04:01:05.910 --> 04:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
the purpose of
 
04:01:07.910 --> 04:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
the database all the motor vehicle
 
04:01:10.870 --> 04:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
records is for motor vehicle purposes
 
04:01:14.150 --> 04:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
for the state not for anyone else
 
04:01:17.510 --> 04:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
this bill makes some exceptions to that
 
04:01:19.670 --> 04:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
the first one
 
04:01:21.750 --> 04:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
and this is um
 
04:01:24.710 --> 04:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
i'm referring to lines page 1
 
04:01:28.950 --> 04:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:30.550 --> 04:01:30.560 align:start position:0%
with the
 
04:01:35.830 --> 04:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:38.550 --> 04:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
the information on the cord can be
 
04:01:40.710 --> 04:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
scanned photocopied recorded retained or
 
04:01:40.720 --> 04:01:44.070 align:start position:0%
scanned photocopied recorded retained or
stored

04:01:44.070 --> 04:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:45.910 --> 04:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
and it's for motor vehicle related
 
04:01:48.550 --> 04:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
business purposes motor vehicle business
 
04:01:51.110 --> 04:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
related business purposes is undefined
 
04:01:51.120 --> 04:01:51.910 align:start position:0%
related business purposes is undefined
so

04:01:51.910 --> 04:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:01:53.349 --> 04:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
that would include an automobile
 
04:01:55.590 --> 04:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
dealership you know when you go to test
 
04:01:57.030 --> 04:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
drive a car you're supposed to give a
 
04:01:59.590 --> 04:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
copy of your license it would apply to
 
04:02:01.349 --> 04:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
my local
 
04:02:03.510 --> 04:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
garage that fixes cars because that's
 
04:02:05.269 --> 04:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle related
 
04:02:07.910 --> 04:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
it would apply to
 
04:02:10.710 --> 04:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
riley's auto and snell auto and all of
 
04:02:12.150 --> 04:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
these auto
 
04:02:14.630 --> 04:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
replacement parts businesses
 
04:02:16.469 --> 04:02:16.479 align:start position:0%
it would apply to a bank
 
04:02:17.750 --> 04:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
which gives
 
04:02:19.910 --> 04:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle-related loans
 
04:02:22.070 --> 04:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
um this is very broad
 
04:02:22.080 --> 04:02:23.189 align:start position:0%
um this is very broad
and

04:02:23.189 --> 04:02:23.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:02:25.429 --> 04:02:25.439 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what the policy is or isn't
 
04:02:26.630 --> 04:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
behind this
 
04:02:28.150 --> 04:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
but it's it's clear to me that this
 
04:02:30.550 --> 04:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
needs to be delineated and restricted if
 
04:02:32.710 --> 04:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
there is a valid reason for allowing
 
04:02:36.150 --> 04:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
these folks to scan and copy this now
 
04:02:38.389 --> 04:02:38.399 align:start position:0%
i will admit that the use of the
 
04:02:40.309 --> 04:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
information is quite restricted in the
 
04:02:43.590 --> 04:02:43.600 align:start position:0%
rest of the section d and e
 
04:02:43.600 --> 04:02:45.269 align:start position:0%
rest of the section d and e
however

04:02:45.269 --> 04:02:45.279 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:02:47.510 --> 04:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
let's go to section e which does the
 
04:02:49.670 --> 04:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
same thing for health care business
 
04:02:49.680 --> 04:02:51.030 align:start position:0%
same thing for health care business
purposes

04:02:51.030 --> 04:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
04:02:52.630 --> 04:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
what's health care
 
04:02:53.910 --> 04:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
well certainly if i go to
 
04:02:56.070 --> 04:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
dartmouth-hitchcock clinic or concord
 
04:02:59.510 --> 04:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
hospital or my local doctor
 
04:03:03.269 --> 04:03:03.279 align:start position:0%
but what about walmart or cvs
 
04:03:05.030 --> 04:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
or walgreens
 
04:03:07.349 --> 04:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
can they do this also in other words
 
04:03:10.469 --> 04:03:10.479 align:start position:0%
again this is a term that is so broad
 
04:03:12.870 --> 04:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
that it would include almost everybody
 
04:03:14.710 --> 04:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
and then as a result of that
 
04:03:15.910 --> 04:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to have copies of our
 
04:03:18.229 --> 04:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
licenses in a very significant
 
04:03:19.670 --> 04:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
proportion of the businesses in this
 
04:03:21.590 --> 04:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
state is that what we think should
 
04:03:23.429 --> 04:03:23.439 align:start position:0%
happen to motor vehicle licenses is that
 
04:03:27.830 --> 04:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:29.590 --> 04:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
the problem is that people have come to
 
04:03:31.750 --> 04:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
use driver's licenses for identification
 
04:03:33.990 --> 04:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
purposes and because we've put in
 
04:03:34.000 --> 04:03:35.349 align:start position:0%
purposes and because we've put in
protections

04:03:35.349 --> 04:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
protections
 
04:03:36.830 --> 04:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
they want those
 
04:03:39.590 --> 04:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
deleted there's one other point that i'd
 
04:03:41.990 --> 04:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
like to make to you
 
04:03:44.389 --> 04:03:44.399 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between section
 
04:03:46.870 --> 04:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
d which deals with motor vehicle related
 
04:03:49.830 --> 04:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
purposes and section e which deals with
 
04:03:52.389 --> 04:03:52.399 align:start position:0%
health care related purposes and that's
 
04:03:54.469 --> 04:03:54.479 align:start position:0%
on page 2
 
04:03:56.950 --> 04:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
line 20.
 
04:03:59.510 --> 04:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
when it comes to health care
 
04:04:01.910 --> 04:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
if i refuse to give my consent because
 
04:04:03.910 --> 04:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
remember they can only get my license if
 
04:04:05.670 --> 04:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
i consent to it
 
04:04:07.990 --> 04:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
it says there is no consequence to the
 
04:04:10.389 --> 04:04:10.399 align:start position:0%
holder who declines to provide such
 
04:04:10.399 --> 04:04:12.150 align:start position:0%
holder who declines to provide such
consent

04:04:12.150 --> 04:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
consent
 
04:04:16.150 --> 04:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:18.469 --> 04:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
in part d dealing with motor vehicle
 
04:04:21.349 --> 04:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
related businesses if i refuse and i
 
04:04:23.110 --> 04:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
have the right to refuse
 
04:04:24.790 --> 04:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
to give my driver's license to these
 
04:04:27.510 --> 04:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
folks when they request it they can say
 
04:04:31.349 --> 04:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
neil there's the door out you go
 
04:04:33.590 --> 04:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
we won't provide you with any of our
 
04:04:33.600 --> 04:04:36.229 align:start position:0%
we won't provide you with any of our
services

04:04:36.229 --> 04:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:38.630 --> 04:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure why that was not put in
 
04:04:39.830 --> 04:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
there but it
 
04:04:41.429 --> 04:04:41.439 align:start position:0%
might have been an oversight i suspect
 
04:04:43.030 --> 04:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
it was intentional
 
04:04:45.189 --> 04:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
um i think you need to put if this bill
 
04:04:48.150 --> 04:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
is going to pass at the very least that
 
04:04:51.189 --> 04:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
section two needs in that's in section e
 
04:04:56.710 --> 04:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:58.389 --> 04:04:58.399 align:start position:0%
that said
 
04:05:00.389 --> 04:05:00.399 align:start position:0%
that's if you pass the bill i still
 
04:05:01.670 --> 04:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
think this is
 
04:05:01.680 --> 04:05:02.550 align:start position:0%
think this is
an

04:05:02.550 --> 04:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
an
 
04:05:02.560 --> 04:05:04.950 align:start position:0%
an
unnecessary

04:05:04.950 --> 04:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
04:05:04.960 --> 04:05:06.630 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
intrusion

04:05:06.630 --> 04:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
intrusion
 
04:05:08.710 --> 04:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
or misuse of the motor vehicle
 
04:05:10.229 --> 04:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
department database and driver's
 
04:05:10.239 --> 04:05:12.469 align:start position:0%
department database and driver's
licenses

04:05:12.469 --> 04:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
04:05:14.950 --> 04:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
but if somebody makes a case that it is
 
04:05:16.710 --> 04:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
an appropriate use
 
04:05:18.950 --> 04:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
and you buy that case then at the very
 
04:05:18.960 --> 04:05:19.990 align:start position:0%
and you buy that case then at the very
least

04:05:19.990 --> 04:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
least
 
04:05:22.790 --> 04:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
you need to add section 2e
 
04:05:25.910 --> 04:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:27.670 --> 04:05:27.680 align:start position:0%

representing all our hospitals and we
 
04:06:28.710 --> 04:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
are in strong support of senate bill 311
 
04:06:30.790 --> 04:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
and we do thank senator carson and
 
04:06:32.630 --> 04:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
senator waters for agreeing to sponsor
 
04:06:34.469 --> 04:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation
 
04:06:37.110 --> 04:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
as well as representatives pearson and
 
04:06:40.630 --> 04:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
penta laykas um i am specifically
 
04:06:43.750 --> 04:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
testifying on paragraph e which does
 
04:06:49.269 --> 04:06:49.279 align:start position:0%
amend rsa 263 colon 12 roman 10 to
 
04:06:51.269 --> 04:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
provide appropriate flexibility for
 
04:06:53.510 --> 04:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
organizations to scan and store a
 
04:06:55.750 --> 04:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
driver's license for legitimate business
 
04:06:57.189 --> 04:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
purposes while protecting the
 
04:06:59.510 --> 04:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
individual's information
 
04:07:01.590 --> 04:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
and i will um i'll try not to read my
 
04:07:03.670 --> 04:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
testimony because i'm handing it out but
 
04:07:05.590 --> 04:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
i do want to explain
 
04:07:06.950 --> 04:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
this is
 
04:07:09.269 --> 04:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
protected information and we did make
 
04:07:11.269 --> 04:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
actually pretty significant changes in
 
04:07:13.910 --> 04:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
the senate to address um
 
04:07:16.710 --> 04:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
concerns raised by representative kirk
 
04:07:20.630 --> 04:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
so i um i was hoping that
 
04:07:23.269 --> 04:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
at least our section would be more
 
04:07:26.229 --> 04:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
amenable um but we did make some changes
 
04:07:29.189 --> 04:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
regarding consent we made changes
 
04:07:32.469 --> 04:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
um that to protect um this was actually
 
04:07:35.349 --> 04:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
in the senate to ensure that as he
 
04:07:37.750 --> 04:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
stated no matter what if they decline or
 
04:07:39.910 --> 04:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
not you still receive
 
04:07:42.229 --> 04:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
you're still going to receive care which
 
04:07:44.389 --> 04:07:44.399 align:start position:0%
of course they would but we wanted to be
 
04:07:44.399 --> 04:07:45.590 align:start position:0%
of course they would but we wanted to be
explicit

04:07:45.590 --> 04:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
explicit
 
04:07:48.389 --> 04:07:48.399 align:start position:0%
we also made changes to ensure that the
 
04:07:51.189 --> 04:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
the holder may request the removal of
 
04:07:53.830 --> 04:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
the driver's license so honestly three
 
04:07:55.830 --> 04:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
four um
 
04:07:57.590 --> 04:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
items two
 
04:07:57.600 --> 04:07:59.510 align:start position:0%
items two
four

04:07:59.510 --> 04:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
four
 
04:08:01.830 --> 04:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
um two three four we made a lot of
 
04:08:03.910 --> 04:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
changes in the senate to this bill i'm
 
04:08:05.269 --> 04:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
just going to
 
04:08:08.710 --> 04:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
say that to address the concerns um and
 
04:08:10.950 --> 04:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
the the reason the hospitals need this
 
04:08:13.670 --> 04:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
and cannot do it now but they need to
 
04:08:16.950 --> 04:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
scan the license the drive the ids
 
04:08:19.189 --> 04:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
to increase patient safety and to reduce
 
04:08:21.189 --> 04:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
fraudulent activities
 
04:08:23.110 --> 04:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
currently they are unable to scan and
 
04:08:27.429 --> 04:08:27.439 align:start position:0%
store these licenses or non-driver ids
 
04:08:29.429 --> 04:08:29.439 align:start position:0%
which is a legitimate business practice
 
04:08:31.910 --> 04:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
which is actually a hipaa term so that
 
04:08:33.670 --> 04:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
is where that
 
04:08:33.680 --> 04:08:34.469 align:start position:0%
is where that
health

04:08:34.469 --> 04:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
health
 
04:08:37.189 --> 04:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
information privacy and protection act
 
04:08:40.750 --> 04:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
it aids in deter deterring identity
 
04:08:42.870 --> 04:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
misrepresentations in which individuals
 
04:08:45.110 --> 04:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
use the name and insurance information
 
04:08:47.189 --> 04:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
of another individual to fraudulently
 
04:08:49.429 --> 04:08:49.439 align:start position:0%
obtain medical services it's it it
 
04:08:52.389 --> 04:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
happens and they need to prevent that
 
04:08:54.309 --> 04:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
it ensures that similarly named
 
04:08:56.630 --> 04:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
individuals with very similar names and
 
04:08:58.710 --> 04:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
dates of birth have correct medical
 
04:09:00.229 --> 04:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
information throughout the course of
 
04:09:00.239 --> 04:09:01.110 align:start position:0%
information throughout the course of
their

04:09:01.110 --> 04:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:09:02.710 --> 04:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
health care services which i'm sure you
 
04:09:04.070 --> 04:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
can appreciate
 
04:09:05.590 --> 04:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
and it prevents individuals from
 
04:09:07.910 --> 04:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
obtaining drugs under someone else's
 
04:09:12.309 --> 04:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
name and again i won't read my testimony
 
04:09:13.830 --> 04:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
but we did work with the health
 
04:09:16.309 --> 04:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
information managers at the hospitals
 
04:09:19.110 --> 04:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
that requested this um legislation for
 
04:09:20.790 --> 04:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
those reasons because they are not
 
04:09:23.990 --> 04:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
hypotheticals they are they are real um
 
04:09:25.590 --> 04:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
they are they're real
 
04:09:28.950 --> 04:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
real instances that this has occurred
 
04:09:31.030 --> 04:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
and then i reference the federal trade
 
04:09:33.590 --> 04:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
commissions red flag rules which require
 
04:09:35.750 --> 04:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
hospitals to do these reasonable to have
 
04:09:37.510 --> 04:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable policies and procedures in
 
04:09:37.520 --> 04:09:38.389 align:start position:0%
reasonable policies and procedures in
place

04:09:38.389 --> 04:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
place
 
04:09:40.469 --> 04:09:40.479 align:start position:0%
to again identify and respond to
 
04:09:43.110 --> 04:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
identity theft called red flags that's a
 
04:09:45.910 --> 04:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
federal that's an ftc thing
 
04:09:45.920 --> 04:09:46.870 align:start position:0%
federal that's an ftc thing
um

04:09:46.870 --> 04:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:49.510 --> 04:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
and that the inability to
 
04:09:52.469 --> 04:09:52.479 align:start position:0%
to do this has been has been a barrier
 
04:09:55.110 --> 04:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
um let's see
 
04:09:55.120 --> 04:09:56.630 align:start position:0%
um let's see
um

04:09:56.630 --> 04:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:59.030 --> 04:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
then legitimate as i mentioned um
 
04:10:01.830 --> 04:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
legitimate business purposes hipaa um
 
04:10:01.840 --> 04:10:02.550 align:start position:0%
legitimate business purposes hipaa um
the

04:10:02.550 --> 04:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:10:05.189 --> 04:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
health information insurance portability
 
04:10:07.670 --> 04:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
and accountability act um allows for
 
04:10:07.680 --> 04:10:08.469 align:start position:0%
and accountability act um allows for
that

04:10:08.469 --> 04:10:08.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:10:10.149 --> 04:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
um am i
 
04:10:13.030 --> 04:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
trying to shut my phone um multiple do
 
04:10:14.950 --> 04:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
we have multiple rules and regulations
 
04:10:17.670 --> 04:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
in place to ensure patient privacy
 
04:10:20.710 --> 04:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
um and to ensure that again they're not
 
04:10:20.720 --> 04:10:21.590 align:start position:0%
um and to ensure that again they're not
being

04:10:21.590 --> 04:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:10:23.510 --> 04:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the medical records
 
04:10:24.630 --> 04:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
04:10:26.309 --> 04:10:26.319 align:start position:0%
even though that was our original
 
04:10:28.630 --> 04:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
testimony we made it very explicit in
 
04:10:31.910 --> 04:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
the amended bill
 
04:10:33.189 --> 04:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
we do
 
04:10:34.870 --> 04:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
believe that all hospitals should employ
 
04:10:36.950 --> 04:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
the employee the opportunity to use
 
04:10:39.590 --> 04:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses and non-driver id to
 
04:10:42.229 --> 04:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
fulfill the purposes of proper patient
 
04:10:45.990 --> 04:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
identification and fraud reduction
 
04:10:48.149 --> 04:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
and we do believe that this bill
 
04:10:50.229 --> 04:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
provides the proper scope to allow this
 
04:10:53.189 --> 04:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
access to while also protecting the
 
04:10:54.950 --> 04:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
patient's privacy
 
04:10:57.269 --> 04:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
um and just just as a little background
 
04:11:00.309 --> 04:11:00.319 align:start position:0%
um it was at when the bill was um
 
04:11:02.870 --> 04:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
initially introduced in the in the bill
 
04:11:04.950 --> 04:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
and excuse me in the senate the first
 
04:11:07.429 --> 04:11:07.439 align:start position:0%
section was not included but the auto
 
04:11:09.750 --> 04:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
dealers association which obviously i do
 
04:11:12.550 --> 04:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
not represent but um they requested that
 
04:11:14.630 --> 04:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
first section they requested an
 
04:11:16.309 --> 04:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
amendment um and so that's where that
 
04:11:19.590 --> 04:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
first section comes from and um
 
04:11:22.070 --> 04:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
i know dan from the uh auto dealers was

04:11:31.590 --> 04:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
um i just wanted to mention that just
 
04:11:33.269 --> 04:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
for the record
 
04:11:35.349 --> 04:11:35.359 align:start position:0%

you very much thank you um are there
 
04:11:37.439 --> 04:11:38.389 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you um are there
questions

04:11:38.389 --> 04:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:11:41.429 --> 04:11:41.439 align:start position:0%
uh representative sykes
 
04:11:43.030 --> 04:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:11:45.510 --> 04:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question of course um
 
04:11:47.670 --> 04:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm trying to wrap my head around
 
04:11:50.630 --> 04:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
the fact that what what is to stop you
 
04:11:50.640 --> 04:11:51.910 align:start position:0%
the fact that what what is to stop you
from

04:11:51.910 --> 04:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:11:53.590 --> 04:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
requesting the information from the
 
04:11:55.189 --> 04:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
patient in other words can i see your
 
04:11:56.790 --> 04:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
driver's license
 
04:11:58.630 --> 04:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
and then checking a box that says you
 
04:12:00.389 --> 04:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
checked his driver's license but not
 
04:12:02.550 --> 04:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily holding on to
 
04:12:05.670 --> 04:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
um you know a photocopy of that license
 
04:12:07.110 --> 04:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
i i don't see
 
04:12:09.349 --> 04:12:09.359 align:start position:0%
i don't see the connection there
 
04:12:12.070 --> 04:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
they they need to check um again the to
 
04:12:14.790 --> 04:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
do the red you need to have reasonable
 
04:12:17.429 --> 04:12:17.439 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures in place and so
 
04:12:20.309 --> 04:12:20.319 align:start position:0%
the health information managers stated
 
04:12:23.110 --> 04:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
that that was necessary to do that check
 
04:12:26.309 --> 04:12:26.319 align:start position:0%
with to verify um that in fact the
 
04:12:29.189 --> 04:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
individual um is in fact
 
04:12:31.189 --> 04:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
there has not been an issue like they
 
04:12:32.870 --> 04:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
didn't lose their license for instance
 
04:12:36.229 --> 04:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
if i walk in to concord hospital with my
 
04:12:39.510 --> 04:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
my insurance card and my id
 
04:12:42.469 --> 04:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
but my but i'm not paula minihan um i'm
 
04:12:44.870 --> 04:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
someone else but i have that information
 
04:12:47.030 --> 04:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
they can check the database to make sure
 
04:12:49.110 --> 04:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
that in fact it hasn't been stolen for
 
04:12:49.120 --> 04:12:51.750 align:start position:0%
that in fact it hasn't been stolen for
instance

04:12:51.750 --> 04:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:55.590 --> 04:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah i would like to follow up so
 
04:12:57.670 --> 04:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
you explain to me what you might do with
 
04:12:59.349 --> 04:12:59.359 align:start position:0%
this information but you didn't explain
 
04:13:00.870 --> 04:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
to me why you needed to have the
 
04:13:03.349 --> 04:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
information i understand you need to
 
04:13:05.030 --> 04:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
check to make sure the person standing
 
04:13:07.429 --> 04:13:07.439 align:start position:0%
in front of you is that person
 
04:13:09.510 --> 04:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
to prevent fraud to make sure that the
 
04:13:11.030 --> 04:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
pa the right patient is getting the
 
04:13:12.630 --> 04:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
right care
 
04:13:14.309 --> 04:13:14.319 align:start position:0%
what what i don't
 
04:13:16.710 --> 04:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
the the pieces of the dots that are not
 
04:13:18.870 --> 04:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
connected is why do you have to keep a
 
04:13:18.880 --> 04:13:20.070 align:start position:0%
connected is why do you have to keep a
copy

04:13:20.070 --> 04:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
copy
 
04:13:22.309 --> 04:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
of that record
 
04:13:25.429 --> 04:13:25.439 align:start position:0%
they are it's being it's not being put
 
04:13:27.030 --> 04:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
in the medical record and that is
 
04:13:30.149 --> 04:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
specifically stated they are they are
 
04:13:33.750 --> 04:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
making sure that because they will be
 
04:13:35.910 --> 04:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
getting treated by more than one one
 
04:13:39.189 --> 04:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
place necessarily so i can get you more
 
04:13:43.910 --> 04:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
clearly from the experts um but again
 
04:13:46.149 --> 04:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
they had stated that in order to follow
 
04:13:49.990 --> 04:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
the ftc requirements they need to
 
04:13:52.469 --> 04:13:52.479 align:start position:0%
they are on they don't scan it now
 
04:13:54.630 --> 04:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
um but if you go from place to place
 
04:13:57.030 --> 04:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
within the hospital for instance it's a
 
04:13:59.349 --> 04:13:59.359 align:start position:0%
better example you're not having to ask
 
04:14:01.269 --> 04:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
for that id every single time because
 
04:14:03.269 --> 04:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
it's in the system as you're making your
 
04:14:05.590 --> 04:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
way through the system but it's not in
 
04:14:16.790 --> 04:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:20.710 --> 04:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:25.349 --> 04:14:25.359 align:start position:0%
so you ask for the id initially
 
04:14:25.359 --> 04:14:26.630 align:start position:0%
so you ask for the id initially
and

04:14:26.630 --> 04:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:14:29.510 --> 04:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
if the the patient could perhaps
 
04:14:29.520 --> 04:14:31.269 align:start position:0%
if the the patient could perhaps
decline

04:14:31.269 --> 04:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
decline
 
04:14:33.510 --> 04:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect his care right or her
 
04:14:35.030 --> 04:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
care right
 
04:14:38.710 --> 04:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
um at any time they could ask
 
04:14:40.149 --> 04:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
their id
 
04:14:43.030 --> 04:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
copy to be removed from
 
04:14:45.750 --> 04:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
the system the hospital system not their
 
04:14:48.630 --> 04:14:48.640 align:start position:0%
records but the system right
 
04:14:52.389 --> 04:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:54.070 --> 04:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know why
 
04:14:55.910 --> 04:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
anyone would comply
 
04:14:55.920 --> 04:14:56.870 align:start position:0%
anyone would comply
um

04:14:56.870 --> 04:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:58.870 --> 04:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
how does how does this benefit the
 
04:15:00.950 --> 04:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
patient i guess that might would be my
 
04:15:00.960 --> 04:15:01.910 align:start position:0%
patient i guess that might would be my
question

04:15:01.910 --> 04:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:15:04.790 --> 04:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's protecting the patient's identity
 
04:15:08.229 --> 04:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
and and records to make sure that
 
04:15:10.790 --> 04:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
um like i said one of the reasons they
 
04:15:14.550 --> 04:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
need this is if ma if there is a as you
 
04:15:17.750 --> 04:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
said paula monahan versus paula minihan
 
04:15:19.590 --> 04:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure that my record is
 
04:15:22.389 --> 04:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
not in paula monahan's record that i'm
 
04:15:25.750 --> 04:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
in paula minihan's record so it is to
 
04:15:28.070 --> 04:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
ensure that similarly named individuals
 
04:15:29.990 --> 04:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
with with similar names and date of
 
04:15:31.429 --> 04:15:31.439 align:start position:0%
birth have the correct medical
 
04:15:33.269 --> 04:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
information used throughout the course
 
04:15:36.389 --> 04:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
of their health care services so it's
 
04:15:39.429 --> 04:15:39.439 align:start position:0%
really it is a it's a patient protection
 
04:15:39.439 --> 04:15:40.710 align:start position:0%
really it is a it's a patient protection
um

04:15:40.710 --> 04:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:42.630 --> 04:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
effort and that's why the federal trade
 
04:15:44.950 --> 04:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
commission um put in these what they
 
04:15:48.710 --> 04:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
call red flag rules to um ensure that
 
04:15:48.720 --> 04:15:49.990 align:start position:0%
call red flag rules to um ensure that
identity

04:15:49.990 --> 04:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
identity
 
04:15:53.189 --> 04:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
theft is not occurring and this is one
 
04:15:56.309 --> 04:15:56.319 align:start position:0%
one tool that they are using
 
04:15:58.070 --> 04:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome and just to be
 
04:16:00.710 --> 04:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
clear uh representative you could
 
04:16:04.550 --> 04:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
request that it be removed but we did um
 
04:16:07.269 --> 04:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
add that not unless legal action
 
04:16:09.189 --> 04:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
concerning the holder is underway then
 
04:16:11.670 --> 04:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
that could not be removed that is on
 
04:16:14.950 --> 04:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
line 29 or legal action concerning the
 
04:16:17.990 --> 04:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
holder be underway and senator birdsell
 
04:16:18.000 --> 04:16:18.710 align:start position:0%
holder be underway and senator birdsell
and

04:16:18.710 --> 04:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:16:20.950 --> 04:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
senator carson agreed to add that
 
04:16:22.790 --> 04:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
language in there so just wanted to be
 
04:16:25.189 --> 04:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
clear because that does happen as well
 
04:16:26.950 --> 04:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
but i'm happy to follow up with the
 
04:16:29.670 --> 04:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
committee and get more information as to
 
04:16:29.680 --> 04:16:30.389 align:start position:0%
committee and get more information as to
the

04:16:30.389 --> 04:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:16:33.590 --> 04:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
the um the necessity for this because i
 
04:16:36.229 --> 04:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
i represent hospitals but
 
04:16:38.309 --> 04:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
lots and lots of very smart people work
 
04:16:39.830 --> 04:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
at hospitals and the health information
 
04:16:42.149 --> 04:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
managers are the ones that have been
 
04:16:43.990 --> 04:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
asking for this actually we tried to do
 
04:16:45.590 --> 04:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
this through um
 
04:16:47.189 --> 04:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
through the department of safety through
 
04:16:49.269 --> 04:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
rule making not rule making but we um
 
04:16:51.910 --> 04:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
through rules it allows for exceptions
 
04:16:54.389 --> 04:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
to be made they actually asked us to
 
04:16:57.110 --> 04:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
make the changes in the in this um
 
04:16:59.830 --> 04:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
statute versus just asking them for an
 
04:17:01.830 --> 04:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
exception so we did actually try that
 
04:17:04.309 --> 04:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
last summer and that's um why we
 
04:17:05.910 --> 04:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
we came up with this approach and
 
04:17:09.110 --> 04:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
senator carson agreed to sponsor it
 
04:17:12.630 --> 04:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
thank you um i have one further question
 
04:17:14.550 --> 04:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
and and i'm not sure if you're the right
 
04:17:16.550 --> 04:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
person because you are representing the
 
04:17:19.110 --> 04:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
hospital association but you've probably
 
04:17:21.910 --> 04:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
heard um a previous
 
04:17:25.910 --> 04:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh testimony mentioned that um it seemed
 
04:17:28.309 --> 04:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
overly broad for the healthcare business
 
04:17:28.319 --> 04:17:29.590 align:start position:0%
overly broad for the healthcare business
purposes

04:17:29.590 --> 04:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
04:17:32.229 --> 04:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
was that mentioned in senate testimony
 
04:17:34.070 --> 04:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
as well
 
04:17:34.080 --> 04:17:35.349 align:start position:0%
as well
the

04:17:35.349 --> 04:17:35.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:17:36.630 --> 04:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
the potential
 
04:17:39.670 --> 04:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
definition of what would be encompassing
 
04:17:42.309 --> 04:17:42.319 align:start position:0%
health care business purposes that is i
 
04:17:44.790 --> 04:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
believe a hipaa term um so health care
 
04:17:47.030 --> 04:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
for legitimate um business purpose
 
04:17:49.269 --> 04:17:49.279 align:start position:0%
health care business purposes so
 
04:17:50.710 --> 04:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
um i
 
04:17:52.950 --> 04:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not recalling to be honest um if
 
04:17:54.550 --> 04:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
that came up or not i'm trying to
 
04:17:56.309 --> 04:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
remember the original again the original
 
04:17:59.590 --> 04:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
bill was was different um
 
04:18:01.189 --> 04:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
trying to find it
 
04:18:04.389 --> 04:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
quick search didn't show that in our
 
04:18:07.189 --> 04:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
rsas but i didn't know if it was it's a
 
04:18:14.229 --> 04:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:17.910 --> 04:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
um the original bill said legitimate
 
04:18:20.710 --> 04:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
business purposes again that is also
 
04:18:24.070 --> 04:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
a hipaa term um but they they changed it
 
04:18:26.710 --> 04:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
to health care business um or whatever
 
04:18:28.469 --> 04:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:18:31.830 --> 04:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
that's fine that's fine
 
04:18:33.510 --> 04:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
healthcare business purposes that was
 
04:18:36.389 --> 04:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
changed um amended in the senate thank
 
04:18:40.710 --> 04:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:43.110 --> 04:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um i'm not sure this is actual
 
04:18:45.110 --> 04:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
question but just sort of i want i'm
 
04:18:46.950 --> 04:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
curious about your response
 
04:18:50.870 --> 04:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
obviously this is an issue of a person's
 
04:18:52.870 --> 04:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
protection of their privacy
 
04:18:52.880 --> 04:18:53.830 align:start position:0%
protection of their privacy
um

04:18:53.830 --> 04:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:55.910 --> 04:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
which actually there's our constitution
 
04:18:57.830 --> 04:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
protects privacy here in new hampshire
 
04:18:58.950 --> 04:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm
 
04:19:00.469 --> 04:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
wondering about
 
04:19:00.479 --> 04:19:01.510 align:start position:0%
wondering about
what

04:19:01.510 --> 04:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:19:03.830 --> 04:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
mechanisms hospitals in new hampshire
 
04:19:03.840 --> 04:19:04.950 align:start position:0%
mechanisms hospitals in new hampshire
provide

04:19:04.950 --> 04:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
provide
 
04:19:08.550 --> 04:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
to prevent any breach of their data we
 
04:19:10.389 --> 04:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
hear sometimes in the news of a data
 
04:19:13.269 --> 04:19:13.279 align:start position:0%
breach where private information is um
 
04:19:14.790 --> 04:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
lost is there
 
04:19:17.429 --> 04:19:17.439 align:start position:0%
any concern that uh this information
 
04:19:19.590 --> 04:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
would be vulnerable
 
04:19:21.349 --> 04:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
i mean there's always the concern
 
04:19:23.590 --> 04:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
because that's that's our the nature of
 
04:19:23.600 --> 04:19:24.389 align:start position:0%
because that's that's our the nature of
our

04:19:24.389 --> 04:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:19:24.399 --> 04:19:25.910 align:start position:0%
our
environment

04:19:25.910 --> 04:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
environment
 
04:19:28.630 --> 04:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
so data breaches do occur not there have
 
04:19:31.030 --> 04:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
not been any significant ones um you've
 
04:19:32.710 --> 04:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
heard it in other parts of the country
 
04:19:35.510 --> 04:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
but not in new hampshire per se um they
 
04:19:37.910 --> 04:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
have lots and lots and lots of layers of
 
04:19:40.630 --> 04:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
protection of the data um so again this
 
04:19:42.389 --> 04:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
is a different database this is not your
 
04:19:44.710 --> 04:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
emr this is not the electronic medical
 
04:19:48.149 --> 04:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
record um i um obviously am not a the
 
04:19:50.389 --> 04:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
cio of a hospital so i can't answer
 
04:19:52.309 --> 04:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
specifically what safeguards they have
 
04:19:54.469 --> 04:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
in place but they have many many to
 
04:19:56.830 --> 04:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
protect everyone's
 
04:19:59.990 --> 04:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
data but i can't i can follow up if you
 
04:20:02.229 --> 04:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
want specifics but i i don't i can't
 
04:20:03.910 --> 04:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
answer that question i just have one
 
04:20:05.910 --> 04:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
other quick question thank you um the
 
04:20:07.349 --> 04:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
only other thing i have a question about
 
04:20:09.269 --> 04:20:09.279 align:start position:0%
is the um
 
04:20:11.030 --> 04:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
that the holder may request the removal
 
04:20:14.070 --> 04:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
of the driver's license at any time
 
04:20:16.710 --> 04:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
i understand the thought process of
 
04:20:18.149 --> 04:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
being able to have each department
 
04:20:18.159 --> 04:20:19.349 align:start position:0%
being able to have each department
verify

04:20:19.349 --> 04:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
verify
 
04:20:21.349 --> 04:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh that kind of thing now i think we're
 
04:20:22.630 --> 04:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
all used to
 
04:20:25.189 --> 04:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
getting banded you know at the admission
 
04:20:27.030 --> 04:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
desk or whatever and everyone checking
 
04:20:28.469 --> 04:20:28.479 align:start position:0%
as you go through the process of the
 
04:20:31.030 --> 04:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
phlebotomist the x-ray whatever i guess
 
04:20:32.950 --> 04:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
i'm curious
 
04:20:34.229 --> 04:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
how would this
 
04:20:35.429 --> 04:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
change that
 
04:20:37.750 --> 04:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're admitting someone to
 
04:20:40.550 --> 04:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
a facility for process
 
04:20:42.309 --> 04:20:42.319 align:start position:0%
how would this change
 
04:20:44.950 --> 04:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
is this another level another layer
 
04:20:44.960 --> 04:20:46.469 align:start position:0%
is this another level another layer
um

04:20:46.469 --> 04:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:47.910 --> 04:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
because i'm wondering sorry i don't mean
 
04:20:49.830 --> 04:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
interrupt you but my question is if
 
04:20:52.630 --> 04:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
someone says you know what
 
04:20:54.630 --> 04:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
i i've changed my mind because i've now
 
04:20:56.550 --> 04:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
pulled my license out and seen it you
 
04:20:58.550 --> 04:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
know scanned or i've seen people pull it
 
04:20:58.560 --> 04:21:00.389 align:start position:0%
know scanned or i've seen people pull it
up

04:21:00.389 --> 04:21:00.399 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:21:03.030 --> 04:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
how would this
 
04:21:05.269 --> 04:21:05.279 align:start position:0%
significantly improve with the process
 
04:21:06.550 --> 04:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
that's already in place i guess is what
 
04:21:08.070 --> 04:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
i'm saying because i want people to be
 
04:21:09.670 --> 04:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
able to know that they can pull back
 
04:21:12.309 --> 04:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
their information
 
04:21:12.319 --> 04:21:13.189 align:start position:0%
their information
i

04:21:13.189 --> 04:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:21:14.950 --> 04:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
can again um
 
04:21:17.110 --> 04:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
get that answer from the experts they
 
04:21:19.910 --> 04:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
asked for this bill so um it's it's very
 
04:21:21.590 --> 04:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
important to them
 
04:21:23.590 --> 04:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
to protect the patient identity and
 
04:21:25.510 --> 04:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
fraud detection
 
04:21:27.750 --> 04:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you yep
 
04:21:29.750 --> 04:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
oh one more question
 
04:21:31.269 --> 04:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
 
04:21:35.110 --> 04:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:37.910 --> 04:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
is there a requirement are you aware of
 
04:21:40.790 --> 04:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh medicare medicaid or
 
04:21:43.349 --> 04:21:43.359 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies for
 
04:21:45.510 --> 04:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
production of this license
 
04:21:50.950 --> 04:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:53.030 --> 04:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it's a requirement like
 
04:21:54.870 --> 04:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
i said the federal trade commission
 
04:21:57.349 --> 04:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
requires this protection through this
 
04:21:59.110 --> 04:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
red flags um
 
04:22:00.870 --> 04:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
regulation so
 
04:22:00.880 --> 04:22:02.149 align:start position:0%
regulation so
um

04:22:02.149 --> 04:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:04.950 --> 04:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
certainly it would be medicare fraud if
 
04:22:07.510 --> 04:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
they're if you're submitting um
 
04:22:10.950 --> 04:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
fraudulent claims unknowingly submitting
 
04:22:13.590 --> 04:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
them would be um have to be reviewed by
 
04:22:15.750 --> 04:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
medicare and proven that you did not
 
04:22:17.990 --> 04:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
realize that the individual was not who
 
04:22:20.389 --> 04:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
he or she said they were
 
04:22:20.399 --> 04:22:21.269 align:start position:0%
he or she said they were
but

04:22:21.269 --> 04:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:22:24.309 --> 04:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
as i think you know the healthcare
 
04:22:25.910 --> 04:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
industry is one of the most highly
 
04:22:29.510 --> 04:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
regulated industries in the country
 
04:22:29.520 --> 04:22:30.309 align:start position:0%
regulated industries in the country
so

04:22:30.309 --> 04:22:30.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:22:32.149 --> 04:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
there are lots and lots of layers so i
 
04:22:34.790 --> 04:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
don't know specifically if it's required
 
04:22:37.110 --> 04:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
um but they do have to they do ask for
 
04:22:39.750 --> 04:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
your your identification they just can't
 
04:22:42.309 --> 04:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
scan it right now that all this is doing
 
04:22:45.269 --> 04:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
is allowing for the scanning of it okay
 
04:22:47.110 --> 04:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're welcome thank
 
04:22:49.510 --> 04:22:49.520 align:start position:0%

04:22:51.590 --> 04:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you you survived your first time

thank you mr chairman um i didn't fully
 
04:26:00.710 --> 04:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
read over this yet but i'll ask you real
 
04:26:03.670 --> 04:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
quick is there any um limitation on
 
04:26:05.830 --> 04:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
retention of the license plate scan
 
04:26:07.110 --> 04:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
image itself
 
04:26:11.349 --> 04:26:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:13.510 --> 04:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:26:14.950 --> 04:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
i have one can you can we have a couple
 
04:26:17.349 --> 04:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
examples of the types of commercial
 
04:26:18.630 --> 04:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
entities that would be interested in
 
04:26:18.640 --> 04:26:21.030 align:start position:0%
entities that would be interested in
this

04:26:21.030 --> 04:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:24.550 --> 04:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
do i have any any examples of of
 
04:26:26.630 --> 04:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
it just allows a private property owner
 
04:26:27.990 --> 04:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
to use
 
04:26:31.349 --> 04:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
your license plate as your
 
04:26:31.359 --> 04:26:32.550 align:start position:0%
your license plate as your
um

04:26:32.550 --> 04:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:35.349 --> 04:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
authority to enter the property okay so
 
04:26:37.110 --> 04:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
it would open the gate if it matched the
 
04:26:39.349 --> 04:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
plane et cetera et cetera that's it did
 
04:26:41.269 --> 04:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
i see a hand down there
 
04:26:42.950 --> 04:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
drop some telersky it was sort of the
 
04:26:45.670 --> 04:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
same question the application of this i
 
04:26:48.229 --> 04:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
could see maybe at a a gated community
 
04:26:50.229 --> 04:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
or a
 
04:26:52.389 --> 04:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
um an industry that had a number of
 
04:26:54.469 --> 04:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
vehicles coming in i guess i'm just
 
04:26:56.149 --> 04:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
trying to understand the application of
 
04:26:58.389 --> 04:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
of this technology
 
04:27:00.870 --> 04:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
anybody who has reason to control entry
 
04:27:03.750 --> 04:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
to their property that would be
 
04:27:05.510 --> 04:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay the reason
 
04:27:06.389 --> 04:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:27:08.229 --> 04:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
any other questions seeing them thank
 
04:27:12.229 --> 04:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:14.790 --> 04:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
i have nobody else signed up to speak on
 
04:27:17.510 --> 04:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
senate bill 310 anybody in the audience
 
04:27:19.590 --> 04:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
that wishes to do so
 
04:27:20.710 --> 04:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'm going to close the
 
04:27:23.830 --> 04:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:26.469 --> 04:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
my apologies i'm wondering if um mr
 
04:27:28.870 --> 04:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
orbiting or someone from the dmv can
 
04:27:31.590 --> 04:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
tell us what the existing rule is for
 
04:27:35.030 --> 04:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
scanning a plate or tracking plates i
 
04:27:35.040 --> 04:27:36.550 align:start position:0%
scanning a plate or tracking plates i
don't

04:27:36.550 --> 04:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:27:36.560 --> 04:27:37.670 align:start position:0%
don't
no

04:27:37.670 --> 04:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:27:39.030 --> 04:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
he's getting up so i'll take that as a
 
04:27:41.510 --> 04:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
yes slowly
 
04:27:45.670 --> 04:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:47.510 --> 04:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
right now it's just my understanding
 
04:27:49.429 --> 04:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
it's law enforcement only i mean as far
 
04:27:52.070 --> 04:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
as we're concerned we produce plates
 
04:27:53.990 --> 04:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's what we do um as far as whether
 
04:27:55.269 --> 04:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
or not they're right or not that's a law
 
04:27:59.269 --> 04:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:00.950 --> 04:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
senator friend sorry thanks for taking
 
04:28:03.030 --> 04:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
my question who can obtain a license
 
04:28:05.590 --> 04:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
plate reader right now
 
04:28:07.189 --> 04:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
my understanding is just law enforcement
 
04:28:09.429 --> 04:28:09.439 align:start position:0%
employees and it's only been for a
 
04:28:10.790 --> 04:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
couple of years a couple of years i
 
04:28:17.030 --> 04:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:19.990 --> 04:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
is he on this bill no no representative
 
04:28:20.000 --> 04:28:21.349 align:start position:0%
is he on this bill no no representative
thompson

04:28:21.349 --> 04:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
thompson
 
04:28:21.359 --> 04:28:22.870 align:start position:0%
thompson
um

04:28:22.870 --> 04:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:24.710 --> 04:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
as i understand it
 
04:28:27.910 --> 04:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
even if you scan this plate and
 
04:28:29.670 --> 04:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
see what it is and they say you can't
 
04:28:31.750 --> 04:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
read they're not going to retain it so i
 
04:28:34.229 --> 04:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
don't know how long it's available for
 
04:28:35.510 --> 04:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to contact motor
 
04:28:37.510 --> 04:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle to run the plate and you're not
 
04:28:40.149 --> 04:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
going to do that for them anyway
 
04:28:40.159 --> 04:28:41.030 align:start position:0%
going to do that for them anyway
so

04:28:41.030 --> 04:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:28:43.510 --> 04:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
there'd be no point to reading it
 
04:28:45.510 --> 04:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
yeah my understanding is that if you're
 
04:28:47.349 --> 04:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
in a private gated community or if you
 
04:28:48.950 --> 04:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
own a private business that you would
 
04:28:51.349 --> 04:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
submit your plate
 
04:28:53.110 --> 04:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
to the owner of the property to submit
 
04:28:55.110 --> 04:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
entry it's not something that you would
 
04:28:56.630 --> 04:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
come back and do a check with us to see
 
04:28:59.110 --> 04:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
whether it's valid or not we we have no
 
04:29:00.870 --> 04:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
connection to that system at all and nor
 
04:29:02.790 --> 04:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
would we right
 
04:29:04.630 --> 04:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
i i guess i look at this in terms of
 
04:29:07.429 --> 04:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
application as being a keypad or or
 
04:29:09.269 --> 04:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
swiping a card to get into a certain
 
04:29:09.279 --> 04:29:10.149 align:start position:0%
swiping a card to get into a certain
area

04:29:10.149 --> 04:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
area
 
04:29:11.830 --> 04:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
but using your license plate using your
 
04:29:13.510 --> 04:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
license plate instead but again it
 
04:29:15.510 --> 04:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
sounds to me it's a volunteer basis if
 
04:29:17.510 --> 04:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
you want to get access quickly
 
04:29:19.830 --> 04:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
to this property you submit your plate
 
04:29:21.830 --> 04:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
and they read it
 
04:29:23.830 --> 04:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
representative hill
 
04:29:26.870 --> 04:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thank you mr chairman um
 
04:29:29.189 --> 04:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that it the reader is
 
04:29:30.550 --> 04:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
attached to
 
04:29:33.830 --> 04:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
the vehicle not
 
04:29:35.269 --> 04:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
if you read the
 
04:29:40.389 --> 04:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:43.110 --> 04:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
only installed
 
04:29:45.349 --> 04:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
or mounted to a vehicle that is attended
 
04:29:47.349 --> 04:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
to and operated by a law enforcement
 
04:29:47.359 --> 04:29:50.469 align:start position:0%
to and operated by a law enforcement
officer

04:29:50.469 --> 04:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:52.309 --> 04:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
i'm confused
 
04:29:54.309 --> 04:29:54.319 align:start position:0%
the way i'm reading that is that
 
04:29:56.229 --> 04:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
those are the only ones that could be
 
04:29:58.149 --> 04:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
attached to a vehicle the rest of them
 
04:30:00.389 --> 04:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
could not that's how i see it
 
04:30:04.870 --> 04:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:06.469 --> 04:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:30:08.630 --> 04:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
or did you want to look into that
 
04:30:10.389 --> 04:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
no my understanding there is no
 
04:30:12.710 --> 04:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
connection to our database right there
 
04:30:14.469 --> 04:30:14.479 align:start position:0%
is no referencing back to us to see
 
04:30:17.269 --> 04:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
whether it's a good plate or not
 
04:30:17.279 --> 04:30:20.550 align:start position:0%
whether it's a good plate or not
okay

04:30:20.550 --> 04:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:23.510 --> 04:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
oh and yes sorry about the pink card
 
04:30:25.349 --> 04:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you very
 
04:30:25.359 --> 04:30:26.870 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you very
much

04:30:26.870 --> 04:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:30:29.189 --> 04:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
um and again i see
 
04:30:31.189 --> 04:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
nobody else here to speak unless a
 
04:30:32.870 --> 04:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative kirk is coming up or a
 
04:30:35.429 --> 04:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
former representative kurt
 
04:30:36.790 --> 04:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
04:30:38.469 --> 04:30:38.479 align:start position:0%
good afternoon i i hadn't intended to
 
04:30:40.309 --> 04:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
speak on this but i am privy to some
 
04:30:41.830 --> 04:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
information which
 
04:30:44.469 --> 04:30:44.479 align:start position:0%
may be helpful to the committee
 
04:30:46.389 --> 04:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
representative peter schmidt contacted
 
04:30:48.389 --> 04:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
me some time ago
 
04:30:52.229 --> 04:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
there's a property i believe in durham
 
04:30:52.239 --> 04:30:53.269 align:start position:0%
there's a property i believe in durham
where

04:30:53.269 --> 04:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:30:55.110 --> 04:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
a developer is proposing to build an
 
04:30:56.790 --> 04:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
apartment building renting it to
 
04:30:58.630 --> 04:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
students and the parking for that
 
04:31:02.149 --> 04:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
parking building would be in a
 
04:31:04.469 --> 04:31:04.479 align:start position:0%
private parking lot which serves a
 
04:31:07.349 --> 04:31:07.359 align:start position:0%
number of other businesses
 
04:31:07.359 --> 04:31:09.510 align:start position:0%
number of other businesses
and

04:31:09.510 --> 04:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:31:12.070 --> 04:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
in order to make sure that
 
04:31:14.149 --> 04:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
these new tenants didn't abuse the fact
 
04:31:16.630 --> 04:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
that there was parking there
 
04:31:19.030 --> 04:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
um and and make it impossible for let's
 
04:31:21.510 --> 04:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
say the supermarket customers to park
 
04:31:21.520 --> 04:31:22.870 align:start position:0%
say the supermarket customers to park
um

04:31:22.870 --> 04:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:24.389 --> 04:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
the owner wanted to have some way to
 
04:31:24.399 --> 04:31:25.269 align:start position:0%
the owner wanted to have some way to
limit

04:31:25.269 --> 04:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
limit
 
04:31:26.870 --> 04:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
their access i don't know whether
 
04:31:28.710 --> 04:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
they're these plate readers would
 
04:31:31.030 --> 04:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
operate a gate or not
 
04:31:33.349 --> 04:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
um but i would like to make two comments
 
04:31:35.830 --> 04:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
first of all sections 9
 
04:31:39.429 --> 04:31:39.439 align:start position:0%
lines 11 through 14 have nothing to do
 
04:31:41.110 --> 04:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
with the purpose of this bill which is
 
04:31:43.990 --> 04:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
line 15 section 3. it simply clarifies
 
04:31:46.630 --> 04:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
an existing statute which says basically
 
04:31:49.990 --> 04:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
only police can have access to license
 
04:31:51.429 --> 04:31:51.439 align:start position:0%
plate readers and the license plate
 
04:31:53.429 --> 04:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
readers have to be on the patrol cars
 
04:31:54.950 --> 04:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
they can't be on the ground somewhere
 
04:31:57.590 --> 04:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
they're you know a stationary unit
 
04:31:57.600 --> 04:31:58.389 align:start position:0%
they're you know a stationary unit
so

04:31:58.389 --> 04:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:32:01.429 --> 04:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
that's the the two are really separate
 
04:32:03.990 --> 04:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
um someone raised the question on
 
04:32:06.870 --> 04:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
section on on the
 
04:32:10.070 --> 04:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
roman 3 section starting on line 15
 
04:32:13.030 --> 04:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
there's nothing here that prevents
 
04:32:13.040 --> 04:32:13.910 align:start position:0%
there's nothing here that prevents
the

04:32:13.910 --> 04:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:32:16.870 --> 04:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
private person from retaining
 
04:32:21.750 --> 04:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
a record of all of the vehicles that
 
04:32:24.630 --> 04:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
license plates that passed through
 
04:32:26.389 --> 04:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
if you don't want that to happen you
 
04:32:28.630 --> 04:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
need to do some amending here
 
04:32:28.640 --> 04:32:29.830 align:start position:0%
need to do some amending here
um

04:32:29.830 --> 04:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:31.830 --> 04:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
but as i say the purpose
 
04:32:34.389 --> 04:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
the reason for this was that
 
04:32:37.349 --> 04:32:37.359 align:start position:0%
under current law it was
 
04:32:39.110 --> 04:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
very debatable whether a private
 
04:32:41.990 --> 04:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
property owner had the legal right to
 
04:32:42.000 --> 04:32:43.110 align:start position:0%
property owner had the legal right to
use

04:32:43.110 --> 04:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
use
 
04:32:45.429 --> 04:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
a scanning device even on private
 
04:32:47.990 --> 04:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
property and so this was put in to
 
04:32:50.229 --> 04:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
clarify that and the instant case was
 
04:32:52.710 --> 04:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
the one that i mentioned in durham
 
04:32:53.830 --> 04:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:32:56.710 --> 04:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
i've informed you as fully as i'm able
 
04:32:57.990 --> 04:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
but i always want to make sure that
 
04:32:59.510 --> 04:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
committees have access to the full
 
04:33:01.189 --> 04:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
information so that
 
04:33:03.750 --> 04:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
you make informed decisions thank you mr
 
04:33:07.590 --> 04:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:10.869 --> 04:33:10.879 align:start position:0%
um okay i still see no one else wishes
 
04:33:12.310 --> 04:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
to speak to
 
04:33:14.070 --> 04:33:14.080 align:start position:0%

04:39:31.990 --> 04:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the community my
 
04:39:33.510 --> 04:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
name is lieutenant james larry from
 
04:39:35.429 --> 04:39:35.439 align:start position:0%
troop g
 
04:39:38.150 --> 04:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
my troop oversees the driver education
 
04:39:38.160 --> 04:39:40.230 align:start position:0%
my troop oversees the driver education
program

04:39:40.230 --> 04:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:39:42.310 --> 04:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
for the state of new hampshire
 
04:39:44.390 --> 04:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
i honestly don't know what the history
 
04:39:47.190 --> 04:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
is to the bill but i can speak to how
 
04:39:49.590 --> 04:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
our out-of-state transfers are handled
 
04:39:49.600 --> 04:39:50.788 align:start position:0%
our out-of-state transfers are handled
currently

04:39:50.788 --> 04:39:50.798 align:start position:0%
currently
 
04:39:53.270 --> 04:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
so if there's a student that took driver
 
04:39:55.590 --> 04:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
education in another state
 
04:39:58.708 --> 04:39:58.718 align:start position:0%
if they move to new hampshire prior to
 
04:40:00.470 --> 04:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
obtaining their driver's license in that
 
04:40:03.350 --> 04:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
state they have to meet our driver
 
04:40:05.590 --> 04:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
education our standard you know our
 
04:40:07.990 --> 04:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
minimum standards so in doing that right
 
04:40:10.868 --> 04:40:10.878 align:start position:0%
now they submit those records to the
 
04:40:12.470 --> 04:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
troop g our representative who's the
 
04:40:14.628 --> 04:40:14.638 align:start position:0%
supervisor of driver education and he
 
04:40:16.390 --> 04:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
ensures that they've met the proper
 
04:40:18.310 --> 04:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
number of behind the wheel um the
 
04:40:21.590 --> 04:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
classroom and the um observation hours
 
04:40:23.030 --> 04:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
and there's also two other sections
 
04:40:25.110 --> 04:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
because our state law also carves out an
 
04:40:26.628 --> 04:40:26.638 align:start position:0%
hour and a half of
 
04:40:28.310 --> 04:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
training around commercial motor
 
04:40:30.628 --> 04:40:30.638 align:start position:0%
vehicles and an hour half speaking about
 
04:40:32.868 --> 04:40:32.878 align:start position:0%
motorcycle rider safety so they need to
 
04:40:33.910 --> 04:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that they meet those
 
04:40:35.750 --> 04:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
qualifications as well it's my
 
04:40:37.190 --> 04:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
understanding that the intent of this
 
04:40:40.070 --> 04:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
bill is to help put some administrative
 
04:40:40.080 --> 04:40:41.350 align:start position:0%
bill is to help put some administrative
rule

04:40:41.350 --> 04:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
rule
 
04:40:43.670 --> 04:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
in setting those guidelines and outlines
 
04:40:45.990 --> 04:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
so that the standard whatever those
 
04:40:47.830 --> 04:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
standards are essentially would be
 
04:40:50.150 --> 04:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
available for someone to review so they
 
04:40:52.470 --> 04:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
know exactly what the expectation is so
 
04:40:53.830 --> 04:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
if they're a vermont resident they could
 
04:40:55.270 --> 04:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
look at our law administrative rule and
 
04:40:56.788 --> 04:40:56.798 align:start position:0%
know that these are the requirements in
 
04:40:57.990 --> 04:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
order to be able to transfer the license
 
04:40:59.110 --> 04:40:59.120 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire it's that's my
 
04:41:03.110 --> 04:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:04.310 --> 04:41:04.320 align:start position:0%

guys are doing say that's what we're
 
04:41:17.830 --> 04:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
going to do and we're good at that point
 
04:41:19.110 --> 04:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
i think what the thank you for your
 
04:41:20.550 --> 04:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
question i appreciate that i believe
 
04:41:23.110 --> 04:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
what the intent is here is to outline
 
04:41:25.750 --> 04:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
what the process for that um that
 
04:41:28.390 --> 04:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
transfer would be so right now it's kind
 
04:41:30.070 --> 04:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
of up to someone to figure out what do i
 
04:41:31.510 --> 04:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
do when i transfer my license and i'm
 
04:41:34.230 --> 04:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
under the age of 18. this would outline
 
04:41:36.470 --> 04:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
exactly what those pro what that step
 
04:41:38.070 --> 04:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
and what those processes would look like
 
04:41:42.230 --> 04:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:45.110 --> 04:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
any other question representative sykes
 
04:41:46.788 --> 04:41:46.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
04:41:46.798 --> 04:41:48.390 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
lieutenant

04:41:48.390 --> 04:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
lieutenant
 
04:41:50.628 --> 04:41:50.638 align:start position:0%
so the part that you just talked about
 
04:41:52.868 --> 04:41:52.878 align:start position:0%
is actually part two and it's very it's
 
04:41:55.510 --> 04:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
pretty clear to me what i
 
04:41:55.520 --> 04:41:57.430 align:start position:0%
pretty clear to me what i
um

04:41:57.430 --> 04:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:00.390 --> 04:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
on departments is section two of part
 
04:42:00.400 --> 04:42:01.510 align:start position:0%
on departments is section two of part
one

04:42:01.510 --> 04:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:42:03.910 --> 04:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
the other the other section two driver
 
04:42:06.948 --> 04:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
license compact license authority they
 
04:42:10.390 --> 04:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
talk about um
 
04:42:10.400 --> 04:42:11.430 align:start position:0%
talk about um
when

04:42:11.430 --> 04:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:42:13.990 --> 04:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
if there's an offense in a different
 
04:42:14.000 --> 04:42:15.750 align:start position:0%
if there's an offense in a different
state

04:42:15.750 --> 04:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:42:17.350 --> 04:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
the person could be
 
04:42:20.070 --> 04:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
that this accountability in this state
 
04:42:22.628 --> 04:42:22.638 align:start position:0%
is that what this is trying to get to
 
04:42:24.868 --> 04:42:24.878 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm not quite sure what that is
 
04:42:26.470 --> 04:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
that section is true yeah the section
 
04:42:27.990 --> 04:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
two part i'm not familiar with i'm not
 
04:42:30.150 --> 04:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
sure if that's something that you would
 
04:42:31.030 --> 04:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
talk to
 
04:42:32.948 --> 04:42:32.958 align:start position:0%
and i apologize yeah no that's right and
 
04:42:35.750 --> 04:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
as i follow up i'd like to know
 
04:42:38.150 --> 04:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
what are we doing now and how will this
 
04:42:39.190 --> 04:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
fix it
 
04:42:40.788 --> 04:42:40.798 align:start position:0%
are you talking about this the part two
 
04:42:42.948 --> 04:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
yeah so i i understand you can't answer
 
04:42:44.788 --> 04:42:44.798 align:start position:0%
that but thank you so i would ask the
 
04:42:46.150 --> 04:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
dmv i think we'll probably be able to
 
04:42:48.948 --> 04:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
give you some insight on that part of it
 
04:42:51.270 --> 04:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
we knew you all should have signed up
 
04:42:55.350 --> 04:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:57.030 --> 04:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon brittany
 
04:42:59.750 --> 04:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
bureau financial responsibility
 
04:43:03.750 --> 04:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
um great questions so part two
 
04:43:05.590 --> 04:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
i believe it further clarifies the
 
04:43:07.990 --> 04:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
director's authority to impose sanctions
 
04:43:08.000 --> 04:43:09.190 align:start position:0%
director's authority to impose sanctions
for

04:43:09.190 --> 04:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:43:10.708 --> 04:43:10.718 align:start position:0%
all the penalties which fall under the
 
04:43:12.550 --> 04:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
driver licensing compact so if you
 
04:43:14.628 --> 04:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
violate in another jurisdiction and
 
04:43:16.230 --> 04:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
that's reported back to us it's just
 
04:43:17.990 --> 04:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
further clarifying the actions that we
 
04:43:20.550 --> 04:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
can apply for those individuals
 
04:43:22.550 --> 04:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
for like fractions under the driver
 
04:43:25.110 --> 04:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
licensing compact
 
04:43:27.110 --> 04:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
that answer your question
 
04:43:36.230 --> 04:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:38.070 --> 04:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
i i guess i'm just curious why is the
 
04:43:41.670 --> 04:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:43.590 --> 04:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
for the follow-up that's the way i'm
 
04:43:43.600 --> 04:43:44.708 align:start position:0%
for the follow-up that's the way i'm
trying

04:43:44.708 --> 04:43:44.718 align:start position:0%
trying
 
04:43:47.510 --> 04:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
the department um again like lieutenant
 
04:43:49.030 --> 04:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
o'leary said we don't know the history
 
04:43:51.670 --> 04:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
behind this bill um and i can't speak to
 
04:43:55.750 --> 04:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:57.670 --> 04:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
i specifically so it may have come from
 
04:44:01.430 --> 04:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:03.510 --> 04:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
and i guess i have a question too and it
 
04:44:05.190 --> 04:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
gets to the same thing why are we
 
04:44:07.430 --> 04:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
reaffirming this because even the first
 
04:44:11.830 --> 04:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
roman 2 in section 1 line 11
 
04:44:13.990 --> 04:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
that's getting back to the driver's ed
 
04:44:16.868 --> 04:44:16.878 align:start position:0%
and the reciprocity
 
04:44:19.190 --> 04:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
if we're already doing it
 
04:44:20.788 --> 04:44:20.798 align:start position:0%
i just don't understand why this is
 
04:44:22.868 --> 04:44:22.878 align:start position:0%
needed because we just actually itl the
 
04:44:25.590 --> 04:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
bill last year that dealt with
 
04:44:27.590 --> 04:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
reciprocity but it was only the fact
 
04:44:29.110 --> 04:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
that you took
 
04:44:31.030 --> 04:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
the uh drivers in in another state you
 
04:44:32.788 --> 04:44:32.798 align:start position:0%
didn't have to do any additional
 
04:44:34.310 --> 04:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
training to make the difference up
 
04:44:36.230 --> 04:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
because our course is different
 
04:44:38.628 --> 04:44:38.638 align:start position:0%
i don't see that
 
04:44:40.550 --> 04:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
reaffirming what we currently do i see
 
04:44:42.550 --> 04:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
that as more of a way of getting back to
 
04:44:44.390 --> 04:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
just a straight reciprocity meaning if
 
04:44:46.868 --> 04:44:46.878 align:start position:0%
you took it in any state it's good here
 
04:44:49.350 --> 04:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
do you you don't read it that way
 
04:44:49.360 --> 04:44:51.190 align:start position:0%
do you you don't read it that way
okay

04:44:51.190 --> 04:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:44:52.948 --> 04:44:52.958 align:start position:0%
and now did you say this was also a
 
04:44:55.030 --> 04:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
request to the department
 
04:44:56.470 --> 04:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
i cannot confirm that like we stated
 
04:44:58.868 --> 04:44:58.878 align:start position:0%
we're not sure the complete history
 
04:45:00.948 --> 04:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
as i furthermore read section two of the
 
04:45:02.390 --> 04:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
bottom section
 
04:45:04.788 --> 04:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
with the transition to the state to
 
04:45:06.470 --> 04:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
state program the driver licensing
 
04:45:08.390 --> 04:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
compact there may have been discussions
 
04:45:11.270 --> 04:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
as to how best handle the state to state
 
04:45:13.190 --> 04:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
program that's been implemented which
 
04:45:15.430 --> 04:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
again is taking the
 
04:45:16.868 --> 04:45:16.878 align:start position:0%
information from one jurisdiction when
 
04:45:19.350 --> 04:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
they move into our our state and again
 
04:45:21.270 --> 04:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
the driver licensing compact um was
 
04:45:22.708 --> 04:45:22.718 align:start position:0%
established at one point and i think
 
04:45:24.788 --> 04:45:24.798 align:start position:0%
this is to support the state to state
 
04:45:26.788 --> 04:45:26.798 align:start position:0%
initiatives and further clarify those
 
04:45:26.798 --> 04:45:27.830 align:start position:0%
initiatives and further clarify those
rules

04:45:27.830 --> 04:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
rules
 
04:45:28.948 --> 04:45:28.958 align:start position:0%
with the
 
04:45:31.510 --> 04:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
next section below that okay thank you
 
04:45:35.590 --> 04:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
04:45:36.868 --> 04:45:36.878 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else that wishes to
 
04:45:38.948 --> 04:45:38.958 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
04:57:07.270 --> 04:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:10.868 --> 04:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:12.788 --> 04:57:12.798 align:start position:0%
i'm going to open up the public hearing
 
04:57:17.750 --> 04:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:19.350 --> 04:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
this is relative to the retention of
 
04:57:20.948 --> 04:57:20.958 align:start position:0%
social security numbers by the division
 
04:57:23.030 --> 04:57:23.040 align:start position:0%

04:57:46.150 --> 04:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
why this bill
 
04:57:48.788 --> 04:57:48.798 align:start position:0%
uh there's two things going on and we'll
 
04:57:51.750 --> 04:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
start at the beginning i called up
 
04:57:53.750 --> 04:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
the department and said
 
04:57:55.430 --> 04:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
do you guys have
 
04:57:57.590 --> 04:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
an objection to me putting in a bill
 
04:57:57.600 --> 04:57:58.708 align:start position:0%
an objection to me putting in a bill
that

04:57:58.708 --> 04:57:58.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:58:01.270 --> 04:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
requires at least four digits of the
 
04:58:05.590 --> 04:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:06.868 --> 04:58:06.878 align:start position:0%
why would you want to do a thing like
 
04:58:08.470 --> 04:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
that well
 
04:58:10.628 --> 04:58:10.638 align:start position:0%
election integrity
 
04:58:10.638 --> 04:58:11.750 align:start position:0%
election integrity
that's

04:58:11.750 --> 04:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:58:14.708 --> 04:58:14.718 align:start position:0%
my thing is elections right and election
 
04:58:17.430 --> 04:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
integrity how can i decide whether a
 
04:58:17.440 --> 04:58:18.628 align:start position:0%
integrity how can i decide whether a
person

04:58:18.628 --> 04:58:18.638 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:58:20.708 --> 04:58:20.718 align:start position:0%
is qualified to vote isn't qualified to
 
04:58:23.270 --> 04:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
vote if they show up because they live
 
04:58:26.470 --> 04:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
under the bridge on third street
 
04:58:28.948 --> 04:58:28.958 align:start position:0%
what do i do do i let him sign an
 
04:58:32.470 --> 04:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
affidavit that says i am who i am
 
04:58:35.190 --> 04:58:35.200 align:start position:0%

that's the way it is right now
 
04:58:48.070 --> 04:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
there are other pieces of information
 
04:58:49.590 --> 04:58:49.600 align:start position:0%
that we can go out
 
04:58:51.510 --> 04:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
and access
 
04:58:53.590 --> 04:58:53.600 align:start position:0%
to help a voter
 
04:58:55.270 --> 04:58:55.280 align:start position:0%

04:58:56.390 --> 04:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
third street
 
04:58:58.470 --> 04:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
or whether they just forgot to bring
 
04:59:00.150 --> 04:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
their id with them
 
04:59:02.310 --> 04:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
and want either to register to vote or
 
04:59:03.910 --> 04:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
04:59:06.948 --> 04:59:06.958 align:start position:0%
and one of those pieces of information
 
04:59:06.958 --> 04:59:07.750 align:start position:0%
and one of those pieces of information
that

04:59:07.750 --> 04:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:59:10.550 --> 04:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
hey you know even children that are born
 
04:59:13.510 --> 04:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
before tax season they need to go out
 
04:59:16.628 --> 04:59:16.638 align:start position:0%
and get them a social security number
 
04:59:18.628 --> 04:59:18.638 align:start position:0%
uh so that that can be put on their
 
04:59:18.638 --> 04:59:20.470 align:start position:0%
uh so that that can be put on their
taxes

04:59:20.470 --> 04:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
04:59:20.480 --> 04:59:21.830 align:start position:0%
taxes
and

04:59:21.830 --> 04:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:59:21.840 --> 04:59:22.708 align:start position:0%
and
that

04:59:22.708 --> 04:59:22.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:59:24.948 --> 04:59:24.958 align:start position:0%
would be the last four digits
 
04:59:26.628 --> 04:59:26.638 align:start position:0%
the bills that were in front of the
 
04:59:28.868 --> 04:59:28.878 align:start position:0%
house and senate down in washington this
 
04:59:28.878 --> 04:59:29.910 align:start position:0%
house and senate down in washington this
year

04:59:29.910 --> 04:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:59:32.628 --> 04:59:32.638 align:start position:0%
one of the provisions in there was thou
 
04:59:35.350 --> 04:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
shall not retain more than the last four
 
04:59:38.628 --> 04:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
digits of the social security number
 
04:59:38.638 --> 04:59:41.350 align:start position:0%
digits of the social security number
okay

04:59:41.350 --> 04:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:43.190 --> 04:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
i turn that around and look at it the
 
04:59:44.230 --> 04:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
other way
 
04:59:46.628 --> 04:59:46.638 align:start position:0%
you can retain the last four digits of
 
04:59:49.030 --> 04:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
the social security number
 
04:59:49.040 --> 04:59:50.868 align:start position:0%
the social security number
now

04:59:50.868 --> 04:59:50.878 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:59:53.670 --> 04:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
as we move through the process here it
 
04:59:56.150 --> 04:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
is interesting to note that right now on
 
04:59:58.070 --> 04:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
the registration form
 
05:00:01.110 --> 05:00:01.120 align:start position:0%
that you are asked to provide
 
05:00:03.510 --> 05:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
either your driver's license number and
 
05:00:03.520 --> 05:00:04.470 align:start position:0%
either your driver's license number and
id

05:00:04.470 --> 05:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
id
 
05:00:04.480 --> 05:00:05.350 align:start position:0%
id
or

05:00:05.350 --> 05:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:00:07.190 --> 05:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
the last four digits social security
 
05:00:07.200 --> 05:00:09.030 align:start position:0%
the last four digits social security
number

05:00:09.030 --> 05:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
number
 
05:00:09.040 --> 05:00:10.628 align:start position:0%
number
and

05:00:10.628 --> 05:00:10.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:00:12.948 --> 05:00:12.958 align:start position:0%
as we move through the process
 
05:00:16.310 --> 05:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
we will contain in our own the secretary
 
05:00:18.150 --> 05:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
of state's own database
 
05:00:20.470 --> 05:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
more and more of that information in
 
05:00:22.788 --> 05:00:22.798 align:start position:0%
those last four digits because it's
 
05:00:25.590 --> 05:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
easier for people to say oh yeah it's
 
05:00:27.190 --> 05:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
one two three four
 
05:00:29.430 --> 05:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
it's seven eight nine ten you know or
 
05:00:32.230 --> 05:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
seven eight nine one or whatever yeah i
 
05:00:34.070 --> 05:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
gotta get the digits right narrow you
 
05:00:35.830 --> 05:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
out you'll get
 
05:00:35.840 --> 05:00:37.190 align:start position:0%
out you'll get
so

05:00:37.190 --> 05:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:00:40.628 --> 05:00:40.638 align:start position:0%
i call up the department and i said well
 
05:00:40.638 --> 05:00:41.510 align:start position:0%
i call up the department and i said well
gee

05:00:41.510 --> 05:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
gee
 
05:00:43.990 --> 05:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
we have this other program out there
 
05:00:46.830 --> 05:00:46.840 align:start position:0%
that we want to use
 
05:00:49.110 --> 05:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
and we would like
 
05:00:51.030 --> 05:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
the last five digits
 
05:00:53.830 --> 05:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
of the social security number to help us
 
05:00:55.750 --> 05:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
in identifying people
 
05:00:55.760 --> 05:00:56.550 align:start position:0%
in identifying people
so

05:00:56.550 --> 05:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:00:59.270 --> 05:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
you know investigations and
 
05:01:02.230 --> 05:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
other incidents where they need to to
 
05:01:02.240 --> 05:01:03.430 align:start position:0%
other incidents where they need to to
verify

05:01:03.430 --> 05:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
verify
 
05:01:06.948 --> 05:01:06.958 align:start position:0%
this is fine i'll put the bill in
 
05:01:08.550 --> 05:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
05:01:08.560 --> 05:01:09.350 align:start position:0%
all right so
now

05:01:09.350 --> 05:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:01:11.750 --> 05:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
we get to people who are
 
05:01:14.948 --> 05:01:14.958 align:start position:0%
very concerned about
 
05:01:17.750 --> 05:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
release of information okay and social
 
05:01:20.310 --> 05:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
security number has been very
 
05:01:24.230 --> 05:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
sensitive information in the past
 
05:01:26.230 --> 05:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
does the state have
 
05:01:28.830 --> 05:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
a reason to do it
 
05:01:28.840 --> 05:01:30.550 align:start position:0%
a reason to do it
does

05:01:30.550 --> 05:01:30.560 align:start position:0%
does
 
05:01:34.708 --> 05:01:34.718 align:start position:0%
well when i talked to doit
 
05:01:38.390 --> 05:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
they said well we don't really need
 
05:01:41.430 --> 05:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
the number what we need is access to the
 
05:01:41.440 --> 05:01:42.310 align:start position:0%
the number what we need is access to the
number

05:01:42.310 --> 05:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
number
 
05:01:44.868 --> 05:01:44.878 align:start position:0%
we need a program that can go in
 
05:01:49.110 --> 05:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
and look into the dmv records and
 
05:01:54.150 --> 05:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:58.470 --> 05:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
and be able to to know that it's correct
 
05:01:58.480 --> 05:01:59.910 align:start position:0%
and be able to to know that it's correct
well

05:01:59.910 --> 05:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:02:01.750 --> 05:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
you know that's certainly
 
05:02:03.590 --> 05:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
in the way this system
 
05:02:06.788 --> 05:02:06.798 align:start position:0%
could be built or will be built
 
05:02:09.110 --> 05:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
can be built into it
 
05:02:11.270 --> 05:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
in some of the other committees there is
 
05:02:13.590 --> 05:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
a a program out there to have an
 
05:02:15.510 --> 05:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
election portal
 
05:02:15.520 --> 05:02:17.030 align:start position:0%
election portal
okay

05:02:17.030 --> 05:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:02:19.110 --> 05:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
when i go pay my taxes
 
05:02:22.788 --> 05:02:22.798 align:start position:0%
if i go into the state's online system
 
05:02:26.230 --> 05:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm filling out my dp10
 
05:02:29.910 --> 05:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:31.750 --> 05:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
what do they see well
 
05:02:33.830 --> 05:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
if they're trying to identify me they
 
05:02:36.788 --> 05:02:36.798 align:start position:0%
may have oh here's three addresses which
 
05:02:39.430 --> 05:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
one was associated with you
 
05:02:41.590 --> 05:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
which of these phone numbers was yours
 
05:02:44.310 --> 05:02:44.320 align:start position:0%

all information that's out there some of
 
05:02:52.788 --> 05:02:52.798 align:start position:0%
that information i find out now that
 
05:02:54.470 --> 05:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
i've looked into this
 
05:02:55.990 --> 05:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
we actually
 
05:02:58.150 --> 05:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
when someone goes in to get a vital
 
05:02:58.160 --> 05:02:59.830 align:start position:0%
when someone goes in to get a vital
record

05:02:59.830 --> 05:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
record
 
05:03:02.230 --> 05:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
that there is a system that the state
 
05:03:04.708 --> 05:03:04.718 align:start position:0%
does subscribe to
 
05:03:04.718 --> 05:03:05.590 align:start position:0%
does subscribe to
where

05:03:05.590 --> 05:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:03:08.708 --> 05:03:08.718 align:start position:0%
they can verify or shouldn't say verify
 
05:03:08.718 --> 05:03:09.750 align:start position:0%
they can verify or shouldn't say verify
um

05:03:09.750 --> 05:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:12.230 --> 05:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
i forget the exact word but if it's
 
05:03:14.310 --> 05:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
important to you you know give me an
 
05:03:17.830 --> 05:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
email and i'll go go get the right word
 
05:03:21.350 --> 05:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
um so it's a tool
 
05:03:21.360 --> 05:03:23.110 align:start position:0%
um so it's a tool
um

05:03:23.110 --> 05:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:25.270 --> 05:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
is there you know
 
05:03:27.750 --> 05:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
in in dealing with someone
 
05:03:29.590 --> 05:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
like i say that person that lives under
 
05:03:32.070 --> 05:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
the bridge on third street that lost
 
05:03:33.590 --> 05:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
their license
 
05:03:35.110 --> 05:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
05:03:37.510 --> 05:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
not because it was taken away but
 
05:03:40.070 --> 05:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
physically lost the the card
 
05:03:43.430 --> 05:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
um what is a piece of information
 
05:03:43.440 --> 05:03:45.030 align:start position:0%
um what is a piece of information
that

05:03:45.030 --> 05:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:03:47.750 --> 05:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
most everyone does know
 
05:03:50.788 --> 05:03:50.798 align:start position:0%
and can help us and them make this
 
05:03:52.708 --> 05:03:52.718 align:start position:0%
process efficient
 
05:03:54.868 --> 05:03:54.878 align:start position:0%
and easy on them
 
05:03:56.868 --> 05:03:56.878 align:start position:0%
and the thing that we came up with was
 
05:03:59.110 --> 05:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
those last four digits
 
05:04:01.590 --> 05:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
as we move into the portal we actually
 
05:04:04.390 --> 05:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
may have other information
 
05:04:06.390 --> 05:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
i tell people that
 
05:04:08.390 --> 05:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
my eldest brother
 
05:04:10.708 --> 05:04:10.718 align:start position:0%
was out here with his girlfriend
 
05:04:14.708 --> 05:04:14.718 align:start position:0%
in 1966 and if you can tell me
 
05:04:16.868 --> 05:04:16.878 align:start position:0%
who was the two people that stood up for
 
05:04:19.830 --> 05:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
him when he was at dover city hall
 
05:04:21.670 --> 05:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
saying i do
 
05:04:23.430 --> 05:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
you know it's pretty good indication
 
05:04:25.990 --> 05:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
that you know
 
05:04:27.990 --> 05:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
a lot about that individual and probably
 
05:04:29.990 --> 05:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
are that person
 
05:04:32.230 --> 05:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
and remember most of the selection stuff
 
05:04:32.240 --> 05:04:32.948 align:start position:0%
and remember most of the selection stuff
it's

05:04:32.948 --> 05:04:32.958 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:04:35.510 --> 05:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
if i can locate the person
 
05:04:35.520 --> 05:04:37.270 align:start position:0%
if i can locate the person
um

05:04:37.270 --> 05:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:39.990 --> 05:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's a very good indicator that
 
05:04:42.230 --> 05:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
they either a didn't do anything wrong
 
05:04:42.240 --> 05:04:43.030 align:start position:0%
they either a didn't do anything wrong
or

05:04:43.030 --> 05:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:04:45.110 --> 05:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
that we will be able to find out if they
 
05:04:47.110 --> 05:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
did so
 
05:04:48.948 --> 05:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
social security number that last four
 
05:04:52.390 --> 05:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
digits is important to us
 
05:04:56.230 --> 05:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
right now statute already says that
 
05:04:59.910 --> 05:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
it is an element in the voter database
 
05:05:01.590 --> 05:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
we want to be able to compare that
 
05:05:01.600 --> 05:05:02.788 align:start position:0%
we want to be able to compare that
number

05:05:02.788 --> 05:05:02.798 align:start position:0%
number
 
05:05:06.868 --> 05:05:06.878 align:start position:0%
with the one in the dmv database
 
05:05:09.590 --> 05:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
right now for people who have
 
05:05:11.510 --> 05:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
a real id
 
05:05:13.750 --> 05:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
that your whole social security number
 
05:05:15.750 --> 05:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
and your picture are retained in that
 
05:05:15.760 --> 05:05:17.270 align:start position:0%
and your picture are retained in that
system

05:05:17.270 --> 05:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:05:20.150 --> 05:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
but if you are only a state of new
 
05:05:21.990 --> 05:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire and department i'm sure will
 
05:05:23.750 --> 05:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
go into this much
 
05:05:26.150 --> 05:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
better uh than i can
 
05:05:28.150 --> 05:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
that there is an option on the form to
 
05:05:31.670 --> 05:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:33.990 --> 05:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
you have to supply it for your first
 
05:05:36.708 --> 05:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
license but then you can ask for it not
 
05:05:38.470 --> 05:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
to be retained
 
05:05:41.670 --> 05:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
that causes the department problems
 
05:05:45.510 --> 05:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:47.430 --> 05:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
in the three options system which is i
 
05:05:48.628 --> 05:05:48.638 align:start position:0%
think one of the
 
05:05:51.350 --> 05:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
amendments that was suggested on this
 
05:05:51.360 --> 05:05:53.350 align:start position:0%
amendments that was suggested on this
bill

05:05:53.350 --> 05:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:05:53.360 --> 05:05:54.310 align:start position:0%
bill
and

05:05:54.310 --> 05:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:05:57.030 --> 05:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly uh willing to sit here as
 
05:06:00.470 --> 05:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:02.470 --> 05:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you senator any questions from the
 
05:06:02.480 --> 05:06:06.310 align:start position:0%
thank you senator any questions from the
committee

05:06:06.310 --> 05:06:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:08.868 --> 05:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
representative oregon
 
05:06:11.030 --> 05:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
oh i'm um
 
05:06:12.868 --> 05:06:12.878 align:start position:0%
a little bit baffled how this interfaces
 
05:06:14.550 --> 05:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
with the voting issues since there's
 
05:06:17.750 --> 05:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
nothing about it in the bill but what
 
05:06:19.910 --> 05:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
scenario are you trying to catch it
 
05:06:21.830 --> 05:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
seems to me there's is this people who
 
05:06:21.840 --> 05:06:23.270 align:start position:0%
seems to me there's is this people who
have

05:06:23.270 --> 05:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:06:24.948 --> 05:06:24.958 align:start position:0%
get a driver's license in somebody
 
05:06:27.030 --> 05:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
else's name by falsely claiming to be
 
05:06:29.590 --> 05:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
them or these people who are showing up
 
05:06:31.270 --> 05:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
which understands a pretty small number
 
05:06:32.788 --> 05:06:32.798 align:start position:0%
who fill out uh
 
05:06:35.270 --> 05:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
affidavits because they don't have um
 
05:06:37.510 --> 05:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
have ids and
 
05:06:39.670 --> 05:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
might also add parenthetically that
 
05:06:41.830 --> 05:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
homeless people are allowed are allowed
 
05:06:43.270 --> 05:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
to vote so if you live under the bridge
 
05:06:45.270 --> 05:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
at third street that's a domicile like
 
05:06:47.350 --> 05:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
any others so but um
 
05:06:48.788 --> 05:06:48.798 align:start position:0%
so what exactly
 
05:06:50.628 --> 05:06:50.638 align:start position:0%
is it that you're trying to prevent here
 
05:06:53.590 --> 05:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the bill page one at
 
05:06:54.708 --> 05:06:54.718 align:start position:0%
the bottom
 
05:06:57.190 --> 05:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
and page two at the top
 
05:06:58.550 --> 05:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh c
 
05:07:01.430 --> 05:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
let me see is that's the right reference
 
05:07:04.390 --> 05:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
on the request on a case by case basis
 
05:07:07.270 --> 05:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
to the department of state for voter
 
05:07:09.990 --> 05:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
verification identification purposes
 
05:07:11.990 --> 05:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
provided that the department may only
 
05:07:13.910 --> 05:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
transmit the last four digits of the
 
05:07:16.550 --> 05:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
individual's number and that is the
 
05:07:20.310 --> 05:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
tie-in to the voter records through that
 
05:07:20.320 --> 05:07:23.990 align:start position:0%
tie-in to the voter records through that
database

05:07:23.990 --> 05:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:26.230 --> 05:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
so you're i'll give you one follow-up
 
05:07:26.240 --> 05:07:27.190 align:start position:0%
so you're i'll give you one follow-up
okay

05:07:27.190 --> 05:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:07:29.590 --> 05:07:29.600 align:start position:0%
um so your belief is that there may be a
 
05:07:31.750 --> 05:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
significant number of people
 
05:07:31.760 --> 05:07:32.830 align:start position:0%
significant number of people
who

05:07:32.830 --> 05:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:07:35.030 --> 05:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
um are impersonating other people in the
 
05:07:37.510 --> 05:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
voter database and if they had to know
 
05:07:39.270 --> 05:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
this piece of information then the
 
05:07:40.628 --> 05:07:40.638 align:start position:0%
secretary of state would have an easier
 
05:07:42.230 --> 05:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
time catching them is that what the
 
05:07:44.708 --> 05:07:44.718 align:start position:0%
purpose of this is no representative the
 
05:07:47.030 --> 05:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
purpose of this is to make it easier for
 
05:07:49.830 --> 05:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
someone who walks into the polling place
 
05:07:52.788 --> 05:07:52.798 align:start position:0%
to register to vote and not have to fill
 
05:07:52.798 --> 05:07:54.550 align:start position:0%
to register to vote and not have to fill
out

05:07:54.550 --> 05:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:07:56.868 --> 05:07:56.878 align:start position:0%
four different affidavits and i told you
 
05:07:59.190 --> 05:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
that they were identity they were age
 
05:08:00.708 --> 05:08:00.718 align:start position:0%
they were citizenship and they were
 
05:08:03.190 --> 05:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
domicile on which they are filling those
 
05:08:06.310 --> 05:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
affidavits out under penalty of perjury
 
05:08:08.070 --> 05:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
and that the state does do
 
05:08:10.788 --> 05:08:10.798 align:start position:0%
investigations into those so we will be
 
05:08:13.270 --> 05:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
saving the voters time we will be saving
 
05:08:14.788 --> 05:08:14.798 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:08:16.390 --> 05:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
money and time
 
05:08:19.110 --> 05:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
in investigating people if we can
 
05:08:21.510 --> 05:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
find a system which more easily
 
05:08:21.520 --> 05:08:22.868 align:start position:0%
find a system which more easily
identifies

05:08:22.868 --> 05:08:22.878 align:start position:0%
identifies
 
05:08:25.830 --> 05:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
them to our satisfaction that they are
 
05:08:27.590 --> 05:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
who they are
 
05:08:30.470 --> 05:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
if they fail to bring any of those
 
05:08:32.708 --> 05:08:32.718 align:start position:0%
records with them
 
05:08:37.030 --> 05:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:38.948 --> 05:08:38.958 align:start position:0%
representative talersky thank you thank
 
05:08:40.708 --> 05:08:40.718 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question senator
 
05:08:42.868 --> 05:08:42.878 align:start position:0%
curious if the secretary of state or his
 
05:08:44.868 --> 05:08:44.878 align:start position:0%
office had an opinion on that this was
 
05:08:47.750 --> 05:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:49.750 --> 05:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
um i've had these discussions with the
 
05:08:51.430 --> 05:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
05:08:54.390 --> 05:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
over several years
 
05:08:54.400 --> 05:08:56.470 align:start position:0%
over several years
certainly

05:08:56.470 --> 05:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
05:09:00.150 --> 05:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
the prior secretary of state was not as
 
05:09:03.590 --> 05:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh interested in an election portal as
 
05:09:06.470 --> 05:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
the current secretary of state
 
05:09:08.708 --> 05:09:08.718 align:start position:0%
but i have been persistent
 
05:09:11.750 --> 05:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
my vision going forward is a a system
 
05:09:11.760 --> 05:09:13.030 align:start position:0%
my vision going forward is a a system
where

05:09:13.030 --> 05:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:09:15.990 --> 05:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
an individual walks into a polling place
 
05:09:19.270 --> 05:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh sees a line in the check-in list
 
05:09:21.110 --> 05:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
can go on the portal enter their
 
05:09:21.120 --> 05:09:22.310 align:start position:0%
can go on the portal enter their
information

05:09:22.310 --> 05:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:09:24.470 --> 05:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh hit a button transmit that
 
05:09:26.708 --> 05:09:26.718 align:start position:0%
information to the
 
05:09:28.230 --> 05:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the checklist the
 
05:09:31.030 --> 05:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
supervisor checklist looks at their id
 
05:09:33.110 --> 05:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
copies down a number the person signs
 
05:09:35.670 --> 05:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
and goes votes and
 
05:09:39.670 --> 05:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
there is virtually no delay
 
05:09:41.910 --> 05:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
and to accomplish that
 
05:09:44.230 --> 05:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
the voter identification is a very
 
05:09:45.910 --> 05:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
important part of that
 
05:09:47.750 --> 05:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
and so getting to that voter
 
05:09:50.470 --> 05:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
identification what can i do today
 
05:09:50.480 --> 05:09:51.590 align:start position:0%
identification what can i do today
today

05:09:51.590 --> 05:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:09:53.030 --> 05:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
there is
 
05:09:55.430 --> 05:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
in our database in the election database
 
05:09:58.470 --> 05:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
there is the last four digits if the
 
05:10:00.230 --> 05:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
voter registered
 
05:10:02.470 --> 05:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
after a certain time when that form was
 
05:10:04.788 --> 05:10:04.798 align:start position:0%
changed to ask for it
 
05:10:08.470 --> 05:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
and that that information is also in
 
05:10:11.430 --> 05:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
the dmv database for people with real
 
05:10:11.440 --> 05:10:12.470 align:start position:0%
the dmv database for people with real
ids

05:10:12.470 --> 05:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
ids
 
05:10:15.190 --> 05:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
and hopefully through this bill it will
 
05:10:17.590 --> 05:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
be available for others
 
05:10:18.628 --> 05:10:18.638 align:start position:0%
in there
 
05:10:21.190 --> 05:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
and that that will be a very quick and
 
05:10:24.230 --> 05:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
easy way for us to get at least an
 
05:10:24.240 --> 05:10:26.708 align:start position:0%
easy way for us to get at least an
indication

05:10:26.708 --> 05:10:26.718 align:start position:0%
indication
 
05:10:29.510 --> 05:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
to me it's probably good enough
 
05:10:31.110 --> 05:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
it's as good as them signing the
 
05:10:33.670 --> 05:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
affidavit without anything
 
05:10:33.680 --> 05:10:34.708 align:start position:0%
affidavit without anything
to

05:10:34.708 --> 05:10:34.718 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:10:38.550 --> 05:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:39.670 --> 05:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:10:41.350 --> 05:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
representative hill
 
05:10:43.110 --> 05:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
05:10:45.030 --> 05:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
05:10:48.070 --> 05:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
um i'm assuming
 
05:10:50.628 --> 05:10:50.638 align:start position:0%
that you're not asking the social
 
05:10:52.150 --> 05:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
security number
 
05:10:54.708 --> 05:10:54.718 align:start position:0%
to be on the license itself because
 
05:10:56.628 --> 05:10:56.638 align:start position:0%
you're saying that if someone walks into
 
05:10:59.830 --> 05:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
the polling place without anything
 
05:11:02.070 --> 05:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
which to me means that they're walking
 
05:11:05.030 --> 05:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
in without a driver's license
 
05:11:07.270 --> 05:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
as long as they know the number there
 
05:11:08.868 --> 05:11:08.878 align:start position:0%
would be some way
 
05:11:10.708 --> 05:11:10.718 align:start position:0%
at the polling place
 
05:11:12.390 --> 05:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
for that person to
 
05:11:14.550 --> 05:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
verbally say what their social security
 
05:11:16.948 --> 05:11:16.958 align:start position:0%
number is and that matches the
 
05:11:19.750 --> 05:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
dmv is that how that works well in one
 
05:11:22.230 --> 05:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
of the other bills we talk about
 
05:11:25.510 --> 05:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
non-published data okay in that
 
05:11:28.628 --> 05:11:28.638 align:start position:0%
application uh the person is asked for
 
05:11:28.638 --> 05:11:29.510 align:start position:0%
application uh the person is asked for
their

05:11:29.510 --> 05:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:11:31.510 --> 05:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh place of birth they're asked for
 
05:11:34.470 --> 05:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
their date of birth they're asked for
 
05:11:36.708 --> 05:11:36.718 align:start position:0%
uh like i say either driver's license
 
05:11:40.070 --> 05:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
number and state or the last four digits
 
05:11:41.910 --> 05:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
of social security number all of that
 
05:11:44.310 --> 05:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
information is non-published
 
05:11:47.670 --> 05:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
okay and not available through rsa 91a
 
05:11:47.680 --> 05:11:49.190 align:start position:0%
okay and not available through rsa 91a
requests

05:11:49.190 --> 05:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
requests
 
05:11:51.670 --> 05:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
but it is information and the
 
05:11:53.110 --> 05:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
discussions that i've had with the
 
05:11:55.990 --> 05:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
current secretary of state is that that
 
05:11:58.390 --> 05:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
information certainly could be for the
 
05:12:02.470 --> 05:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
voters in that uh polling place
 
05:12:04.708 --> 05:12:04.718 align:start position:0%
uh that that could be printed on a
 
05:12:06.310 --> 05:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
separate list that the
 
05:12:07.590 --> 05:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
they would have
 
05:12:09.270 --> 05:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
even if they didn't have internet
 
05:12:11.590 --> 05:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
capability and somebody could run down
 
05:12:13.750 --> 05:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
through that list very quickly
 
05:12:16.868 --> 05:12:16.878 align:start position:0%
if you forgot your license
 
05:12:19.670 --> 05:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
some of the other things that you'll see
 
05:12:21.430 --> 05:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
possibly that
 
05:12:23.670 --> 05:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
we're looking at
 
05:12:23.680 --> 05:12:24.610 align:start position:0%
we're looking at
is

05:12:24.610 --> 05:12:24.620 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:12:24.620 --> 05:12:26.310 align:start position:0%
is
[Music]

05:12:26.310 --> 05:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:12:29.190 --> 05:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
you know other ways to to verify
 
05:12:33.350 --> 05:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh if you go in there with your
 
05:12:36.150 --> 05:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
cousin who's now living with you because
 
05:12:38.310 --> 05:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
of covid or whatever
 
05:12:41.030 --> 05:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
allowing one voter who has proper
 
05:12:43.750 --> 05:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
identification to vouch for another one
 
05:12:46.070 --> 05:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
again the purpose is to cut the list
 
05:12:48.628 --> 05:12:48.638 align:start position:0%
down to make it easier on the voter to
 
05:12:48.638 --> 05:12:49.350 align:start position:0%
down to make it easier on the voter to
go

05:12:49.350 --> 05:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
go
 
05:12:52.708 --> 05:12:52.718 align:start position:0%
register or to go vote
 
05:12:54.868 --> 05:12:54.878 align:start position:0%
but to do that
 
05:12:57.750 --> 05:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
some people would say that you know i'm
 
05:12:59.750 --> 05:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
asking for things i shouldn't be asking
 
05:12:59.760 --> 05:13:00.550 align:start position:0%
asking for things i shouldn't be asking
for

05:13:00.550 --> 05:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:13:03.990 --> 05:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
um i don't see it that way i think that
 
05:13:06.948 --> 05:13:06.958 align:start position:0%
in the constitution where it says any
 
05:13:08.550 --> 05:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
inhabitant of the state
 
05:13:10.628 --> 05:13:10.638 align:start position:0%
you know has the right to vote
 
05:13:12.708 --> 05:13:12.718 align:start position:0%
uh but then goes on to say once they've
 
05:13:16.070 --> 05:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
established a domicile that um
 
05:13:18.390 --> 05:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
you know that gives us the
 
05:13:20.390 --> 05:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
the authority to go in and check for the
 
05:13:22.310 --> 05:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
some of those things that
 
05:13:24.390 --> 05:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
are required for people to vote
 
05:13:25.670 --> 05:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
and right now
 
05:13:27.350 --> 05:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
we have age
 
05:13:28.708 --> 05:13:28.718 align:start position:0%
we have
 
05:13:28.718 --> 05:13:29.990 align:start position:0%
we have
citizenship

05:13:29.990 --> 05:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
citizenship
 
05:13:31.110 --> 05:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
we have
 
05:13:31.120 --> 05:13:32.470 align:start position:0%
we have
domicile

05:13:32.470 --> 05:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
domicile
 
05:13:35.430 --> 05:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
but to be able to use records to prove
 
05:13:35.440 --> 05:13:36.230 align:start position:0%
but to be able to use records to prove
that

05:13:36.230 --> 05:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:13:38.470 --> 05:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
already in statute it says you first
 
05:13:39.430 --> 05:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
need to
 
05:13:41.990 --> 05:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
prove your identity so that you can
 
05:13:45.030 --> 05:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
prove that those records apply to you
 
05:13:46.948 --> 05:13:46.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:13:49.030 --> 05:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative sykes
 
05:13:51.190 --> 05:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
05:13:52.948 --> 05:13:52.958 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
05:13:52.958 --> 05:13:53.830 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
this

05:13:53.830 --> 05:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:13:55.510 --> 05:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
i'm just a little bit confused this
 
05:13:57.350 --> 05:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
portal that you talk about does not
 
05:13:58.948 --> 05:13:58.958 align:start position:0%
currently exist
 
05:14:03.910 --> 05:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
the portal bill i believe is in front of
 
05:14:06.390 --> 05:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
your elections committee right now
 
05:14:07.830 --> 05:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
will this
 
05:14:09.590 --> 05:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
follow up please
 
05:14:11.350 --> 05:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
well the changes that you are looking
 
05:14:14.470 --> 05:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
for in this bill
 
05:14:14.480 --> 05:14:15.750 align:start position:0%
for in this bill
help

05:14:15.750 --> 05:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
help
 
05:14:15.760 --> 05:14:16.628 align:start position:0%
help
if

05:14:16.628 --> 05:14:16.638 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:14:18.708 --> 05:14:18.718 align:start position:0%
will it work without that portal let's
 
05:14:20.230 --> 05:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
say the other bill never gets through
 
05:14:21.990 --> 05:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
the rest of the process
 
05:14:24.310 --> 05:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
either one can be used independently
 
05:14:26.948 --> 05:14:26.958 align:start position:0%
they would be much more efficient and
 
05:14:29.510 --> 05:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
easier to manage should you pass them
 
05:14:29.520 --> 05:14:30.390 align:start position:0%
easier to manage should you pass them
both

05:14:30.390 --> 05:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
both
 
05:14:32.390 --> 05:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
there's also other bills out there that
 
05:14:34.948 --> 05:14:34.958 align:start position:0%
i haven't talked about that would also
 
05:14:36.708 --> 05:14:36.718 align:start position:0%
assist in that
 
05:14:38.550 --> 05:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
one final sure
 
05:14:41.750 --> 05:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:41.760 --> 05:14:42.788 align:start position:0%
 
has

05:14:42.788 --> 05:14:42.798 align:start position:0%
has
 
05:14:42.798 --> 05:14:44.230 align:start position:0%
has
anyone

05:14:44.230 --> 05:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
05:14:46.470 --> 05:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
prepared any fiscal notes to go with any
 
05:14:48.390 --> 05:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
of these bills so that we know
 
05:14:50.310 --> 05:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
what the cost may be in order to
 
05:14:52.470 --> 05:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
implement these programs
 
05:14:55.910 --> 05:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
the portal bill has a very large fiscal
 
05:14:57.830 --> 05:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
note and that is
 
05:15:01.350 --> 05:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
um i don't remember the exact number
 
05:15:02.948 --> 05:15:02.958 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
05:15:05.190 --> 05:15:05.200 align:start position:0%
people that are on that committee have
 
05:15:05.200 --> 05:15:06.070 align:start position:0%
people that are on that committee have
it

05:15:06.070 --> 05:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:15:08.150 --> 05:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
i could go on look it up i can look it
 
05:15:10.230 --> 05:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
up thank you i appreciate it and the
 
05:15:13.270 --> 05:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
reason that it is as high as it is
 
05:15:14.310 --> 05:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:15:16.948 --> 05:15:16.958 align:start position:0%
these services that you would go to that
 
05:15:18.470 --> 05:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
know your
 
05:15:20.868 --> 05:15:20.878 align:start position:0%
mother's father's maiden name
 
05:15:24.470 --> 05:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
okay her wife's maiden name or whatever
 
05:15:27.590 --> 05:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh are very expensive and that if only
 
05:15:30.310 --> 05:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
one department a the secretary of state
 
05:15:33.910 --> 05:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
goes in and pays for that then that is a
 
05:15:36.708 --> 05:15:36.718 align:start position:0%
big expense but if other departments
 
05:15:39.030 --> 05:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
come online with that
 
05:15:41.430 --> 05:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
or other functions come online and that
 
05:15:42.948 --> 05:15:42.958 align:start position:0%
cost is shared
 
05:15:45.190 --> 05:15:45.200 align:start position:0%
then it will be cut in half if two would
 
05:15:48.230 --> 05:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
be cut into the third if three cut into
 
05:15:50.948 --> 05:15:50.958 align:start position:0%
a quarter and on until
 
05:15:53.270 --> 05:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
and certainly you know we mentioned the
 
05:15:56.230 --> 05:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
dp-10 your income tax form here in the
 
05:15:59.350 --> 05:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire that's certainly
 
05:16:00.948 --> 05:16:00.958 align:start position:0%
another place
 
05:16:02.788 --> 05:16:02.798 align:start position:0%
that could be used department of health
 
05:16:05.430 --> 05:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
and human services
 
05:16:07.830 --> 05:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
you know even
 
05:16:07.840 --> 05:16:09.350 align:start position:0%
you know even
the

05:16:09.350 --> 05:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:16:11.990 --> 05:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
wildlife you know registering a deer i
 
05:16:14.390 --> 05:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
mean there's all kinds of uses for that
 
05:16:14.400 --> 05:16:15.670 align:start position:0%
mean there's all kinds of uses for that
information

05:16:15.670 --> 05:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:16:19.270 --> 05:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:22.470 --> 05:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
05:16:24.230 --> 05:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
you have one representative
 
05:16:26.470 --> 05:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
05:16:28.868 --> 05:16:28.878 align:start position:0%
the five digits versus the four digits
 
05:16:30.868 --> 05:16:30.878 align:start position:0%
it sounded to me the way you described
 
05:16:32.788 --> 05:16:32.798 align:start position:0%
it that we would be in violation of
 
05:16:35.110 --> 05:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
federal law if we did five
 
05:16:37.030 --> 05:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
but can you explain what the purpose of
 
05:16:38.948 --> 05:16:38.958 align:start position:0%
that fifth one was
 
05:16:43.190 --> 05:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
the fifth digit can't be used for
 
05:16:45.510 --> 05:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
well would not according to this bill
 
05:16:47.990 --> 05:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
would not be used for any secretary of
 
05:16:49.590 --> 05:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
state purposes
 
05:16:51.430 --> 05:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
05:16:54.150 --> 05:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
the law that i was referring to did not
 
05:16:54.160 --> 05:16:55.030 align:start position:0%
the law that i was referring to did not
pass

05:16:55.030 --> 05:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
pass
 
05:17:01.110 --> 05:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
it was at one point called hr1 and s-1
 
05:17:01.120 --> 05:17:02.150 align:start position:0%
it was at one point called hr1 and s-1
okay

05:17:02.150 --> 05:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:17:04.788 --> 05:17:04.798 align:start position:0%
but has not been passed but it is
 
05:17:07.190 --> 05:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
indicative of other legislation that has
 
05:17:08.788 --> 05:17:08.798 align:start position:0%
been brought forward
 
05:17:08.798 --> 05:17:09.750 align:start position:0%
been brought forward
where

05:17:09.750 --> 05:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:17:09.760 --> 05:17:11.590 align:start position:0%
where
the

05:17:11.590 --> 05:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:17:15.590 --> 05:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
people who have written that legislation
 
05:17:19.030 --> 05:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
down in washington have said that yeah
 
05:17:21.030 --> 05:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
the last four is okay
 
05:17:24.868 --> 05:17:24.878 align:start position:0%
and so reflecting that in this bill
 
05:17:27.350 --> 05:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
and what we've done in the past
 
05:17:29.750 --> 05:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
certainly you're going to get to
 
05:17:31.430 --> 05:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
people who are going to match if you're
 
05:17:33.910 --> 05:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
only using those last four digits but
 
05:17:35.910 --> 05:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
remember in the election database i not
 
05:17:38.550 --> 05:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
only have the last four digits i've also
 
05:17:39.910 --> 05:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
got your
 
05:17:42.868 --> 05:17:42.878 align:start position:0%
date and place of birth and i have other
 
05:17:44.310 --> 05:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
things in there
 
05:17:46.708 --> 05:17:46.718 align:start position:0%
plus your initials etc
 
05:17:49.990 --> 05:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
that can be used to narrow that down and
 
05:17:51.670 --> 05:17:51.680 align:start position:0%
so that when you combine those things
 
05:17:51.680 --> 05:17:52.708 align:start position:0%
so that when you combine those things
together

05:17:52.708 --> 05:17:52.718 align:start position:0%
together
 
05:17:52.718 --> 05:17:53.750 align:start position:0%
together
um

05:17:53.750 --> 05:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:55.990 --> 05:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
you know and using it as a unique
 
05:17:56.000 --> 05:17:57.430 align:start position:0%
you know and using it as a unique
identifier

05:17:57.430 --> 05:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
identifier
 
05:17:58.708 --> 05:17:58.718 align:start position:0%
we're pretty
 
05:18:01.190 --> 05:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
sure that we can get right down to you
 
05:18:04.390 --> 05:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
but again i want to use it as a way for
 
05:18:07.030 --> 05:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
you a citizen who goes in to vote
 
05:18:09.270 --> 05:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
and either forgets your id
 
05:18:09.280 --> 05:18:11.430 align:start position:0%
and either forgets your id
or

05:18:11.430 --> 05:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:18:13.030 --> 05:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
you're going in to register and you
 
05:18:15.270 --> 05:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
don't have proper identification for
 
05:18:16.550 --> 05:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
different things
 
05:18:18.628 --> 05:18:18.638 align:start position:0%
i want to use that as a piece of
 
05:18:18.638 --> 05:18:20.230 align:start position:0%
i want to use that as a piece of
information

05:18:20.230 --> 05:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:18:21.350 --> 05:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
to help
 
05:18:23.190 --> 05:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
you register to vote
 
05:18:26.070 --> 05:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
without having to sign affidavits
 
05:18:29.430 --> 05:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
or being able to sign the affidavit and
 
05:18:32.470 --> 05:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
the inspector taking a look at it
 
05:18:34.868 --> 05:18:34.878 align:start position:0%
reviewing it and then deciding that we
 
05:18:37.270 --> 05:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
don't need to pursue anything further
 
05:18:39.750 --> 05:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
because there is um
 
05:18:41.910 --> 05:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
a record at the welfare office that you
 
05:18:44.470 --> 05:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
came in and signed up for benefits or
 
05:18:48.390 --> 05:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
there is uh a record of your taxes you
 
05:18:48.400 --> 05:18:49.110 align:start position:0%
there is uh a record of your taxes you
know

05:18:49.110 --> 05:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:18:53.750 --> 05:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh x number whatever uh that your
 
05:18:57.110 --> 05:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
mother father's address is this and
 
05:18:57.120 --> 05:18:58.708 align:start position:0%
mother father's address is this and
again

05:18:58.708 --> 05:18:58.718 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:19:00.948 --> 05:19:00.958 align:start position:0%
if you want to make it easier for people
 
05:19:02.628 --> 05:19:02.638 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
05:19:06.230 --> 05:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
and don't want them to be subject to
 
05:19:08.310 --> 05:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
signing all those affidavits or being
 
05:19:11.110 --> 05:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
investigated because they did we need to
 
05:19:13.750 --> 05:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
change something
 
05:19:15.990 --> 05:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
we need to change something
 
05:19:18.070 --> 05:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
this is one of those things this and the
 
05:19:20.070 --> 05:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
portal are some of those things that you
 
05:19:21.270 --> 05:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
can go out
 
05:19:23.510 --> 05:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
and you can change
 
05:19:27.350 --> 05:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
and we won't have 2 000 whatever people
 
05:19:30.470 --> 05:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
signing the affidavits for not one not
 
05:19:33.590 --> 05:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
two but all four of those things
 
05:19:37.990 --> 05:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
identity age citizenship and domicile
 
05:19:40.550 --> 05:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
right now if propriety would allow you
 
05:19:42.470 --> 05:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
could walk in with nothing in your hands
 
05:19:45.110 --> 05:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
and nothing on you at all
 
05:19:47.110 --> 05:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
as god created you
 
05:19:48.868 --> 05:19:48.878 align:start position:0%
and you could go vote
 
05:19:51.030 --> 05:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
we would take your picture and we would
 
05:19:52.550 --> 05:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
have you sign
 
05:19:57.990 --> 05:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:00.948 --> 05:20:00.958 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
05:20:07.430 --> 05:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:08.788 --> 05:20:08.798 align:start position:0%
next up
 
05:20:11.110 --> 05:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
neil kirk representing himself
 
05:20:16.948 --> 05:20:16.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:18.948 --> 05:20:18.958 align:start position:0%
good afternoon once again mr chairman
 
05:20:20.550 --> 05:20:20.560 align:start position:0%

representative smith good to see you
um

05:20:32.628 --> 05:20:32.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:34.470 --> 05:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
i'm opposed to this bill because it
 
05:20:36.708 --> 05:20:36.718 align:start position:0%
requires the department to do something
 
05:20:38.948 --> 05:20:38.958 align:start position:0%
which it today cannot do and that is to
 
05:20:41.510 --> 05:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
demand your social security number
 
05:20:43.270 --> 05:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
under current law
 
05:20:45.030 --> 05:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
first-time drivers have to submit their
 
05:20:47.510 --> 05:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
social security number but may request
 
05:20:48.948 --> 05:20:48.958 align:start position:0%
it to be removed from the department
 
05:20:51.350 --> 05:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
after they've gotten their license
 
05:20:53.510 --> 05:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
under current law
 
05:20:54.948 --> 05:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
the department can ask you for your
 
05:20:56.548 --> 05:20:56.558 align:start position:0%
social security number but you can
 
05:20:58.548 --> 05:20:58.558 align:start position:0%
decline to provide it
 
05:21:01.030 --> 05:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
so right now the department for those
 
05:21:02.548 --> 05:21:02.558 align:start position:0%
people who are concerned about social
 
05:21:04.708 --> 05:21:04.718 align:start position:0%
security numbers privacy and all sorts
 
05:21:06.548 --> 05:21:06.558 align:start position:0%
of other things
 
05:21:08.310 --> 05:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
the the state through the department of
 
05:21:10.070 --> 05:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles does not have their
 
05:21:11.830 --> 05:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
social security number
 
05:21:14.390 --> 05:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
this bill changes that
 
05:21:16.310 --> 05:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
it gives you an option of providing your
 
05:21:18.390 --> 05:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
entire social security number or only
 
05:21:20.470 --> 05:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
the last five digits but one way or
 
05:21:20.480 --> 05:21:21.430 align:start position:0%
the last five digits but one way or
another

05:21:21.430 --> 05:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
another
 
05:21:23.590 --> 05:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
every single person in this state when
 
05:21:25.590 --> 05:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
they next register to vote and newcomers
 
05:21:27.910 --> 05:21:27.920 align:start position:0%

register i'm sorry
 
05:21:32.150 --> 05:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
every time you
 
05:21:35.030 --> 05:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
renew your license
 
05:21:38.150 --> 05:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
first timers as well as existing license
 
05:21:40.150 --> 05:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
holders you will have to provide either
 
05:21:43.030 --> 05:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
the full social security number or
 
05:21:44.788 --> 05:21:44.798 align:start position:0%
those five digits
 
05:21:44.798 --> 05:21:46.830 align:start position:0%
those five digits
now

05:21:46.830 --> 05:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:21:46.840 --> 05:21:48.470 align:start position:0%
now
currently

05:21:48.470 --> 05:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
currently
 
05:21:50.868 --> 05:21:50.878 align:start position:0%
under the bill and
 
05:21:52.708 --> 05:21:52.718 align:start position:0%
under current law
 
05:21:57.708 --> 05:21:57.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:01.990 --> 05:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
24 25 and 26.
 
05:22:04.310 --> 05:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
department um
 
05:22:06.390 --> 05:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
shall only make the social security
 
05:22:08.390 --> 05:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
number available and remember that's
 
05:22:09.670 --> 05:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
only for those people who have
 
05:22:12.070 --> 05:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
voluntarily provided it
 
05:22:14.150 --> 05:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
to other states for driver record
 
05:22:16.868 --> 05:22:16.878 align:start position:0%
purposes to any national driver
 
05:22:19.830 --> 05:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
information repository established
 
05:22:21.990 --> 05:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
pursuant to federal law that could be
 
05:22:24.390 --> 05:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
privately or otherwise operated it's not
 
05:22:26.310 --> 05:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily federal
 
05:22:26.320 --> 05:22:28.390 align:start position:0%
necessarily federal
and

05:22:28.390 --> 05:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:22:30.708 --> 05:22:30.718 align:start position:0%
to the department of state for voter
 
05:22:32.788 --> 05:22:32.798 align:start position:0%
registration purposes the last one is
 
05:22:35.830 --> 05:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
new and senator gray discussed that
 
05:22:35.840 --> 05:22:36.948 align:start position:0%
new and senator gray discussed that
so

05:22:36.948 --> 05:22:36.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:22:40.948 --> 05:22:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:42.708 --> 05:22:42.718 align:start position:0%
at the very least five digits of
 
05:22:45.030 --> 05:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
everyone's social security number could
 
05:22:46.310 --> 05:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
go to
 
05:22:48.948 --> 05:22:48.958 align:start position:0%
other states for driver record purposes
 
05:22:51.030 --> 05:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
to any national driver information
 
05:22:53.030 --> 05:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
repository established by the federal
 
05:22:56.230 --> 05:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
government and the last four to the
 
05:22:58.708 --> 05:22:58.718 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
05:23:02.230 --> 05:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
this to me is a very major change in the
 
05:23:04.470 --> 05:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
privacy protection that this legislature
 
05:23:06.150 --> 05:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
has established for social security
 
05:23:08.788 --> 05:23:08.798 align:start position:0%
numbers a very major change and that's
 
05:23:11.430 --> 05:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
why i oppose the bill
 
05:23:13.670 --> 05:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
i note that the secretary of state is
 
05:23:15.830 --> 05:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
not testifying has taken no position on
 
05:23:18.628 --> 05:23:18.638 align:start position:0%
this does not apparently need this
 
05:23:20.470 --> 05:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
um when i checked with the secretary of
 
05:23:22.868 --> 05:23:22.878 align:start position:0%
state's office some time ago
 
05:23:27.510 --> 05:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:27.520 --> 05:23:29.350 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:23:29.350 --> 05:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:23:31.110 --> 05:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
while senator gray talks about the need
 
05:23:34.708 --> 05:23:34.718 align:start position:0%
for this bill for a variety of election
 
05:23:36.868 --> 05:23:36.878 align:start position:0%
integrity purposes as well as to make it
 
05:23:39.030 --> 05:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
easier for people to vote
 
05:23:40.708 --> 05:23:40.718 align:start position:0%
the authority that's really involved in
 
05:23:42.150 --> 05:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
this doesn't seem to have taken a
 
05:23:42.160 --> 05:23:45.110 align:start position:0%
this doesn't seem to have taken a
position

05:23:45.110 --> 05:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:48.548 --> 05:23:48.558 align:start position:0%
the other point that i'd like to mention
 
05:23:51.030 --> 05:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:23:53.110 --> 05:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
the dmv is currently using whatever
 
05:23:55.030 --> 05:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
information they have to participate in
 
05:23:57.590 --> 05:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
databases with other states and with the
 
05:23:57.600 --> 05:23:58.708 align:start position:0%
databases with other states and with the
national

05:23:58.708 --> 05:23:58.718 align:start position:0%
national
 
05:23:58.718 --> 05:24:00.628 align:start position:0%
national
repository

05:24:00.628 --> 05:24:00.638 align:start position:0%
repository
 
05:24:02.628 --> 05:24:02.638 align:start position:0%
while this might make it easier for them
 
05:24:04.070 --> 05:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
or make it more complete or more
 
05:24:06.150 --> 05:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
accurate it is not essential it is not
 
05:24:08.150 --> 05:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
necessary for them to continue business
 
05:24:09.510 --> 05:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
as usual
 
05:24:11.430 --> 05:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
and i hope you'll hear from them and
 
05:24:14.150 --> 05:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
they will explain exactly
 
05:24:15.670 --> 05:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
how this would help them and how it's
 
05:24:16.948 --> 05:24:16.958 align:start position:0%
necessary and how they could live
 
05:24:19.030 --> 05:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
without it
 
05:24:21.750 --> 05:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
the final point i want to make
 
05:24:21.760 --> 05:24:22.628 align:start position:0%
the final point i want to make
is

05:24:22.628 --> 05:24:22.638 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:24:25.110 --> 05:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
that i believe this would violate the
 
05:24:27.110 --> 05:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
recently adopted amendment to our
 
05:24:29.430 --> 05:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
constitution the privacy informational
 
05:24:31.030 --> 05:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
privacy amendment
 
05:24:32.390 --> 05:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
this is
 
05:24:32.400 --> 05:24:33.430 align:start position:0%
this is
article

05:24:33.430 --> 05:24:33.440 align:start position:0%

05:24:33.440 --> 05:24:35.030 align:start position:0%

05:24:35.030 --> 05:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
2b
 
05:24:44.310 --> 05:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:46.948 --> 05:24:46.958 align:start position:0%
an individual's right to live free from
 
05:24:49.430 --> 05:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
governmental intrusion in private or
 
05:24:51.270 --> 05:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
personal information
 
05:24:52.548 --> 05:24:52.558 align:start position:0%
is natural
 
05:24:52.558 --> 05:24:53.670 align:start position:0%
is natural
essential

05:24:53.670 --> 05:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
essential
 
05:24:56.390 --> 05:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:58.310 --> 05:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
if this state wants to get my social
 
05:24:59.830 --> 05:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
security number
 
05:25:02.310 --> 05:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
then this state is going to have to show
 
05:25:05.030 --> 05:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
that the only way they can provide an
 
05:25:07.670 --> 05:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
essential government service
 
05:25:09.670 --> 05:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
is by getting that number there is no
 
05:25:11.430 --> 05:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
alternative and that service is
 
05:25:13.510 --> 05:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
essential those are the two criteria
 
05:25:15.430 --> 05:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
that would allow the state to do that
 
05:25:17.190 --> 05:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't come close to meeting
 
05:25:17.200 --> 05:25:19.030 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't come close to meeting
that

05:25:19.030 --> 05:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:25:19.040 --> 05:25:21.030 align:start position:0%
that
so

05:25:21.030 --> 05:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:25:22.868 --> 05:25:22.878 align:start position:0%
i would hope this committee would as it
 
05:25:25.030 --> 05:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
has in the past respect the personal
 
05:25:27.030 --> 05:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
privacy of individuals
 
05:25:27.040 --> 05:25:27.910 align:start position:0%
privacy of individuals
and

05:25:27.910 --> 05:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:25:30.070 --> 05:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
declare this bill and find this bill in
 
05:25:32.150 --> 05:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate thank you mr
 
05:25:33.590 --> 05:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
chairman i'd be pleased to answer any
 
05:25:35.750 --> 05:25:35.760 align:start position:0%

05:25:46.788 --> 05:25:46.798 align:start position:0%
next up brittany shoot from the

05:25:57.590 --> 05:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:59.030 --> 05:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon brittany shoot bureau

financial responsibility administrator
 
05:26:02.788 --> 05:26:02.798 align:start position:0%
i'm here on behalf of the department of
 
05:26:04.548 --> 05:26:04.558 align:start position:0%
safety to let you know what this bill
 
05:26:06.070 --> 05:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
means to us and
 
05:26:08.390 --> 05:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
how will impact the changes that are
 
05:26:09.990 --> 05:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
proposed here
 
05:26:11.190 --> 05:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
to give you a little backstory as
 
05:26:14.070 --> 05:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
senator gray indicated he was looking at
 
05:26:15.430 --> 05:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
how to
 
05:26:17.030 --> 05:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
amend the section of the law and had
 
05:26:19.350 --> 05:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
said the four digits when it was brought
 
05:26:20.788 --> 05:26:20.798 align:start position:0%
to our attention we're like if we're
 
05:26:22.868 --> 05:26:22.878 align:start position:0%
going to go there the five digits would
 
05:26:24.470 --> 05:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
help the department of safety division
 
05:26:27.270 --> 05:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
of motor vehicles better match on driver
 
05:26:29.430 --> 05:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
pointers with the state to stay program
 
05:26:31.670 --> 05:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
so when you move into our state there's
 
05:26:33.990 --> 05:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
criteria that we match against
 
05:26:35.750 --> 05:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
the network to see if that is the
 
05:26:37.910 --> 05:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
correct pointer that we're pulling in
 
05:26:39.430 --> 05:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
for instance you can have plenty of
 
05:26:41.430 --> 05:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
steve smith and you need to make sure
 
05:26:42.868 --> 05:26:42.878 align:start position:0%
that you have the right steve smith when
 
05:26:44.788 --> 05:26:44.798 align:start position:0%
you're moving in
 
05:26:47.350 --> 05:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
currently the way that the law is we are
 
05:26:50.070 --> 05:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
still able to do our job um having the
 
05:26:51.430 --> 05:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
last five would just make it more
 
05:26:53.350 --> 05:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
effective for us to ensure that we're
 
05:26:55.830 --> 05:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
not inadvertently canceling the wrong
 
05:26:57.110 --> 05:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
driver credentials in other
 
05:26:57.120 --> 05:27:00.548 align:start position:0%
driver credentials in other
jurisdictions

05:27:00.548 --> 05:27:00.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:02.230 --> 05:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
this is the amended version that came
 
05:27:04.708 --> 05:27:04.718 align:start position:0%
out from the senate and when we had an
 
05:27:06.390 --> 05:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to read and speak with all
 
05:27:08.470 --> 05:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
of you today there are a couple concerns
 
05:27:11.430 --> 05:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:13.030 --> 05:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
with the
 
05:27:15.430 --> 05:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
lines 10 through
 
05:27:15.440 --> 05:27:16.628 align:start position:0%
lines 10 through
15

05:27:16.628 --> 05:27:16.638 align:start position:0%
15
 
05:27:18.788 --> 05:27:18.798 align:start position:0%
on a renewal you'll be able to opt if
 
05:27:20.788 --> 05:27:20.798 align:start position:0%
you want to retain your social security
 
05:27:22.708 --> 05:27:22.718 align:start position:0%
number have your social security number
 
05:27:25.670 --> 05:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
removed or have your last five retained
 
05:27:27.990 --> 05:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
in the system um despite the leading
 
05:27:30.230 --> 05:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
lines 10 through 12 basically stating
 
05:27:31.350 --> 05:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
that you're going to leave your full
 
05:27:34.948 --> 05:27:34.958 align:start position:0%
social security or your last five
 
05:27:36.708 --> 05:27:36.718 align:start position:0%
currently when you move into the state
 
05:27:38.548 --> 05:27:38.558 align:start position:0%
you provide your social security number
 
05:27:40.708 --> 05:27:40.718 align:start position:0%
and you can have the option to remove it
 
05:27:42.390 --> 05:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
currently when you renew your driver's
 
05:27:43.990 --> 05:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
license you can leave your social
 
05:27:45.670 --> 05:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
security number on file or you can
 
05:27:46.788 --> 05:27:46.798 align:start position:0%
remove it
 
05:27:48.868 --> 05:27:48.878 align:start position:0%
there are certain carve outs currently
 
05:27:50.948 --> 05:27:50.958 align:start position:0%
for commercial drivers and those with
 
05:27:53.030 --> 05:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
real ids that we must retain your social
 
05:27:55.190 --> 05:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
security number but again that is an
 
05:27:55.200 --> 05:27:56.548 align:start position:0%
security number but again that is an
opt-in

05:27:56.548 --> 05:27:56.558 align:start position:0%
opt-in
 
05:27:56.558 --> 05:27:58.788 align:start position:0%
opt-in
situation

05:27:58.788 --> 05:27:58.798 align:start position:0%
situation
 
05:28:01.990 --> 05:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
if this legislation would pass again
 
05:28:05.430 --> 05:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
the three options of everything nothing
 
05:28:07.430 --> 05:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
or the last five despite there not being
 
05:28:09.910 --> 05:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note attached to this there is
 
05:28:11.910 --> 05:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
a fiscal impact to the division to be
 
05:28:13.590 --> 05:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
able to administer this and change our
 
05:28:14.948 --> 05:28:14.958 align:start position:0%
database for us to be able to
 
05:28:20.310 --> 05:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:22.708 --> 05:28:22.718 align:start position:0%
and lastly the effective date
 
05:28:24.788 --> 05:28:24.798 align:start position:0%
on this we would not be able to achieve
 
05:28:27.430 --> 05:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
compliance and we would need to look at
 
05:28:28.788 --> 05:28:28.798 align:start position:0%
when could we actually achieve
 
05:28:30.070 --> 05:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
compliance with this proposed
 
05:28:30.080 --> 05:28:31.350 align:start position:0%
compliance with this proposed
legislation

05:28:31.350 --> 05:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:28:32.868 --> 05:28:32.878 align:start position:0%
with that i'll be happy to take any
 
05:28:32.878 --> 05:28:35.670 align:start position:0%
with that i'll be happy to take any
questions

05:28:35.670 --> 05:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:28:36.948 --> 05:28:36.958 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
05:28:36.958 --> 05:28:38.230 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the

05:28:41.430 --> 05:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:28:41.440 --> 05:28:42.310 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
uh

05:28:42.310 --> 05:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:28:44.628 --> 05:28:44.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
05:28:47.670 --> 05:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
when you say that there will be some
 
05:28:49.750 --> 05:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
involved with the database
 
05:28:51.510 --> 05:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
is that the typical hundred thousand
 
05:28:51.520 --> 05:28:52.628 align:start position:0%
is that the typical hundred thousand
dollars

05:28:52.628 --> 05:28:52.638 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:28:55.190 --> 05:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
that we hear about all the time
 
05:28:56.868 --> 05:28:56.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
05:28:58.390 --> 05:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
if we were to look at this at an eight
 
05:29:00.548 --> 05:29:00.558 align:start position:0%
week cycle that'd be about 320 hours
 
05:29:01.910 --> 05:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
worth of development and we estimate
 
05:29:06.548 --> 05:29:06.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:08.230 --> 05:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
05:29:10.470 --> 05:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
representative tallerski
 
05:29:11.590 --> 05:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
05:29:13.590 --> 05:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
question ms shoot i'm a little confused
 
05:29:15.750 --> 05:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
to that that part you just directed us
 
05:29:19.670 --> 05:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
to 10 to 15. the way i'm reading this is
 
05:29:21.750 --> 05:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
if this goes into law you will have your
 
05:29:23.430 --> 05:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
choice of either providing the full
 
05:29:25.430 --> 05:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
number or the last five
 
05:29:28.948 --> 05:29:28.958 align:start position:0%
correct but then the next line says
 
05:29:32.230 --> 05:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
you can still check the box
 
05:29:32.240 --> 05:29:33.030 align:start position:0%
you can still check the box
to

05:29:33.030 --> 05:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:29:35.270 --> 05:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
that just directly conflicts exactly
 
05:29:36.390 --> 05:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
that was the point i was trying to make
 
05:29:37.910 --> 05:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
up okay i was not clear on that i wanted
 
05:29:39.590 --> 05:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure that i was understanding it
 
05:29:41.510 --> 05:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
because that's why i read it okay
 
05:29:43.350 --> 05:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
so quick follow-up just to clarify
 
05:29:43.360 --> 05:29:44.708 align:start position:0%
so quick follow-up just to clarify
something

05:29:44.708 --> 05:29:44.718 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:29:45.830 --> 05:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:29:45.840 --> 05:29:46.788 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

05:29:46.788 --> 05:29:46.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:29:50.310 --> 05:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
um i think the intent of the sponsor
 
05:29:53.110 --> 05:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
was requiring the full number or the
 
05:29:53.120 --> 05:29:54.548 align:start position:0%
was requiring the full number or the
five

05:29:54.548 --> 05:29:54.558 align:start position:0%
five
 
05:29:57.190 --> 05:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
and there's not an option
 
05:29:59.590 --> 05:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
for no thank you i'd rather not
 
05:30:01.910 --> 05:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
i do believe that was his initial intent
 
05:30:01.920 --> 05:30:03.750 align:start position:0%
i do believe that was his initial intent
thanks

05:30:03.750 --> 05:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
05:30:04.948 --> 05:30:04.958 align:start position:0%

05:30:06.310 --> 05:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative hill
 
05:30:07.830 --> 05:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
05:30:10.470 --> 05:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
05:30:12.390 --> 05:30:12.400 align:start position:0%
you're not comfortable with the 60 days
 
05:30:15.430 --> 05:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
after passage is there an estimate of
 
05:30:17.430 --> 05:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
how long after passage you would be able
 
05:30:17.440 --> 05:30:18.708 align:start position:0%
how long after passage you would be able
to

05:30:18.708 --> 05:30:18.718 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:30:20.150 --> 05:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question i believe we
 
05:30:22.548 --> 05:30:22.558 align:start position:0%
originally opposed january our proposed
 
05:30:24.788 --> 05:30:24.798 align:start position:0%
to senator gray january the following
 
05:30:24.798 --> 05:30:26.548 align:start position:0%
to senator gray january the following
year

05:30:26.548 --> 05:30:26.558 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:30:30.150 --> 05:30:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:32.868 --> 05:30:32.878 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
05:30:35.030 --> 05:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
 
05:30:37.910 --> 05:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
you said that um
 
05:30:41.830 --> 05:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
this would make it easier for you
 
05:30:43.910 --> 05:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
in identifying people from other states
 
05:30:46.390 --> 05:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
is that correct when they apply for new
 
05:30:48.708 --> 05:30:48.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire license yes thank you for your
 
05:30:50.708 --> 05:30:50.718 align:start position:0%
question when individuals move in from
 
05:30:53.190 --> 05:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
our state if they're participating state
 
05:30:55.270 --> 05:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
to state which most of the jurisdictions
 
05:30:56.390 --> 05:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
are moving there in new hampshire i
 
05:30:59.510 --> 05:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
believe 36 state to join it
 
05:31:01.350 --> 05:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
when the information pops up it gives
 
05:31:03.270 --> 05:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
you name date of birth and social
 
05:31:04.548 --> 05:31:04.558 align:start position:0%
security number and it helps you make a
 
05:31:06.830 --> 05:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
better more secure match for that driver
 
05:31:06.840 --> 05:31:08.548 align:start position:0%
better more secure match for that driver
pointer

05:31:08.548 --> 05:31:08.558 align:start position:0%
pointer
 
05:31:12.868 --> 05:31:12.878 align:start position:0%
follow up if i may follow up the um
 
05:31:16.548 --> 05:31:16.558 align:start position:0%
so these 35 or six other states require
 
05:31:19.030 --> 05:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
the full
 
05:31:20.708 --> 05:31:20.718 align:start position:0%
social security number
 
05:31:21.990 --> 05:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your follow-up
 
05:31:23.670 --> 05:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions have different um
 
05:31:25.030 --> 05:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
requirements if they have the full
 
05:31:26.470 --> 05:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
number then they post the full number
 
05:31:27.990 --> 05:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
and again if they don't have the full
 
05:31:30.310 --> 05:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
number then they post the last five
 
05:31:32.150 --> 05:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
the last five are the american
 
05:31:33.350 --> 05:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
association of motor vehicle
 
05:31:34.830 --> 05:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
administrators best
 
05:31:40.070 --> 05:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:41.830 --> 05:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
representative tillerson thank you just
 
05:31:42.788 --> 05:31:42.798 align:start position:0%
a quick one
 
05:31:42.798 --> 05:31:44.150 align:start position:0%
a quick one
um

05:31:44.150 --> 05:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:45.990 --> 05:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
in the section at the end of page one
 
05:31:47.990 --> 05:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
where it adds the secretary of state
 
05:31:49.670 --> 05:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
it's already i just want to clarify it's
 
05:31:50.948 --> 05:31:50.958 align:start position:0%
already in law
 
05:31:52.948 --> 05:31:52.958 align:start position:0%
that you can share
 
05:31:55.670 --> 05:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
the information with law enforcement
 
05:31:55.680 --> 05:31:56.708 align:start position:0%
the information with law enforcement
or

05:31:56.708 --> 05:31:56.718 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:31:57.830 --> 05:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
05:31:59.990 --> 05:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
services only in regards to child
 
05:32:02.070 --> 05:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
support enforcement and i just want to
 
05:32:04.470 --> 05:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
clarify that it's only if you have the
 
05:32:06.948 --> 05:32:06.958 align:start position:0%
social security numbers already in your
 
05:32:09.510 --> 05:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
records correct correct we can only
 
05:32:12.070 --> 05:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
share what we have available so if a
 
05:32:13.590 --> 05:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
person initially provided and they opt
 
05:32:15.110 --> 05:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
to remove it we can no longer use that
 
05:32:16.708 --> 05:32:16.718 align:start position:0%
information and one other quick
 
05:32:19.030 --> 05:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up can i ask when
 
05:32:21.110 --> 05:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
i don't recall when i first moved here
 
05:32:23.430 --> 05:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
and got my license providing my social
 
05:32:26.070 --> 05:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
security number when did that
 
05:32:27.750 --> 05:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
part of it go in i know that with the
 
05:32:28.868 --> 05:32:28.878 align:start position:0%
real id
 
05:32:30.948 --> 05:32:30.958 align:start position:0%
i believe that is required but when did
 
05:32:32.628 --> 05:32:32.638 align:start position:0%
you start collecting social security
 
05:32:32.638 --> 05:32:33.590 align:start position:0%
you start collecting social security
numbers

05:32:33.590 --> 05:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
05:32:33.600 --> 05:32:35.670 align:start position:0%
numbers
or

05:32:35.670 --> 05:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:32:37.350 --> 05:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
i believe we've been collecting social
 
05:32:38.470 --> 05:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
security numbers i don't know the exact
 
05:32:39.750 --> 05:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
date but i'll be definitely happy to
 
05:32:41.110 --> 05:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
take that as an action item get back to
 
05:32:46.310 --> 05:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:48.230 --> 05:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan
 
05:32:48.240 --> 05:32:50.868 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan
um

05:32:50.868 --> 05:32:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:53.750 --> 05:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
what's the uh what's the penalty for
 
05:32:56.548 --> 05:32:56.558 align:start position:0%
not getting a driver's license and uh
 
05:32:58.830 --> 05:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
when is is it required if you're not
 
05:33:02.310 --> 05:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
actually driving in the state or
 
05:33:03.750 --> 05:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
i know there's we hear a lot about the
 
05:33:05.990 --> 05:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
60-day requirement but what's
 
05:33:07.670 --> 05:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
what's the penalty if for some reason do
 
05:33:09.670 --> 05:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
you take 61 or more days before you get
 
05:33:11.670 --> 05:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
around to applying for your new driver's
 
05:33:13.990 --> 05:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
license after moving here i think that's
 
05:33:16.390 --> 05:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
a great question i believe there is a
 
05:33:19.030 --> 05:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
statute where the first offense is 62
 
05:33:22.470 --> 05:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
and the second offense is 124 dollars
 
05:33:24.230 --> 05:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
is that that's for
 
05:33:25.990 --> 05:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up and that's for driving with
 
05:33:26.000 --> 05:33:27.110 align:start position:0%
follow-up and that's for driving with
the

05:33:27.110 --> 05:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:33:29.270 --> 05:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
license that's outdated
 
05:33:31.350 --> 05:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
that would be for failing to exchange or
 
05:33:33.270 --> 05:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
residency um so if you've been here for
 
05:33:35.910 --> 05:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
those 60 days and you have not become a
 
05:33:38.070 --> 05:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
resident as a driver as the statute
 
05:33:38.080 --> 05:33:39.110 align:start position:0%
resident as a driver as the statute
defines

05:33:39.110 --> 05:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
defines
 
05:33:42.868 --> 05:33:42.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:45.350 --> 05:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
05:33:47.030 --> 05:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative sykes
 
05:33:47.910 --> 05:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:33:50.390 --> 05:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
um this is slightly
 
05:33:53.110 --> 05:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
off topic and not particular to this
 
05:33:56.948 --> 05:33:56.958 align:start position:0%
bill but anybody else from the committee
 
05:33:59.270 --> 05:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
give me a chance here buddy
 
05:33:59.280 --> 05:34:00.390 align:start position:0%
give me a chance here buddy
um

05:34:00.390 --> 05:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:01.270 --> 05:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
is it
 
05:34:04.390 --> 05:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
is it a fact that if you
 
05:34:06.310 --> 05:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
come in to get your new hampshire
 
05:34:08.948 --> 05:34:08.958 align:start position:0%
driver's license you have to surrender
 
05:34:10.548 --> 05:34:10.558 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
05:35:13.110 --> 05:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
i believe this bill
 
05:35:13.120 --> 05:35:14.948 align:start position:0%
i believe this bill
is

05:35:14.948 --> 05:35:14.958 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:35:17.270 --> 05:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
not good for our privacy
 
05:35:19.430 --> 05:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
and the other reason that i'm
 
05:35:21.590 --> 05:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
not supporting this bill is because it's
 
05:35:23.990 --> 05:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
someone who wasn't born here
 
05:35:25.670 --> 05:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
someone who is
 
05:35:27.670 --> 05:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
a natural citizen
 
05:35:29.590 --> 05:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
when i was
 
05:35:32.390 --> 05:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
registered to vote i was sent home three
 
05:35:32.400 --> 05:35:34.230 align:start position:0%
registered to vote i was sent home three
times

05:35:34.230 --> 05:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
times
 
05:35:35.430 --> 05:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
the first time that i went and
 
05:35:37.350 --> 05:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
registered they told me that my driver's
 
05:35:39.910 --> 05:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
license wasn't good enough
 
05:35:42.310 --> 05:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
the second time
 
05:35:44.230 --> 05:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
i was told that i need my driver's
 
05:35:45.590 --> 05:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
license my
 
05:35:48.390 --> 05:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
citizenship because i wasn't born here i
 
05:35:50.230 --> 05:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
went and brought it
 
05:35:52.390 --> 05:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
they told me that wasn't good enough i
 
05:35:54.470 --> 05:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
went back home
 
05:35:56.470 --> 05:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
when got my u.s citizen
 
05:35:57.910 --> 05:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
my passport
 
05:36:00.788 --> 05:36:00.798 align:start position:0%
so i brought three things just to prove
 
05:36:03.590 --> 05:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
that i was over to and qualify
 
05:36:06.788 --> 05:36:06.798 align:start position:0%
to register to vote so i don't think
 
05:36:09.670 --> 05:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
saving the social security number
 
05:36:11.590 --> 05:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
and the records or in the system is
 
05:36:13.830 --> 05:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
going to help people like myself
 
05:36:16.150 --> 05:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
i don't think they make it any easier or
 
05:36:17.990 --> 05:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's going to make it any harder but i
 
05:36:20.548 --> 05:36:20.558 align:start position:0%
don't think this is going to help
 
05:36:22.628 --> 05:36:22.638 align:start position:0%
people to register and
 
05:36:24.708 --> 05:36:24.718 align:start position:0%
i've been keep hearing the same thing
 
05:36:25.910 --> 05:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
that is like
 
05:36:25.920 --> 05:36:26.788 align:start position:0%
that is like
people

05:36:26.788 --> 05:36:26.798 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:36:26.798 --> 05:36:27.830 align:start position:0%
people
who

05:36:27.830 --> 05:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:36:31.670 --> 05:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
are illegals or people who don't
 
05:36:33.270 --> 05:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
currently have residency in new
 
05:36:34.948 --> 05:36:34.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire being able to just vote
 
05:36:34.958 --> 05:36:35.830 align:start position:0%
hampshire being able to just vote
because

05:36:35.830 --> 05:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:36:37.990 --> 05:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
they signed an affidavit
 
05:36:40.150 --> 05:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
if that was the case
 
05:36:41.830 --> 05:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
i wish that was the case when i
 
05:36:43.430 --> 05:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
registered to vote
 
05:36:45.750 --> 05:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
then they don't make it any easier i'm
 
05:36:48.230 --> 05:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
so glad that i have
 
05:36:50.310 --> 05:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
my mind set up that i want to be able to
 
05:36:51.910 --> 05:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
vote at that point
 
05:36:54.708 --> 05:36:54.718 align:start position:0%
but if someone who's like okay i gotta
 
05:36:57.190 --> 05:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
go back to work or i have i gotta go at
 
05:36:59.990 --> 05:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
taking care of my kids they give up
 
05:37:02.070 --> 05:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
they don't register to vote and that's
 
05:37:04.470 --> 05:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
taking away someone's right to be able
 
05:37:08.230 --> 05:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
to vote so for that reason i will ask
 
05:37:10.830 --> 05:37:10.840 align:start position:0%

we are looked at the amendment uh some
 
06:21:52.230 --> 06:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
of us in the other room saw that it
 
06:21:54.548 --> 06:21:54.558 align:start position:0%
makes the necessary changes that we
 
06:21:58.150 --> 06:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
discussed this morning including to
 
06:22:00.070 --> 06:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
the first lower case a bringing in the
 
06:22:02.070 --> 06:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
electric distribution utilities and it
 
06:22:04.548 --> 06:22:04.558 align:start position:0%
also made the change down in section
 
06:22:04.558 --> 06:22:05.510 align:start position:0%
also made the change down in section
four

06:22:05.510 --> 06:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
four
 
06:22:07.190 --> 06:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
um changing the depart i believe it was
 
06:22:08.628 --> 06:22:08.638 align:start position:0%
the department of energy previously to
 
06:22:10.468 --> 06:22:10.478 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission so i
 
06:22:12.310 --> 06:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
think it took in all the concerns that
 
06:22:15.990 --> 06:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:18.390 --> 06:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
06:22:20.230 --> 06:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
i do agree it just basically addressed
 
06:22:21.510 --> 06:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
all the issues we had with the public
 
06:22:22.948 --> 06:22:22.958 align:start position:0%
hearing this morning
 
06:22:25.430 --> 06:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh so it's nothing else to offer on the
 
06:22:25.440 --> 06:22:26.628 align:start position:0%
uh so it's nothing else to offer on the
amendment

06:22:26.628 --> 06:22:26.638 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:22:26.638 --> 06:22:28.628 align:start position:0%
amendment
um

06:22:28.628 --> 06:22:28.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:30.390 --> 06:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
the question would be to approve
 
06:22:33.350 --> 06:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
amendment 1467 s all those in favor say
 
06:22:33.360 --> 06:22:34.468 align:start position:0%
amendment 1467 s all those in favor say

aye
 
06:22:36.310 --> 06:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
opposed nay
 
06:22:38.150 --> 06:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
that would be unanimous so the amendment
 
06:22:40.150 --> 06:22:40.160 align:start position:0%
is adopted now we're looking at the
 
06:22:43.430 --> 06:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor 417 as out to pass
 
06:22:44.628 --> 06:22:44.638 align:start position:0%
as amended
 
06:22:44.638 --> 06:22:46.390 align:start position:0%
as amended
um

06:22:46.390 --> 06:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:47.750 --> 06:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative smith would you care to
 
06:22:50.788 --> 06:22:50.798 align:start position:0%
speak to the bill sure
 
06:22:50.798 --> 06:22:51.670 align:start position:0%
speak to the bill sure
so

06:22:51.670 --> 06:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:22:53.350 --> 06:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
we've had bills about electric vehicle
 
06:22:56.150 --> 06:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
programs before and the two sides are
 
06:22:57.430 --> 06:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
they're incredibly expensive or they're
 
06:22:59.110 --> 06:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
never going to work in new hampshire or
 
06:23:00.948 --> 06:23:00.958 align:start position:0%
they're actually going to save money
 
06:23:02.788 --> 06:23:02.798 align:start position:0%
committing general fund money to answer
 
06:23:05.030 --> 06:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
that question has been a problem this
 
06:23:06.788 --> 06:23:06.798 align:start position:0%
one though this
 
06:23:10.230 --> 06:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
allows des to allocate volkswagen trust
 
06:23:12.628 --> 06:23:12.638 align:start position:0%
fund money to this which was i mean when
 
06:23:14.070 --> 06:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
you're looking at a budget essentially
 
06:23:15.190 --> 06:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
found money
 
06:23:17.270 --> 06:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
and also to seek federal funds to do
 
06:23:18.628 --> 06:23:18.638 align:start position:0%
this program
 
06:23:20.948 --> 06:23:20.958 align:start position:0%
i say let's just answer the question let
 
06:23:24.230 --> 06:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
some municipality or area try this the
 
06:23:26.070 --> 06:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
requirements of this are that they
 
06:23:28.628 --> 06:23:28.638 align:start position:0%
report on how it went report on the
 
06:23:30.628 --> 06:23:30.638 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the vehicle
 
06:23:32.628 --> 06:23:32.638 align:start position:0%
one of the key selling points
 
06:23:35.110 --> 06:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
we've been told
 
06:23:36.708 --> 06:23:36.718 align:start position:0%
while the vehicles themselves are more
 
06:23:38.788 --> 06:23:38.798 align:start position:0%
expensive out of the gate that the cost
 
06:23:40.468 --> 06:23:40.478 align:start position:0%
of ownership is lower because they're
 
06:23:42.948 --> 06:23:42.958 align:start position:0%
reduced maintenance costs no oil changes
 
06:23:45.430 --> 06:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
no fuel filters none of that
 
06:23:45.440 --> 06:23:46.468 align:start position:0%
no fuel filters none of that
so

06:23:46.468 --> 06:23:46.478 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:23:48.468 --> 06:23:48.478 align:start position:0%
i'm in favor of using some of the money
 
06:23:50.390 --> 06:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
from that trust fund to try this
 
06:23:52.390 --> 06:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
somewhere if anyone's willing they're
 
06:23:54.708 --> 06:23:54.718 align:start position:0%
going to request proposals might or
 
06:23:57.190 --> 06:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
might not happen for me i hope it does
 
06:23:59.750 --> 06:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
and that in a few years we have data on
 
06:24:02.070 --> 06:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not this is useful cheaper
 
06:24:04.628 --> 06:24:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:06.788 --> 06:24:06.798 align:start position:0%
thank you representative anybody else
 
06:24:08.390 --> 06:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
representative sykes
 
06:24:09.910 --> 06:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
yeah the other part of the program that
 
06:24:13.110 --> 06:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
i think would be worth discovering is
 
06:24:15.750 --> 06:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
if in fact these large batteries can
 
06:24:17.830 --> 06:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
send electricity back to the grid and
 
06:24:19.990 --> 06:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
save money that way as well the only way
 
06:24:21.430 --> 06:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to be able to learn that is
 
06:24:23.750 --> 06:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
to try a pilot program so i'm in support
 
06:24:26.468 --> 06:24:26.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:29.510 --> 06:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:31.350 --> 06:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
06:24:33.030 --> 06:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
i'll ask the clerk to call the roll once
 
06:24:35.910 --> 06:24:35.920 align:start position:0%

recommendation about to pass as amended
 
06:25:28.468 --> 06:25:28.478 align:start position:0%
is adopted 15-0 i heard a motion
 
06:25:31.990 --> 06:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
for consent oh ah it's an fn
 
06:25:33.350 --> 06:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
yeah you're right so that'll be regular
 
06:25:35.510 --> 06:25:35.520 align:start position:0%

calendar mr chair yep
uh

06:25:36.708 --> 06:25:36.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:25:38.788 --> 06:25:38.798 align:start position:0%
but it says indeterminable and
 
06:25:40.468 --> 06:25:40.478 align:start position:0%
contingent on future funding
 
06:25:42.548 --> 06:25:42.558 align:start position:0%
considerations so
 
06:25:44.310 --> 06:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
there are cases where you can put an fn
 
06:25:47.670 --> 06:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
on the consent calendar you are right
 
06:25:49.270 --> 06:25:49.280 align:start position:0%

your motion
 
06:27:37.990 --> 06:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair um from listening
 
06:27:40.390 --> 06:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
to testimony this morning
 
06:27:41.910 --> 06:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
the department of transportation is
 
06:27:44.948 --> 06:27:44.958 align:start position:0%
looking for better toll enforcement
 
06:27:46.548 --> 06:27:46.558 align:start position:0%
and they talked about the process that
 
06:27:48.868 --> 06:27:48.878 align:start position:0%
they go through to try to collect tolls
 
06:27:51.030 --> 06:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
and one of the concerning issues we have
 
06:27:52.708 --> 06:27:52.718 align:start position:0%
here is that
 
06:27:54.150 --> 06:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
they mentioned last year there were
 
06:27:56.868 --> 06:27:56.878 align:start position:0%
roughly 33 000 plates
 
06:27:58.868 --> 06:27:58.878 align:start position:0%
that didn't pay tolls in the previous
 
06:28:02.708 --> 06:28:02.718 align:start position:0%
years it was 48 000 to over 50 000 so
 
06:28:04.708 --> 06:28:04.718 align:start position:0%
there's an enormous amount of revenue
 
06:28:06.548 --> 06:28:06.558 align:start position:0%
that we are not collecting
 
06:28:08.230 --> 06:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
as a state
 
06:28:09.990 --> 06:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
even though there's a concern that they
 
06:28:11.960 --> 06:28:11.970 align:start position:0%
had the dmv regarding to
 
06:28:11.970 --> 06:28:13.910 align:start position:0%
had the dmv regarding to
[Music]

06:28:13.910 --> 06:28:13.920 align:start position:0%

06:28:15.350 --> 06:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
kind of tracking
 
06:28:17.350 --> 06:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
families in the same household i think
 
06:28:19.510 --> 06:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
this is a good bill to kind of get the
 
06:28:21.190 --> 06:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
ball started so that's why i recommend
 
06:28:21.200 --> 06:28:23.430 align:start position:0%
ball started so that's why i recommend
otp

06:29:32.708 --> 06:29:32.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:33.510 --> 06:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
all right so our committee
 
06:29:35.270 --> 06:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation about to pass on senate
 
06:29:38.548 --> 06:29:38.558 align:start position:0%
bill 442 is adopted um this one does
 
06:29:41.910 --> 06:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
have a 250 000 expenditure so regular
 
06:29:44.708 --> 06:29:44.718 align:start position:0%
calendar it goes
 
06:29:46.390 --> 06:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
i'm going to close the executive session
 
06:29:50.788 --> 06:29:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:52.150 --> 06:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
just give me one second i want to check
 
06:29:54.150 --> 06:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
on our deadline so i can let you know of
 
06:30:34.948 --> 06:30:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:36.468 --> 06:30:36.478 align:start position:0%
yeah what i'm trying to do is determine
 
06:30:37.910 --> 06:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
06:30:39.670 --> 06:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
i think we can wait a week for the
 
06:30:41.830 --> 06:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
executive sessions on the rest of these
 
06:30:45.030 --> 06:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
bills and not meet next week unless
 
06:30:46.628 --> 06:30:46.638 align:start position:0%
anybody finds
 
06:30:48.948 --> 06:30:48.958 align:start position:0%
what's up well no unless and i'm just
 
06:30:50.230 --> 06:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
looking at the calendar to make sure i
 
06:30:55.590 --> 06:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:10.788 --> 06:31:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:12.548 --> 06:31:12.558 align:start position:0%
the week of the deadline
 
06:31:18.230 --> 06:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:30.468 --> 06:31:30.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:32.390 --> 06:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
well that's okay next tuesday
 
06:31:35.590 --> 06:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
one of us
 
06:31:37.670 --> 06:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
well let me ask you this there's the
 
06:31:39.910 --> 06:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
reason for delaying the executive
 
06:31:41.750 --> 06:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
sessions till the 26th which is the last
 
06:31:44.230 --> 06:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
day for us if we still meet on tuesdays
 
06:31:46.548 --> 06:31:46.558 align:start position:0%
to do it a lot can happen in two weeks
 
06:31:48.868 --> 06:31:48.878 align:start position:0%
and you never know what might need to
 
06:31:51.030 --> 06:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
happen differently
 
06:31:51.040 --> 06:31:51.910 align:start position:0%
happen differently
so

06:31:51.910 --> 06:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:31:51.920 --> 06:31:53.750 align:start position:0%
so
um

06:31:53.750 --> 06:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:31:55.830 --> 06:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
i i would still prefer i'll give your
 
06:31:58.070 --> 06:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
opinion on it if we can still plan on
 
06:32:00.150 --> 06:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
the 26th to exact the rest of these does
 
06:32:03.270 --> 06:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
that sound good
 
06:32:06.070 --> 06:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
it works for me
 
06:32:09.590 --> 06:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:19.160 --> 06:32:19.170 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:19.170 --> 06:32:25.190 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

06:32:25.190 --> 06:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:27.590 --> 06:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
well all right let me um
 
06:32:29.110 --> 06:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
let me ask another question any of the
 
06:32:30.468 --> 06:32:30.478 align:start position:0%
bills that we haven't exact today that
 
06:32:32.628 --> 06:32:32.638 align:start position:0%
we heard today
 
06:32:34.230 --> 06:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
rise to a level if anybody wants to
 
06:32:36.310 --> 06:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
study them more as a group or we're just
 
06:32:38.708 --> 06:32:38.718 align:start position:0%
going to do our own individual research
 
06:32:40.468 --> 06:32:40.478 align:start position:0%
before we do executive in other words
 
06:32:42.948 --> 06:32:42.958 align:start position:0%
work sessions or anything of the nature
 
06:32:46.390 --> 06:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:48.310 --> 06:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
because if we're gonna do that then we
 
06:32:49.830 --> 06:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
might have to put it off for the 26th
 
06:32:51.190 --> 06:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to instead of me just
 
06:32:52.310 --> 06:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
calling the shots here i'm just trying
 
06:32:54.788 --> 06:32:54.798 align:start position:0%
to get some input from everybody on how
 
06:32:56.868 --> 06:32:56.878 align:start position:0%
this works and i still like the idea of
 
06:32:58.628 --> 06:32:58.638 align:start position:0%
delaying our action on the remainder of
 
06:33:00.628 --> 06:33:00.638 align:start position:0%
these bills as long as possible
 
06:33:02.628 --> 06:33:02.638 align:start position:0%
i'm okay with that
 
06:33:02.638 --> 06:33:03.590 align:start position:0%
i'm okay with that
yeah

06:33:03.590 --> 06:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:33:04.788 --> 06:33:04.798 align:start position:0%
you know i
 
06:33:07.430 --> 06:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
i was would have preferred to 19th but i
 
06:33:09.750 --> 06:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
understand you're a rationale it also
 
06:33:11.430 --> 06:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
means though that we don't have to come
 
06:33:13.190 --> 06:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
on the same week as we have session
 
06:33:15.590 --> 06:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
already true and that is
 
06:33:15.600 --> 06:33:17.990 align:start position:0%
already true and that is
that

06:33:17.990 --> 06:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:20.628 --> 06:33:20.638 align:start position:0%
and that's next week
 
06:33:33.190 --> 06:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:35.270 --> 06:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
i don't expect we'll be here long
 
06:33:37.030 --> 06:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
i mean we're going to have schedules
 
06:33:40.230 --> 06:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
eight bills to execute
 
06:33:42.390 --> 06:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be a long day and so if we
 
06:33:44.230 --> 06:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
start you know our normal time in the
 
06:33:45.910 --> 06:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
morning i think we're going to be home
 
06:33:49.190 --> 06:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:51.430 --> 06:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
if or that or i'll take you out if i
 
06:33:56.868 --> 06:33:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:59.190 --> 06:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
vacation week is a really big week for
 
06:34:01.270 --> 06:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
me for work we'll talk later but i don't
 
06:34:02.708 --> 06:34:02.718 align:start position:0%
see a problem
 
06:34:04.390 --> 06:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
i don't see a problem
 
06:34:06.468 --> 06:34:06.478 align:start position:0%
uh so back to my first question anything
 
06:34:08.070 --> 06:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
we want to study further as a group or
 
06:34:10.548 --> 06:34:10.558 align:start position:0%
we're just going to do our own research
 
06:34:12.070 --> 06:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
i don't have any to bring up i just
 
06:34:14.070 --> 06:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
figured i'd throw it out there
 
06:34:15.590 --> 06:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to get some answers back
 
06:34:18.070 --> 06:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
from the hospital
 
06:34:20.150 --> 06:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
association right
 
06:34:22.468 --> 06:34:22.478 align:start position:0%
i hope so we have ideas
 
06:34:24.788 --> 06:34:24.798 align:start position:0%
and we have other questions that people
 
06:34:26.390 --> 06:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
were planning on getting back to us i
 
06:34:28.310 --> 06:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
can't remember the bills off the top of
 
06:34:29.750 --> 06:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
my head so
 
06:34:32.468 --> 06:34:32.478 align:start position:0%
that'll give us more time to yep
 
06:34:34.548 --> 06:34:34.558 align:start position:0%
that's another reason okay we'll we'll
 
06:34:36.468 --> 06:34:36.478 align:start position:0%
we'll seek the information we need
 
06:34:38.948 --> 06:34:38.958 align:start position:0%
outside of meeting as a group so
 
06:34:41.350 --> 06:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
with that thanks everybody um another
 
06:34:44.468 --> 06:34:44.478 align:start position:0%
milestone done yeah and
 
06:34:49.270 --> 06:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:51.430 --> 06:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh yes i thought you were going back and
 
06:34:51.440 --> 06:34:52.868 align:start position:0%
uh yes i thought you were going back and
forth

06:34:52.868 --> 06:34:52.878 align:start position:0%
forth
 
06:34:55.270 --> 06:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
yeah i probably am i'm getting tired too
 
06:34:56.390 --> 06:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm just trying to accommodate
 
06:34:58.788 --> 06:34:58.798 align:start position:0%
everybody i'll put it in the calendar
 
06:35:00.868 --> 06:35:00.878 align:start position:0%
but it'll be the 26th
 
06:35:02.948 --> 06:35:02.958 align:start position:0%
if we've only got eight bills to exec i
 
06:35:04.708 --> 06:35:04.718 align:start position:0%
may not do nine maybe we could do nine
 
06:35:07.510 --> 06:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
for caucus time and ten o'clock perhaps
 
06:35:09.110 --> 06:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
so that actually probably makes more
 
06:35:11.190 --> 06:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
sense i think eight two hours for eight
 
06:35:11.200 --> 06:35:12.628 align:start position:0%
sense i think eight two hours for eight
bills

06:35:12.628 --> 06:35:12.638 align:start position:0%
bills
 
06:35:13.990 --> 06:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
is not a problem
 
06:35:14.000 --> 06:35:15.350 align:start position:0%
is not a problem
yeah

06:35:15.350 --> 06:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
