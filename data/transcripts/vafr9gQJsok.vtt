00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
i'll try this again all right so this is
 
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
on house bill 490 we're discussing i
 
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
passed out an email i asked the biggest
 
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
i think discussion point
 
00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 align:start position:0%
that we want to have is around the
 
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
definition of firearm which was the
 
00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 align:start position:0%
latest ad to the bill
 
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
i sent out
 
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
the definitions as research by house
 
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
community services we have firearms
 
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
defined in three different places in our
 
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.909 align:start position:0%
defined in three different places in our
statutes

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
the current amendment reference does uh
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
reference by incorporation of the
 
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
federal statute and there's some
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
concerns about doing that
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
um so we'll just start with the
 
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
conversation on what what the idea is
 
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
again this i believe this amendment was
 
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
added um specifically to deal with uh
 
00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 align:start position:0%
superior court cases that are now
 
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
tackling where felons who want to hunt
 
00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
with muzzleloaders are basically in
 
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
charge with felons in possession of
 
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
firearms and that was never the intent
 
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
of the definition so i think the new
 
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
definition is an attempt to clarify that
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
and fix that
 
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
interpretation by the judicial branch
 
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure if i got all that right
 
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
but if i didn't then let's talk about it
 
00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.230 align:start position:0%
all right
so

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
again looking at the on the definition
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
of firearm
 
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
let me see if i can get um
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
dan can you go get us copies of the bill
 
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
please of 490. uh so everyone has a copy
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure everyone had a copy i
 
00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
thought they'd be here this morning
 
00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:52.629 align:start position:0%
thought they'd be here this morning
um

00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:54.869 --> 00:07:54.879 align:start position:0%
let me pull up the current amended
 
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
version here
 
00:07:59.189 --> 00:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
mr chair you have you do have a new
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
amendment though to add to this right i
 
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
have i have what the senate passed
 
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
so i believe is what the the bill that
 
00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879 align:start position:0%
dan will print out is the current
 
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
version of the of the bill right but you
 
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
have new language to i don't and that
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
was i wouldn't have a discussion because
 
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
i can recess the committee and draft
 
00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
language i in looking so in my looking
 
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
at this and i'm looking at the history
 
00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
of i think the
 
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
the history changed when we in
 
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
if you look at our say well the new the
 
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
current version by changing spell
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
projectile by action of of an explosive
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
it used to say gunpowder
 
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
and by by action of gunpowder and that
 
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
was meant to keep black powder out of
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
the out of the conversation um
 
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.909 align:start position:0%
the out of the conversation um
however

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the line we changed this
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
definition to say
 
00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:48.870 align:start position:0%
definition to say
um

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
to say explosive and that's where we
 
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
have our issue is this courts of ruling
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
black powder or gunpowder identical
 
00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:57.519 align:start position:0%
creates an explosive accent which fires
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
a projectile and so the word explosive
 
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
is our problem i think um
 
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
and how we correct that to say that we
 
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
can go back to the gunpowder definition
 
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
then explicitly
 
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
my thinking is we go back to the
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
gunpowder definition then and make an
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
explicit statement that black powder is
 
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
not included in the definition of
 
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.949 align:start position:0%
not included in the definition of
firearm

00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959 align:start position:0%
firearm
 
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
and that would be cleaner than
 
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
referencing the federal federal language
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
but i'm open to discussion on that
 
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
i like what you what you said
 
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
so the amendment if we were to do one
 
00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
would say we'd go back if you look at um
 
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
the email i sent out that has a history
 
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
under number one just i'll use this
 
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
definition because it's cleaner
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
you'll see a note under number one and
 
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
it says firearm means any weapon
 
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
including a starter gun which
 
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
will or is designed or maybe readily be
 
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
converted to expel a projector by force
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
of gunpowder so i want to use that
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
definition go back to that definition
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
where we were
 
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
and then add
 
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
the the specific exemption of black
 
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
black powder this firearm shall not
 
00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:02.949 align:start position:0%
black powder this firearm shall not
include

00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:02.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh a weapon starter gun um or weapon a
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
starter gun that is uh powered by black
 
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.550 align:start position:0%
starter gun that is uh powered by black
powder

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
powder
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
senator go ahead
 
00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:21.519 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
my i just want to make sure that our
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
the question is whether
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
i understand and support the exclusion
 
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
of black powder
 
00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.590 align:start position:0%
of black powder
fine

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
but i'm just what i'd like to know if
 
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
your research has revealed this that if
 
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.870 align:start position:0%
your research has revealed this that if
we

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
say gun powder with the exclusion of
 
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
black powder
 
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
are there any other explosives that
 
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.829 align:start position:0%
are there any other explosives that
might

00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:43.839 align:start position:0%
might
 
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
propel a projectile that is not included
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
under the definition of gunpowder
 
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
so your question is there any other
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
weapons that would be
 
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
that would fire a projectile by way of
 
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
black powder no basically no my question
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
is are there is
 
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
does the definition explosive include
 
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
any method of propulsion
 
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
that does not include gun powder or
 
00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
black powder for instance rambo with a
 
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.110 align:start position:0%
black powder for instance rambo with a
thing

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
right so again but that's but that's the
 
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
arrow isn't projected by gunpowder right
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
but that's a you know so it'd be but
 
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
colonel might have an answer for us if
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
he's listening to the conversation he
 
00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:35.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:36.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
all right fine i just you know the the
 
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
miracles of modern chemistry right i
 
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
just you know i i i
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to make sure i wanted to
 
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
make sure we wouldn't
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
we're putting a loophole in here that
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
some other
 
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
form of chemical reaction that can by
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
our projectile would not would now be
 
00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:55.839 align:start position:0%
excluded but if the assurance is that
 
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
there is no such thing although maybe
 
00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
somebody in their garage is somewhere
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
then then it's okay
 
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
i am sure some lawyers somewhere will
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
find a loophole somewhere that they'll
 
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
try to exploit so
 
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
in everything we do we may want to
 
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.110 align:start position:0%
in everything we do we may want to
exclude

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
exclude
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
excesses of alcohol which have been
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
known to cause
 
00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.269 align:start position:0%
known to cause
incidents

00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
i think for most people the difference
 
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
between explosive and gunpowder is not
 
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
understood to be
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
black powder
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
so if we put in that we add it except
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
for black powder
 
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
that would be clear to everyone
 
00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
right it'll be shall not include for
 
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
definition purposes it shall not include
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
projectiles fired by black powder
 
00:12:40.639 --> 00:12:42.310 align:start position:0%
projectiles fired by black powder
correct

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
so if i may
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
so your suggestion seems to be that
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
leave explosive
 
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
but then say
 
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh for the purposes of this chapter the
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
term explosive shall not include black
 
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.790 align:start position:0%
term explosive shall not include black
powder

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
i i think that accomplishes the same
 
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
thing i'm okay with that unless someone
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
could see some other loophole that we
 
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
just created by doing that
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
um so yeah so your definition we want to
 
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
leave the original the current rsa the
 
00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:10.959 align:start position:0%
current definition which says
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
expel a projectile by action of an
 
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
explosive however this chapter shall
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
this uh chapter shall exclude
 
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
um uh weapons and starter pistols
 
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.990 align:start position:0%
um uh weapons and starter pistols
um

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
i think they'd say for the purpose of
 
00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
this chapter the term explosive shall
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
exclude black powder okay
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm sure
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
i'm sure somebody in ols will figure out
 
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
the much more elegant and correct
 
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
phrase it but i guess that's what we're
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
trying to get at
 
00:13:39.509 --> 00:13:39.519 align:start position:0%
is that what you're suggesting
 
00:13:39.519 --> 00:13:43.430 align:start position:0%
is that what you're suggesting
representative

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
more or less what you're suggesting
 
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
yes more or less i you know you could
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
just add by action of
 
00:13:52.949 --> 00:13:52.959 align:start position:0%
an explosive other than black powder and
 
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
that would do it
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
and that's the simplest solution i would
 
00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:05.110 align:start position:0%
and that's the simplest solution i would
think

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
i'll recess and then we'll we got to be
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
back here anyway it'll give me time to
 
00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
run to ols give them the language
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
they'll draft it for us we'll come back
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
and get the exact language and then
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
if everyone's okay with that then i'll
 
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
just and have ols draft it and have it
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
set up for signature is everybody okay
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
with that language we'll say for the
 
00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
purposes of this chapter this definition
 
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
shall not include
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh weapons fired by
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
that would include a muzzleloader and
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
we are um
 
00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.150 align:start position:0%
we are um
done

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
now we gotta wait till 9 30 for the next
 
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
one so go get a cup of coffee biobreak
 
00:33:07.029 --> 00:33:07.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
the only discussion point is around
 
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
who should who should make the decision
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
um in the senate version of the bill
 
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
they have they amended our bill
 
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
we had it going to the commission
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
um for an appeal process and the
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
senate wants to go to the executive
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
director so i'm going to speak to the
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
house mission as an amendment in front
 
00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919 align:start position:0%
of you i cleaned up some of the language
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
and one of the reasons i cleaned it up
 
00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
is because the hearing process
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
the senate left in section one of the
 
00:33:41.669 --> 00:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
bill which changed the duties to include
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
an appeals process but then changed the
 
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
appeals process in section two to
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
say that the executive director was
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
going to do it so section one wasn't
 
00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
needed but it's still in the bill um so
 
00:33:54.389 --> 00:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
i cleaned up the timeline so it's nice
 
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
and clean
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
on the house position the idea is that
 
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
we don't think an appeal process going
 
00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:01.909 align:start position:0%
we don't think an appeal process going
to

00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:34:01.919 --> 00:34:02.789 align:start position:0%
to
um

00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
a person's boss for lack of a better
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
phrase um the exact a single person
 
00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
single bureaucrat um is the appropriate
 
00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
action for a citizen who is in conflict
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
with the department because the the
 
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
executive director is going to take the
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
the position of this department and for
 
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
and support his subordinate and so the
 
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
idea was that this bill would go in
 
00:34:23.109 --> 00:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
front of a commission more than one
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
person and on a majority vote of that
 
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
commission um the appeal could be turned
 
00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:30.079 align:start position:0%
over i did incorporate the amendment
 
00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
that's before you um a lot of the senate
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
language i agreed with
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
the language that said unless the
 
00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
executive director issues a written
 
00:34:37.839 --> 00:34:39.030 align:start position:0%
executive director issues a written
decision

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
that issuing a permit may pose a
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
significant disease
 
00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.430 align:start position:0%
significant disease
genetic

00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
genetic
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
genetic ecological environmental health
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
safety a welfare risk of persons marine
 
00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
animals or wildlife so that was the
 
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
senate language and i took that language
 
00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
and i moved it in so it was good clean
 
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
language and i appreciated the senate
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
for adding it um
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
but again i i looked at this as similar
 
00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.270 align:start position:0%
but again i i looked at this as similar
to

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
i go back to a lot of the hats i wear
 
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
one of the hats i wear is i'm a zoning
 
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
board chair and when they when the
 
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
zoning administrator rules on something
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go to the selectmen or town
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
manager for a decision it goes to the
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
zoning board of adjustment so there's a
 
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
multiple board of five people that
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
review the decision made by the um
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
decider to see if that decision was
 
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
accurate and then that board then votes
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
on either overturning that the decision
 
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
by the zoning administrator or not and
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
if it overturns it overturns it and and
 
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's moved forward if they support it
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
then the decisions support it so again
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
the idea being that a citizen should not
 
00:35:37.839 --> 00:35:38.710 align:start position:0%
the idea being that a citizen should not
be

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
should have um a chance to present its
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
case to a board in in what i consider a
 
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
less biased board
 
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
in the commission so
 
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
um if any other house members want to
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
speak to the house position whether they
 
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
agree disagree
 
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
but again we think it should be more
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
than one person that makes the decision
 
00:35:59.349 --> 00:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
the the agency has the absolute right to
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
deny a permit based on scientific
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
grounds present those scientific grounds
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
in writing to the uh applicant so he
 
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
knows why he's being denied and whether
 
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
or not he thinks he has a basis for an
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
appeal to the commissioners so that is
 
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh the basis of this email again
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
this thing is we had a citizen who has
 
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
told no
 
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
and then that was the end of it he had
 
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
no place to go and that's why this bill
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
came forward so with that logic in place
 
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
representative should we do that with
 
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
all the departments as well
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
where appropriate i'm completely fine
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
with that if there's a commission again
 
00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
not all departments yeah i don't believe
 
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
the department of agriculture has a
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
commission or a board that could appeal
 
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
its decisions or anything else those
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
decisions go to um superior court i'm
 
00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
not assuming i actually don't know
 
00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:44.470 align:start position:0%
not assuming i actually don't know
but

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
in the case where there's a commission a
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
board that you can appeal again we
 
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
talked about the idea that
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
every time we have a new law that comes
 
00:36:51.839 --> 00:36:52.950 align:start position:0%
every time we have a new law that comes
forward

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh in the fish and game department the
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
fish and game commission takes a
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
position so on the bills they they come
 
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
in and we hear from what used to be paul
 
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
sanchem and i forgot the other guy's
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
name i apologize the new guy uh woman um
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
but um it used to be that they would
 
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
come in and they would say the the
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
commission believes and the commission
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
thinks and i serve on jalcar and they do
 
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
the same exact thing when they bring in
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
rules they say the commission the
 
00:37:17.589 --> 00:37:17.599 align:start position:0%
executive director created this rule and
 
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
the commission takes the position that
 
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
we approve we they agree with this rule
 
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
so again i think it's not uncommon for
 
00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
them to take positions on on policy um
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
and they should they may review policy
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
so i think that a written decision by
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
the executive director denying a permit
 
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
could be reviewed easily by the
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
commission and if there's a sound basis
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
in fact and and
 
00:37:39.119 --> 00:37:39.910 align:start position:0%
in fact and and
the

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
citizen gets the chance to give his
 
00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
opposing position they can make the call
 
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
um having sat on fish and game for four
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
years and now r d for two years um
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
fish and game is unique in that it has a
 
00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:01.349 align:start position:0%
fish and game is unique in that it has a
commission

00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
overseeing it and in my opinion
 
00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
it is the checks and balances that
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
exists for a director position he's not
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
a commissioner of fishing game it's a
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
director and so the commissioners have
 
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
in the past commented on legislation
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
that has come to the fish and game
 
00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.390 align:start position:0%
that has come to the fish and game
committee

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
so i think it's appropriate that in an
 
00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
instance where
 
00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:23.950 align:start position:0%
instance where
a

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
evaluation of a determination by a
 
00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:29.349 align:start position:0%
evaluation of a determination by a
director

00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
director
 
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
of an appealed process has to have some
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
level where the
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
constituent in new hampshire can take
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
their appeal too
 
00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
he can't be the only
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
decision maker especially when and i
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
agree with the representative of the
 
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
chair when when he may be
 
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
defending his agency or his employee so
 
00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
there has to be a third party that can
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
make a
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
uh fair or balanced uh decision and i
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
think the commission is in place just
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
for that reason and has done that while
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not a fan of how this bill came to
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
us and it the piece of legislation uh
 
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
the issue it was tied around i think
 
00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:11.839 align:start position:0%
when we come to the idea of creating an
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity for our constituents to be
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
able to appeal any issue at an agency to
 
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
a director position and i do would agree
 
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
with you that commissioners probably
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
have more control
 
00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:24.079 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
that they would not have checks and
 
00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.190 align:start position:0%
that they would not have checks and
balances

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
balances
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
that's within their ruling you know
 
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
commissioners of dot or commissioners of
 
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
um you know other agencies so i think
 
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
within a director position that has a
 
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
commission overseeing it this would be
 
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
an appropriate measure in my opinion
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair um when
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
when i was hearing the bill apparently
 
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
there wasn't any type of uh you know
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
cogent type of appeal process as as is
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct right so this is
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
the senate the senate position is a step
 
00:39:55.109 --> 00:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
forward is it not
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.430 align:start position:0%
it is
um

00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
i really appreciate you
 
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
saying that um is it perfect
 
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
chances are not i was actually very
 
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
frustrated in the community because i i
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
really wasn't able to listen to a whole
 
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
host of testimonies so something people
 
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
came in with charts but were getting
 
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
rushed out and we were bottlenecked but
 
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
we did come up with a
 
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
at least
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
a start
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
and that that is the the senate's
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
position at this point
 
00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.349 align:start position:0%
position at this point
which

00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
apparently there was that was one of the
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh the resting points when i left the
 
00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
room that we got to fix this this this
 
00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
appeals process and i think that's one
 
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
of the things that we were successful at
 
00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:33.829 align:start position:0%
of the things that we were successful at
doing

00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
uh and then we we just kind of gave it a
 
00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:37.829 align:start position:0%
uh and then we we just kind of gave it a
tweak

00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:37.839 align:start position:0%
tweak
 
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
we're hoping that you would see it our
 
00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
way and then come back another year and
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
then help us to uh to
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
go further with the process if if
 
00:40:45.839 --> 00:40:46.950 align:start position:0%
go further with the process if if
necessary

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
so senator if i can ask can you tell me
 
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
what what is that
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna use the word hang up on using
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
the commissioners again it's not an
 
00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
uncommon place for them to
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
take positions to make decisions based
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
on what the executive director brings to
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
them um and again i think that by having
 
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
it more than one person we do our
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
citizens the greatest good um by having
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
it's not just you got to convince one
 
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:12.079 align:start position:0%
person you got to convince a majority of
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
the board of the of the commission that
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
your position is right and the
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner's position is wrong that's
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
a pretty high hurdle for a person to
 
00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.309 align:start position:0%
a pretty high hurdle for a person to
overcome

00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
overcome
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
and it gives them
 
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
the uh the you know again they don't
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
feel like they're they're
 
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
swimming against the tide so to speak
 
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.079 align:start position:0%
well i'm looking at like a bird in the
 
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
hand syndrome right now so we have we
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
have something that that can uh be a a
 
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
fix but i know that uh i haven't spoken
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
with my colleague uh senator waters uh
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
and i don't put words in his mouth but
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i think he has
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
concerned with and i'll let him speak to
 
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
it but it's just that fish and game is
 
00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:49.910 align:start position:0%
it but it's just that fish and game is
unique

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
unique
 
00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:50.790 align:start position:0%
unique
and

00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
we you know there tends to be a
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
politicization of issues and we don't
 
00:41:59.589 --> 00:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
want that to creep into this
 
00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:01.839 align:start position:0%
unique uh
 
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
department that and it is a unique
 
00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
department it's self-funded blah blah
 
00:42:05.359 --> 00:42:06.470 align:start position:0%
department it's self-funded blah blah
blah

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
blah
 
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
so we were just looking at uh having a
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
bird in the hand and maybe coming back
 
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
and and saying hey you know if if this
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
isn't working we can definitely readjust
 
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
it i'd like that opportunity but i'd
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
like to see at least something move
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
forward and i really think that the
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
so senator waters yeah i don't need that
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
much i mean i think it's pretty clear
 
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
what the senate position is and it'd be
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
you know we found a way to move forward
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
but if the house doesn't want to move
 
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
forward then the bill can die um but i
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
would say that in terms of your question
 
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
you know i was i spent my four years in
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
the house on fish and game
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
and those who may not have been here
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
remember back then that there were very
 
00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
different circumstances at that point
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh related to around the commission
 
00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
there was an audit and things have not
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
always been
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
the way maybe they should be
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
but the real point here is that
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
this ought to be a scientific based
 
00:43:03.359 --> 00:43:04.630 align:start position:0%
this ought to be a scientific based
decision

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
and that is what the chief of wildlife
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
bureau and what the director are
 
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
primarily beholden to
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
we are in very
 
00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
you know difficult circumstances about
 
00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
these vector disease vectors
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
um it's not just coveted in the deer
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
it's not just cwd
 
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's not just the avian flu we know
 
00:43:26.309 --> 00:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
about those but one of the reasons that
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
it was not just colonel jordan and dan
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
bergeron who testified against the bill
 
00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:31.990 align:start position:0%
bergeron who testified against the bill
and

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
thought that it ought to remain in the
 
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
hands of the director not the commission
 
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
because of the scientific issues but
 
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
notice we had eric anderson there i do a
 
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
lot of work with fisheries on the
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
atlantic states marine fisheries
 
00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.230 align:start position:0%
atlantic states marine fisheries
commission

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
appointee from the legisl from the
 
00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.390 align:start position:0%
appointee from the legisl from the
legislature

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:48.550 align:start position:0%
and the
the

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
what an invasive species can do
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
in the marine environment or in the
 
00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
aquatic environment on land are is just
 
00:44:00.069 --> 00:44:00.079 align:start position:0%
devastating you know we we're seeing it
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
happening right now
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
uh in our coastal waters and so this is
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
this is something and once it's once it
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
gets out it's too late right so
 
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
um i think i think we made a good step
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
forward with this i i agree there ought
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
to be an appeals process i think that's
 
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
kind of universal to our function of of
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
open and transparent uh government um
 
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
but i think we do need to trust the
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
director here and the scientific staff
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
on it so i i think we've as the chairman
 
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
said we made good progress i think we
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
can pass this bill as the senate
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
um dealt with it and if it proves to be
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
does not work
 
00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:37.910 align:start position:0%
does not work
um

00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
then we'll be back at it but i think
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
this this this will work
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i i do notice
 
00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
colonel jordan is here
 
00:44:49.829 --> 00:44:49.839 align:start position:0%
and i know that the the house had led
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
other people to speak on you know in
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
committee of conferences that i was
 
00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
wondering if we could ask his opinion
 
00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
sure right after set of the guidance of
 
00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:00.870 align:start position:0%
sure right after set of the guidance of
course

00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if we have to have an
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
either or paradigm or could you say
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
something like the director in
 
00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
consultation with
 
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
the director would retain the authority
 
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
but we bring the commission in as well i
 
00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:19.349 align:start position:0%
but we bring the commission in as well i
i

00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
i have to respect the fact that the
 
00:45:23.109 --> 00:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
commissions change
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
commissioners change the knowledge level
 
00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
their changes when you have an
 
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
established base of knowledge within an
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
agency and dealing with the disease
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
vectors that we're talking about the
 
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
invasive species covet you pick whatever
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's unreasonable to have
 
00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
working with
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
the director
 
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure we have to have an either
 
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.030 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure we have to have an either
or

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
look we felt this was consistent to have
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
this go to the director as well the
 
00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
problem we get into with the commission
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
is they meet one they're part-time they
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%
meet once a month well we're worried
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
about that time frame issue if i can't
 
00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
get them all together
 
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
and the other the other issue that i
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
have right now i have an awesome
 
00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:32.870 align:start position:0%
have right now i have an awesome
commission

00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
i don't always have that quite honestly
 
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
and so i'm concerned about future
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
commissioners i think the director is
 
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
where we do our license appeals to the
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
director the search and rescue
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh billing goes through the appeal
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
process goes through the director a
 
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
citizen can appeal there free of charge
 
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
they don't have to hire anybody
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
and then you know beyond the the
 
00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:53.839 align:start position:0%
director if they're not happy with that
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
and they want to challenge that in court
 
00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
then they do that with with all these
 
00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
other things and i think following that
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
same time
 
00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
that same um
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
setup would be appropriate here uh it's
 
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
going to help us meet those timelines
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
that have been placed in the bill the
 
00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
the limit of days where we're not going
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
to have to worry about a commission
 
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
meeting so i think the director is very
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
capable of making that decision he makes
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
all the others so this would be just one
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:21.119 --> 00:47:22.829 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:22.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman my question to
 
00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:32.559 align:start position:0%
senator who uh
 
00:47:34.549 --> 00:47:34.559 align:start position:0%
proposed that the director will be
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
involved also with the commission
 
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
um my question is
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
the director is going to be a voting
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
member or not not you know i'm trying to
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
understand i think he's the final
 
00:47:45.359 --> 00:47:47.910 align:start position:0%
understand i think he's the final
decision

00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
representative i believe he makes the
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
final or he or she makes the final
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
decision as to the uh
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
how the appeal will go
 
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
follow up mr seven what
 
00:47:58.880 --> 00:47:59.829 align:start position:0%
follow up mr seven what
so

00:47:59.829 --> 00:47:59.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
if he's the final decision so that means
 
00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:03.990 align:start position:0%
if he's the final decision so that means
that

00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
the commission doesn't have any function
 
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
but so whatever we are trying to
 
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
accomplish you know the
 
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
transparency some place to go and
 
00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:19.349 align:start position:0%
transparency some place to go and
citizen's

00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
citizen's
 
00:48:19.359 --> 00:48:20.230 align:start position:0%
citizen's
right

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
it's not working if he's the only final
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
decision so
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
right and i i do appreciate the comment
 
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
and i think one of the things that i i'm
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
just gleaning and uh from from colonel
 
00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:31.839 align:start position:0%
jordan's testimony is the fact that
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
sometimes you have good commissions
 
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes you don't have good working
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
commissions also
 
00:48:38.069 --> 00:48:38.079 align:start position:0%
uh there is a you know do we have a
 
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
quorum do we have an emergency is there
 
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh if you're gonna meet quarterly or how
 
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know how how you meet but if
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
timing has something to do with it as
 
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
well and so
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
i would love to to get something passed
 
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
i would love to get the an appeals
 
00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
process started
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
and working and then come back and
 
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
address this again in the next term
 
00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:05.430 align:start position:0%
address this again in the next term
and

00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i have a question for
 
00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:11.910 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i have a question for
colonel

00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
how often do you have appeals to
 
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
decisions by the director or yourself
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
so on license appeals
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:49:22.319 --> 00:49:23.829 align:start position:0%
we have
probably

00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
probably 20 a year on license appeals i
 
00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:27.750 align:start position:0%
probably 20 a year on license appeals i
don't

00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
search and rescue appeals we have very
 
00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
few less than five in a year
 
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
and with importation issues i'm i'm
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
going to tell you that we have very few
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
disputes there's only
 
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
a couple of times that this becomes an
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
issue um and and i think it is important
 
00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
to have a way for people to appeal a
 
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.109 align:start position:0%
to have a way for people to appeal a
decision

00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
um but it but it's not something that's
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
going to happen a lot
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
uh one other thing that senator guida
 
00:49:55.829 --> 00:49:55.839 align:start position:0%
said if i may uh he he made a reference
 
00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
to the director making the decision
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
after consulting with the commission
 
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
i think that piece of it would allow him
 
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
some freedom if we get into an issue of
 
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
a quorum as opposed to the way it's
 
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
written now where it's required as a
 
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
majority vote
 
00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
so if we if it's possible to have the
 
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
director make the decision with after
 
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
consulting with the commission i think
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
that would that might free up our
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
meeting my concern is that meeting
 
00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
framework getting a commission together
 
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
um every time that we have one of these
 
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
and being able to stay within that time
 
00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.470 align:start position:0%
and being able to stay within that time
frame

00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
frame
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
reason i'm bringing the point up is this
 
00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
there's a truism
 
00:50:36.549 --> 00:50:36.559 align:start position:0%
delay is the deadliest form of denial
 
00:50:36.559 --> 00:50:37.270 align:start position:0%
delay is the deadliest form of denial
and

00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of the people that are importing
 
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
things and so forth
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
are quite frankly in business
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
and delay could
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
you know could be denial if it's drawn
 
00:50:47.599 --> 00:50:48.790 align:start position:0%
you know could be denial if it's drawn
out

00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:49.589 align:start position:0%
out
and

00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
and one of the common complaints among
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
my constituents is how long how long it
 
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.270 align:start position:0%
my constituents is how long how long it
takes

00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
takes
 
00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:56.150 align:start position:0%
takes
to

00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
push something past
 
00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.990 align:start position:0%
push something past
a

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
a bureaucratic environment
 
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
that frankly is probably overloaded
 
00:51:07.589 --> 00:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
especially in times of covet
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:13.839 align:start position:0%
and so i wanted to know whether this was
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
an exceptional thing if it was then it
 
00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
would not be a big time constraint on
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
the on the department to deal with
 
00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
and very in as you say there are very
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
few appeals
 
00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
and and that would be our concern with
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
involving the commission is that time
 
00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
issue that's going to add time to it
 
00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
where now we have a system in place
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
where the director hears these appeals
 
00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
on all these other issues and it works
 
00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
pretty well we feel it would work well
 
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
for this as well
 
00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.270 align:start position:0%
for this as well
so

00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:45.109 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that i've been
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
brought up is is that
 
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
contacting the how are these appeals
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
made are they made in person before the
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
department are they written or what
 
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
so we send out a letter with our in all
 
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
these other cases that i'm describing to
 
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
you we send out a form letter explaining
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
uh the decision that's been made and the
 
00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
process to ask for an appeal
 
00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
and we allow people to call in and
 
00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:11.839 align:start position:0%
schedule that appeal or email back and
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
let us know or write a letter back and
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
we set those appeals up uh to be heard
 
00:52:17.349 --> 00:52:17.359 align:start position:0%
by the director following that we have a
 
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
time frame later but it is a it's an
 
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
in-person uh absolutely face-to-face
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
hearing right and they all know at that
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
time whether it's it's agreed to or not
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
or they don't know that instant i don't
 
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
let the director i've i stopped the
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
director for making making the decision
 
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
with the person sitting in a room
 
00:52:35.829 --> 00:52:35.839 align:start position:0%
because i think in some cases that could
 
00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
place him in harm's way
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
so on some of these things so what i say
 
00:52:42.549 --> 00:52:42.559 align:start position:0%
to folks on tape or record them all what
 
00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
i say to them is the director will be
 
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
making a decision within a week to 10
 
00:52:47.589 --> 00:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
days and you'll receive it that decision
 
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
in writing and then we get the decision
 
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
right outside license suspensions i get
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
i get those memos out within two to
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
three days of the hearing so that
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
because i know people are waiting well i
 
00:52:59.109 --> 00:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
noticed in the senate version that you
 
00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
have 60 days to to appeal right
 
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
right right and it seems like there's
 
00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:05.910 align:start position:0%
right right and it seems like there's
like

00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
a long
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
a long period between
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
striking the match and seeing if it
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
catches fire yeah and we i i gotta tell
 
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
you we don't none of i don't i can't
 
00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:17.839 align:start position:0%
remember the last time an importation
 
00:53:20.309 --> 00:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
permit went 60 days we make these we
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
know we make those decisions fairly
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
quickly and would allow for the hearing
 
00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
to happen quickly i just i don't want
 
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
things i don't want the mechanical part
 
00:53:29.349 --> 00:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
as far as who has to hear it stretch out
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
that time or strength that's my concern
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that just does work
 
00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
in favor of the
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
it does the individual making the
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
complaint it does so uh representative
 
00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:44.470 align:start position:0%
complaint it does so uh representative
egan

00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
egan
 
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i think in
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
consensus we all want to make sure that
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
there's an appeals process i do highly
 
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
respect the point of view of senator
 
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
waters about that
 
00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
scientists and experts are making the
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
decisions where i could be more
 
00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
comfortable that the director makes the
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
decision in consultation with the
 
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
commission so at least there is an
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity for
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
the decision-making process to be moved
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
along and another set of eyes on it and
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
i'd be comfortable if that's uh an
 
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
amendment that sort of i think represent
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
uh senator excuse me senator you are a
 
00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
senator i can't call you a
 
00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
representative uh senator geider sort of
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh reflected that would be a good
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
sort of middle ground that i think we'd
 
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
all be comfortable with i would support
 
00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
something like that i can tell you the
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
wording that could do it if you want it
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
if you look um
 
00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
and the there
 
00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
any person is denied a permanent
 
00:54:38.789 --> 00:54:38.799 align:start position:0%
understand paragraph a may appeal the
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
decision in writing to executive
 
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
director within 60 days of the denial
 
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
executive director shall respond
 
00:54:48.069 --> 00:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
after consultation with the
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
commission to the appeal within 60 days
 
00:54:55.829 --> 00:54:55.839 align:start position:0%
why not it's consultation
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
give me one second senator i'm going to
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
try and catch up on that
 
00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
that's line 14 so your line you're
 
00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
you're on section b any person who's
 
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
done on a pyramid under
 
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
sub paragraph a may appeal the decision
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
writing to the executive director within
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
60 days of the now the executive
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
director shall respond to the appeal
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
within 60 days can you tell me where
 
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
that language was the executive director
 
00:55:17.349 --> 00:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
shall respond
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
okay so i just have a couple comments on
 
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:31.839 align:start position:0%
this as long as we're we'll stick with
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
the senate version for right now and
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
look where i have some issues
 
00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:36.150 align:start position:0%
look where i have some issues
um

00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns i have is as they're
 
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
i'm a little concerned and maybe colonel
 
00:55:43.349 --> 00:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
jordan speak to this we specifically say
 
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
in in statute by the senate version that
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
it's the chief of the wildlife division
 
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
shall respond i had changed it to the
 
00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
executive director or as designee in the
 
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
language i used because i think you've
 
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
said colonel jordan before you didn't
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
have this process you didn't have this
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility somebody else in the
 
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
agency had this responsibility i don't
 
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
know if they're going to go back to that
 
00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:05.839 align:start position:0%
we heard in testimony quite clearly
 
00:56:05.839 --> 00:56:06.789 align:start position:0%
we heard in testimony quite clearly
from

00:56:06.789 --> 00:56:06.799 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
from fish and game that anything like
 
00:56:11.589 --> 00:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
this should start with the
 
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
division of wildlife because that is the
 
00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:16.240 align:start position:0%
scientist who's on top of this stuff so
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's why if it's an appeal
 
00:56:20.309 --> 00:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
process it has you have a decision made
 
00:56:20.319 --> 00:56:21.270 align:start position:0%
process it has you have a decision made
by

00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:23.670 align:start position:0%
the um
wildlife

00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
wildlife
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
and then the appeal goes to the director
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
so that's why the senate did it the way
 
00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
it did so if i'm not mistaken colonel
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
jordan that's different than the current
 
00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
process which is you as the chief of law
 
00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement are making this decision and
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
issuing the permit or not issuing the
 
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
permit now we're going to be telling the
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
agencies the chief of wildlife which is
 
00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
a different person in in the agency and
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
and uh we we talked about that at before
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
the hearing in that i didn't feel i was
 
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
the appropriate person to make that
 
00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
because the bi i'd we would feel more
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
comfortable the biologists make that
 
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
decision because it's a biological
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
concern and keep the director out of it
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
at that point and then have the appeal
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
go to the director for the final
 
00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
decision after consultation if we if you
 
00:57:07.589 --> 00:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
go that route with the commission
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
so let me just finish finish my i'm
 
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
finishing this sentence
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
so we have
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
the chief of wildlife division who's
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
going to respond to the request but in
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
the second sentence of that section it
 
00:57:20.789 --> 00:57:20.799 align:start position:0%
says the permit shall be granted within
 
00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
60 days unless the executive director
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
right so now we've moved that somehow
 
00:57:27.829 --> 00:57:27.839 align:start position:0%
division is going to respond to the
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
request but the executive director is
 
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
actually making the decision
 
00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:34.799 align:start position:0%
and so the question is should that
 
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
executive director language go back go
 
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
to the chief of the wildlife division
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise you have the executive
 
00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
director appeal his own decision because
 
00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
it's you've given him the decision in
 
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
that second sentence
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
well i think the problem there is the
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
timing again that you know once the
 
00:57:54.549 --> 00:57:54.559 align:start position:0%
genie's out of the box here
 
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
if he's said yes and the executive
 
00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
director thinks wait a minute this is
 
00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:04.950 align:start position:0%
director thinks wait a minute this is
terrible

00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
terrible
 
00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
decision executive thor the executive
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
director is the boss there not the chief
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
of wildlife so
 
00:58:11.359 --> 00:58:12.230 align:start position:0%
of wildlife so
um

00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:13.589 --> 00:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
you know there needs to be this
 
00:58:13.599 --> 00:58:14.789 align:start position:0%
you know there needs to be this
gatekeeper

00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
gatekeeper
 
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
they're really in the executive director
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
and uh then the appeal that he made an
 
00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:20.150 align:start position:0%
and uh then the appeal that he made an
appeal

00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
with this proposed amendment would bring
 
00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
in the commission so there are some
 
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
other eyes on it but this is not
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
i i'm just trying to emphasize because
 
00:58:30.789 --> 00:58:30.799 align:start position:0%
of the work that we've done the last
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
couple years on the issues about these
 
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
potential diseases that this is this is
 
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
this is a system that requires caution
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
senator i'm not disagreeing with you
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
again i want to protect our our herds
 
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
and our and our flocks and whatever else
 
00:58:47.589 --> 00:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
you call everything else that's around
 
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
the state um in our wildlife i'm just
 
00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
looking at process right i'm just
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
cleaning up process so what in this we
 
00:58:56.309 --> 00:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
have the executive director making the
 
00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
determination and then we have the
 
00:58:59.349 --> 00:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
executive director doing his appeal of
 
00:59:01.030 --> 00:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
his own determination which doesn't seem
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
appropriate to me right again if if if
 
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to use the chief of the
 
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
wildlife division to make shall respond
 
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
to requests
 
00:59:12.789 --> 00:59:12.799 align:start position:0%
then i'm guessing that it the second in
 
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
that second line
 
00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
it should say if the
 
00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
wildlife division determines that
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
issuing the permit the the
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
i'm just
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
you can't have the executive director
 
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
appeal his own decision he's already
 
00:59:26.069 --> 00:59:26.079 align:start position:0%
made his decision that would be kind of
 
00:59:26.079 --> 00:59:27.430 align:start position:0%
made his decision that would be kind of
redundant

00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
redundant
 
00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
so either if we're going to leave that
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
language in there then it has to go to
 
00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799 align:start position:0%
the commission because that's the next
 
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
step up
 
00:59:35.829 --> 00:59:35.839 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to unders again this is a
 
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
process question senator guida i would
 
00:59:40.069 --> 00:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
concur with that i would think that if
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
the wildlife folks are the biologists
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
that are going to do the scientific
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
analysis they issue the opinion or the
 
00:59:46.319 --> 00:59:47.829 align:start position:0%
analysis they issue the opinion or the
denial

00:59:47.829 --> 00:59:47.839 align:start position:0%
denial
 
00:59:47.839 --> 00:59:49.510 align:start position:0%
denial
um

00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
and then that then gets appealed to the
 
00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
director with consultation of the
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
commission that to me makes a sensible
 
00:59:57.990 --> 00:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
process i would agree that you cannot
 
01:00:00.069 --> 01:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
appeal to the very same person that
 
01:00:02.309 --> 01:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
denied the request initially finally
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
senator geider the problem there though
 
01:00:05.829 --> 01:00:05.839 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
let's say that the director
 
01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
the wildlife
 
01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
makes a decision that
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
the executive director thinks is a
 
01:00:15.599 --> 01:00:17.270 align:start position:0%
the executive director thinks is a
mistake

01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
mistake
 
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
then it's too late
 
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
because if if under this it would be
 
01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.069 align:start position:0%
because if if under this it would be
that

01:00:24.069 --> 01:00:24.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:24.789 align:start position:0%
that
if

01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:24.799 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
if you see if the decision goes in favor
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
of the person
 
01:00:31.109 --> 01:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
then there's no appeal right it's just
 
01:00:31.119 --> 01:00:32.549 align:start position:0%
then there's no appeal right it's just
done

01:00:32.549 --> 01:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh under this proposed change and that i
 
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
i'm nervous about that because i think
 
01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:38.630 align:start position:0%
i'm nervous about that because i think
that

01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
um the appeals process you know denial
 
01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
then you have the the process but
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
in this case it's kind of like an
 
01:00:45.119 --> 01:00:46.549 align:start position:0%
in this case it's kind of like an
emergency

01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
where the director says wait a minute
 
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
there's a significant problem here that
 
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
may not have been sufficiently
 
01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.069 align:start position:0%
may not have been sufficiently
considered

01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
considered
 
01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
if i might senator i think that
 
01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
the director himself probably relies on
 
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
the knowledge of his wildlife people i
 
01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:01.839 align:start position:0%
don't know i think the director's
 
01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
position is more of a generalist he may
 
01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
have certain specialties and experience
 
01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
but i think he would rely on his
 
01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
wildlife person
 
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
to make the scientific analysis and he
 
01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
would then upon appeal review that
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
um i i i would say that
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
at some point we're going to have to
 
01:01:20.789 --> 01:01:20.799 align:start position:0%
trust the department's science resources
 
01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
to not make a bad decision and start
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:27.119 --> 01:01:28.150 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
what i'm gathering you through this
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
whole discussion we have potential time
 
01:01:33.349 --> 01:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
delays if we add an extra layer of
 
01:01:33.359 --> 01:01:34.630 align:start position:0%
delays if we add an extra layer of
conversation

01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
to this
 
01:01:37.349 --> 01:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
we do not have an appeals process that's
 
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
working right now the senate
 
01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
is offering
 
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
a start
 
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
and just by the conversation that we're
 
01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
having right now it seems as though it's
 
01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
getting complicated
 
01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
to where we we should re
 
01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
get a bird in the hand
 
01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
come back
 
01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:56.230 align:start position:0%
come back
and

01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
modify in the next session but i think
 
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
this right here gives us a process
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
to to get started
 
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
and then we can come back and we can
 
01:02:07.109 --> 01:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
revisit this and you know with a full
 
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
hearing but i think um
 
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
as the representative said you know
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh time delayed is is
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
you know it's not
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's not working in favor of the people
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
that are wanting the appeals because yes
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
now we have an appeals process it's
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
going to go to the commission it's going
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
to go to this person it's going to come
 
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
back but we need a time
 
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
you know so
 
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
so my humble opinion is we have
 
01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:31.670 align:start position:0%
so my humble opinion is we have
something

01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
let's go with this so senator again i i
 
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
a time delay the timing in your language
 
01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
and the timing in my language going to
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
the commission are exactly identical 60
 
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
days and 60 days so it doesn't create a
 
01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
delay for anybody right so between the
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
two bills there's no difference in time
 
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
um the the process is exactly identical
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
to 60 days for a decision 60 days for an
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
appeal 60 days for an appeal not 60 days
 
01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
for a decision nope they both have 60
 
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
days for a decision in it built into the
 
01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
so i just want to take that discussion
 
01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:06.559 align:start position:0%
off so yeah we're leaving uh so we're
 
01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
missing my only my only concern is you
 
01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
have the executive director based on
 
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
your bill
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
appealing his own decision
 
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
and and i'm not sure how that suits
 
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
anybody so again i i think that
 
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
if we just make that one change the
 
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
chief of wildlife division right unless
 
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
the chief of wildlife division
 
01:03:25.589 --> 01:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
determines it and i would add the word
 
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
in writing uh that issuing a permit may
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
pose a significant risk right and then
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
you appeal that decision to the to the
 
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh if they're denied by the chief of
 
01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
wildlife i'm not i i'll accede to the
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
senate position with some minor changes
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
only because i think procedurally wrong
 
01:03:42.549 --> 01:03:42.559 align:start position:0%
i think procedurally having us appeal
 
01:03:44.309 --> 01:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
the executive director's decision to the
 
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
executive director is like asking me if
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
i'm going to change my own opinion
 
01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:48.870 align:start position:0%
i'm going to change my own opinion
right

01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
you know i've already stated my opinion
 
01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
right and so um i think that
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
just making that simple change of saying
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
unless the chief of the wildlife
 
01:03:59.270 --> 01:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
division determines in writing that
 
01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
issuing a permit may pose that's all i'm
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
asking for is i think that change
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
fixes the problem so that we don't have
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
a a
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
stacked case against a citizen
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
repeat that one more time please so in
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
the second sentence the permit shall be
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
granted within 60 days of the request
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
unless the chief of the wildlife
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
division determines in writing that
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
issuing a permit
 
01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:31.839 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i just don't think we can have
 
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
something that says that if it takes you
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
60 days you get your permit i'm sorry
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
that's already the senate position
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
only thing i'm changing is to make sure
 
01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
we don't have a the citizen doesn't feel
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
the guy who made decisions got to hear
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
because that's how your your bills cur
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
that's how the senate position is
 
01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
currently written and i'm just asking
 
01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
that the chief of the wildlife who you
 
01:04:58.390 --> 01:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
put right in the front shall respond
 
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
right you already have that said that
 
01:05:02.069 --> 01:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
that's the person responsible for making
 
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
the determination
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
i'm just guessing that we stay
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
consistent with that and says unless
 
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
that same person determines that issuing
 
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
a permit is bad
 
01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
i really like to pass something and have
 
01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
an appeal do we have just one minute yes
 
01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
we're back in session thank you mr chair
 
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
i think right now i think we're going to
 
01:07:31.109 --> 01:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
just uh have to uh
 
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
not a seed to the house and just leave
 
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
it as it is we're just going to keep
 
01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
this senate position at this point i
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
really think we should come back another
 
01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:39.589 align:start position:0%
really think we should come back another
session

01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
fix whatever we would do but we got a
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
bird in the hand
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
that's where we're going to leave it at
 
01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
this point and i i love you so you want
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
so we want to leave it so that the
 
01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
executive director is going to appeal
 
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
his own decision we got to start we'll
 
01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:54.839 align:start position:0%
move we'll move forward next
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
time trust me and i and i'll give you
 
01:07:59.670 --> 01:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
but we are including that in
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
consultation with the commission in that
 
01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
no no i'm just just the senate position
 
01:08:06.309 --> 01:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
and i i understand that that that's
 
01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:08.799 align:start position:0%
that's heartburn but uh
 
01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
i i can give you my word that i will uh
 
01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:11.829 align:start position:0%
i i can give you my word that i will uh
read

01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:11.839 align:start position:0%
read
 
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
we'll come back and and uh
 
01:08:15.190 --> 01:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
re uh
 
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
address this
 
01:08:18.789 --> 01:08:18.799 align:start position:0%
my my concerns with the commission it
 
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
adds extra time uh
 
01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
so i i just
 
01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
it's getting squirrely to me and i'm not
 
01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that and making it uh
 
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
making a lot of these decisions on the
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
fly i'd love to revisit this
 
01:08:31.679 --> 01:08:32.470 align:start position:0%
fly i'd love to revisit this
and

01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
like i give you my word that i will give
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
you my best
 
01:08:38.789 --> 01:08:38.799 align:start position:0%
when we come back next session to make
 
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
some changes if necessary
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
house members conversation do you want
 
01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
to accede to the senate position i think
 
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
we're creating a logical fallacy in our
 
01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
discussion where we have the executive
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
director appealing his own decision i
 
01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
think that's just
 
01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
we either trust the science we don't we
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
trust our biologists we don't and now
 
01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
we're saying well we trust our
 
01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
biologists but not really because we
 
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
want the executive director to
 
01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
to actually decide and over possibly
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
overturn the scientists i i don't know
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
how that makes any sense but
 
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
are you do you want the bird in the hand
 
01:09:13.110 --> 01:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
to take this kind of position or do you
 
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
want to want to walk too much talking i
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
want to hear my other two colleagues
 
01:09:15.839 --> 01:09:18.070 align:start position:0%
want to hear my other two colleagues
first

01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:22.470 align:start position:0%
first
representative

01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
my thinking is uh
 
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
the commission is already doing this
 
01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
kind of things you know in all different
 
01:09:28.719 --> 01:09:29.669 align:start position:0%
kind of things you know in all different
ways

01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
ways
 
01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is they represent
 
01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
the you know all different part of our
 
01:09:33.679 --> 01:09:34.630 align:start position:0%
the you know all different part of our
state

01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
so it will be more transparent it will
 
01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
be voice of the people than how it feels
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
but then again i really don't want to
 
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
see that this thing dies here because
 
01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
the number of people came here and all
 
01:09:50.550 --> 01:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
the testimony and all the work and
 
01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
everything the our work the clerical
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
work and all these things just dies just
 
01:09:57.910 --> 01:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
because of that i really like to see
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
that we take another five or ten minutes
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
to think about how we can make a
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
compromise that is my you know
 
01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
you know proposal to all of you
 
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.390 align:start position:0%
you know proposal to all of you
mac

01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:11.270 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
i am where
 
01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
i'm reminded that we in the legislature
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
as juries are
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
in civil and criminal cases
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
the final word not the executive not the
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
governor not the judge and so there must
 
01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
be a role for the commissioners in this
 
01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
i would think
 
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
and so i am
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
in favor of the compromise
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
on the other hand the good senator said
 
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
a bird in the hand
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
is a great place to start and it's hard
 
01:10:53.189 --> 01:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:53.199 --> 01:10:55.910 align:start position:0%
 
i'm

01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
we're a long way
 
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
we're closer to it
 
01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:01.030 align:start position:0%
we're closer to it
uh

01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps the reason for an appeal would
 
01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
be that the original application
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
would be modified by
 
01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
recurring events and so forth
 
01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
so i'm willing to go with the burden
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
hand at this moment
 
01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
and with the experience that comes in
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
the next year with the advice of colonel
 
01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:19.669 align:start position:0%
the next year with the advice of colonel
jordan

01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
jordan
 
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps we can refine this further
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
so we didn't get to our body of law
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
overnight and i don't think we can
 
01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.430 align:start position:0%
overnight and i don't think we can
i

01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
the feeling in the senate is such it's
 
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
either this or nothing
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
so i'm just going to ask colonel jordan
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
once because i i saw him bobbing his
 
01:11:38.229 --> 01:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
head yes that i was right so that's why
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
i'm going to make him come up and say
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
i'm right um so again colonel jordan
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
you know again i'm i'm only i'll see to
 
01:11:47.189 --> 01:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
the senate position with the one minor
 
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
change of the fact that i don't think
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
the commissioner i don't the executive
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
director should be appealing his own
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
decision that just doesn't the citizens
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
not gonna gonna feel that's right
 
01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
they're like wait the same guy that
 
01:11:58.870 --> 01:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
already told me no i've got to ask him
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
to change his mind and that just the
 
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
citizen is kind of left out in the cold
 
01:12:04.709 --> 01:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
in my opinion um in the in this in this
 
01:12:06.630 --> 01:12:06.640 align:start position:0%
process by doing this is it's might as
 
01:12:08.229 --> 01:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
well not have a process because these
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
odds of this of the of the commission
 
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
are changing his mind is pretty or the
 
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
executive director probably pretty about
 
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
zero and so
 
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
um again
 
01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:18.470 align:start position:0%
um again
so

01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
this is all about the citizen and
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
creating a process that makes the
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
citizen feel that they were heard they
 
01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
were that they had avenues to do
 
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
something and so colonel jordan so how
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
do you feel about the idea of changing
 
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
the um that second sentence in this bill
 
01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
that says unless the executive director
 
01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
determines to unless the chief of
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
wildlife division determines which in
 
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
the first sentence is who we say is the
 
01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:45.669 --> 01:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
so i i'm not sure i'm looking at the
 
01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
same version but but the way that we
 
01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
would like to see it work we think
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
basing it on how we're doing it now with
 
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
these other decisions where the chief
 
01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
the appropriate chief makes a decision
 
01:12:59.910 --> 01:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
then if we give them that in writing and
 
01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
and allow them an opportunity for a
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
hearing before the director to appeal
 
01:13:05.189 --> 01:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
that decision
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
we don't involve the commission we don't
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
involve any of that delay
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
and then it's up to the chief to come to
 
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
the like i do for license suspension to
 
01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
go to the director and say i made this
 
01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
decision director based on this this and
 
01:13:20.709 --> 01:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
this i defend my position
 
01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
the person citizen gets to put in their
 
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
ideas and defend their positions very
 
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
much like a trial and then the director
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
has that final say to me
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's the appropriate way to do this
 
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
the same way we're doing all our other
 
01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.270 align:start position:0%
the same way we're doing all our other
processes

01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
processes
 
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
it works very well we haven't had any
 
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
issues with it and i feel if we could
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
get there with this we would have it i
 
01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
do think an appeal is important i'm not
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about the director not being
 
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
involved in that first step because i i
 
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
think that's more appropriate for the
 
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
scientist in this case and then they go
 
01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
and defend that decision with the boss
 
01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
when people appeal that to the director
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
and leave the commission out of it
 
01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:01.830 align:start position:0%
and leave the commission out of it
senator

01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
the chief of the wildlife division shall
 
01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
to request
 
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
for a permit within 60 days of a
 
01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:20.470 align:start position:0%
for a permit within 60 days of a
submission

01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
submission
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
for a final request
 
01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:29.669 align:start position:0%
for a final request
sorry

01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
so then then excuse me then strike the
 
01:14:33.189 --> 01:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
next sentence
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
to strike it the permit shall be granted
 
01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
and then um any person
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
who's denied a permit on this paragraph
 
01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
may may appeal the decision in writing
 
01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
again the language we're looking at in a
 
01:14:58.709 --> 01:14:58.719 align:start position:0%
senate position which is what was passed
 
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
um the only issue
 
01:15:03.189 --> 01:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
that we're calling is the is that unless
 
01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
the executive director that language
 
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
right there those four words and making
 
01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
that being unless the chief of wildlife
 
01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:11.590 align:start position:0%
that being unless the chief of wildlife
division

01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
that otherwise that's not the senate
 
01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
position you've already passed this in a
 
01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
position of that the permits granted
 
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
within 60 days if the agency doesn't
 
01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
respond otherwise there's no recourse
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
what this would do
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
would be to say the chief of the wild
 
01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
delights division shall issue a written
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
response request for permit within 60
 
01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
then there's nothing after that until
 
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
you get down to b
 
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
any person who's denied a permit under
 
01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
sub-aircraft a may appeal the decision
 
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
to write an executive director within 60
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
days of denial
 
01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
your acceptance is a response
 
01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
i would assume as colonel jordan has
 
01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
indicated that the chief of wildlife
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
division is going to take into account
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
significant disease genetic ecological
 
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
environment health safety or welfare
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
risk to persons marine species or
 
01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:06.790 align:start position:0%
risk to persons marine species or
wildlife

01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
wildlife
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
so the
 
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
chief of the wildlife division
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
makes a decision if it's a non-isle
 
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
the citizen can appeal to the executive
 
01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:16.550 align:start position:0%
the citizen can appeal to the executive
director

01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
director
 
01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
that's the process and what happens if
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
they don't make a decision what what
 
01:16:22.229 --> 01:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
happens if they don't make a decision
 
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose of the second
 
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
sentence is the force action
 
01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
make sure this is it doesn't just done
 
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
by delay we do this in a lot of bills
 
01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
we're doing a lot more research i'm
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
the direct executive director shall
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
respond to the appeal within 60 days
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
now if at that point that it's still
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
denied and the person doesn't like it
 
01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
they can go to court
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
so the question again comes back to if
 
01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
the wildlife if the chief of the
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
wildlife division just chooses not to
 
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
act and just sits on it it says right
 
01:16:58.630 --> 01:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
here in the sentence if you'll notice
 
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
the shell
 
01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
issue written
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
written response to request for permit
 
01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
within 60 days of the of a submission of
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
a final request
 
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
you got 60 days and you got 60 days
 
01:17:14.709 --> 01:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
again senator so the question is if i
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
don't if the chief of wildlife does not
 
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
issue a ruling
 
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
just doesn't do anything with the permit
 
01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
the permit submitted even though it says
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
shall they broken the law that may be
 
01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
but the citizens still left hanging out
 
01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:26.790 align:start position:0%
but the citizens still left hanging out
there

01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
and and the point of the 60 day is to
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
force them to issue a ruling and if they
 
01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
don't then the assumption's yes
 
01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i think we've made an
 
01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
awfully good
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:43.350 --> 01:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
house members how do you want to go
 
01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
they're not willing to move off their
 
01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
language in any meaningful way that's
 
01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:51.669 align:start position:0%
language in any meaningful way that's
reasonable

01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:52.950 --> 01:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
that's not a compromise that makes the
 
01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
bill worse fine
 
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
okay that's not a compromise the only
 
01:17:59.350 --> 01:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
question we had was who hears the appeal
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
and who who is makes the decision those
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
are the two questions you're asking in
 
01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
your version of the bill you want the
 
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
decision maker and now we're going back
 
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
on the fact that it's a shall that they
 
01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
have to respond within 60 days
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
otherwise nothing happens to them and
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
that that's not the point the point of
 
01:18:17.189 --> 01:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
the bill was to help the citizens and by
 
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
not putting a timeline in there that
 
01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
makes it so that if they don't act
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
there's there's consequences then we've
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
done nothing for the citizen they can't
 
01:18:29.189 --> 01:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
you will walk away guys could shall be
 
01:18:33.189 --> 01:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
replaced with must
 
01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:34.719 align:start position:0%
well it's the same language so it's
 
01:18:36.390 --> 01:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
shallow must as a saying well shall is
 
01:18:38.550 --> 01:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
optional must is a requirement nope
 
01:18:41.669 --> 01:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
shall is may is optional
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
are you guys willing to walk away from
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
this i don't want to walk away from this
 
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
again i i think i'm just asking for
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
a clean up of the process now we want to
 
01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
okay we're done
 
02:05:12.550 --> 02:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:14.069 --> 02:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
why don't i open the committee of
 
02:05:18.629 --> 02:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
conference then on house bill 1586
 
02:05:20.950 --> 02:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
fn and act relative to the likeness of
 
02:05:23.589 --> 02:05:23.599 align:start position:0%
wentworth cheswell at the state house
 
02:05:23.599 --> 02:05:24.950 align:start position:0%
wentworth cheswell at the state house
um

02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:27.350 --> 02:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
the house position uh we do have a
 
02:05:29.109 --> 02:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
side-by-side would you
 
02:05:30.310 --> 02:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
are you
 
02:05:32.229 --> 02:05:32.239 align:start position:0%
comfortable with
 
02:05:33.990 --> 02:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
the side-by-side
 
02:05:36.470 --> 02:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
do the senators have that jennifer yeah
 
02:05:36.480 --> 02:05:38.069 align:start position:0%
do the senators have that jennifer yeah
okay

02:05:38.069 --> 02:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:05:41.189 --> 02:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
um why don't we start from
 
02:05:43.910 --> 02:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
the point of view of um
 
02:05:46.950 --> 02:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
hearing why the senate decided that uh
 
02:05:49.750 --> 02:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
the unanimous decision of the house was
 
02:05:52.629 --> 02:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:54.390 --> 02:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman we're glad to
 
02:05:58.390 --> 02:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:00.390 --> 02:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
we had considerable discussion about the
 
02:06:03.510 --> 02:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
fact that there is no known image of
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
wentworth cheswell
 
02:06:06.870 --> 02:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:06:08.709 --> 02:06:08.719 align:start position:0%
that would put us in the position that
 
02:06:10.950 --> 02:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill itself
 
02:06:12.629 --> 02:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
could not work because it directed the
 
02:06:14.229 --> 02:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
historical committee to accept the
 
02:06:16.870 --> 02:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
likeness of cheswell whereas if there
 
02:06:18.790 --> 02:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
was no possibility of creating a
 
02:06:20.870 --> 02:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
likeness of him the historical committee
 
02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
could never accept such a portrait
 
02:06:27.030 --> 02:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
we did a lot of consultation
 
02:06:28.830 --> 02:06:28.840 align:start position:0%
with the black heritage trail in new
 
02:06:30.390 --> 02:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire i have to be a member of that
 
02:06:32.390 --> 02:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
board and other groups have done uh
 
02:06:34.950 --> 02:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
research on these areas and there was a
 
02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
real kind of sense that if you
 
02:06:41.109 --> 02:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
presented an image which in a sense was
 
02:06:41.119 --> 02:06:42.550 align:start position:0%
presented an image which in a sense was
fought

02:06:42.550 --> 02:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
fought
 
02:06:44.790 --> 02:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
what can i say constructed or imagined
 
02:06:46.310 --> 02:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
or invented
 
02:06:48.470 --> 02:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
then we in a sense would be presenting
 
02:06:50.390 --> 02:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
something that could be very
 
02:06:51.669 --> 02:06:51.679 align:start position:0%
troubling in what it claimed to
 
02:06:51.679 --> 02:06:52.950 align:start position:0%
troubling in what it claimed to
represent

02:06:52.950 --> 02:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:06:55.270 --> 02:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
um what we know about cheswell is he had
 
02:06:59.270 --> 02:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
his mixed mixed heritage um
 
02:07:02.229 --> 02:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
and we don't know was he white skin did
 
02:07:04.229 --> 02:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
he have straight hair or curly hair what
 
02:07:07.270 --> 02:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
were his features we know none of this
 
02:07:07.280 --> 02:07:09.270 align:start position:0%
were his features we know none of this
and

02:07:09.270 --> 02:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:07:11.510 --> 02:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
for that reason it was feared that
 
02:07:13.750 --> 02:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
whatever portrait was
 
02:07:15.510 --> 02:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
was created would be
 
02:07:18.310 --> 02:07:18.320 align:start position:0%
an invention and we've been
 
02:07:20.149 --> 02:07:20.159 align:start position:0%
you know in many circumstances over many
 
02:07:22.950 --> 02:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
years where people's imagined ideas of
 
02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
african americans have been very
 
02:07:24.480 --> 02:07:26.550 align:start position:0%
african americans have been very
problematic

02:07:26.550 --> 02:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
02:07:28.470 --> 02:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
that you would be creating something
 
02:07:30.470 --> 02:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
that was based on somebody's imagined
 
02:07:32.149 --> 02:07:32.159 align:start position:0%
image of what a black person may or may
 
02:07:35.189 --> 02:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
not have have looked like
 
02:07:37.750 --> 02:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
so that's why we thought that what would
 
02:07:39.669 --> 02:07:39.679 align:start position:0%
be really much more appropriate would be
 
02:07:41.030 --> 02:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
to have a plaque
 
02:07:43.030 --> 02:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
it could be prominently displayed in the
 
02:07:46.069 --> 02:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
hallway where the revolutionary war
 
02:07:47.830 --> 02:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
folks are commemorated right across the
 
02:07:49.350 --> 02:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
visitor's center so we have high
 
02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
visibility and the plaque as you go
 
02:07:53.510 --> 02:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
around the state house it affords an
 
02:07:55.990 --> 02:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity for much more information
 
02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
about uh an individual
 
02:08:00.790 --> 02:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
so that was our position and i i will
 
02:08:02.790 --> 02:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
just say that that's basically what the
 
02:08:05.350 --> 02:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
senate position is and i i don't think
 
02:08:07.270 --> 02:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
we're i i would hope the house could
 
02:08:09.589 --> 02:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
exceed to it because otherwise i fear
 
02:08:15.669 --> 02:08:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:18.069 --> 02:08:18.079 align:start position:0%
thank you senator um
 
02:08:18.079 --> 02:08:19.669 align:start position:0%
thank you senator um
anyone

02:08:19.669 --> 02:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
02:08:23.270 --> 02:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
from the house i'd like to respond
 
02:08:24.950 --> 02:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
yes mr senator
 
02:08:27.589 --> 02:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:08:29.589 --> 02:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry
 
02:08:31.510 --> 02:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
quote all right thank you so much
 
02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:32.629 align:start position:0%
quote all right thank you so much
um

02:08:32.629 --> 02:08:32.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:34.950 --> 02:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
it's true we don't have an actual
 
02:08:39.270 --> 02:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
picture of wentworth tiswell however
 
02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
we have had in the past a portrait of a
 
02:08:45.350 --> 02:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
governor governor kai's pronounced kai's
 
02:08:47.990 --> 02:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
but spelled keys
 
02:08:52.069 --> 02:08:52.079 align:start position:0%
for dozens and dozens of decades hanging
 
02:08:54.069 --> 02:08:54.079 align:start position:0%
on the second floor only to find out
 
02:08:55.830 --> 02:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
that wasn't him at all and people looked
 
02:08:57.990 --> 02:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
at him and read the plaque and believed
 
02:08:59.750 --> 02:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
the plaque and believed that image was
 
02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:01.350 align:start position:0%
the plaque and believed that image was
him

02:09:01.350 --> 02:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
him
 
02:09:04.310 --> 02:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
we also have an image of marilla ricker
 
02:09:05.910 --> 02:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
from dover
 
02:09:08.870 --> 02:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
and i mentioned to the artist that
 
02:09:10.950 --> 02:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
for the photographs we have of her the
 
02:09:13.350 --> 02:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
image looked quite different and she
 
02:09:15.350 --> 02:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
said well marilla ricker looked very
 
02:09:17.430 --> 02:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
severe she thought she'd take artistic
 
02:09:20.709 --> 02:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
license with the portrait and soften it
 
02:09:22.870 --> 02:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't look that much like
 
02:09:25.750 --> 02:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
marilla ricker
 
02:09:27.910 --> 02:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
we also have portraits of people wearing
 
02:09:30.950 --> 02:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
tricorn hats and wearing wigs
 
02:09:32.390 --> 02:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
we don't know exactly
 
02:09:34.069 --> 02:09:34.079 align:start position:0%
what they look like
 
02:09:35.990 --> 02:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
there is a problem here because we don't
 
02:09:37.910 --> 02:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
know exactly what
 
02:09:40.470 --> 02:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
wentworth has well looked like but
 
02:09:42.229 --> 02:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
we could very well do a likeness and
 
02:09:44.470 --> 02:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
then we all have the writings the
 
02:09:46.229 --> 02:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
plaques underneath the portraits that
 
02:09:49.030 --> 02:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
get plenty of details about these people
 
02:09:50.870 --> 02:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
and we could introduce that portrait by
 
02:09:52.870 --> 02:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
saying this is a likeness because we do
 
02:09:55.750 --> 02:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
not have an actual image from which to
 
02:09:55.760 --> 02:09:58.550 align:start position:0%
not have an actual image from which to
work

02:09:58.550 --> 02:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:01.510 --> 02:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
i think with the clothing that we would
 
02:10:02.950 --> 02:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
put on him
 
02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:03.990 align:start position:0%
put on him
and

02:10:03.990 --> 02:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:10:06.229 --> 02:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
uh whatever background we might or might
 
02:10:08.629 --> 02:10:08.639 align:start position:0%
not use could be enough to give a sense
 
02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
of when this man lived we know that he
 
02:10:13.350 --> 02:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
was not 100
 
02:10:15.830 --> 02:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
black we know that he was a mixed race
 
02:10:18.069 --> 02:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
but he was the first person of mixed
 
02:10:21.270 --> 02:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
race to ever be elected to any office in
 
02:10:24.390 --> 02:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
this country and my concern is if we put
 
02:10:26.629 --> 02:10:26.639 align:start position:0%
up simply a plaque
 
02:10:28.709 --> 02:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
that all the people who all the visitors
 
02:10:30.149 --> 02:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
from around the state and around the
 
02:10:32.069 --> 02:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
country around the world who come as
 
02:10:33.589 --> 02:10:33.599 align:start position:0%
well as the fourth graders who come
 
02:10:35.910 --> 02:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
every year won't even look at a plaque
 
02:10:38.069 --> 02:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
people need something to see an image of
 
02:10:39.589 --> 02:10:39.599 align:start position:0%
some sort
 
02:10:41.350 --> 02:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
and i was thinking recently when i was
 
02:10:43.589 --> 02:10:43.599 align:start position:0%
down in portsmouth looking at the
 
02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
amazingly wonderful tribute for the the
 
02:10:50.390 --> 02:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
black heritage grave area
 
02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know who stood for that image of
 
02:10:54.709 --> 02:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
the woman standing there with her hands
 
02:10:56.870 --> 02:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
but i thought we didn't know what each
 
02:10:58.790 --> 02:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
one of these people really looked like
 
02:10:58.800 --> 02:10:59.669 align:start position:0%
one of these people really looked like
either

02:10:59.669 --> 02:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
either
 
02:11:02.310 --> 02:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
and granted we want to know what people
 
02:11:04.470 --> 02:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
really look like but i think there's
 
02:11:06.629 --> 02:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
enough information that we could
 
02:11:09.510 --> 02:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
put up a likeness of him
 
02:11:11.589 --> 02:11:11.599 align:start position:0%
document that it is a likeness because
 
02:11:13.669 --> 02:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
we don't have an actual image going way
 
02:11:18.149 --> 02:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
back to the 1700s and i think it would
 
02:11:21.189 --> 02:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
be important because again people would
 
02:11:23.589 --> 02:11:23.599 align:start position:0%
at least have some concept look at what
 
02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
i saw at the state house
 
02:11:26.870 --> 02:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:29.589 --> 02:11:29.599 align:start position:0%
thank you if i may respond to that
 
02:11:29.599 --> 02:11:31.510 align:start position:0%
thank you if i may respond to that
senator

02:11:31.510 --> 02:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
senator
 
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
i was involved with the
 
02:11:36.830 --> 02:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
african bearing ground
 
02:11:39.189 --> 02:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
process there
 
02:11:42.149 --> 02:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
and um the figures there if you read the
 
02:11:43.830 --> 02:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
read about it was meant to represent
 
02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
mother africa no person one was mother
 
02:11:48.470 --> 02:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
africa and another was meant to
 
02:11:50.950 --> 02:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
represented a person in bondage there
 
02:11:54.069 --> 02:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
was no pretense that these represented
 
02:11:56.950 --> 02:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
any living people they were symbolic
 
02:11:56.960 --> 02:11:57.910 align:start position:0%
any living people they were symbolic
now

02:11:57.910 --> 02:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:12:00.470 --> 02:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
the issue here is you can look up the
 
02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
decision of definition of likeness it's
 
02:12:06.790 --> 02:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
a semblance resemblance or a portrait um
 
02:12:09.109 --> 02:12:09.119 align:start position:0%
and i i just
 
02:12:10.709 --> 02:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
and again i was also involved in harriet
 
02:12:12.709 --> 02:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
wilson project which created the
 
02:12:15.030 --> 02:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
monument for her first uh
 
02:12:16.709 --> 02:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
woman of accurate descent to publish a
 
02:12:21.030 --> 02:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
novel in the history of the world 1859
 
02:12:22.629 --> 02:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
over in milford
 
02:12:24.310 --> 02:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
and there was a very
 
02:12:27.189 --> 02:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
very thorough process of discussing what
 
02:12:28.629 --> 02:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
should be presented there because for
 
02:12:31.030 --> 02:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
her in her autobiographical novel there
 
02:12:34.310 --> 02:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
were extensive descriptions of her there
 
02:12:36.229 --> 02:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
and also there was a drawing of her
 
02:12:38.069 --> 02:12:38.079 align:start position:0%
there was a label of the the hair
 
02:12:39.669 --> 02:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
restorer that she
 
02:12:41.990 --> 02:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
she used um
 
02:12:43.830 --> 02:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
do we really want to get in a situation
 
02:12:46.629 --> 02:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
where we are saying to an artist well
 
02:12:48.709 --> 02:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
and i will this is kind of conversations
 
02:12:50.149 --> 02:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
that went along with the harry wilson
 
02:12:52.709 --> 02:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
one well does does the person look
 
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
african enough or african-american
 
02:12:57.830 --> 02:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
enough or what if the person
 
02:13:00.149 --> 02:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh would you know was so like completely
 
02:13:01.910 --> 02:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
that people look at the portrait and say
 
02:13:04.310 --> 02:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
why you have a portrait of a
 
02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
light complected or what visually would
 
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
tell you one thing about race
 
02:13:10.950 --> 02:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
or if it is another kind of an image
 
02:13:13.750 --> 02:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
that is not him but but features what
 
02:13:15.510 --> 02:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
people might imagine our
 
02:13:17.350 --> 02:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
african-american features whether it's
 
02:13:20.069 --> 02:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
hair physiognomy or skin tone
 
02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
then we have also i think
 
02:13:26.310 --> 02:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
used 20 22 conceptualizations of what
 
02:13:28.149 --> 02:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
racial depiction is
 
02:13:29.910 --> 02:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
and i think that is something that has
 
02:13:33.270 --> 02:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
been extremely problematic in our past
 
02:13:35.350 --> 02:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
about creating these invented images and
 
02:13:37.750 --> 02:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
i don't i also as an educator
 
02:13:40.470 --> 02:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
i don't think that we want to
 
02:13:42.229 --> 02:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
have our school children come in here
 
02:13:45.669 --> 02:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
and present with what would be a false
 
02:13:45.679 --> 02:13:47.350 align:start position:0%
and present with what would be a false
image

02:13:47.350 --> 02:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
image
 
02:13:51.109 --> 02:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
a false image why would we be doing that
 
02:13:53.430 --> 02:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
as a state legislature
 
02:13:55.109 --> 02:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
to present a false image and i don't
 
02:13:56.550 --> 02:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
know what happened with that portrait of
 
02:13:58.310 --> 02:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
the governor that wasn't the port of the
 
02:14:00.229 --> 02:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
governor i think it came down
 
02:14:02.229 --> 02:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
and ricker at least you know artistic
 
02:14:03.589 --> 02:14:03.599 align:start position:0%
licensed somewhat but it was off a
 
02:14:05.350 --> 02:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
photograph look at the photograph and
 
02:14:07.830 --> 02:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
sure you know it's she's a little
 
02:14:10.149 --> 02:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
improved but there was a photograph
 
02:14:12.870 --> 02:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
where alexander twilight who um you know
 
02:14:14.870 --> 02:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
from vermont a
 
02:14:17.270 --> 02:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
state representative up there founded
 
02:14:19.510 --> 02:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
academy which is the building is still
 
02:14:21.350 --> 02:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
there extraordinary individual novels
 
02:14:22.870 --> 02:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
written about him
 
02:14:25.350 --> 02:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
but there's a portrait and uh that i
 
02:14:27.350 --> 02:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
mean there was a photograph
 
02:14:29.189 --> 02:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
and that photograph was what what the
 
02:14:31.270 --> 02:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
artist could use for the one that's
 
02:14:34.629 --> 02:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
that was created so um
 
02:14:37.189 --> 02:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
and i think also to presume we are an
 
02:14:39.030 --> 02:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
age of images but to presume that people
 
02:14:41.350 --> 02:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
cannot receive information other than by
 
02:14:43.589 --> 02:14:43.599 align:start position:0%
having a you know a likeness or an image
 
02:14:47.109 --> 02:14:47.119 align:start position:0%
or a picture i i think
 
02:14:49.589 --> 02:14:49.599 align:start position:0%
really sells short our guides our
 
02:14:52.069 --> 02:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
students are our public who
 
02:14:54.229 --> 02:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
who could appreciate information and and
 
02:14:56.229 --> 02:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
maybe let their own mind
 
02:14:58.069 --> 02:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
kind of imagine what
 
02:14:58.079 --> 02:14:58.870 align:start position:0%
kind of imagine what
um

02:14:58.870 --> 02:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:01.589 --> 02:15:01.599 align:start position:0%
what cheswell's life was like i will say
 
02:15:01.599 --> 02:15:02.310 align:start position:0%
what cheswell's life was like i will say
too

02:15:02.310 --> 02:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
too
 
02:15:04.629 --> 02:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
that we know what we know from wentworth
 
02:15:07.830 --> 02:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
cheswell is that he really valued his
 
02:15:07.840 --> 02:15:09.270 align:start position:0%
cheswell is that he really valued his
handwriting

02:15:09.270 --> 02:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
handwriting
 
02:15:11.910 --> 02:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
that at that time as a person of african
 
02:15:13.589 --> 02:15:13.599 align:start position:0%
descent to be able to sign your
 
02:15:15.669 --> 02:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
signature meant that you were recognized
 
02:15:18.069 --> 02:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
in the eyes of the law
 
02:15:20.950 --> 02:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
this is an extremely important test
 
02:15:23.910 --> 02:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
and he in his work in new market he
 
02:15:25.350 --> 02:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
copied the town record because thought
 
02:15:26.790 --> 02:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
the british might burn them in their own
 
02:15:28.629 --> 02:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
deposit in the university of new
 
02:15:31.109 --> 02:15:31.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire library and he signed a lot of
 
02:15:33.350 --> 02:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
documents you can go online or you can
 
02:15:35.109 --> 02:15:35.119 align:start position:0%
go see the originals and you'll see
 
02:15:36.390 --> 02:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
his signature
 
02:15:38.149 --> 02:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
and so if you want something from his
 
02:15:40.470 --> 02:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
hand on a plaque
 
02:15:42.069 --> 02:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
you know or that is a likeness or
 
02:15:44.149 --> 02:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
resemblance you you know
 
02:15:46.390 --> 02:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
and i i i could reference to you you
 
02:15:48.709 --> 02:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
know the individuals who wrote you know
 
02:15:51.270 --> 02:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
philosophy writing to george washington
 
02:15:53.910 --> 02:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
you know uh or others writing to thomas
 
02:15:56.550 --> 02:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
jefferson and um having that their
 
02:15:58.629 --> 02:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
signature that their hand would be
 
02:16:00.390 --> 02:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
recognized or the petitioners the slave
 
02:16:02.629 --> 02:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
petitioners in portsmouth who wrote
 
02:16:04.149 --> 02:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
their signatures very large you can go
 
02:16:05.830 --> 02:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
up the state of arkansas because it
 
02:16:07.750 --> 02:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
meant that their
 
02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
their signature meant that they were
 
02:16:12.870 --> 02:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
recognized as human beings so we have an
 
02:16:15.270 --> 02:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity there to do something
 
02:16:18.310 --> 02:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
but as i said the senate position is is
 
02:16:20.950 --> 02:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
what is going to be here senator carson
 
02:16:22.310 --> 02:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
confirm this
 
02:16:24.069 --> 02:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
that we hope the house will exceed or
 
02:16:26.790 --> 02:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
else the bill will die
 
02:16:28.629 --> 02:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
i'd like to give the opportunity for the
 
02:16:31.510 --> 02:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor to chime in
 
02:16:34.629 --> 02:16:34.639 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair and members of the
 
02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:46.870 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and members of the

hb 1586 fn a um
 
02:16:58.070 --> 02:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know i think it's really really
 
02:17:00.870 --> 02:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
important that we get this portrait done
 
02:17:03.429 --> 02:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
and displayed in the state house
 
02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
mainly because of wentworth cheswell's
 
02:17:09.030 --> 02:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
accomplishments his duty to the country
 
02:17:11.589 --> 02:17:11.599 align:start position:0%
as a revolutionary war

02:17:15.990 --> 02:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
um and all of the things that
 
02:17:18.070 --> 02:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
he established in
 
02:17:20.230 --> 02:17:20.240 align:start position:0%

library
now

02:17:23.429 --> 02:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:17:26.870 --> 02:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
there's been debate about what did mr
 
02:17:29.429 --> 02:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
cheswell really looked like
 
02:17:35.030 --> 02:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:37.750 --> 02:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
senator waters just mentioned another
 
02:17:37.760 --> 02:17:39.030 align:start position:0%
senator waters just mentioned another
character

02:17:39.030 --> 02:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
character
 
02:17:41.110 --> 02:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
historic character um
 
02:17:44.150 --> 02:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
alexander twilight from vermont whose
 
02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
portrait was unveiled on may 4th in the
 
02:17:48.870 --> 02:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
vermont state house
 
02:17:50.950 --> 02:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
i see a lot of parallels
 
02:17:52.549 --> 02:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
with um
 
02:17:54.629 --> 02:17:54.639 align:start position:0%
wentworth cheswell and
 
02:17:57.509 --> 02:17:57.519 align:start position:0%
alexander twilight and
 
02:18:00.469 --> 02:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
that just makes me more compelled to
 
02:18:00.479 --> 02:18:02.629 align:start position:0%
that just makes me more compelled to
support

02:18:02.629 --> 02:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:18:04.230 --> 02:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:18:06.950 --> 02:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
as we know it passed in the house on a
 
02:18:08.549 --> 02:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
voice vote
 
02:18:08.559 --> 02:18:09.349 align:start position:0%
voice vote
um

02:18:09.349 --> 02:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:09.359 --> 02:18:11.030 align:start position:0%
um
unanimously

02:18:11.030 --> 02:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
unanimously
 
02:18:14.150 --> 02:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
and i think that we need to close the
 
02:18:16.309 --> 02:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
circle on this and get this portrait
 
02:18:16.319 --> 02:18:17.190 align:start position:0%
circle on this and get this portrait
done

02:18:17.190 --> 02:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
done
 
02:18:19.030 --> 02:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
however we do it
 
02:18:22.230 --> 02:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
and as for objections that we're not
 
02:18:24.309 --> 02:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
quite sure what he looked like we don't
 
02:18:26.309 --> 02:18:26.319 align:start position:0%
want his hair to be too curly we don't
 
02:18:28.150 --> 02:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
want his skin to be too light or too
 
02:18:31.509 --> 02:18:31.519 align:start position:0%
dark i think that we do have artists who
 
02:18:34.629 --> 02:18:34.639 align:start position:0%
could project a really good likeness of
 
02:18:38.709 --> 02:18:38.719 align:start position:0%

like

02:18:45.830 --> 02:18:45.840 align:start position:0%

thank you

my understanding is
 
02:19:05.270 --> 02:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
that um

group

02:19:08.629 --> 02:19:08.639 align:start position:0%
group
 
02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
where the portrait
 
02:19:13.349 --> 02:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
was going to access
 
02:19:15.589 --> 02:19:15.599 align:start position:0%
a painter who has
 
02:19:17.509 --> 02:19:17.519 align:start position:0%
experience in
 
02:19:22.150 --> 02:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
this type of issue of um interviewing
 
02:19:24.469 --> 02:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
the descendants um
 
02:19:28.230 --> 02:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
and and building that composite from
 
02:19:31.589 --> 02:19:31.599 align:start position:0%
either not eyewitnesses but from from
 
02:19:33.669 --> 02:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
documented um
 
02:19:34.950 --> 02:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
history of
 
02:19:36.150 --> 02:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
what they
 
02:19:38.230 --> 02:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
what the relatives look like
 
02:19:40.389 --> 02:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
um is that your understanding as well
 
02:19:41.830 --> 02:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:19:44.469 --> 02:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
that is this person has experience with
 
02:19:47.429 --> 02:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
that this this portrait painter
 
02:19:50.790 --> 02:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:53.270 --> 02:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative ruler
 
02:19:55.590 --> 02:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:19:58.309 --> 02:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
i just want to say that
 
02:20:00.150 --> 02:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
one of the most important things that i
 
02:20:02.870 --> 02:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
have seen here at the state house
 
02:20:05.190 --> 02:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
is when the fourth graders come to the
 
02:20:07.270 --> 02:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
state house
 
02:20:07.280 --> 02:20:08.309 align:start position:0%
state house
and

02:20:08.309 --> 02:20:08.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:20:10.389 --> 02:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
the questions that they ask when they
 
02:20:12.870 --> 02:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
sit in rep's hall about the buttons and
 
02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
about the pictures
 
02:20:17.510 --> 02:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
and the times that i've been here
 
02:20:19.190 --> 02:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
the little girls
 
02:20:20.790 --> 02:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
that were fourth graders were thrilled
 
02:20:21.910 --> 02:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
to see
 
02:20:21.920 --> 02:20:22.950 align:start position:0%
to see
women

02:20:22.950 --> 02:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
women
 
02:20:25.590 --> 02:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
women females on the wall
 
02:20:27.830 --> 02:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
we have more diversity coming into the
 
02:20:29.750 --> 02:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
state house now
 
02:20:31.590 --> 02:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
with all
 
02:20:31.600 --> 02:20:32.550 align:start position:0%
with all
different

02:20:32.550 --> 02:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:20:32.560 --> 02:20:34.150 align:start position:0%
different
nationalities

02:20:34.150 --> 02:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
nationalities
 
02:20:36.309 --> 02:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
including black
 
02:20:37.830 --> 02:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
mixed race
 
02:20:40.070 --> 02:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
the entire
 
02:20:43.750 --> 02:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
gamut and wouldn't it be wonderful
 
02:20:46.469 --> 02:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
for these children to identify
 
02:20:48.230 --> 02:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
with someone
 
02:20:50.710 --> 02:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
that is a mixed race
 
02:20:52.389 --> 02:20:52.399 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
02:20:54.870 --> 02:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
looking at a plaque and not
 
02:20:57.349 --> 02:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
understanding that this person
 
02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
is perhaps
 
02:21:00.309 --> 02:21:00.319 align:start position:0%
like them
 
02:21:01.830 --> 02:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
02:21:05.110 --> 02:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
that is a most compelling reason
 
02:21:07.270 --> 02:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
that we need to do it
 
02:21:09.349 --> 02:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be looking the kids
 
02:21:11.670 --> 02:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
are going to walk right past a plaque
 
02:21:12.870 --> 02:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
and they're going to be looking at the
 
02:21:12.880 --> 02:21:14.070 align:start position:0%
and they're going to be looking at the
portraits

02:21:14.070 --> 02:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
portraits
 
02:21:16.309 --> 02:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
and i understand that it may not be
 
02:21:20.710 --> 02:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
exactly but the most important aspect of
 
02:21:23.270 --> 02:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
the picture
 
02:21:26.309 --> 02:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
is that he was biracial
 
02:21:29.670 --> 02:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
and partly black
 
02:21:32.309 --> 02:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:34.630 --> 02:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah if i may respond to a
 
02:21:38.830 --> 02:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:42.070 --> 02:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh you can do the science on it you do
 
02:21:43.510 --> 02:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
the math or you can go to the scientists
 
02:21:46.389 --> 02:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
on whether descendants provide any guide
 
02:21:48.150 --> 02:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
when you get six to eight generations
 
02:21:48.160 --> 02:21:49.349 align:start position:0%
when you get six to eight generations
down

02:21:49.349 --> 02:21:49.359 align:start position:0%
down
 
02:21:51.910 --> 02:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
um by the math you're at less than two
 
02:21:55.110 --> 02:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
percent of the dna from that descendant
 
02:21:57.750 --> 02:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
the way the dna is actually passed down
 
02:21:59.590 --> 02:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
and i will use the scientific and
 
02:22:01.510 --> 02:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
technical term that is you can find
 
02:22:03.349 --> 02:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
internet by eight generations the amount
 
02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
of dna from the original person is quote
 
02:22:08.710 --> 02:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
unquote vanishingly small
 
02:22:12.230 --> 02:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
so it is no reliable guide whatsoever
 
02:22:14.550 --> 02:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
as to physiognomy or anything else about
 
02:22:16.630 --> 02:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
someone who is eight generations
 
02:22:20.230 --> 02:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
previous that's just the science on it
 
02:22:23.830 --> 02:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
i will say secondly that i'm just really
 
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
anxious about going into the territory
 
02:22:29.349 --> 02:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
of our imagining what well not
 
02:22:30.790 --> 02:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily bi-raciated black
 
02:22:30.800 --> 02:22:32.550 align:start position:0%
necessarily bi-raciated black
grandfather

02:22:32.550 --> 02:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
grandfather
 
02:22:35.429 --> 02:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
person looked like at that time
 
02:22:38.150 --> 02:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
and i you know i i'll just be personal
 
02:22:40.309 --> 02:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
my our son is african-american
 
02:22:43.030 --> 02:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
and uh he is someone who at a very early
 
02:22:46.150 --> 02:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
age recognized the kind of images and
 
02:22:48.630 --> 02:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
the presentations and the difficulties
 
02:22:50.950 --> 02:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
in his classroom of kind of fantasized
 
02:22:52.469 --> 02:22:52.479 align:start position:0%
images in fact they had you know
 
02:22:54.630 --> 02:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
plantation images of happy slaves on the
 
02:22:57.670 --> 02:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
schoolhouse wall of his fourth grade
 
02:23:00.790 --> 02:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
and this is disturbing to him
 
02:23:03.270 --> 02:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
and to see that someone would have
 
02:23:03.280 --> 02:23:04.710 align:start position:0%
and to see that someone would have
imagined

02:23:04.710 --> 02:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
imagined
 
02:23:06.309 --> 02:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
and again i i'd say representative i
 
02:23:07.750 --> 02:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
mean are you going to sit there and with
 
02:23:09.830 --> 02:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
a color chart disguise you know how much
 
02:23:11.990 --> 02:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
look at the portrait wentworth of uh
 
02:23:13.750 --> 02:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
alexander twilight look at that portrait
 
02:23:15.190 --> 02:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
you think you're you know looking at a
 
02:23:17.830 --> 02:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote white
 
02:23:19.830 --> 02:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
you know with the photograph
 
02:23:19.840 --> 02:23:20.790 align:start position:0%
you know with the photograph
and

02:23:20.790 --> 02:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:23:20.800 --> 02:23:21.910 align:start position:0%
and
um

02:23:21.910 --> 02:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:23.910 --> 02:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
so what what is it that would put up
 
02:23:25.429 --> 02:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
there and try to tell the school
 
02:23:27.110 --> 02:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
children that we are wanting them to
 
02:23:30.469 --> 02:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
accept as a basically a racial fantasy
 
02:23:32.309 --> 02:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
about who this what this person looked
 
02:23:34.389 --> 02:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
like why would we even want to go down
 
02:23:35.670 --> 02:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
that road
 
02:23:38.630 --> 02:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
when we have a very good option here
 
02:23:40.230 --> 02:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:23:41.510 --> 02:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:23:41.520 --> 02:23:43.670 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:23:45.590 --> 02:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry senator richard did you have
 
02:23:47.510 --> 02:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
something you wanted to come yes thank
 
02:23:49.830 --> 02:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
you uh mr chairman i think
 
02:23:52.150 --> 02:23:52.160 align:start position:0%
the place that we can all agree is that
 
02:23:53.830 --> 02:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
wentworth cheswell
 
02:23:56.550 --> 02:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
should be recognized and
 
02:23:58.950 --> 02:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
was a very amazing person
 
02:24:02.230 --> 02:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
but we feel in the senate that you're
 
02:24:05.750 --> 02:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
doing a disservice to him to put up
 
02:24:07.990 --> 02:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
a fictitious
 
02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:09.030 align:start position:0%
a fictitious
portrait

02:24:09.030 --> 02:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
portrait
 
02:24:10.389 --> 02:24:10.399 align:start position:0%
now to
 
02:24:14.309 --> 02:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
speak to the point of the fourth graders
 
02:24:16.630 --> 02:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
i've been here with many of my fourth
 
02:24:19.590 --> 02:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
grade classes just this week on monday
 
02:24:20.950 --> 02:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
with jeffrey
 
02:24:24.389 --> 02:24:24.399 align:start position:0%
the tour is done very well
 
02:24:26.150 --> 02:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
things are pointed out it doesn't have
 
02:24:29.510 --> 02:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
to just be a portrait but for people to
 
02:24:32.710 --> 02:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
really recognize what this man
 
02:24:34.150 --> 02:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
was about
 
02:24:35.990 --> 02:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
will be identified
 
02:24:38.309 --> 02:24:38.319 align:start position:0%
perhaps the best way to go is to do the
 
02:24:40.469 --> 02:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
plaque rather than have a fictitious
 
02:24:40.479 --> 02:24:41.510 align:start position:0%
plaque rather than have a fictitious
portrait

02:24:41.510 --> 02:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
portrait
 
02:24:44.230 --> 02:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
have this man properly recognized and
 
02:24:47.030 --> 02:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
honored and then maybe somewhere down
 
02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
the road there are some historians there
 
02:24:51.990 --> 02:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
can dig up something further of a
 
02:24:53.429 --> 02:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
photograph maybe there's something
 
02:24:55.510 --> 02:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere down the road but that's the
 
02:24:59.429 --> 02:24:59.439 align:start position:0%
the senate position so thank you
 
02:25:02.309 --> 02:25:02.319 align:start position:0%
thank you senator
 
02:25:05.830 --> 02:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
um a quick question i have on the um
 
02:25:08.710 --> 02:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
the senate version is
 
02:25:11.510 --> 02:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
to accept a a gift um
 
02:25:13.510 --> 02:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
is there a senate
 
02:25:13.520 --> 02:25:14.630 align:start position:0%
is there a senate
provider

02:25:14.630 --> 02:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
provider
 
02:25:19.830 --> 02:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:20.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:25:20.870 --> 02:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:23.110 --> 02:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
that is kind of boreplayed as to what we
 
02:25:25.030 --> 02:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
do rather than spending state expending
 
02:25:27.670 --> 02:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
state funds but i i can assure you that
 
02:25:29.270 --> 02:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
there will be
 
02:25:31.110 --> 02:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
the money could be raised perhaps by the
 
02:25:33.590 --> 02:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
black heritage trail or other groups
 
02:25:35.429 --> 02:25:35.439 align:start position:0%
i will assure you that we are you may
 
02:25:37.110 --> 02:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
have noticed that a
 
02:25:39.750 --> 02:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
marker went up in windham
 
02:25:41.750 --> 02:25:41.760 align:start position:0%

02:25:44.790 --> 02:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh to commemorate peop you know enslaved
 
02:25:46.790 --> 02:25:46.800 align:start position:0%

on june 4th there's going to be others
 
02:25:55.510 --> 02:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
in dover and elsewhere i mean we have
 
02:25:57.429 --> 02:25:57.439 align:start position:0%
this you know statewide trail and those
 
02:25:59.190 --> 02:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
plaques cost
 
02:26:01.349 --> 02:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
maybe three thousand each
 
02:26:02.710 --> 02:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
um i
 
02:26:04.389 --> 02:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
don't remember the most recent plaque we
 
02:26:06.710 --> 02:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
put up the price but anyways yes so i'm
 
02:26:08.230 --> 02:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
trying to give i should just give a
 
02:26:10.790 --> 02:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
short answer to your question yes
 
02:26:12.389 --> 02:26:12.399 align:start position:0%

coming from i definitely get it because
 
02:26:24.800 --> 02:26:25.830 align:start position:0%
coming from i definitely get it because
um

02:26:25.830 --> 02:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:27.190 --> 02:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
you know i definitely don't want to
 
02:26:29.270 --> 02:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
misrepresent somebody but
 
02:26:32.230 --> 02:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
at the same time i think you know one of
 
02:26:34.469 --> 02:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
you know i as a person of color i walk
 
02:26:37.349 --> 02:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
around these halls and i you know i see
 
02:26:39.429 --> 02:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
nobody that looks like me
 
02:26:41.670 --> 02:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
um and i and i don't know if there ever
 
02:26:43.590 --> 02:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
will be a portrait of somebody who looks
 
02:26:46.389 --> 02:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
like me i hope so in the future um i
 
02:26:48.309 --> 02:26:48.319 align:start position:0%
mean i'm part of the joy i get in the
 
02:26:50.150 --> 02:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
fourth grade class coming over is when i
 
02:26:51.830 --> 02:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
get to speak to my fourth grade
 
02:26:53.270 --> 02:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
elementary school led street elementary
 
02:26:54.389 --> 02:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
school and i get to speak to them in
 
02:26:56.710 --> 02:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
spanish and the kids go bananas because
 
02:27:00.150 --> 02:27:00.160 align:start position:0%
about half the school uh is our our
 
02:27:03.510 --> 02:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
spanish speakers um which is incredible
 
02:27:05.429 --> 02:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
um but one of
 
02:27:06.630 --> 02:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
you know one of the things we're trying
 
02:27:09.270 --> 02:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
to do here is trying to memorialize you
 
02:27:09.280 --> 02:27:09.990 align:start position:0%
to do here is trying to memorialize you
know

02:27:09.990 --> 02:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:27:13.510 --> 02:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
an amazing man um and and try to raise
 
02:27:15.190 --> 02:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
up his legacy here in the state house
 
02:27:18.710 --> 02:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
and i you know i worry about the the
 
02:27:21.270 --> 02:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
optics of of of a plaque versus a
 
02:27:25.590 --> 02:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
portrait simply just not being enough um
 
02:27:27.910 --> 02:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
and that is and like and being enough is
 
02:27:30.710 --> 02:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
just a longer conversation that we can
 
02:27:33.270 --> 02:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
that that that happens and one of the
 
02:27:35.190 --> 02:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
things i i get concerned about it's like
 
02:27:37.510 --> 02:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
oh it doesn't rain it's to me it feels
 
02:27:38.950 --> 02:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
like oh it doesn't it's not raised to
 
02:27:41.670 --> 02:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
the level of stature of a portrait and
 
02:27:41.680 --> 02:27:42.790 align:start position:0%
the level of stature of a portrait and
um

02:27:42.790 --> 02:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:45.429 --> 02:27:45.439 align:start position:0%
and i and yeah that just did
 
02:27:47.190 --> 02:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
so this is it's a tip it's a difficult
 
02:27:49.830 --> 02:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
decision to grapple with um and you know
 
02:27:52.469 --> 02:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
that's why i believe you know we
 
02:27:55.429 --> 02:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
we in the house want uh would love if
 
02:27:57.270 --> 02:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
the the portrait rather than the plaque
 
02:28:00.309 --> 02:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
so i may just add mr chairman if you
 
02:28:01.510 --> 02:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
walk around the state house you notice
 
02:28:03.190 --> 02:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
that some of the people of the of the
 
02:28:05.510 --> 02:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
highest honors that we accord are medal
 
02:28:07.349 --> 02:28:07.359 align:start position:0%
of honor winners and others
 
02:28:10.830 --> 02:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a bronze plaque
 
02:28:14.309 --> 02:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
um and i agree completely about needing
 
02:28:17.030 --> 02:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
to diversify the representation of this
 
02:28:19.429 --> 02:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
state through portraiture
 
02:28:22.950 --> 02:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
um we have the opportunity certainly for
 
02:28:25.110 --> 02:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
the you know the the first
 
02:28:27.910 --> 02:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
housemate african-american house member
 
02:28:30.150 --> 02:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
to be commemorated and portrait were we
 
02:28:31.830 --> 02:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
to choose to do so
 
02:28:34.230 --> 02:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
i hope people saw in the last week that
 
02:28:36.469 --> 02:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
tom hooker died
 
02:28:38.230 --> 02:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
what an extraordinary man an
 
02:28:40.389 --> 02:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
extraordinary history of state and
 
02:28:40.399 --> 02:28:41.750 align:start position:0%
extraordinary history of state and
national

02:28:41.750 --> 02:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
national
 
02:28:43.750 --> 02:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
service and his wife too i mean the
 
02:28:45.830 --> 02:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
portrait of both an eleanor hooker
 
02:28:47.429 --> 02:28:47.439 align:start position:0%
eleanor williams hooker what they did
 
02:28:50.150 --> 02:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
together here in this state as pioneers
 
02:28:52.389 --> 02:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
um extraordinary opportunity
 
02:28:54.309 --> 02:28:54.319 align:start position:0%
i think with with them so there's no
 
02:28:56.150 --> 02:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
shortage of people to commemorate in
 
02:28:59.270 --> 02:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
such a in such a way and as i said
 
02:29:01.270 --> 02:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
i i think we'd be
 
02:29:03.670 --> 02:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
magnificently pleased with the results
 
02:29:05.429 --> 02:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
of having this plaque and where it would
 
02:29:06.710 --> 02:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
be displayed
 
02:29:08.469 --> 02:29:08.479 align:start position:0%
and the stories that could be told about
 
02:29:08.479 --> 02:29:09.429 align:start position:0%
and the stories that could be told about
it

02:29:09.429 --> 02:29:09.439 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:29:12.469 --> 02:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
um but we wouldn't be propagating um
 
02:29:14.710 --> 02:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
a false image and so
 
02:29:16.710 --> 02:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
i mean i i don't want to belabor it but
 
02:29:19.270 --> 02:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
you know from senator carson who made it
 
02:29:21.030 --> 02:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
very clear in conversation yesterday
 
02:29:23.510 --> 02:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
where the senate was at and
 
02:29:25.110 --> 02:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
i hope that the house will exceed
 
02:29:27.110 --> 02:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's going to
 
02:29:30.550 --> 02:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
have to just wait for another year
 
02:29:30.560 --> 02:29:32.469 align:start position:0%
have to just wait for another year
representable

02:29:32.469 --> 02:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
representable
 
02:29:34.230 --> 02:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman thank
 
02:29:36.309 --> 02:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
you senator waters for your information
 
02:29:38.309 --> 02:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
and for your commitment to this
 
02:29:40.870 --> 02:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
again i go back to the fact that
 
02:29:43.110 --> 02:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
we've got plaques under every single
 
02:29:43.120 --> 02:29:44.309 align:start position:0%
we've got plaques under every single
portrait

02:29:44.309 --> 02:29:44.319 align:start position:0%
portrait
 
02:29:46.309 --> 02:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
and and people don't really read those
 
02:29:46.319 --> 02:29:48.150 align:start position:0%
and and people don't really read those
plaques

02:29:48.150 --> 02:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
plaques
 
02:29:49.990 --> 02:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
except on a rare occasion for a rare
 
02:29:52.230 --> 02:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
individual they might find
 
02:29:54.230 --> 02:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
is there no way you could come up with a
 
02:29:56.870 --> 02:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable compromise we have
 
02:29:58.309 --> 02:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
a commitment
 
02:30:01.510 --> 02:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
from the public to pay for this portrait
 
02:30:04.710 --> 02:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
for a portrait of a likeness
 
02:30:06.469 --> 02:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
something that people can really see
 
02:30:06.479 --> 02:30:07.830 align:start position:0%
something that people can really see
visually

02:30:07.830 --> 02:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
visually
 
02:30:09.510 --> 02:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
something that people
 
02:30:11.830 --> 02:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
just won't see words on the wall
 
02:30:13.590 --> 02:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
and we all know that words are very
 
02:30:15.270 --> 02:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
important and we all know that they're
 
02:30:18.150 --> 02:30:18.160 align:start position:0%
very important uh
 
02:30:20.790 --> 02:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
efforts and commitments that
 
02:30:22.790 --> 02:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
weren't worth cheswell made in his life
 
02:30:25.349 --> 02:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
that need to be memorialized but there
 
02:30:28.389 --> 02:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
needs to be more than just a plaque
 
02:30:30.389 --> 02:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
can you come up with a compromise of
 
02:30:33.990 --> 02:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
some sort well i i would thank
 
02:30:35.590 --> 02:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
representative but and i would say that
 
02:30:37.670 --> 02:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
i've mentioned the signature
 
02:30:37.680 --> 02:30:39.830 align:start position:0%
i've mentioned the signature
um

02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:41.830 --> 02:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
certainly uh if you want to commemorate
 
02:30:41.840 --> 02:30:42.630 align:start position:0%
certainly uh if you want to commemorate
his

02:30:42.630 --> 02:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
his
 
02:30:45.190 --> 02:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
his ride you know with paul revere you
 
02:30:47.270 --> 02:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
could have a figure on a horse
 
02:30:50.150 --> 02:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
back um you could have a masonic
 
02:30:52.710 --> 02:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
sign on this you could have
 
02:30:55.590 --> 02:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
an image of the new market town record
 
02:30:55.600 --> 02:30:56.389 align:start position:0%
an image of the new market town record
book

02:30:56.389 --> 02:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
book
 
02:30:58.469 --> 02:30:58.479 align:start position:0%
you could have an image of his house i
 
02:31:00.389 --> 02:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
mean there's no shortage of visual
 
02:31:03.429 --> 02:31:03.439 align:start position:0%
attractions that can be put on a plaque
 
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
to get people to stop and take a look at
 
02:31:08.550 --> 02:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
it and maybe even be more extensive
 
02:31:10.950 --> 02:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
than that but there's no such thing as a
 
02:31:13.349 --> 02:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
portrait of wentworth cheswell there is
 
02:31:15.830 --> 02:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
no such thing
 
02:31:18.150 --> 02:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
there is no such thing as a likeness of
 
02:31:20.710 --> 02:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
wentworth cheswell
 
02:31:23.429 --> 02:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
so that that's where we are and i i will
 
02:31:25.590 --> 02:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
just say you know that we hope the house
 
02:31:27.510 --> 02:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
will exceed to the senate
 
02:31:29.510 --> 02:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
position because otherwise senator
 
02:31:31.590 --> 02:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
carson says that we'll we're just going
 
02:31:34.870 --> 02:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:37.190 --> 02:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
yeah i think we will take a break
 
02:31:38.710 --> 02:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
because i'm i'm
 
02:31:41.110 --> 02:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
fairly certain that
 
02:31:43.190 --> 02:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
the house doesn't see it that way but
 
02:31:44.950 --> 02:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll have a conversation we can
 
02:36:49.750 --> 02:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:51.190 --> 02:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
senators uh
 
02:36:54.230 --> 02:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
we've had our conversation we are
 
02:36:57.110 --> 02:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
very much stuck on a visual um
 
02:36:58.790 --> 02:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
it was interesting to us to hear you
 
02:36:58.800 --> 02:36:59.670 align:start position:0%
it was interesting to us to hear you
mention

02:36:59.670 --> 02:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
mention
 
02:37:03.349 --> 02:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:06.150 --> 02:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
would the senate be amenable to
 
02:37:06.160 --> 02:37:07.750 align:start position:0%
would the senate be amenable to
um

02:37:07.750 --> 02:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:09.510 --> 02:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
that type of a
 
02:37:12.150 --> 02:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
of a an accompaniment to the plaque
 
02:37:14.070 --> 02:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
of a rider on a horse
 
02:37:16.150 --> 02:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
where that discussion of
 
02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:17.030 align:start position:0%
where that discussion of
of

02:37:17.030 --> 02:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:37:20.630 --> 02:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
the rider that rode north from boston uh
 
02:37:22.950 --> 02:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
where paul revere rode west
 
02:37:24.790 --> 02:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
um would that
 
02:37:27.349 --> 02:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
be something that the senate would be
 
02:37:29.510 --> 02:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
amenable to uh
 
02:37:31.030 --> 02:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
changing their proposals
 
02:37:32.630 --> 02:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
you know why not i mean i don't think
 
02:37:34.389 --> 02:37:34.399 align:start position:0%
you need to change the language i mean
 
02:37:36.070 --> 02:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
the plaque the process of deciding
 
02:37:37.510 --> 02:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
what's on the plaque is something that
 
02:37:38.870 --> 02:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
we would do
 
02:37:40.710 --> 02:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
and um you could have right on a plaque
 
02:37:43.349 --> 02:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
a nice image of the top of somebody
 
02:37:44.790 --> 02:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
on a horse and you wouldn't get into the
 
02:37:47.030 --> 02:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
business about his features necessarily
 
02:37:49.429 --> 02:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
you know think of the tricorn hat and
 
02:37:51.110 --> 02:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
you could have it right on a plaque and
 
02:37:52.870 --> 02:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
i could the tour guide said did you know
 
02:37:55.110 --> 02:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
that well chez will roll with paul
 
02:37:57.830 --> 02:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
revere and he was from new market and
 
02:37:59.590 --> 02:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
02:38:01.190 --> 02:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
and i think his signature under it i
 
02:38:03.670 --> 02:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
mean i think it's what we would do is
 
02:38:05.510 --> 02:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
work with the
 
02:38:07.670 --> 02:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
you know the with the deciding on this
 
02:38:09.349 --> 02:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
and the wording is it's extremely
 
02:38:10.550 --> 02:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
important as i know from the black
 
02:38:12.550 --> 02:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
heritage trail putting up its uh trail
 
02:38:14.550 --> 02:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
markers it's extremely important as
 
02:38:16.870 --> 02:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
extensive committee work and historical
 
02:38:19.110 --> 02:38:19.120 align:start position:0%
researchers who come up with a language
 
02:38:20.790 --> 02:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
so that you have that right so i think
 
02:38:22.870 --> 02:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
that it just that if you go to the black
 
02:38:25.190 --> 02:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
and we we could just say we want
 
02:38:25.200 --> 02:38:26.710 align:start position:0%
and we we could just say we want
um

02:38:26.710 --> 02:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:28.630 --> 02:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
you know uh if you want to add something
 
02:38:30.469 --> 02:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
with images commemorating his
 
02:38:32.309 --> 02:38:32.319 align:start position:0%
accomplishments or his life you could
 
02:38:34.309 --> 02:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
add that or just assume that in the
 
02:38:36.070 --> 02:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
black the process is we're going to end
 
02:38:37.910 --> 02:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
up with something like that so i don't
 
02:38:40.550 --> 02:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
think we need to we should assume um
 
02:38:43.349 --> 02:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so representative
 
02:38:45.670 --> 02:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
02:38:47.190 --> 02:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
but then we come up with the problem of
 
02:38:49.590 --> 02:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
money because we don't pay for um i'm
 
02:38:51.750 --> 02:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
sorry i can't hear you the problem is
 
02:38:53.030 --> 02:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
the money then
 
02:38:55.030 --> 02:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
because you say we can come up with the
 
02:38:56.469 --> 02:38:56.479 align:start position:0%
money for the plaque well you know the
 
02:38:58.070 --> 02:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
historic committee does the blacks
 
02:38:59.670 --> 02:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
anyway we come up with the money for
 
02:38:59.680 --> 02:39:00.630 align:start position:0%
anyway we come up with the money for
that

02:39:00.630 --> 02:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:39:03.429 --> 02:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to someone on a horse
 
02:39:05.190 --> 02:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
i i don't think the historic committee
 
02:39:06.630 --> 02:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
is going to come up with something like
 
02:39:09.110 --> 02:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
that we've already got a commitment from
 
02:39:11.510 --> 02:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
the outside
 
02:39:11.520 --> 02:39:12.630 align:start position:0%
the outside
from

02:39:12.630 --> 02:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:39:16.389 --> 02:39:16.399 align:start position:0%
what a portrait is so
 
02:39:18.870 --> 02:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking we could still have a
 
02:39:18.880 --> 02:39:20.950 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking we could still have a
painting

02:39:20.950 --> 02:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
painting
 
02:39:21.990 --> 02:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
if the
 
02:39:24.070 --> 02:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
if the masons in new hampshire are still
 
02:39:24.080 --> 02:39:25.910 align:start position:0%
if the masons in new hampshire are still
willing

02:39:25.910 --> 02:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
willing
 
02:39:28.469 --> 02:39:28.479 align:start position:0%
for this kind of compromise to have
 
02:39:31.750 --> 02:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
a painting of a colonial person
 
02:39:34.150 --> 02:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
horseback riding from portsmouth i guess
 
02:39:37.349 --> 02:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
it was to exeter to warn about the
 
02:39:39.110 --> 02:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
british are coming
 
02:39:40.870 --> 02:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
um make sure he's going in the right
 
02:39:40.880 --> 02:39:41.910 align:start position:0%
um make sure he's going in the right
direction

02:39:41.910 --> 02:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
direction
 
02:39:45.270 --> 02:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:47.270 --> 02:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
that would be rather significant to try
 
02:39:48.230 --> 02:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
to put
 
02:39:51.190 --> 02:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
all this on one plaque i think would be
 
02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:52.870 align:start position:0%
all this on one plaque i think would be
expensive

02:39:52.870 --> 02:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
02:39:55.270 --> 02:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know who would pay for so what
 
02:39:57.830 --> 02:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
what are you thinking of then
 
02:39:59.670 --> 02:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
where we do have a financial commitment
 
02:40:03.110 --> 02:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
from the outside there would be um
 
02:40:04.870 --> 02:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
i think it would be
 
02:40:06.790 --> 02:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
an opportune moment for fundraising to
 
02:40:08.950 --> 02:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
cover the cost of this
 
02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:09.830 align:start position:0%
cover the cost of this
uh

02:40:09.830 --> 02:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:40:12.469 --> 02:40:12.479 align:start position:0%
of this i think that that i do think
 
02:40:14.469 --> 02:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
that would be accomplished
 
02:40:14.479 --> 02:40:15.990 align:start position:0%
that would be accomplished
um

02:40:15.990 --> 02:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:17.110 --> 02:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:40:21.510 --> 02:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:23.750 --> 02:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
i think we are where we are
 
02:40:25.190 --> 02:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
and if you'd like to put in some
 
02:40:26.710 --> 02:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
language in this it says with
 
02:40:26.720 --> 02:40:27.990 align:start position:0%
language in this it says with
appropriate

02:40:27.990 --> 02:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
02:40:31.269 --> 02:40:31.279 align:start position:0%
images commemorating chess with cheswell
 
02:40:31.279 --> 02:40:33.429 align:start position:0%
images commemorating chess with cheswell
fine

02:40:33.429 --> 02:40:33.439 align:start position:0%
fine
 
02:40:33.439 --> 02:40:35.990 align:start position:0%
fine
um

02:40:35.990 --> 02:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:39.670 align:start position:0%
 
then

02:40:39.670 --> 02:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:43.830 --> 02:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:46.630 --> 02:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
i think we will need to draft
 
02:40:49.030 --> 02:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
just for the assurances that it will not
 
02:40:52.710 --> 02:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:52.720 --> 02:40:53.750 align:start position:0%
 
simple

02:40:53.750 --> 02:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
simple
 
02:40:53.760 --> 02:40:54.950 align:start position:0%
simple
worded

02:40:54.950 --> 02:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
worded
 
02:40:58.389 --> 02:40:58.399 align:start position:0%
plaque um i think we do need
 
02:41:00.870 --> 02:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
either a relief we need something on
 
02:41:03.030 --> 02:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
this plaque so that it
 
02:41:04.950 --> 02:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
generally will show
 
02:41:07.110 --> 02:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
um what we've talked about
 
02:41:07.120 --> 02:41:08.309 align:start position:0%
um what we've talked about
um

02:41:08.309 --> 02:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:10.469 --> 02:41:10.479 align:start position:0%
that being the case we'll need to put
 
02:41:12.309 --> 02:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
together something with ols and they'll
 
02:41:14.309 --> 02:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
be signed off but i think we're in
 
02:41:16.950 --> 02:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
agreement that um
 
02:41:19.110 --> 02:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
that failing
 
02:41:20.389 --> 02:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
to get
 
02:41:23.510 --> 02:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
the portrait that we feel still that was
 
02:41:23.520 --> 02:41:24.790 align:start position:0%
the portrait that we feel still that was
necessary

02:41:24.790 --> 02:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:26.389 align:start position:0%
necessary
um

02:41:26.389 --> 02:41:26.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:29.429 --> 02:41:29.439 align:start position:0%
a necessary compromise might be the
 
02:41:29.439 --> 02:41:30.710 align:start position:0%
a necessary compromise might be the
um

02:41:30.710 --> 02:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:32.710 --> 02:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
the accomplishments mr chairman i hope
 
02:41:34.230 --> 02:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
we could work out the language here
 
02:41:35.910 --> 02:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
because if we come back and it's
 
02:41:37.429 --> 02:41:37.439 align:start position:0%
language we're not going to agree to
 
02:41:40.150 --> 02:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
this what what's the point and um
 
02:41:41.670 --> 02:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
neither will we
 
02:41:44.389 --> 02:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
let's uh what what do you we have the
 
02:41:45.910 --> 02:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
senate version here what do you want to
 
02:41:49.030 --> 02:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:53.030 --> 02:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:53.040 --> 02:41:54.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:41:54.070 --> 02:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:56.550 --> 02:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
it could say on line five well it says
 
02:41:58.469 --> 02:41:58.479 align:start position:0%
this could say
 
02:41:59.910 --> 02:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
accept the gift of commemorative
 
02:42:03.510 --> 02:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
historical plaque for wentworth chiswell
 
02:42:03.520 --> 02:42:07.429 align:start position:0%
historical plaque for wentworth chiswell
including

02:42:07.429 --> 02:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:07.439 --> 02:42:10.870 align:start position:0%
 
appropriate

02:42:10.870 --> 02:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:10.880 --> 02:42:14.389 align:start position:0%
 
images

02:42:14.389 --> 02:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:16.070 --> 02:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
commemorate uh
 
02:42:22.630 --> 02:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:22.640 --> 02:42:23.510 align:start position:0%
 
go

02:42:23.510 --> 02:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
go
 
02:42:26.070 --> 02:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
oh i think an appropriate image that's
 
02:42:28.469 --> 02:42:28.479 align:start position:0%
very vague
 
02:42:32.630 --> 02:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:35.510 --> 02:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
minus an actual portrait we have to have
 
02:42:39.110 --> 02:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
a figure of since you mentioned it
 
02:42:41.990 --> 02:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
figure of a man
 
02:42:44.389 --> 02:42:44.399 align:start position:0%
on a horse this still doesn't
 
02:42:47.429 --> 02:42:47.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:49.510 --> 02:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
we have to have an image that's more
 
02:42:51.750 --> 02:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
specific than what you've said senator
 
02:42:54.630 --> 02:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
including appropriate images marking his
 
02:42:54.640 --> 02:42:59.349 align:start position:0%
including appropriate images marking his
accomplishments

02:42:59.349 --> 02:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:01.910 --> 02:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
mr chairman thank you but he had many
 
02:43:03.830 --> 02:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
other accomplishments besides riding
 
02:43:05.349 --> 02:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
that horse
 
02:43:05.359 --> 02:43:06.550 align:start position:0%
that horse
um

02:43:06.550 --> 02:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:08.150 --> 02:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
you know someone could very well take
 
02:43:09.910 --> 02:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
that language and do almost anything
 
02:43:11.510 --> 02:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
just have someone sitting why don't we
 
02:43:14.070 --> 02:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
say appropriate images marking his
 
02:43:16.070 --> 02:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
accomplish as
 
02:43:16.080 --> 02:43:19.190 align:start position:0%
accomplish as
approved

02:43:19.190 --> 02:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:22.070 --> 02:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
by the joint legislative historical
 
02:43:22.080 --> 02:43:25.590 align:start position:0%
by the joint legislative historical
committee

02:43:25.590 --> 02:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:30.630 --> 02:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:34.230 --> 02:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:36.630 --> 02:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
historical plaque for wentworth cheswell
 
02:43:40.070 --> 02:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
including appropriate images
 
02:43:43.429 --> 02:43:43.439 align:start position:0%
marking his accomplishments as approved
 
02:43:45.590 --> 02:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
by the joint legislative historical
 
02:43:45.600 --> 02:43:47.349 align:start position:0%
by the joint legislative historical
committee

02:43:47.349 --> 02:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:43:49.510 --> 02:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
and oversee the placement of the plaque
 
02:43:54.950 --> 02:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:57.110 --> 02:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
do we have we don't have actual wording
 
02:43:59.110 --> 02:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
of what the plaque will say right i mean
 
02:44:02.389 --> 02:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
i i i'm presuming the main point is that
 
02:44:04.870 --> 02:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
it will talk about um his racial
 
02:44:07.590 --> 02:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
qualities is that
 
02:44:09.349 --> 02:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
or racial history
 
02:44:10.389 --> 02:44:10.399 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:44:12.710 --> 02:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
going to be included well i i would i
 
02:44:14.710 --> 02:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
imagine i'm sure you've looked at the uh
 
02:44:16.309 --> 02:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
wording on historical marker that's
 
02:44:18.790 --> 02:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
placed at his gravesite in new market
 
02:44:22.309 --> 02:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
yes um that is an awfully good template
 
02:44:23.990 --> 02:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
yeah and that went through the process
 
02:44:26.150 --> 02:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
over there i mean again i was on the
 
02:44:28.070 --> 02:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
i've been on the historical resources
 
02:44:28.080 --> 02:44:29.670 align:start position:0%
i've been on the historical resources
committee

02:44:29.670 --> 02:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:44:31.190 --> 02:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
with the division of historical
 
02:44:33.830 --> 02:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
resources and that vetting proc process
 
02:44:35.349 --> 02:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
for language that goes on state
 
02:44:38.230 --> 02:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
historical markers is very
 
02:44:39.830 --> 02:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
very well done and so that could
 
02:44:41.830 --> 02:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
certainly form a basis for it so but you
 
02:44:43.269 --> 02:44:43.279 align:start position:0%
could add
 
02:44:45.110 --> 02:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate images
 
02:44:53.190 --> 02:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:55.830 --> 02:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
marking his accomplishments
 
02:44:57.830 --> 02:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
so including appropriate images and
 
02:45:01.590 --> 02:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
descriptions marking his accomplishments
 
02:45:03.429 --> 02:45:03.439 align:start position:0%
as approved by the joint legislative
 
02:45:05.510 --> 02:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
historical committee
 
02:45:07.590 --> 02:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
and oversee the placement of the plaque
 
02:45:13.510 --> 02:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:15.190 --> 02:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that we're
 
02:45:17.190 --> 02:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
going to have
 
02:45:17.200 --> 02:45:17.990 align:start position:0%
going to have
some

02:45:17.990 --> 02:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:45:21.349 --> 02:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
man on a horse in the plaque on the top
 
02:45:23.910 --> 02:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
of the plaque and i think you may have
 
02:45:25.750 --> 02:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
alluded to that in what you're saying
 
02:45:28.550 --> 02:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
there as long as that's because a visual
 
02:45:31.030 --> 02:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
is to me very important to the children
 
02:45:33.429 --> 02:45:33.439 align:start position:0%
coming through the state house
 
02:45:35.990 --> 02:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
um and and they may remember all these
 
02:45:39.510 --> 02:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
you know other portraits but
 
02:45:42.309 --> 02:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
riding on a horse and a plaque and and
 
02:45:44.630 --> 02:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
and and i think that the racial
 
02:45:47.429 --> 02:45:47.439 align:start position:0%
component of it is also very important
 
02:45:49.510 --> 02:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah and i that's why i say
 
02:45:51.429 --> 02:45:51.439 align:start position:0%
referencing the plaque and and the
 
02:45:53.030 --> 02:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
historical marker newmarket because it
 
02:45:54.630 --> 02:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
talks about his dissent
 
02:45:56.389 --> 02:45:56.399 align:start position:0%
thank you and um
 
02:45:58.230 --> 02:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
and and you know uh
 
02:45:59.830 --> 02:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
i imagine representative wall you're
 
02:46:01.110 --> 02:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
going to be on the joint legislative
 
02:46:02.550 --> 02:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
historical committee since you've
 
02:46:04.070 --> 02:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
probably been on there since there was a
 
02:46:06.389 --> 02:46:06.399 align:start position:0%
history in new hampshire
 
02:46:14.070 --> 02:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:17.429 --> 02:46:17.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um senator um since
 
02:46:19.670 --> 02:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
the first
 
02:46:21.429 --> 02:46:21.439 align:start position:0%
physical thing that we know that
 
02:46:23.910 --> 02:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
wentworth chaswell did
 
02:46:27.190 --> 02:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
for our country was to
 
02:46:30.550 --> 02:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
ride from portsmouth to exeter to warn
 
02:46:32.550 --> 02:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
about the british coming after paul
 
02:46:34.150 --> 02:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
revere arrived
 
02:46:35.830 --> 02:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
02:46:39.110 --> 02:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
i do approve of him of an image of him
 
02:46:42.070 --> 02:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
on a horse um
 
02:46:44.630 --> 02:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
and i do but i think some of the
 
02:46:46.389 --> 02:46:46.399 align:start position:0%
disappointment we've heard from
 
02:46:48.309 --> 02:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
people today is that
 
02:46:49.670 --> 02:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
and we feel
 
02:46:52.630 --> 02:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
he was the first person of color
 
02:46:55.030 --> 02:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
so that must have to be elected to
 
02:46:57.349 --> 02:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
public office now i don't know
 
02:46:59.269 --> 02:46:59.279 align:start position:0%
you know we're focusing on the image of
 
02:47:01.190 --> 02:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
him on the horse for the revolutionary
 
02:47:01.200 --> 02:47:02.150 align:start position:0%
him on the horse for the revolutionary
war

02:47:02.150 --> 02:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
war
 
02:47:02.160 --> 02:47:03.750 align:start position:0%
war
um

02:47:03.750 --> 02:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:07.349 --> 02:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
is there any way we can besides writing
 
02:47:10.389 --> 02:47:10.399 align:start position:0%
it in the plaque that we can acknowledge
 
02:47:12.150 --> 02:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
that he was the first person of color to
 
02:47:13.750 --> 02:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
be elected to office in the united
 
02:47:13.760 --> 02:47:14.950 align:start position:0%
be elected to office in the united
states

02:47:14.950 --> 02:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
states
 
02:47:17.830 --> 02:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
i mean i i don't know if we can put that
 
02:47:20.630 --> 02:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
in the image somehow or not i don't know
 
02:47:22.630 --> 02:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
well as i said
 
02:47:23.910 --> 02:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative you're going to be on the
 
02:47:25.230 --> 02:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
committee aren't you
 
02:47:25.240 --> 02:47:27.590 align:start position:0%
committee aren't you
[Laughter]

02:47:27.590 --> 02:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:47:28.950 --> 02:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
you're giving the committee a lot of
 
02:47:28.960 --> 02:47:33.190 align:start position:0%
you're giving the committee a lot of
responsibility

02:47:33.190 --> 02:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:36.790 --> 02:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:38.710 --> 02:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'll just say historically you
 
02:47:40.070 --> 02:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
know don't get me started you know you
 
02:47:40.080 --> 02:47:41.110 align:start position:0%
know don't get me started you know you
mean

02:47:41.110 --> 02:47:41.120 align:start position:0%
mean
 
02:47:42.550 --> 02:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
but you know that he did things
 
02:47:43.990 --> 02:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
significant to our nation's history
 
02:47:45.750 --> 02:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
before he made that ride
 
02:47:47.590 --> 02:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
because he was one of the early signers
 
02:47:50.469 --> 02:47:50.479 align:start position:0%
of documents uh about you know
 
02:47:52.469 --> 02:47:52.479 align:start position:0%
protesting british
 
02:47:54.710 --> 02:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
authority and rule he was there from the
 
02:47:57.429 --> 02:47:57.439 align:start position:0%
get-go uh on these things and that's
 
02:47:59.590 --> 02:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
it's incredible you know he was willing
 
02:48:01.670 --> 02:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
to fight fight for freedom in these ways
 
02:48:02.790 --> 02:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:48:04.870 --> 02:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
so i i just think and a plaque the thing
 
02:48:06.150 --> 02:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
i like about a black too is that they
 
02:48:07.910 --> 02:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
can be pretty good size and get a pretty
 
02:48:10.150 --> 02:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
good number of words on them
 
02:48:12.630 --> 02:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
and you know thank you very much for all
 
02:48:14.630 --> 02:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
that and we do know that there's a lot
 
02:48:17.590 --> 02:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
to say about him um do you happen to
 
02:48:19.510 --> 02:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
know somebody who
 
02:48:21.910 --> 02:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
is accomplished enough who can undertake
 
02:48:24.150 --> 02:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
this kind of project
 
02:48:26.870 --> 02:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
well i would uh recommend actually i i'm
 
02:48:28.469 --> 02:48:28.479 align:start position:0%
sure you know the work of richard haynes
 
02:48:30.389 --> 02:48:30.399 align:start position:0%
a very prominent african-american artist
 
02:48:32.309 --> 02:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
and i think that tasked with the
 
02:48:33.750 --> 02:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
creation of a
 
02:48:36.550 --> 02:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
image of a rider or other things as well
 
02:48:39.670 --> 02:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
and then there are others uh who do this
 
02:48:41.590 --> 02:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
do design work
 
02:48:44.150 --> 02:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
that the black heritage trail has has
 
02:48:45.830 --> 02:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
used or the seacoast african-american
 
02:48:48.950 --> 02:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
cultural center has used um
 
02:48:48.960 --> 02:48:49.990 align:start position:0%
cultural center has used um
and

02:48:49.990 --> 02:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:48:52.550 --> 02:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
i would think that the you know possibly
 
02:48:54.550 --> 02:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
the joint historical committee would set
 
02:48:56.309 --> 02:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
up a little subcommittee that invited
 
02:48:58.630 --> 02:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
some of these folks to participate in
 
02:49:00.950 --> 02:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
creating the designs that that are there
 
02:49:02.469 --> 02:49:02.479 align:start position:0%
so i think it'd be a good process and if
 
02:49:05.349 --> 02:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
this passes we'd get right on it
 
02:49:07.590 --> 02:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
you are you are submitting that in that
 
02:49:10.710 --> 02:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
language we just discussed yes
 
02:49:13.269 --> 02:49:13.279 align:start position:0%
mr mr chairman um
 
02:49:14.550 --> 02:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
i you know i've been on other ones this
 
02:49:16.150 --> 02:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
is a house bill so you'd have to submit
 
02:49:17.590 --> 02:49:17.600 align:start position:0%
the language but if this is the language
 
02:49:19.110 --> 02:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
we agree on
 
02:49:21.910 --> 02:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
we can vote now and you can have it we
 
02:49:23.830 --> 02:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
can sign off when we sign off we'll see
 
02:49:27.750 --> 02:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
what os is drafted okay are we good
 
02:49:30.070 --> 02:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
i think mr truman i just have one other
 
02:49:32.150 --> 02:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
thing um in
 
02:49:34.950 --> 02:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
the sense that we have disappointed a
 
02:49:37.510 --> 02:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
lot of people with this decision
 
02:49:39.830 --> 02:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
um we're satisfying some but we're
 
02:49:42.230 --> 02:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
disappointing those who
 
02:49:45.110 --> 02:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
wanted this image in the first place
 
02:49:47.670 --> 02:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
can you come up with some way for us to
 
02:49:50.950 --> 02:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
let the masons in new hampshire know
 
02:49:52.710 --> 02:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
how and why we came up with this
 
02:49:54.870 --> 02:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
decision because they were fully
 
02:49:54.880 --> 02:49:56.150 align:start position:0%
decision because they were fully
prepared

02:49:56.150 --> 02:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
prepared
 
02:50:04.150 --> 02:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:06.950 --> 02:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry is there a question in that
 
02:50:09.269 --> 02:50:09.279 align:start position:0%
the masons of new hampshire
 
02:50:11.830 --> 02:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
were going to pay for the portrait they
 
02:50:11.840 --> 02:50:13.030 align:start position:0%
were going to pay for the portrait they
they

02:50:13.030 --> 02:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:50:14.950 --> 02:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
that's why paul smith was here he is
 
02:50:14.960 --> 02:50:16.150 align:start position:0%
that's why paul smith was here he is
amazing

02:50:16.150 --> 02:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
amazing
 
02:50:18.469 --> 02:50:18.479 align:start position:0%
and um they had committed i don't know
 
02:50:20.309 --> 02:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
if they you heard that testimony in the
 
02:50:21.670 --> 02:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
senate or not
 
02:50:22.870 --> 02:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
but they
 
02:50:22.880 --> 02:50:23.670 align:start position:0%
but they
when

02:50:23.670 --> 02:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
when
 
02:50:26.309 --> 02:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony in the house
 
02:50:29.030 --> 02:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
the masons the order masons i'm not sure
 
02:50:31.349 --> 02:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
how the term goes uh we're fully
 
02:50:33.990 --> 02:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
prepared to pay for the portrait
 
02:50:36.950 --> 02:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
so based on the fact that we have
 
02:50:39.190 --> 02:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
changed our commitment to this
 
02:50:39.200 --> 02:50:40.870 align:start position:0%
changed our commitment to this
considerably

02:50:40.870 --> 02:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
considerably
 
02:50:42.790 --> 02:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
how can we
 
02:50:45.349 --> 02:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
let the masons know that in good faith
 
02:50:47.349 --> 02:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
you know they were enthused and more
 
02:50:49.030 --> 02:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
than willing to come up with the
 
02:50:50.469 --> 02:50:50.479 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars that would come for
 
02:50:53.269 --> 02:50:53.279 align:start position:0%
the portrait but clearly um i don't
 
02:50:54.630 --> 02:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
think they're going to pay for anything
 
02:50:56.389 --> 02:50:56.399 align:start position:0%
beyond that
 
02:50:57.830 --> 02:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
how can we
 
02:51:00.550 --> 02:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
justifiably give our apologies to them
 
02:51:00.560 --> 02:51:01.990 align:start position:0%
justifiably give our apologies to them
please

02:51:01.990 --> 02:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
please
 
02:51:04.469 --> 02:51:04.479 align:start position:0%
well i appreciate that i appreciate the
 
02:51:06.550 --> 02:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
masons as well um
 
02:51:09.429 --> 02:51:09.439 align:start position:0%
again if you go to portsmouth um
 
02:51:11.429 --> 02:51:11.439 align:start position:0%
the tavern building there which is
 
02:51:13.349 --> 02:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
immensely significant for black history
 
02:51:14.230 --> 02:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
that they
 
02:51:16.309 --> 02:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
it is still it is still a masonic lodge
 
02:51:18.469 --> 02:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
but it is also operated jointly with the
 
02:51:20.550 --> 02:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
strawberry bank and they spent how many
 
02:51:22.150 --> 02:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars to
 
02:51:23.510 --> 02:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
restore that
 
02:51:25.590 --> 02:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
um and to tell the stories of the
 
02:51:28.070 --> 02:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
african-american inhabitants of that
 
02:51:30.070 --> 02:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
that building so i truly appreciate what
 
02:51:32.150 --> 02:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
the masons have done on this i would say
 
02:51:33.670 --> 02:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to prevent the masons
 
02:51:35.429 --> 02:51:35.439 align:start position:0%
from having a portrait made of wentworth
 
02:51:36.710 --> 02:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
chisel which they could display
 
02:51:36.720 --> 02:51:37.990 align:start position:0%
chisel which they could display
elsewhere

02:51:37.990 --> 02:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
02:51:40.469 --> 02:51:40.479 align:start position:0%
um i would hope that they would see and
 
02:51:43.349 --> 02:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
we might include a masonic sign on on on
 
02:51:45.429 --> 02:51:45.439 align:start position:0%
the plaque that you know and i hope they
 
02:51:47.110 --> 02:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
would understand from this conversations
 
02:51:49.190 --> 02:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
here which have been extensive what
 
02:51:51.670 --> 02:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
the issues here are and i also would
 
02:51:53.110 --> 02:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
hope that they would consult more
 
02:51:54.550 --> 02:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
closely with the african-american
 
02:51:56.469 --> 02:51:56.479 align:start position:0%
community in the future
 
02:51:56.479 --> 02:51:57.750 align:start position:0%
community in the future
um

02:51:57.750 --> 02:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:00.790 --> 02:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
when they have kind of concepts about
 
02:52:02.950 --> 02:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
about this because uh i think that's
 
02:52:02.960 --> 02:52:05.349 align:start position:0%
about this because uh i think that's
important

02:52:05.349 --> 02:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:52:07.830 --> 02:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:52:10.230 --> 02:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
representative expedia thank you miss
 
02:52:11.670 --> 02:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
sharon you know
 
02:52:13.269 --> 02:52:13.279 align:start position:0%
i think you know i echo the the
 
02:52:15.269 --> 02:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
sentiments but i do think that you know
 
02:52:17.190 --> 02:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
if we do get more i know obviously
 
02:52:19.110 --> 02:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have photos in the 1700s but in
 
02:52:21.429 --> 02:52:21.439 align:start position:0%
the future if we do get any you know
 
02:52:23.030 --> 02:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
anything with historical research i'm
 
02:52:24.550 --> 02:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
hoping that we can
 
02:52:27.750 --> 02:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
highlight him if we can get a portrait
 
02:52:28.950 --> 02:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
if we ever got something like that it
 
02:52:31.269 --> 02:52:31.279 align:start position:0%
would be great but um i'm hoping in the
 
02:52:33.030 --> 02:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
future and you know i'm hoping like you
 
02:52:34.150 --> 02:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
like you said senator that we could
 
02:52:35.910 --> 02:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
diversify our walls
 
02:52:37.670 --> 02:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
um because i think it is important for
 
02:52:39.670 --> 02:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
our for our visitors who come through
 
02:52:42.309 --> 02:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
that they see you see you know things
 
02:52:44.230 --> 02:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
that may look like themselves
 
02:52:46.230 --> 02:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
i appreciate but i appreciate your
 
02:52:48.070 --> 02:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
work on this
 
02:52:50.550 --> 02:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
thank you um i'd like to close it by
 
02:52:53.750 --> 02:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
just saying i'm really disappointed um
 
02:52:55.429 --> 02:52:55.439 align:start position:0%
i thought we would be able to do
 
02:52:57.990 --> 02:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
something for the fourth graders
 
02:53:00.870 --> 02:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
and and provide an image that they could
 
02:53:02.309 --> 02:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
look at and
 
02:53:05.030 --> 02:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
i am disappointed in the senate um
 
02:53:07.429 --> 02:53:07.439 align:start position:0%
i will take a look at the language and
 
02:53:09.750 --> 02:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
submit it and hopefully
 
02:53:30.550 --> 02:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:32.070 --> 02:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
we're not authorized to put it in the
 
02:53:33.590 --> 02:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
state house they can do whatever they
 
02:53:34.870 --> 02:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
want but we're not authorized to put it
 
03:01:29.830 --> 03:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:29.840 --> 03:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
