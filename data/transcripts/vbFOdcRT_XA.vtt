00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call to order this
 
00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 align:start position:0%
continuing education event for the
 
00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 align:start position:0%
children and family law committee and
 
00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary Committee
 
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
we found that some of the bills that
 
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 align:start position:0%
have come before us having to do with
 
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
the law or the Judiciary Committee we're
 
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 align:start position:0%
not ready for prime time
 
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes there were misuses of legal
 
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 align:start position:0%
terms sometimes the rules of Criminal
 
00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 align:start position:0%
Court were soon to be the same as the
 
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 align:start position:0%
rules for civil court and so on and I
 
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
got to thinking if we had a continuing
 
00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
education event and brought senior
 
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
senior Judiciary people to us they could
 
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
make a presentation to us and we would
 
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
learn some more things about the law so
 
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
next time our bills would have a greater
 
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
chance of being heard and not either
 
00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
killed or retained here's the format for
 
00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
how we're going to be working today
 
00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:19.930 align:start position:0%
how we're going to be working today
the

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
Judiciary folks will introduce
 
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
themselves and make a presentation
 
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
if along the way you have a question
 
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
you will go over to the table where the
 
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
committee researcher is
 
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.310 align:start position:0%
committee researcher is
waving

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
waving
 
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
cards at you and her hand too and you
 
00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 align:start position:0%
will fill out the question on the card
 
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
we will not take questions from the
 
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
audience in a direct verbal way you'll
 
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
fill the cards out and there's a box
 
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
where you'll put them in
 
00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the line
 
00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee chairman Bob Lynn
 
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 align:start position:0%
will pick up a pile of those cards and
 
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
sort them by type because many of the
 
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
questions will be similar to other
 
00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 align:start position:0%
questions so we'll group them or he'll
 
00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 align:start position:0%
group them so that we can ask one
 
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 align:start position:0%
composite question
 
00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 align:start position:0%
it's not proper to raise a question
 
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
about a particular court case
 
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
first of all because that is considered
 
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 align:start position:0%
unethical in a case like we're in today
 
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
secondly the justices may not be
 
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
familiar with it and thirdly we're not
 
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 align:start position:0%
looking at particular cases we're
 
00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 align:start position:0%
looking at process what is the process
 
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
is it being followed should there be a
 
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
different process what is the procedure
 
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
those are the kinds of broad questions
 
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 align:start position:0%
that can be put to the justices
 
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
now in a meeting with chairman Lynn and
 
00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
the justices I came to the belief that
 
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
they are coming both to explain but also
 
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
to listen
 
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
and there will be some things where I
 
00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 align:start position:0%
know I'll learn a lot I made assumptions
 
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
that were incorrect
 
00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 align:start position:0%
but they're also going to hear some of
 
00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:16.259 align:start position:0%
the many concerns that people have
 
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
raised and until he proved to me
 
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise I think they're going to do
 
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
something about it and as I told them
 
00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 align:start position:0%
those are the nice carrots the stick I
 
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
have in my back pocket is several
 
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
retained bills that are really
 
00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 align:start position:0%
trying to straighten out Judiciary so
 
00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 align:start position:0%
I've got that stick I don't think I'll
 
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 align:start position:0%
need it
 
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 align:start position:0%
but I got it so now that I've pretty
 
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
well alienated everybody in the room
 
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
I will call upon the Chief Justice sir
 
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
if you would introduce yourself and your
 
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.189 align:start position:0%
if you would introduce yourself and your
colleagues

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 align:start position:0%

served as a mayoral master
 
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520 align:start position:0%

some Basics about the Judiciary also
 
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
give you a briefing on what something
 
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
called the weighted caseload study which
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
is a evidence-based analysis of the
 
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
resources that our Judiciary needs in
 
00:07:46.249 --> 00:07:46.259 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:07:49.249 --> 00:07:49.259 align:start position:0%
and then judge king is prepared to give
 
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
the Committees some statistics relating
 
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
to the Family Division and judge Gardner
 
00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
who uh is very well versed in this area
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
of the law and the procedure is prepared
 
00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:04.139 align:start position:0%
to help the committee and members of the
 
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
public with questions relating to that
 
00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
so we are very grateful for the
 
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
opportunity I do want to reiterate what
 
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
the chair said we want to hear comments
 
00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:16.919 align:start position:0%
we want to hear feedback as public
 
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
officials that's our duty and if we can
 
00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
do better we want to do better and it is
 
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
in that spirit that we are here
 
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
I do have slides and I've distributed I
 
00:08:31.369 --> 00:08:31.379 align:start position:0%
think every member of the committees has
 
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
them uh so I've covered slide two uh
 
00:08:38.209 --> 00:08:38.219 align:start position:0%
Chief would it be possible if we have
 
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
some left over we keep a few for
 
00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
committee members who aren't here but
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
those particularly in the audience who
 
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
are house members and Bill writers might
 
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:51.860 align:start position:0%
have access and
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
maybe the way they're distributed people
 
00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:57.300 align:start position:0%
could look on with one another
 
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you sir okay slide number three is
 
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
our mission
 
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
and it is something that we take very
 
00:09:06.769 --> 00:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
very seriously and we try to live by
 
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:09.300 align:start position:0%
every day and that goes through before
 
00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
not just the judges but our 800
 
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
employees in the judicial branch
 
00:09:16.009 --> 00:09:16.019 align:start position:0%
the next slide just gives you a visual
 
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
overview of the judicial branch we are
 
00:09:20.329 --> 00:09:20.339 align:start position:0%
comprised of two trial courts the
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
circuit court and the Superior Court one
 
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
Appellate Court the Supreme Court and
 
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
one office that provides administrative
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
support for the Judiciary it's called
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
the administrative office of the courts
 
00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:35.700 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to detail or judge king
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
and I will detail each one of these
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
courts just to level set everyone and I
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
recognize in advance that for many of
 
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
you this is uh you're well versed in
 
00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
this but I want to just make sure we're
 
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
we're all on the same page
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh circuit court judge king
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Chief so I'm on slide six and
 
00:09:58.910 --> 00:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh by way a review for some of you and
 
00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:02.519 align:start position:0%
maybe new for others the Circuit Court
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
was created uh with an effective date of
 
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
July 1st 2011 by this body it's a
 
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
legislatively created court and at the
 
00:10:14.449 --> 00:10:14.459 align:start position:0%
time we were under some fairly we the
 
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire were in some
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
fairly tight budget times and we were
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
asked to get creative and see if there
 
00:10:21.769 --> 00:10:21.779 align:start position:0%
are ways that we could create
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
efficiencies for the state in the court
 
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
system and what we did at the time was
 
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
we took three limited jurisdiction
 
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:31.980 align:start position:0%
courts we took the district court the
 
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
Probate Court where I came from and the
 
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
Family Division and we collapsed them
 
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
into one court and we called it the
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court we just kind of pulled
 
00:10:41.449 --> 00:10:41.459 align:start position:0%
that name out of the air I said we
 
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
called it the circuit court because
 
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:44.220 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court was already taken so we
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
needed to come up with something so we
 
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
called it the circuit court and the bill
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
was introduced in January of 2011 and I
 
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
think Governor Lynch signed it in
 
00:10:56.329 --> 00:10:56.339 align:start position:0%
mid-may it was one of the biggest
 
00:10:58.970 --> 00:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
changes in the court system since the
 
00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:02.339 align:start position:0%
consolidation in 1983 which was House
 
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
Bill 200 back then I was a member of
 
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
House Judiciary in the 8384 session
 
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
which I was shocked to do the math today
 
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
was 40 years ago but we when we created
 
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court it was House Bill 609
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
and we had asked the legislature for 10
 
00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:21.959 align:start position:0%
years to implement it so that we could
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
do the restructuring by attrition and we
 
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
were told that we had to implement it by
 
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
July 1st so we did we went from 115
 
00:11:32.569 --> 00:11:32.579 align:start position:0%
clerks and deputies across those three
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
courts down to 52
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
clerks and deputies we brought all those
 
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
folks into a room and we said we're
 
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
going to post 52 jobs you're all free to
 
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
apply but basically half of you are
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
going to lose your jobs and it was
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
probably one of the most difficult
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
things I've done in court administration
 
00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
and so and at the time we had 45
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
full-time judicial officers on the bench
 
00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:56.700 align:start position:0%
across those three courts Inc which
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
included 13 marital Masters and today
 
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
there's only one of those left and it's
 
00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:06.180 align:start position:0%
me the rest are the other 44 judges and
 
00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:08.519 align:start position:0%
Masters have retired summer some Masters
 
00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
are now judges like judge Garner some
 
00:12:13.069 --> 00:12:13.079 align:start position:0%
part-time judges have become full-time
 
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:15.180 align:start position:0%
judges but of those 45 judicial officers
 
00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
44 are no longer on the bench
 
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
slide seven uh it was no mystery to the
 
00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:26.940 align:start position:0%
creation of this we created 10 circuits
 
00:12:29.569 --> 00:12:29.579 align:start position:0%
and each County was a circuit and we
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
wanted to try to change as little as
 
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
possible uh to try to get this through
 
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
the legislature as seamlessly as we
 
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
could so we have 34 Circuit Court
 
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
locations around the state they're all
 
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
depicted on this map we have 10 probate
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
divisions those were the where the
 
00:12:46.129 --> 00:12:46.139 align:start position:0%
probate courts were originally
 
00:12:49.129 --> 00:12:49.139 align:start position:0%
established in the county seats and now
 
00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
we have a district Division and a Family
 
00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:53.300 align:start position:0%
Division and all of the other 31
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
locations since we created the Circuit
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
Court we've closed plastow which was a
 
00:12:59.930 --> 00:12:59.940 align:start position:0%
really small Court down in the lower
 
00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
part of the part of the state
 
00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
slide eight gives you what we're using
 
00:13:09.129 --> 00:13:09.139 align:start position:0%
as a an annual circuit court case volume
 
00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
and because of the covid-19 pandemic and
 
00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
a pretty significant reduction in many
 
00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
different case types we have used the
 
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:23.220 align:start position:0%
average of fiscal years 17 18 and 19 but
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
using those years of the circuit court
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
case volume is over 126 000 cases a year
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
in addition to that we have a number of
 
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:35.700 align:start position:0%
cases that are reopened and just in the
 
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
divorce parenting world that's another 3
 
00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
700 to 5400 cases a year that get added
 
00:13:44.569 --> 00:13:44.579 align:start position:0%
to our dockets
 
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:47.700 align:start position:0%
on the next slide uh what we show the
 
00:13:50.449 --> 00:13:50.459 align:start position:0%
number of Circuit Court judges and the
 
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:52.200 align:start position:0%
chief will explain the weighted caseload
 
00:13:55.009 --> 00:13:55.019 align:start position:0%
study but currently as of today we have
 
00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
41 full-time judges on the bench we have
 
00:14:01.009 --> 00:14:01.019 align:start position:0%
one full-time vacancy and we actually
 
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
have five part-time judges because judge
 
00:14:05.449 --> 00:14:05.459 align:start position:0%
Maloney just turned 70 and she's now a
 
00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:09.180 align:start position:0%
referee in addition to that we have
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
four senior active judges that we use
 
00:14:14.449 --> 00:14:14.459 align:start position:0%
from time to time who can work part-time
 
00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
those are Judges who have retired but
 
00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
are still under the age of 70. we have
 
00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
one marital master who is retired who
 
00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.250 align:start position:0%
one marital master who is retired who
still

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
sits occasionally and we have 12
 
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
retired judges who are over the age of
 
00:14:32.449 --> 00:14:32.459 align:start position:0%
70 that we still need in order to try to
 
00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:34.200 align:start position:0%
meet the caseload that we have because
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
we just don't have enough judges so 12
 
00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:39.300 align:start position:0%
judges over age 70 who are regularly
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
hearing cases as senior referees and
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
everything that that they do has to be
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
co-signed by a judge so it's not a real
 
00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
efficient use but we schedule in the
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court by judge days
 
00:14:56.569 --> 00:14:56.579 align:start position:0%
so if you take those 126 000 cases using
 
00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:58.740 align:start position:0%
the weighted caseload that translates to
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
16 352 judge days that we need to move
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
the volume of cases that we have
 
00:15:08.689 --> 00:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
for this year calendar year 2023 when we
 
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
put the judicial schedule together
 
00:15:12.889 --> 00:15:12.899 align:start position:0%
we were able to Cobble together ten
 
00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
thousand five hundred and eighteen days
 
00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:17.240 align:start position:0%
so that's all of the full-time judges
 
00:15:20.329 --> 00:15:20.339 align:start position:0%
that's the part-time judges we have five
 
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
part-time judges they sit anywhere from
 
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
a handful of days up to a couple hundred
 
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:28.740 align:start position:0%
days they tell us how many they are
 
00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:30.899 align:start position:0%
willing to do when we try to add a few
 
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
more to that
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
and then we take the senior active
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
judges and the referees War over 70 and
 
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
that all of those all in added up to ten
 
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
thousand five hundred and eighteen days
 
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
so you can see where where thousands of
 
00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
days short of scheduling what we need to
 
00:15:53.689 --> 00:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:56.329 --> 00:15:56.339 align:start position:0%
our other trial court is the superior
 
00:15:59.629 --> 00:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
court if you go to page 11 is a brief
 
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
description of the jurisdiction of the
 
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
Superior Court it is our court of
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
General jurisdiction it is the only
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
Court in our state which has conducts
 
00:16:09.949 --> 00:16:09.959 align:start position:0%
jury trials
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
uh it it has uh jurisdiction over all
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
felony crimes and all civil matters over
 
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
twenty five thousand dollars so a very
 
00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.050 align:start position:0%
twenty five thousand dollars so a very
wide

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:21.060 align:start position:0%
wide
 
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh range of jurisdiction on the next
 
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
slide you will see what
 
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
I'm sure is very familiar we have 11
 
00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
Superior Court locations in New
 
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:32.990 align:start position:0%
Superior Court locations in New
Hampshire

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
one in each County two in Hillsboro in
 
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
Manchester in Nashua
 
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
on slide 13 you will see the analog to
 
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:44.820 align:start position:0%
what you saw in slide 8 with the Circuit
 
00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:45.710 align:start position:0%
what you saw in slide 8 with the Circuit
Court

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
Court
 
00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:49.639 align:start position:0%
about 18 000 cases in superior court
 
00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:52.860 align:start position:0%
over the same period of time that judge
 
00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:54.899 align:start position:0%
king described and you can see the
 
00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
breakdown in the um in the in the
 
00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:01.860 align:start position:0%
graphic the largest cohort of cases are
 
00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
criminal cases
 
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
the next slide you will see our head
 
00:17:09.289 --> 00:17:09.299 align:start position:0%
count in Superior Court it has remained
 
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
unchanged uh since at least 2011 we have
 
00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
21 authorized judges and one chief
 
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:20.220 align:start position:0%
justice currently we were fully
 
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
accounted for in terms of judges no
 
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
so those are our true trial courts we
 
00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:31.020 align:start position:0%
have one Appellate Court in New
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that is the Supreme Court
 
00:17:36.049 --> 00:17:36.059 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court sits here in Concord and
 
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
on page 16.
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
you will see the justices of the Supreme
 
00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:43.220 align:start position:0%
Court there are four associate justices
 
00:17:47.409 --> 00:17:47.419 align:start position:0%
and one chief justice
 
00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
in addition to our duties and as
 
00:17:54.529 --> 00:17:54.539 align:start position:0%
appellate judges we serve as leaders of
 
00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:56.940 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch and the Chief
 
00:17:58.909 --> 00:17:58.919 align:start position:0%
Justice in particular has administrative
 
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for the judicial branch
 
00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:05.240 align:start position:0%
our duties include
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
overseeing issues such as attorney
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
discipline attorney emissions liaison
 
00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:11.820 align:start position:0%

and development of court rules
 
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
on the next slide slide 17 you will see
 
00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:21.260 align:start position:0%
our breakdown of cases it's about
 
00:18:26.289 --> 00:18:26.299 align:start position:0%
625 650 cases a year of that about
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
150 125 to 150
 
00:18:33.169 --> 00:18:33.179 align:start position:0%
receive full-blown oral arguments and
 
00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:35.700 align:start position:0%
and decisions that are reported in the
 
00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:37.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire reports I just came from a
 
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
day of oral argument to be over here we
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
hold them about four times four to six
 
00:18:44.529 --> 00:18:44.539 align:start position:0%
times a month
 
00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
the rest of our cases are all
 
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
handled there are five sets of eyes on
 
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:52.860 align:start position:0%
every single case that runs through our
 
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
court they're just disposed of in
 
00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
various different ways including by
 
00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
the next slide we are supported by the
 
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
administrative office of the courts
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
about 55 people who work there their
 
00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:11.900 align:start position:0%
location is over at one Granite place
 
00:19:15.289 --> 00:19:15.299 align:start position:0%
and they they provide support in terms
 
00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
of Information Technology Human
 
00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
Resources legal government relations
 
00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:24.980 align:start position:0%
that are back office support
 
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:28.980 align:start position:0%
and it's a fairly complex organization
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
as you've seen in our slides we have
 
00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:33.860 align:start position:0%
over 40 locations around New Hampshire
 
00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:39.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:45.049 --> 00:19:45.059 align:start position:0%
so let's begin the discussion of
 
00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
what what is called the way to caseload
 
00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:49.980 align:start position:0%
study and if you turn to page or slide
 
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.130 align:start position:0%
study and if you turn to page or slide
20

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
20
 
00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:55.390 align:start position:0%
20
um

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
of two legislatures ago judge king can
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
correct me uh this legislature
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
authorized uh appropriated funds for us
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
to undertake a way to caseload study a
 
00:20:11.049 --> 00:20:11.059 align:start position:0%
weighted caseload study is an
 
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:14.700 align:start position:0%
evidence-based analysis of how many
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
resources we need in terms of judges and
 
00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
case processing staff given our case
 
00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:23.750 align:start position:0%
case processing staff given our case
load

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
load
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
in a way to caseload study is in
 
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
contrast to other ways that that policy
 
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
makers may decide how to assign judicial
 
00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.730 align:start position:0%
makers may decide how to assign judicial
resources

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:33.740 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:37.559 align:start position:0%
but we feel this is the best most
 
00:20:37.559 --> 00:20:38.830 align:start position:0%
but we feel this is the best most
reliable

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
reliable
 
00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.570 align:start position:0%
reliable
evidence-based

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:40.580 align:start position:0%
evidence-based
 
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
means to do it and our feeling is backed
 
00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:48.299 align:start position:0%
up by legislation which was enacted in
 
00:20:48.299 --> 00:20:51.250 align:start position:0%
up by legislation which was enacted in
2005

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:51.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
which by which this legislature endorsed
 
00:20:57.529 --> 00:20:57.539 align:start position:0%
a way to caseload study one was
 
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
conducted in 2005 and then
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
um slide 21 talks about other methods
 
00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
that may be employed to determine how
 
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
many judges and Court staff we need
 
00:21:18.409 --> 00:21:18.419 align:start position:0%
population-based formulas for formal is
 
00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
based purely on the number of cases but
 
00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:21.650 align:start position:0%
based purely on the number of cases but
again

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
um in 490f Colon 11 this legislature has
 
00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:28.740 align:start position:0%
endorsed a weighted caseload study
 
00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
on slide 22 I
 
00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
the basic methodology the basic approach
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
is to take the number of cases determine
 
00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
a case weight and then determine how
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
many resources measured in core
 
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
personnel and judges are needed to make
 
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
our workload
 
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
this is the history of our weighted
 
00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:55.380 align:start position:0%
caseload study in New Hampshire as I
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned one was conducted in 2005 at
 
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
the time the trial courts had 482
 
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.409 align:start position:0%
the time the trial courts had 482
positions

00:22:02.409 --> 00:22:02.419 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
in 2022 when we conducted this study
 
00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
there were 514 positions
 
00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:13.580 align:start position:0%
do this study we on next slide
 
00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
slide 24 we retained the services of the
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
national Center for state courts the
 
00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
national Center for state courts is an
 
00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:25.559 align:start position:0%
extraordinary resource which serves all
 
00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
State and territorial courts in our
 
00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:28.810 align:start position:0%
State and territorial courts in our
country

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:28.820 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:32.220 align:start position:0%
and they have substantial experience and
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
expertise since in assisting
 
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions in doing way to caseload
 
00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
studies both for judges and staff so we
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
retained them to assist us with the
 
00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.909 align:start position:0%
retained them to assist us with the
study

00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
on the next slide slide 25
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
you will see a basic methodology or
 
00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
calculation for how a weighted caseload
 
00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
is determined for one of our case types
 
00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
small claims are heard in the Circuit
 
00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:02.990 align:start position:0%
small claims are heard in the Circuit
Court

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
Court
 
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
and you can see that if you look at the
 
00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
the chart on the right hand side of
 
00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
slide 25
 
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
during our survey period which was six
 
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
weeks at the beginning of last year
 
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
judges uh
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
recorded in court processing staff
 
00:23:28.669 --> 00:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
recorded 22 324 minutes
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:33.500 align:start position:0%
that they worked on small claims
 
00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:37.559 align:start position:0%
cases there were 29 days of collection
 
00:23:41.049 --> 00:23:41.059 align:start position:0%
during this period you divide those two
 
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
numbers and then multiply it by the
 
00:23:46.669 --> 00:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
number of judicial working days
 
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
and you have the Statewide annualized
 
00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
minutes for small claims cases
 
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
then you divide that
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
by the number of court filings for small
 
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
claims and you see that the case weight
 
00:24:06.909 --> 00:24:06.919 align:start position:0%
for this case type is 12.38 minutes
 
00:24:11.169 --> 00:24:11.179 align:start position:0%
which means on average a judge spends
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
12.38 minutes on a small claims case
 
00:24:18.169 --> 00:24:18.179 align:start position:0%
now is my colleagues will explain that's
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
an average I mean it's some or less some
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
are more small claims cases can if
 
00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
they're if they're settled no no time is
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
needed or recorded but that's the
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
average and it this this slide is simply
 
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate how we come up with a
 
00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
weighted case
 
00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.370 align:start position:0%
weighted case
number

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:41.810 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:41.820 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
is a
 
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
we needed data for each one of our case
 
00:24:51.529 --> 00:24:51.539 align:start position:0%
types and our staff and judges recorded
 
00:24:54.409 --> 00:24:54.419 align:start position:0%
the data as I said for 29 days at the
 
00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
beginning of last year
 
00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
and it was those that time that was the
 
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
essential data point that helped us
 
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
and led to our conclusions on page slide
 
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
27 you will see our Baseline staff for
 
00:25:18.169 --> 00:25:18.179 align:start position:0%
the weighted caseload study at the time
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
it was conducted
 
00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
broken down by judicial officers in
 
00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:25.799 align:start position:0%
various categories of staff
 
00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
on the circuit court side you will see
 
00:25:30.769 --> 00:25:30.779 align:start position:0%
that there are 44.32
 
00:25:33.289 --> 00:25:33.299 align:start position:0%
judicial officers included in the study
 
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
at the time I just want you to footnote
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
that because we'll come back to it and
 
00:25:37.679 --> 00:25:39.850 align:start position:0%
that because we'll come back to it and
explain

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:39.860 align:start position:0%
explain
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
explain that
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
number a little bit more in the context
 
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:51.169 --> 00:25:51.179 align:start position:0%
on the next slide you will see that we
 
00:25:54.049 --> 00:25:54.059 align:start position:0%
had extraordinary participation and
 
00:25:57.289 --> 00:25:57.299 align:start position:0%
therefore highly reliable data we had a
 
00:25:59.149 --> 00:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
hundred percent participation by our
 
00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
judges and our staff
 
00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
over 29 days so in addition to doing
 
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
performing their day-to-day function
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
functions and serving the people of our
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
state in our court system they were
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
recording the time on each one of the
 
00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
on slide 29 we summarize the results
 
00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.750 align:start position:0%
on slide 29 we summarize the results
um

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:31.940 align:start position:0%
the national Center found that we needed
 
00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.330 align:start position:0%
the national Center found that we needed
536

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:34.340 align:start position:0%
536
 
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
563.77 judicial officers and staff to
 
00:26:39.049 --> 00:26:39.059 align:start position:0%
process cases
 
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
in both of our trial courts and that's
 
00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
about 50 more positions than in our
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
current budget
 
00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
and of those broken down the Circuit
 
00:26:54.049 --> 00:26:54.059 align:start position:0%
Court needs were identified as an
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
additional 37 positions in Superior
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
Court an additional 12 positions both
 
00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
I want to uh if we could just go out of
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
order skip to slide 31.
 
00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
in addition the study
 
00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:22.860 align:start position:0%
tried to capture a very important data
 
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
source which is the reality in both of
 
00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:29.820 align:start position:0%
our trial courts is that clerks Deputy
 
00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
clerks and other managers are actually
 
00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
doing the work of our court Assistance
 
00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
or core process our case processing
 
00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:38.269 align:start position:0%
or core process our case processing
staff

00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:27:41.149 --> 00:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
and you can see that across both trial
 
00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
courts that
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
work that's impounded in our clerks and
 
00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:49.740 align:start position:0%
our Deputy clerks that should be with
 
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
court processing staff amounts to
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
57.3 positions in both of our trial
 
00:27:58.250 --> 00:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
courts broken down by about 40 in the
 
00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court in 17 and a half in the
 
00:28:03.769 --> 00:28:03.779 align:start position:0%
Superior Court
 
00:28:06.529 --> 00:28:06.539 align:start position:0%
so in addition to the numbers that we
 
00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
saw on page 29 these are also the
 
00:28:12.529 --> 00:28:12.539 align:start position:0%
reality of what we're dealing with we
 
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
have clerks and Deputy clerks who are
 
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:16.919 align:start position:0%
who are doing case processing work and
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's a key data point that we're able
 
00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:20.940 align:start position:0%
to capture
 
00:28:24.529 --> 00:28:24.539 align:start position:0%
oh on page 30
 
00:28:24.539 --> 00:28:26.029 align:start position:0%
oh on page 30
um

00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:26.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:31.149 --> 00:28:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
the basic conclusions of the national
 
00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
centers work for us which
 
00:28:39.409 --> 00:28:39.419 align:start position:0%
um in the Circuit Court in terms of
 
00:28:39.419 --> 00:28:41.330 align:start position:0%
um in the Circuit Court in terms of
judges

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
judges
 
00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.010 align:start position:0%
judges
um

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:44.570 align:start position:0%
um
we

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:45.789 align:start position:0%
we
require

00:28:45.789 --> 00:28:45.799 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
21.35 additional judges
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
but I want you to footnote that we'll
 
00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
come back to it and you can see the
 
00:28:55.789 --> 00:28:55.799 align:start position:0%
breakdown among staff in Superior Court
 
00:28:58.130 --> 00:28:58.140 align:start position:0%
three and a half new judges
 
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
and for the most part additional staff
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
is needed
 
00:29:13.549 --> 00:29:13.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:16.860 align:start position:0%
so page 32 I'm going to ask judge king
 
00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
page 32 level sets the
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
the number of judges
 
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
that the national Center identified with
 
00:29:33.409 --> 00:29:33.419 align:start position:0%
the reality of judicial resources
 
00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
available to us because the national
 
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
Center did not capture the work of some
 
00:29:42.289 --> 00:29:42.299 align:start position:0%
of our per diem or of our per diem
 
00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:46.700 align:start position:0%
judges and this chart explains
 
00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
explains that
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
so this page actually shows what we had
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
available to us at the during that six
 
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
week period of data collection on the
 
00:29:59.149 --> 00:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
ground in the circuit court so we had at
 
00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
that time 40 full-time judges we still
 
00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
had one marital Master we had a
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
full-time child support referee which
 
00:30:09.049 --> 00:30:09.059 align:start position:0%
was counted as a judge a part-time child
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
support referee
 
00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
and then we have we had two we now have
 
00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:16.980 align:start position:0%
one holdover salaried district court
 
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
judges so these were judges that were
 
00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
appointed before the Circuit Court was
 
00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
created were appointed to a specific
 
00:30:24.769 --> 00:30:24.779 align:start position:0%
court for example the Portsmouth
 
00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
District Court they are still considered
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
a salary judge and they received the
 
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
salary by Statute for that Court to
 
00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
which they were appointed until they
 
00:30:37.549 --> 00:30:37.559 align:start position:0%
retire or they turned 70. that's just
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
unless they become a full-time judge so
 
00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:41.820 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit of a one-off for us we
 
00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
have to take the weighted caseload for
 
00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:44.940 align:start position:0%
that court and then do the math and
 
00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
that's how their salaries are calculated
 
00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.430 align:start position:0%
that's how their salaries are calculated
um

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:51.529 --> 00:30:51.539 align:start position:0%
and then there were adjustments made to
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
that for
 
00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.330 align:start position:0%
that for
um

00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
there were two authorized full-time
 
00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
judges in addition to that one marital
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
Master had retired and one of the two
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
salary judges had retired and we added a
 
00:31:09.529 --> 00:31:09.539 align:start position:0%
full-time probate referee just about
 
00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
exactly when we were doing the study
 
00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:13.980 align:start position:0%
which was authorized by the legislature
 
00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:16.559 align:start position:0%
to be able to process our electronically
 
00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:19.559 align:start position:0%
filed Estates thereby kind of freeing up
 
00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:22.860 align:start position:0%
a judge from doing that work
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
and if you get to the bottom line that
 
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
so one on slide 30 the national Center
 
00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:40.940 align:start position:0%
had identified
 
00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
21.35 additional judges once you true it
 
00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
up the real number as as judge king just
 
00:31:51.669 --> 00:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
explained that the number is
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
17.32 additional judges needed that is
 
00:31:57.169 --> 00:31:57.179 align:start position:0%
the bottom line of the study in the
 
00:31:59.630 --> 00:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court three and a half judges in
 
00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court
 
00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
now I'm going to ask both of my
 
00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
colleagues if they want to explain what
 
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
the consequences of not having adequate
 
00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:16.140 align:start position:0%
an adequate number of judges in court
 
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
processing staff are in terms of the
 
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
reality of their the caseload in circuit
 
00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
court and basically how cases are
 
00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.490 align:start position:0%
court and basically how cases are
triaged

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:27.500 align:start position:0%
triaged
 
00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'll take a stab at that Chief
 
00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
um as I said earlier in my comments the
 
00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:36.539 align:start position:0%
weighted caseload
 
00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:40.820 align:start position:0%
calls for 16 352
 
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
judge days for 2023 to move the number
 
00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:49.140 align:start position:0%
of cases and we we can break that down
 
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
by case type but there are a lot of
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
cases that this legislature has told us
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
have to be resolved in certain time
 
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
frames so our landlord tenant cases our
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
abuse neglect cases our juvenile
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
delinquency cases some guardianship
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
cases civil protection orders uh chins
 
00:33:12.409 --> 00:33:12.419 align:start position:0%
termination of parental rights that's a
 
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
big chunk of what we do and even during
 
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
the covid-19 pandemic we were required
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
by Statute to get those cases resolved
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
in the time frames that you set for us
 
00:33:24.049 --> 00:33:24.059 align:start position:0%
and we were able to do that we didn't
 
00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
miss a deadline we had some exceptions
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
for landlord tenant by Court rule
 
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
um but there are a number of cases that
 
00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
there just are not enough judges on the
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
bench to get to and those are the cases
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
that you're hearing from your
 
00:33:42.049 --> 00:33:42.059 align:start position:0%
constituents that aren't moving as
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
quickly as they should and we do not
 
00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:47.700 align:start position:0%
dispute that they are absolutely right
 
00:33:50.269 --> 00:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
um there are criminal cases that involve
 
00:33:52.669 --> 00:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
non-incarcerated defendants that it's
 
00:33:54.649 --> 00:33:54.659 align:start position:0%
taking longer than we would like to get
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
scheduled for trial and certainly in the
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
divorce parenting Arena we're not
 
00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:01.140 align:start position:0%
getting to those cases nearly as quickly
 
00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:02.580 align:start position:0%
as we would like those are the kinds of
 
00:34:05.389 --> 00:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
cases that don't have statutorily
 
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
dictated deadlines and so we triage the
 
00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
cases that we have to reach and there's
 
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
got to be some slippage somewhere and
 
00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
it's primarily in non-incarcerated
 
00:34:17.629 --> 00:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
defendants small claims in civil cases
 
00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
and in the divorce parenting cases in
 
00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
order to meet our deadlines we would
 
00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:24.540 align:start position:0%
need the judges that the weighted
 
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
caseload study says that we need so I
 
00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:28.919 align:start position:0%
think I'm really proud that our judges
 
00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
are doing as as well as they are doing
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
they work nights and weekends to try to
 
00:34:35.089 --> 00:34:35.099 align:start position:0%
stay on top of things but there is
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
definitely a gap and we are not reaching
 
00:34:40.609 --> 00:34:40.619 align:start position:0%
the time to disposition in all of our
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
cases in the fashion that we would like
 
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
to or
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
being perfectly upfront about that I've
 
00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:47.460 align:start position:0%
talked to both chairman about that and
 
00:34:49.849 --> 00:34:49.859 align:start position:0%
it's not a mystery
 
00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
judge Garner can probably talk about how
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
so I was here a couple of months ago I
 
00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:03.060 align:start position:0%
think to be introduced to the children
 
00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
and family law section it's nice of you
 
00:35:06.589 --> 00:35:06.599 align:start position:0%
to have me back again I'm glad to be
 
00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:07.640 align:start position:0%
back again
 
00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
just by way of introduction I'm a
 
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:11.820 align:start position:0%
circuit court judge I've been a judge
 
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
for about seven years I sit in Laconia
 
00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
almost all of the time
 
00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
and I'm as a circuit court judge trained
 
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
to do all three of the divisions probate
 
00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:23.940 align:start position:0%
district and family
 
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
as it happens we have more work in the
 
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
Family Division than in District and so
 
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
my week typically is two or three days
 
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
of Family Division maybe one or two days
 
00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
of District division the occasional
 
00:35:40.609 --> 00:35:40.619 align:start position:0%
probate division assignment my family
 
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
days are typically either a full day
 
00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
contested one hearing case that's been
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
pending for a while or a list day which
 
00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
is typically 30-minute hearings back to
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
back beginning at 8 30 and ending at
 
00:35:55.849 --> 00:35:55.859 align:start position:0%
four o'clock with the lunch hour if I
 
00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
can conjure that up somewhere
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
let me just add to what judge king was
 
00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
saying in terms of our triaging on the
 
00:36:05.089 --> 00:36:05.099 align:start position:0%
micro level
 
00:36:08.089 --> 00:36:08.099 align:start position:0%
we have a divorce and parenting cases
 
00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:09.900 align:start position:0%
which have an enormous spectrum of
 
00:36:12.349 --> 00:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
complexity some of those cases are
 
00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:14.940 align:start position:0%
resolved virtually at the time that
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
they're filed and it's simply a question
 
00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:18.900 align:start position:0%
of reviewing the paperwork making sure
 
00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
the forms are in order and approving it
 
00:36:22.609 --> 00:36:22.619 align:start position:0%
sending it out
 
00:36:25.069 --> 00:36:25.079 align:start position:0%
some of those are cases which begin in
 
00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
difficult ways and go through a series
 
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
of hearings that may be prompted by
 
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
emergency motions or other features
 
00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
unique to the case
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
May ultimately end up with full day or
 
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes multi-day final hearings that
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
involve multiple Witnesses
 
00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
there may be a guardian that Litem
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
involved there may be contested
 
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
parenting issues contested Financial
 
00:36:49.849 --> 00:36:49.859 align:start position:0%
issues alimony support property
 
00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
distribution all of that may be
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
supported by exhibits which in my recent
 
00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
experience tend to be expanding rather
 
00:36:59.210 --> 00:36:59.220 align:start position:0%
than Contracting
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
and so those cases those complex divorce
 
00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
and parenting cases are a little bit
 
00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
unpredictable we don't know which cases
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
are going to turn into that when they're
 
00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:09.780 align:start position:0%
first filed we don't have much control
 
00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:11.220 align:start position:0%
over that
 
00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:13.740 align:start position:0%
our triage process though on the micro
 
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
level on a daily basis is really
 
00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:17.870 align:start position:0%
level on a daily basis is really
threefold

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
threefold
 
00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
we have emergency motions that are filed
 
00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:24.300 align:start position:0%
every day again unpredictably either in
 
00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
divorce parenting cases when there's an
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
emergency that prompts one party to come
 
00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
to court and ask for immediate orders or
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
in domestic violence petition sorts of
 
00:37:33.359 --> 00:37:34.550 align:start position:0%
in domestic violence petition sorts of
cases

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
in Laconia we get 350 more or less
 
00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
domestic violence petitions every year
 
00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:42.780 align:start position:0%
it's unpredictable for us when those
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
cases are going to come in although we
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
inexperienced know that Friday afternoon
 
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
and Monday mornings tend to be the times
 
00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
but every day we're going to get
 
00:37:54.829 --> 00:37:54.839 align:start position:0%
emergency motions that are filed those
 
00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:57.660 align:start position:0%
motions are reviewed by a judge every
 
00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:58.849 align:start position:0%
motions are reviewed by a judge every
day

00:37:58.849 --> 00:37:58.859 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
not a single one of those cases comes in
 
00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:04.140 align:start position:0%
and lacks review by a judge and a
 
00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:06.180 align:start position:0%
decision by a judge whether to Grant an
 
00:38:08.329 --> 00:38:08.339 align:start position:0%
emergency protective order or emergency
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
relief and from time to time because our
 
00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
protocols allow and require for a
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
hearing for the party who has been
 
00:38:19.329 --> 00:38:19.339 align:start position:0%
denied relief when they first come in
 
00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:21.780 align:start position:0%
occasionally those motions and those
 
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
filings result in the need for having a
 
00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
hearing that day
 
00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:28.140 align:start position:0%
that's pretty rare but it happens
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
regularly enough that it's worth
 
00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:31.980 align:start position:0%
mentioning so that's the overlay to our
 
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
daily work otherwise our daily work is
 
00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:37.380 align:start position:0%
managing the cases that have to be
 
00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:39.060 align:start position:0%
scheduled according to the statutory
 
00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
deadlines that judge king mentioned
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
those cases have to be scheduled they
 
00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:44.460 align:start position:0%
have to be heard and the orders have to
 
00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
be entered within the certain statutory
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
deadlines and behind those come our
 
00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
cases without statutory deadlines and of
 
00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
varying levels of complexity so my day
 
00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:00.660 align:start position:0%
is going to be either one or the other
 
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
typically in Family Division it's either
 
00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:06.660 align:start position:0%
a list a or a full day or more than one
 
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
full day of final hearings and in the
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
middle I'm going to get a Sprinkle of
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
emergency motions that are filed as the
 
00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
day goes by and I have to carve out time
 
00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
to make orders on those cases
 
00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:19.500 align:start position:0%
so our triage is basically emergency
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
cases cases that have statutory
 
00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:23.940 align:start position:0%
deadlines that may be creeping up on us
 
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
and the divorce and parenting cases that
 
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
don't have statutory deadlines and
 
00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
that's simply how we manage it day to
 
00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
day in the Family Division and to a
 
00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:37.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:42.109 --> 00:39:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:44.820 align:start position:0%
even even if our judicial head count
 
00:39:47.329 --> 00:39:47.339 align:start position:0%
were where it needed to be in terms of
 
00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
the way to caseload
 
00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
we would not be adequately serving the
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire the people of
 
00:39:56.089 --> 00:39:56.099 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire if we did not augment our
 
00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:57.300 align:start position:0%
court staff
 
00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
and uh I'd like to have judge king talk
 
00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.270 align:start position:0%
and uh I'd like to have judge king talk
about

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
the pressures that we are facing like
 
00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
every other employer in our state with
 
00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:09.900 align:start position:0%
respect to current vacancies and the
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
effects that that has on our ability to
 
00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.270 align:start position:0%
effects that that has on our ability to
to

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.890 align:start position:0%
to
um

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
for for the judges to do their jobs and
 
00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:20.820 align:start position:0%
for the people to um
 
00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
receive receive the services that that
 
00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:29.900 align:start position:0%
so needless to say during the pandemic
 
00:40:34.609 --> 00:40:34.619 align:start position:0%
we averaged about 70 to 75 percent of
 
00:40:37.849 --> 00:40:37.859 align:start position:0%
our staff showing up on any given day
 
00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:40.380 align:start position:0%
that was a tremendous pressure now that
 
00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
we're sort of on the back side of that
 
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
our biggest challenge is that we're just
 
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
not competitive the judicial branch is
 
00:40:49.609 --> 00:40:49.619 align:start position:0%
not competitive with starting wages our
 
00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
starting wage for a quarter system two
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
which is an entry level position is
 
00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:57.180 align:start position:0%
around 15 an hour uh after union dues I
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
think it's a it's 14 and change we
 
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
currently as of this morning have 39
 
00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
full-time vacant staff positions most of
 
00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
which have been posted for an extended
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
period of time three just in the Concord
 
00:41:13.849 --> 00:41:13.859 align:start position:0%
circuit court court assistant threes
 
00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
which are not entry levels those are the
 
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
next step up that we we just haven't
 
00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
even had any applications for people
 
00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
aren't applying to Workforce at those
 
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
wages so today we have 37 full-time
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
vacant positions and three part-time
 
00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
vacant positions out of 359 total
 
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
positions so even at the positions that
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
are authorized notwithstanding that the
 
00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:35.460 align:start position:0%
weighted caseload study reflects that we
 
00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:38.460 align:start position:0%
need another 30 30 plus we have more
 
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
than 10 percent of our seats that are
 
00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:44.700 align:start position:0%
vacant and absent some relief in the
 
00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:47.820 align:start position:0%
budget for our wage restructuring
 
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
they're going to continue to be vacant
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
and if we don't have staff to process
 
00:41:53.329 --> 00:41:53.339 align:start position:0%
the orders and get them out it's one
 
00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:54.900 align:start position:0%
thing for a judge to hold a hearing sign
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
the order you may see another two to
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
three weeks before that order gets out
 
00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:01.079 align:start position:0%
the door because we don't have staff to
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
process and I'm sure you've heard from
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
from constituents that that's the case
 
00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:07.380 align:start position:0%
and that's our reality and our staff
 
00:42:10.609 --> 00:42:10.619 align:start position:0%
work really really hard
 
00:42:10.619 --> 00:42:11.210 align:start position:0%
work really really hard
um

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:11.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
and we offer great benefits but we're
 
00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:15.660 align:start position:0%
finding that the the Millennials don't
 
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
care about health insurance because
 
00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
they're probably on their parents health
 
00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
insurance or they're not going to get
 
00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
sick anyway so they don't need health
 
00:42:23.569 --> 00:42:23.579 align:start position:0%
insurance they just want to know what am
 
00:42:25.069 --> 00:42:25.079 align:start position:0%
I going to be paid an hour and we have
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
literally lost folks who have gone to
 
00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
Dunkin Donuts and fast food restaurants
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
because they pay more an hour that's
 
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
so finally page slide 34 is a summary of
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
part of our budget request that is in
 
00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
reflects what we learn from our
 
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
evidence-based way to caseload
 
00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
as to judges you will see that of the 17
 
00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:57.660 align:start position:0%
you'll recall
 
00:43:00.589 --> 00:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
judges that the study identified we've
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
requested seven in in the superior court
 
00:43:06.589 --> 00:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
of the three and a half uh judges that
 
00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
were identified as needed we've
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
requested one in terms of Court staff 31
 
00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:14.780 align:start position:0%
new clerical staff in the Circuit Court
 
00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
in one new clerk in the circuit court
 
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:20.700 align:start position:0%
and in the Superior Court 4 News
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
so that is a summary the way the
 
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
caseload study I'm now going to ask
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
judge king to give a breakdown of some
 
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
statistics relating to the Family
 
00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:38.329 align:start position:0%
statistics relating to the Family
Division

00:43:38.329 --> 00:43:38.339 align:start position:0%
Division
 
00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not sure what the Committees
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
want to hear so I'm happy to not do
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
anything I put together a few statistics
 
00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:45.660 align:start position:0%
that I thought you might find
 
00:43:48.109 --> 00:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
interesting I've already mentioned the
 
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
the volume of cases the and those are in
 
00:43:52.809 --> 00:43:52.819 align:start position:0%
the slides
 
00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:56.940 align:start position:0%
I want to make the point that
 
00:43:59.390 --> 00:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
I've already talked about the turnover
 
00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:03.780 align:start position:0%
in judges but 25 of our full-time judges
 
00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:06.900 align:start position:0%
have been appointed since 2018 so more
 
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
than half our bench has been on the
 
00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
bench less than five years so these are
 
00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:11.700 align:start position:0%
Judges that are still in the process of
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
learning to be judges some of them have
 
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
come to us as prosecutors some have come
 
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
from various law practices and they have
 
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
to be trained as judge Garner said to
 
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
learn the breadth of the jurisdiction in
 
00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:25.079 align:start position:0%
the circuit court so that they're
 
00:44:26.329 --> 00:44:26.339 align:start position:0%
fungible and we can move them from
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
location to location
 
00:44:28.319 --> 00:44:29.150 align:start position:0%
location to location
um

00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
the judges are often in the courtrooms
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
kind of on their own in the circuit
 
00:44:35.809 --> 00:44:35.819 align:start position:0%
court if you go to a superior court
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
you'll see a court monitor which is the
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
person who's with the judge responsible
 
00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
to make sure the record's running
 
00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
properly and has headphones on to make
 
00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
sure everything's functional
 
00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
our judges are often responsible for
 
00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:51.180 align:start position:0%
turning the recorders on and off which
 
00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
are not located on the bench they're
 
00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
somewhere else or the court security
 
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
officers turn them on or off we we don't
 
00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
have court monitors and our judges don't
 
00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:00.660 align:start position:0%
have law Clerks so in the Superior Court
 
00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
in the Supreme Court there are a law
 
00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:05.940 align:start position:0%
clerks who are lawyers who assist with
 
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
writing orders doing research our judges
 
00:45:11.089 --> 00:45:11.099 align:start position:0%
are on their own to do that we have
 
00:45:13.089 --> 00:45:13.099 align:start position:0%
three staff attorneys to service roughly
 
00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
60 judicial officers in the circuit
 
00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
court and so you can expect that they
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of time to be sitting
 
00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
in on hearings and helping to write
 
00:45:25.069 --> 00:45:25.079 align:start position:0%
orders when the pandemic started and we
 
00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:29.060 align:start position:0%
moved to more remote hearings our
 
00:45:31.849 --> 00:45:31.859 align:start position:0%
costs for telephone was going through
 
00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
the roof and so we immediately began to
 
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
track the number of hearings and the
 
00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:37.740 align:start position:0%
number of remote hearings and I thought
 
00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
you might find this statistic
 
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
interesting since mid-march of 2020 in
 
00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:44.940 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court as of the end of
 
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
February Circuit Court judges have
 
00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
conducted 469 532 hearings
 
00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
of those two hundred and two thousand
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
four hundred and twenty three had at
 
00:45:58.670 --> 00:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
least one party who participated
 
00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
remotely either by telephone or by video
 
00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:03.900 align:start position:0%
so about 43 percent but almost 470 000
 
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
hearings since March of 2020.
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
most of the folks who come to the
 
00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court don't have attorneys we
 
00:46:13.609 --> 00:46:13.619 align:start position:0%
call them self-represented litigants
 
00:46:16.849 --> 00:46:16.859 align:start position:0%
about 85 percent of parenting divorce
 
00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:18.660 align:start position:0%
cases have at least one unrepresented
 
00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:19.490 align:start position:0%
cases have at least one unrepresented
party

00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
party
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
that has its own challenges
 
00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:24.780 align:start position:0%
and of all of the appeals that the
 
00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court gets about 30 percent of
 
00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
the total number come out of the Family
 
00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:30.470 align:start position:0%
the total number come out of the Family
Division

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
Division
 
00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
so it's a small number in terms of the
 
00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:34.980 align:start position:0%
gross number of cases but a lot of those
 
00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:39.060 align:start position:0%
cases get appealed and 40 or so of those
 
00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:42.300 align:start position:0%
are termination of parental rights cases
 
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
judge Garner talked about some cases
 
00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:48.300 align:start position:0%
move quickly some take longer in 2014 we
 
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
had some law students for the summer and
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
we wanted to try to see if we could come
 
00:46:55.609 --> 00:46:55.619 align:start position:0%
up with data points that were common
 
00:46:57.890 --> 00:46:57.900 align:start position:0%
across divorce parenting cases that
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
caused them to be open longer than a
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
year so we looked at all of the cases
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
that were disposed between January and
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
December of 2014 which was 7 500 cases
 
00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:12.970 align:start position:0%
December of 2014 which was 7 500 cases
roughly

00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:12.980 align:start position:0%
roughly
 
00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
of those cases 50 percent closed within
 
00:47:18.349 --> 00:47:18.359 align:start position:0%
three months so from the time the case
 
00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:20.540 align:start position:0%
was open the time it closed three months
 
00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
seventy percent were closed within six
 
00:47:26.089 --> 00:47:26.099 align:start position:0%
months 80 percent within nine months and
 
00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
87 percent were closed within a year and
 
00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:31.020 align:start position:0%
that's sort of our goal with a new
 
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
divorce cases from open to disposition
 
00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
is a year we hope that more than 90
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
percent close within that time frame
 
00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:39.890 align:start position:0%
percent close within that time frame
um

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
most cases get resolved fairly quickly
 
00:47:43.849 --> 00:47:43.859 align:start position:0%
in the Family Division
 
00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
so there are some that don't and that go
 
00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
on for years there are some cases that
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
have hundreds and hundreds of pleadings
 
00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:51.300 align:start position:0%
those are the cases that I think you've
 
00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
been hearing about in some of those in
 
00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
your committees and that's just the
 
00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:56.460 align:start position:0%
reality of the circuit court it's not
 
00:47:58.730 --> 00:47:58.740 align:start position:0%
one size doesn't fit all
 
00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:00.950 align:start position:0%
one size doesn't fit all
um

00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
so I think those are the numbers I
 
00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman to anticipate another area
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
of Interest based on our conversation I
 
00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
know Rules of Evidence and evidentiary
 
00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
issues in Family Division has been a
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
concern to to the Committees so I would
 
00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:22.140 align:start position:0%
like to ask judge Garner to discuss that
 
00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:24.540 align:start position:0%
if that's appropriate yes thank you
 
00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:35.460 align:start position:0%
we think in terms of admissibility of
 
00:48:38.809 --> 00:48:38.819 align:start position:0%
evidence and really that just means
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
what is the court allowed to consider
 
00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:42.900 align:start position:0%
what is the court not going to consider
 
00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
in terms of being a gatekeeper for what
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
we hope is going to be reliable evidence
 
00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:50.089 align:start position:0%
we hope is going to be reliable evidence
the

00:48:50.089 --> 00:48:50.099 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:52.140 align:start position:0%
question of the Rules of Evidence in
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
Family Division is as I understand the
 
00:48:58.250 --> 00:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
subject of some proposed legislation so
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
let me try to give you a background and
 
00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
if you'll indulge me I'll give you some
 
00:49:05.809 --> 00:49:05.819 align:start position:0%
perspective in terms of what the reasons
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
might be
 
00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
that might cause you to think carefully
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
about that sort of a proposal
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
currently the rules of evidence and I
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
brought my book with me it's a desk copy
 
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
that they give us we all have it
 
00:49:24.349 --> 00:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
as lawyers we were trained in it from
 
00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
law school and it is for those of us who
 
00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:30.660 align:start position:0%
hear a lot of District division cases
 
00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
criminal cases particularly everyone in
 
00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
Superior Court
 
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
they live by the rules of evidence it's
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
a daily thing for them in Family
 
00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:39.470 align:start position:0%
a daily thing for them in Family
Division

00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
Division
 
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
it's not so much that way and
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
particularly in domestic relations cases
 
00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:45.900 align:start position:0%
which are divorce parenting support
 
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:47.720 align:start position:0%
cases paternity
 
00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
and I can lump domestic violence cases
 
00:49:52.849 --> 00:49:52.859 align:start position:0%
in with that the Rules of Evidence don't
 
00:49:52.859 --> 00:49:54.170 align:start position:0%
in with that the Rules of Evidence don't
apply

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:54.180 align:start position:0%
apply
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
and the Authority for that is a series
 
00:49:58.609 --> 00:49:58.619 align:start position:0%
of Supreme Court decisions that actually
 
00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
go back at least 80 years
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
and so there's a culture that these
 
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
sorts of cases do not receive the strict
 
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
treatment of the Rules of Evidence in
 
00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:09.300 align:start position:0%
terms of the judge's decision whether to
 
00:50:11.089 --> 00:50:11.099 align:start position:0%
admit certain evidence
 
00:50:13.609 --> 00:50:13.619 align:start position:0%
or certain other kinds of evidence we
 
00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
have discretion
 
00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:17.240 align:start position:0%
the Family Division rules
 
00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
carry on that that feature of our
 
00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
practice that the Rules of Evidence
 
00:50:24.109 --> 00:50:24.119 align:start position:0%
don't strictly apply but the Family
 
00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
Division rules it's a rule 2.2 also
 
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
provide that the trial judge in their
 
00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:33.180 align:start position:0%
discretion can utilize The Rules of
 
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
Evidence in order to create an orderly
 
00:50:38.569 --> 00:50:38.579 align:start position:0%
predictable and fair kind of a
 
00:50:42.109 --> 00:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
proceeding so that's available to us
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
in addition The Rules of Evidence
 
00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
themselves carry a long list of
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
exemptions under rule 1101 and among
 
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
those exemptions from The Rules of
 
00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:55.740 align:start position:0%
Evidence are Domestic Relations cases so
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
that's the current law The Rules of
 
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
Evidence don't apply the court in in
 
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:03.900 align:start position:0%
some cases can use them but I would
 
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
suggest only consistent with an
 
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
agreement if there are attorneys
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
typically representing both sides
 
00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:12.300 align:start position:0%
because the Rules of Evidence are
 
00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:13.490 align:start position:0%
because the Rules of Evidence are
complicated

00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:16.020 align:start position:0%
and their application is often highly
 
00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:17.030 align:start position:0%
and their application is often highly
technical

00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
technical
 
00:51:21.049 --> 00:51:21.059 align:start position:0%
and the results are not always intuitive
 
00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:22.980 align:start position:0%
this makes them a challenge for folks
 
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
who are representing themselves and it
 
00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:26.700 align:start position:0%
makes it a challenge for folks who are
 
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
represented by an attorney with a
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
self-represented litigant on the other
 
00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.270 align:start position:0%
self-represented litigant on the other
side

00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
side
 
00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:34.430 align:start position:0%
side
so

00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
the cases that tell us that the Rules of
 
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
Evidence don't apply in these kinds of
 
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
cases don't embellish much about the
 
00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
reasons why that should be
 
00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:47.700 align:start position:0%
but I'll share with you my perspective
 
00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:49.740 align:start position:0%
based on my experience about what those
 
00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
reasons might be
 
00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
first are the rules of evidence are
 
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
really a tool for trial lawyers
 
00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
they're a tool to create a reliable
 
00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
gatekeeping process so that the fact
 
00:52:07.069 --> 00:52:07.079 align:start position:0%
finder typically a jury in those cases
 
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
have reliable evidence to consider and
 
00:52:12.049 --> 00:52:12.059 align:start position:0%
don't have unreliable evidence
 
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
trial lawyers live by the rules of
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
evidence judges in jury courts and
 
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559 align:start position:0%
judges in criminal cases including
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
judges in the district Division and
 
00:52:23.089 --> 00:52:23.099 align:start position:0%
circuit court apply the Rules of
 
00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:25.380 align:start position:0%
Evidence have to be careful about them
 
00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:30.300 align:start position:0%
and take that obligation very seriously
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
there are no juries in circuit court and
 
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
there are no juries in the Family
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
Division in circuit court and so at
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
least that part of it isn't really
 
00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:38.630 align:start position:0%
least that part of it isn't really
necessary

00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
Family Division cases and I'm thinking
 
00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:43.980 align:start position:0%
mostly now Domestic Relations divorce
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
and parenting cases also have a couple
 
00:52:48.370 --> 00:52:48.380 align:start position:0%
of unique features that I think
 
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
undermine the reason that might support
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
applying the rules of evidence in a
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
strict way the first of these is that
 
00:52:57.470 --> 00:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
our court
 
00:53:00.349 --> 00:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
tries its best to make our process user
 
00:53:02.569 --> 00:53:02.579 align:start position:0%
friendly for those who are coming to
 
00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
court for orders
 
00:53:07.329 --> 00:53:07.339 align:start position:0%
and tries its best to make the process
 
00:53:11.569 --> 00:53:11.579 align:start position:0%
as non-adversarial as possible partly
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
because often these folks who are in
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
front of the court on day one are going
 
00:53:18.049 --> 00:53:18.059 align:start position:0%
to have parenting responsibilities for
 
00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:21.180 align:start position:0%
children after the case is over and we
 
00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:23.220 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that as difficult as
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
that case is for them we don't make it
 
00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
more difficult by imposing on them
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
certain procedural strictures that they
 
00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
may be unable to meet and that may
 
00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:36.300 align:start position:0%
generate a result that at least they
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
will feel at some level wasn't a fair
 
00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:40.140 align:start position:0%
result because of the application of
 
00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
these rules
 
00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:43.309 align:start position:0%
these rules
finally

00:53:43.309 --> 00:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
finally
 
00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
divorce and parenting cases often take
 
00:53:46.559 --> 00:53:47.750 align:start position:0%
divorce and parenting cases often take
um

00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
often obligate the court to take into
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
account what's going to happen in the
 
00:53:52.559 --> 00:53:53.390 align:start position:0%

future
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
if we're going to create a property
 
00:53:58.250 --> 00:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
distribution or alimony or certainly
 
00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
parenting orders that are going to be in
 
00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:02.280 align:start position:0%

00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:02.990 align:start position:0%

on

00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:54:05.450 --> 00:54:05.460 align:start position:0%
we have to take a Long View in terms of
 
00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:07.559 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen what are the
 
00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
likelihoods what are the parents parties
 
00:54:13.069 --> 00:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
expectations and planning for that sort
 
00:54:14.809 --> 00:54:14.819 align:start position:0%
of a thing really doesn't have much to
 
00:54:17.569 --> 00:54:17.579 align:start position:0%
do with what actually happened the Rules
 
00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:19.980 align:start position:0%
of Evidence are designed to provide
 
00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
reliable evidence about what actually
 
00:54:24.829 --> 00:54:24.839 align:start position:0%
happened and that certainly is part of
 
00:54:26.569 --> 00:54:26.579 align:start position:0%
what we have to do but it's not the
 
00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:28.980 align:start position:0%
whole picture in these kinds of cases we
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
have to take into account some planning
 
00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
element for the future for these parties
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
lives that are being deconstructed and
 
00:54:37.849 --> 00:54:37.859 align:start position:0%
rearranged by this process
 
00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:40.140 align:start position:0%
and the Rules of Evidence aren't
 
00:54:42.589 --> 00:54:42.599 align:start position:0%
necessarily helpful for them we want to
 
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
give the parties the opportunity to tell
 
00:54:47.690 --> 00:54:47.700 align:start position:0%
us what their concerns are to develop a
 
00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
plan for the future and to provide
 
00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
evidence that would support that plan
 
00:54:53.569 --> 00:54:53.579 align:start position:0%
not necessarily evidence that would be
 
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
reliable to a fact finder but evidence
 
00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:57.839 align:start position:0%
it would be reliable for someone who's
 
00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
planning the future of this family in
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
one way or another judge excuse me for a
 
00:55:05.809 --> 00:55:05.819 align:start position:0%
minute being passed around to some cards
 
00:55:07.849 --> 00:55:07.859 align:start position:0%
for members of the two committees if
 
00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
they have questions as well for them to
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
write them down and then when you have
 
00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
please send them back and chairman Lynn
 
00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
is sorting them by question type sorry
 
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
sir carry on wonderful thank you and I
 
00:55:23.450 --> 00:55:23.460 align:start position:0%
might add too that um
 
00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
Richard has my email so if you think of
 
00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
something after the hearing that you
 
00:55:29.329 --> 00:55:29.339 align:start position:0%
think I can weigh in on in terms of our
 
00:55:32.329 --> 00:55:32.339 align:start position:0%
practice or our challenges or a court
 
00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:34.140 align:start position:0%
process please let him know he'll send
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
it on to me I'll be more than happy to
 
00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.790 align:start position:0%
it on to me I'll be more than happy to
respond

00:55:37.790 --> 00:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
respond
 
00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:44.930 align:start position:0%
respond
then

00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
there are some practical reasons I think
 
00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
that the imposition of the Rules of
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
Evidence might be of some concern to
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
those of us who hear these sorts of
 
00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
cases in Family Division
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
particularly if you have a situation
 
00:55:58.970 --> 00:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
where one party is represented by
 
00:56:00.589 --> 00:56:00.599 align:start position:0%
Council and the other party is not
 
00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:03.180 align:start position:0%
represented by Council beside this
 
00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
represented is going to start out with
 
00:56:06.829 --> 00:56:06.839 align:start position:0%
some Advantage there if the Rules of
 
00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
Evidence are being applied an attorney
 
00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
May well have an obligation to their
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
client to try to take advantage of the
 
00:56:15.170 --> 00:56:15.180 align:start position:0%
rules of evidence to the extent possible
 
00:56:17.329 --> 00:56:17.339 align:start position:0%
that's part of our adversarial system
 
00:56:19.130 --> 00:56:19.140 align:start position:0%
and there's nothing wrong with that
 
00:56:22.609 --> 00:56:22.619 align:start position:0%
unless one party is so disadvantaged by
 
00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:25.140 align:start position:0%
their lack of knowledge about the rules
 
00:56:26.809 --> 00:56:26.819 align:start position:0%
or their lack of experience about the
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
rules that they simply are a target for
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
the imposition of the rules in a strict
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
way and requiring the rules to apply
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
makes it difficult for the court to
 
00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
generate some kinds of information in
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
that context
 
00:56:44.450 --> 00:56:44.460 align:start position:0%
further in the situation where both
 
00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:47.220 align:start position:0%
parties are self-represented and that's
 
00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:48.660 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
rough guess more than 50 percent of our
 
00:56:53.809 --> 00:56:53.819 align:start position:0%
cases divorce and parenting cases
 
00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
involve folks who are representing
 
00:56:58.010 --> 00:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
themselves each of them
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
applying the Rules of Evidence to those
 
00:57:03.049 --> 00:57:03.059 align:start position:0%
sorts of cases creates what I think is
 
00:57:05.210 --> 00:57:05.220 align:start position:0%
likely an insurmountable challenge for
 
00:57:07.790 --> 00:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
them and it also begs the question of
 
00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:09.839 align:start position:0%
who's going to
 
00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:12.300 align:start position:0%
be the gatekeeper there in a very
 
00:57:13.569 --> 00:57:13.579 align:start position:0%
practical way
 
00:57:16.609 --> 00:57:16.619 align:start position:0%
if one party is testifying in a way or
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
submitting evidence
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
that is clearly contrary to The Rules of
 
00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:22.069 align:start position:0%
that is clearly contrary to The Rules of
Evidence

00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
Evidence
 
00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:24.780 align:start position:0%
the judge is faced with a choice if the
 
00:57:26.569 --> 00:57:26.579 align:start position:0%
other party is not objecting does the
 
00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
court weigh in and say you can't do that
 
00:57:31.849 --> 00:57:31.859 align:start position:0%
that feels to the party reasonably feels
 
00:57:33.230 --> 00:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
to the party as though the Court's
 
00:57:35.930 --> 00:57:35.940 align:start position:0%
simply not interested in listening to
 
00:57:37.609 --> 00:57:37.619 align:start position:0%
what they have to say or in considering
 
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
their evidence
 
00:57:40.849 --> 00:57:40.859 align:start position:0%
so there are sort of a myriad of
 
00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
practical problems that go along with
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
that as someone who is trained in the
 
00:57:47.809 --> 00:57:47.819 align:start position:0%
rules and who
 
00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
worked with the rules as an attorney
 
00:57:52.849 --> 00:57:52.859 align:start position:0%
doing trials and as someone who still
 
00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:54.740 align:start position:0%
applies the rules in District division
 
00:57:57.530 --> 00:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
in criminal cases
 
00:57:59.450 --> 00:57:59.460 align:start position:0%
I have tremendous respect for the rules
 
00:58:01.130 --> 00:58:01.140 align:start position:0%
of evidence and I think there's a role
 
00:58:04.790 --> 00:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
for them I'm concerned that the strict
 
00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
imposition of the Rules of Evidence May
 
00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:09.720 align:start position:0%
extend our cases these sorts of cases in
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
Family Division may not really be a good
 
00:58:14.089 --> 00:58:14.099 align:start position:0%
fit for these sorts of cases in Family
 
00:58:16.609 --> 00:58:16.619 align:start position:0%
Division and will create impediments and
 
00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:19.140 align:start position:0%
costs to the parties both in terms of
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
the time and in terms of some
 
00:58:23.809 --> 00:58:23.819 align:start position:0%
dissatisfaction with the result if it if
 
00:58:25.970 --> 00:58:25.980 align:start position:0%
it appears to them that the result is
 
00:58:28.790 --> 00:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
based on a technical application
 
00:58:31.609 --> 00:58:31.619 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be happy about the
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
results if it appears and I think
 
00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
studies that we've learned about have
 
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
shown this if the parties feel as though
 
00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:40.380 align:start position:0%
the process is fair they've been
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
listened to they've been understood the
 
00:58:45.289 --> 00:58:45.299 align:start position:0%
court has taken into account their
 
00:58:47.049 --> 00:58:47.059 align:start position:0%
concerns and their own point of view
 
00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:50.220 align:start position:0%
then the outcome is slightly less
 
00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:52.740 align:start position:0%
critical to them it's the process itself
 
00:58:54.349 --> 00:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to make as Fair as
 
00:58:55.970 --> 00:58:55.980 align:start position:0%
possible to these folks who are often
 
00:58:59.150 --> 00:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
representing themselves and the in my
 
00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
view the marginal benefit of imposing
 
00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
The Rules of Evidence is probably
 
00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:05.480 align:start position:0%
outweighed in the long term
 
00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:08.460 align:start position:0%
by the the difficulties that it creates
 
00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:11.940 align:start position:0%
for folks within that system and the
 
00:59:14.030 --> 00:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
difficulties it creates in achieving the
 
00:59:16.730 --> 00:59:16.740 align:start position:0%
goals that we'd like to try to meet
 
00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
so that's my practical take I want to
 
00:59:20.450 --> 00:59:20.460 align:start position:0%
clarify that I'm not speaking on behalf
 
00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
of the judicial branch this is this is
 
00:59:25.609 --> 00:59:25.619 align:start position:0%
my read based on my experience judge
 
00:59:27.289 --> 00:59:27.299 align:start position:0%
Gunner um
 
00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:29.460 align:start position:0%
chairman Lynn has been sorting the cards
 
00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
by type and I've asked him if he has
 
00:59:34.849 --> 00:59:34.859 align:start position:0%
cards on this particular issue of Rules
 
00:59:37.609 --> 00:59:37.619 align:start position:0%
of Evidence this would be a good time to
 
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
take questions on that subject you just
 
00:59:42.109 --> 00:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
spoke of thank you
 
00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:43.980 align:start position:0%
I might mention while he's sorting
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
through those cards that if you have
 
00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
questions about the Rules of Evidence
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
generally and even specifically
 
00:59:53.809 --> 00:59:53.819 align:start position:0%
I don't consider myself an expert in the
 
00:59:55.549 --> 00:59:55.559 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence by any means but you
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
have an expert sitting here in this room
 
01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:01.740 align:start position:0%
and I suspect that representative Lynn
 
01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:03.540 align:start position:0%
would be more than happy to sort of give
 
01:00:05.569 --> 01:00:05.579 align:start position:0%
you the Practical impact of the Rules of
 
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
I wonder if I'm how quickly I would be
 
01:00:19.329 --> 01:00:19.339 align:start position:0%
reversed though but yeah
 
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
so you know I
 
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
um I guess I would um
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
in trying to follow up on what you were
 
01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:29.940 align:start position:0%
just speaking of uh judge judge Garner
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
um one one questioner says if the rules
 
01:00:34.849 --> 01:00:34.859 align:start position:0%
of evidence do not do not apply then
 
01:00:38.569 --> 01:00:38.579 align:start position:0%
does the court rely on hearsay in its
 
01:00:38.579 --> 01:00:39.589 align:start position:0%
does the court rely on hearsay in its
orders

01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
orders
 
01:00:40.849 --> 01:00:40.859 align:start position:0%
um and I wonder if you could maybe just
 
01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:42.900 align:start position:0%
elaborate on that a bit it's a
 
01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
complicated answer and and I don't like
 
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
to say maybe but
 
01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:49.380 align:start position:0%
if the Rules of Evidence don't apply the
 
01:00:51.829 --> 01:00:51.839 align:start position:0%
court has discretion to determine what's
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
relevant and to determine what's
 
01:00:56.329 --> 01:00:56.339 align:start position:0%
material and helpful to the court in
 
01:00:58.370 --> 01:00:58.380 align:start position:0%
making its decision
 
01:01:00.589 --> 01:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
there are on and I should mention just
 
01:01:03.289 --> 01:01:03.299 align:start position:0%
by way of background that
 
01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:05.940 align:start position:0%
hearsay is a vast part of the Rules of
 
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
Evidence so even applying the Rules of
 
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
Evidence there's some statements that
 
01:01:11.809 --> 01:01:11.819 align:start position:0%
are not hearsay because of the reason
 
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
that they're offered and there are a
 
01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:16.140 align:start position:0%
long list of exceptions to the rule
 
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
against hearsay which cover many of the
 
01:01:20.809 --> 01:01:20.819 align:start position:0%
kinds of evidence that people would
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
submit that would be admissible even
 
01:01:24.589 --> 01:01:24.599 align:start position:0%
Under The Rules of Evidence
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you when my personal take is
 
01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:29.940 align:start position:0%
when I have a hearsay objection I'm
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
going to be guided by the rules to begin
 
01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
with if it's not hearsay then I'm going
 
01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:35.940 align:start position:0%
to overrule the objection if it is
 
01:01:37.789 --> 01:01:37.799 align:start position:0%
hearsay I'll run through in my head what
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
the exceptions might be
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
and if there are no exceptions that
 
01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:44.220 align:start position:0%
particularly cover it I'll ask myself
 
01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
what are the independent indicio
 
01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:49.020 align:start position:0%
reliability about this particular piece
 
01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:51.180 align:start position:0%
of evidence whether it's a statement or
 
01:01:52.849 --> 01:01:52.859 align:start position:0%
whether it's a document is there
 
01:01:55.069 --> 01:01:55.079 align:start position:0%
something about it either the context or
 
01:01:57.410 --> 01:01:57.420 align:start position:0%
the content or plugging it into that
 
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
piece of the case it makes it reliable
 
01:02:02.289 --> 01:02:02.299 align:start position:0%
in a way that we wouldn't ordinarily
 
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
rely on on a blank statement
 
01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
and if it is then I'll probably let it
 
01:02:12.349 --> 01:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
in so the answer is that hearsay some
 
01:02:14.930 --> 01:02:14.940 align:start position:0%
kinds of hearsay is admissible is
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
admissible under the rules under one of
 
01:02:19.490 --> 01:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
the exceptions and I don't expect that
 
01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
the Family Division in these sorts of
 
01:02:21.119 --> 01:02:24.109 align:start position:0%
the Family Division in these sorts of
cases

01:02:24.109 --> 01:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
would allow um
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
would disallow evidence that would come
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
in under the rules I think if anything
 
01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:31.740 align:start position:0%
we're going to expand a little bit
 
01:02:33.890 --> 01:02:33.900 align:start position:0%
beyond the rules to get information that
 
01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
we're greedy for frankly in in looking
 
01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
to make good decisions and to help these
 
01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
folks for the rest of their lives so
 
01:02:44.569 --> 01:02:44.579 align:start position:0%
that's my maybe answer okay thank you
 
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
um and let me just address this to
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
really all any of you've uh who may want
 
01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
to answer it the question is without
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence how do you address
 
01:02:57.770 --> 01:02:57.780 align:start position:0%
possible mental health concerns as
 
01:02:59.390 --> 01:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
related to the best interest of the
 
01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:00.309 align:start position:0%
related to the best interest of the
child

01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
uh in making custody and or parenting
 
01:03:06.530 --> 01:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
time decisions
 
01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:07.549 align:start position:0%
time decisions
sure

01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:07.559 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
I think actually there's some potential
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
for the Rules of Evidence to be an
 
01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
impediment to that sort of an inquiry
 
01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
therapy or counseling records those
 
01:03:23.329 --> 01:03:23.339 align:start position:0%
sorts of things
 
01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
are often the best evidence that might
 
01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
bear on that kind of a question
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
and the Rules of Evidence might
 
01:03:31.789 --> 01:03:31.799 align:start position:0%
sometimes exclude those because of the
 
01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
lack of a foundation or lack of
 
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
authentication whereas if the parties
 
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
agree that a document is something that
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
it is what it purports to be and it's
 
01:03:44.089 --> 01:03:44.099 align:start position:0%
relevant then the court would typically
 
01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
take that into account and probably
 
01:03:47.329 --> 01:03:47.339 align:start position:0%
allow it to be marked and probably
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
consider it I should mention as a
 
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
footnote because we're talking about
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
medical or counseling records that the
 
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
provisions of the rules of evidence that
 
01:03:58.490 --> 01:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
relate to privileges
 
01:04:00.589 --> 01:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
attorney-client privilege doctor patient
 
01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
privileged counselor therapist privilege
 
01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:05.460 align:start position:0%
those carry on and those are applied
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
even in the cases where the Rules of
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
Evidence don't strictly apply so there
 
01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:11.940 align:start position:0%
may be issues related to privilege that
 
01:04:14.030 --> 01:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
might keep something out of that nature
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
but the authentication issues we're
 
01:04:18.410 --> 01:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
likely to get past if the parties agree
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
that the document is what it is
 
01:04:23.569 --> 01:04:23.579 align:start position:0%
this is a little a little bit different
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
but I think it generally goes to the
 
01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
sort of the issues of efficiency in the
 
01:04:30.890 --> 01:04:30.900 align:start position:0%
judicial branch and the and I'm I'm sort
 
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
of recasting the question but this
 
01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
questioner raises concerns about
 
01:04:37.319 --> 01:04:38.109 align:start position:0%
questioner raises concerns about
um

01:04:38.109 --> 01:04:38.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
delays in family cases and
 
01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.030 align:start position:0%
delays in family cases and
um

01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
particularly focuses on the fact that
 
01:04:48.049 --> 01:04:48.059 align:start position:0%
apparently that in many cases the the
 
01:04:49.849 --> 01:04:49.859 align:start position:0%
presiding judge
 
01:04:49.859 --> 01:04:51.370 align:start position:0%
presiding judge
changes

01:04:51.370 --> 01:04:51.380 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
during the course of the proceeding here
 
01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
it is the ledge two or three times
 
01:04:57.530 --> 01:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
during the course of a proceeding could
 
01:04:59.750 --> 01:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
you just kind of any of you really just
 
01:05:02.930 --> 01:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
sort of explain what when in a
 
01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
particular case is it normally assigned
 
01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:07.559 align:start position:0%
to a particular judge throughout the
 
01:05:11.089 --> 01:05:11.099 align:start position:0%
case or is it or does the judge do the
 
01:05:13.549 --> 01:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
judges change hearing to hearing and if
 
01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
so when when is that likely to happen
 
01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:17.220 align:start position:0%
yeah so in a perfect world
 
01:05:18.890 --> 01:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn
 
01:05:21.890 --> 01:05:21.900 align:start position:0%
a Family Division was designed to be one
 
01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
family one judge so the the concept was
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
a judge would be assigned to a case and
 
01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
it would be if there was a divorce case
 
01:05:30.650 --> 01:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
pending that they would be the judge if
 
01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:32.220 align:start position:0%
there was a related abuse neglect it
 
01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
would be the same judge there was a
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
juvenile delinquency case would be the
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
same judge but the reality is that we
 
01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
have a lot of turnover in our bench we
 
01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
have to move judges around because
 
01:05:47.089 --> 01:05:47.099 align:start position:0%
on any given day I may get a call in the
 
01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
morning or the night before that a
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
judges out for covet or other related
 
01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
reasons and we have to shuffle judges
 
01:05:53.329 --> 01:05:53.339 align:start position:0%
around so
 
01:05:56.990 --> 01:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
I think in a best case scenario it would
 
01:05:59.270 --> 01:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
be a judge that would carry through the
 
01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
life of the case but some of these cases
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
go on for years and years too so a judge
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
May retire and somebody else has to come
 
01:06:09.289 --> 01:06:09.299 align:start position:0%
in I just had a case literally that was
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
the case had been pending for 20 years
 
01:06:14.329 --> 01:06:14.339 align:start position:0%
the judge retired and one of the lawyers
 
01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
asked that the judge be specially
 
01:06:18.049 --> 01:06:18.059 align:start position:0%
assigned in his retirement to hear the
 
01:06:19.789 --> 01:06:19.799 align:start position:0%
case and I said because he's because the
 
01:06:21.170 --> 01:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
judge has been hearing this case for 20
 
01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
years they said he's retired I mean I
 
01:06:24.529 --> 01:06:24.539 align:start position:0%
can't force him to come out of
 
01:06:27.410 --> 01:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
retirement to hear this case
 
01:06:30.289 --> 01:06:30.299 align:start position:0%
um that's an extreme example but the
 
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
reality is that with a turnover and
 
01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
judges and judges covering multiple
 
01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
locations that it's it's not possible to
 
01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
have one judge for one case straight
 
01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
through from beginning to end and you
 
01:06:43.069 --> 01:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
know just to sort of follow up on this
 
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
because I think that that's there are a
 
01:06:46.609 --> 01:06:46.619 align:start position:0%
number of questions here that sort of
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
focus on how long Family Division cases
 
01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
take and I know you mentioned before
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
that that the typical and perhaps a vast
 
01:06:58.609 --> 01:06:58.619 align:start position:0%
majority of let's say divorce cases are
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
concluded within a year can you just
 
01:07:03.049 --> 01:07:03.059 align:start position:0%
give us without getting into the details
 
01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
of any particular case but can you just
 
01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:09.260 align:start position:0%
give us sort of a um an overview of of
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
what what are the situations that cause
 
01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
a case to go on for like 20 years as you
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
just said what are the what are the sort
 
01:07:19.970 --> 01:07:19.980 align:start position:0%
of dynamics of the situation that causes
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing to happen and what
 
01:07:23.089 --> 01:07:23.099 align:start position:0%
and it's and is there something the
 
01:07:25.549 --> 01:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
judge can do to stop that yeah I'll let
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:31.490 --> 01:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
I I can't think of any offhand that are
 
01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
20 years but
 
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
but I think every judge who works in the
 
01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
Family Division has cases that have gone
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
on longer than they should have gone on
 
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
in the ideal world
 
01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
some of those cases too are cases in
 
01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
which some of those cases too are cases
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
in which you've gotten to a final
 
01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
hearing within the period you would hope
 
01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
certainly six months nine months a year
 
01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
if it's a really contested case
 
01:07:58.490 --> 01:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
final orders have been entered but the
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
case may have been brought forward by
 
01:08:01.490 --> 01:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
one of the parties
 
01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
and this that's not something we can
 
01:08:05.569 --> 01:08:05.579 align:start position:0%
control there are legal standards that
 
01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
in parenting issues that make the burden
 
01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
of proof more difficult if you bring a
 
01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
case forward from a final parenting plan
 
01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't prevent folks from
 
01:08:17.150 --> 01:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
bringing them forward and there are
 
01:08:19.249 --> 01:08:19.259 align:start position:0%
quite legitimate and reasonable issues
 
01:08:21.530 --> 01:08:21.540 align:start position:0%
too such as a proposed relocation of the
 
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
children's residents that could prompt
 
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
the case to be brought forward so I
 
01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
think it's important to distinguish
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
between the question of how long the
 
01:08:32.329 --> 01:08:32.339 align:start position:0%
Family Division gets to a final decree
 
01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:34.980 align:start position:0%
the first time the case is filed and
 
01:08:36.769 --> 01:08:36.779 align:start position:0%
then how we manage a case once it's
 
01:08:38.450 --> 01:08:38.460 align:start position:0%
brought forward because it can be
 
01:08:40.669 --> 01:08:40.679 align:start position:0%
brought forward it seems endlessly I'm
 
01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
sure it seems endless to the parties but
 
01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
it can be brought forward almost at
 
01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
infinitum until typically the children
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
reach age of 18.
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
um I would say that there are a couple
 
01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
of issues that tend to come up that may
 
01:08:59.689 --> 01:08:59.699 align:start position:0%
cause some delays inherently
 
01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
if the parties are having trouble
 
01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:04.859 align:start position:0%
managing the exchange of information we
 
01:09:06.650 --> 01:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
have a mandatory Discovery rule
 
01:09:08.809 --> 01:09:08.819 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's difficult for folks to
 
01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
get around to doing that
 
01:09:14.209 --> 01:09:14.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:16.610 --> 01:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
at loggerheads in terms of the parenting
 
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
orders even if there are temporary
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
orders in place if they're having
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
trouble complying or their motions for
 
01:09:24.829 --> 01:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
contempt about non-compliance that can
 
01:09:26.809 --> 01:09:26.819 align:start position:0%
always delay the process because we'll
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
schedule a hearing on those motions once
 
01:09:30.849 --> 01:09:30.859 align:start position:0%
the motion and objection is filed
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
it happens sometimes that um in
 
01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
complicated cases particularly
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
complicated Financial cases they'll have
 
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
attorneys on both sides they have to do
 
01:09:43.370 --> 01:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
a lot of Discovery in those cases they
 
01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
may have to engage experts to testify to
 
01:09:48.829 --> 01:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
provide opinions that process in itself
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
tends to take longer than the case might
 
01:09:54.169 --> 01:09:54.179 align:start position:0%
otherwise require those are inherent
 
01:09:57.410 --> 01:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
issues with every case and the faces of
 
01:09:58.910 --> 01:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
them change and there are always cases
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
that have a combination of more than one
 
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
of those features that just make it
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
difficult to say to the parties and have
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
them say to the court now we're ready
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
now we're ready to schedule a final
 
01:10:11.150 --> 01:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
hearing we've done what we have to do
 
01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:13.140 align:start position:0%
we're prepared let's go forward and
 
01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
typically the court is not
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
likely we're going to try to time the
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
scheduling of a final hearing at a point
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
where we can trust that the parties are
 
01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
really ready and they need the time
 
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
because if
 
01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
if the case really doesn't need a full
 
01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
day and we schedule a full day and it
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
turns out that day or the day before
 
01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
that it didn't need a full day and
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
they've settled it we've just spent a
 
01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
day that we may not be able to fill in
 
01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
with other hearings so we we treat our
 
01:10:45.169 --> 01:10:45.179 align:start position:0%
time as valuable and we try to get the
 
01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
litigants to look at it the same way and
 
01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:48.780 align:start position:0%
everyone tries to be practical and
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
realistic about how long the case will
 
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
take let me follow up on that from
 
01:10:54.890 --> 01:10:54.900 align:start position:0%
another card on the subject we're on
 
01:10:58.209 --> 01:10:58.219 align:start position:0%
right now in terms of
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
length of time we already spoke of there
 
01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:02.940 align:start position:0%
were not enough judges we it looks like
 
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
are going to get some more of the ones
 
01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
we need but what about one of the
 
01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
litigants who's turning the process
 
01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
whether it is the wealthy person who can
 
01:11:17.770 --> 01:11:17.780 align:start position:0%
pay a lawyer to tie the other one up
 
01:11:22.189 --> 01:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
with endless motions or somebody who is
 
01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
pro se but has read too much and doesn't
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
understand enough and is doing the same
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
thing when is it proper for the judge to
 
01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:32.820 align:start position:0%
come in and say you're abusing the
 
01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:34.310 align:start position:0%
come in and say you're abusing the
process

01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
in that situation once it becomes
 
01:11:38.930 --> 01:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
apparent that one side or the other is
 
01:11:41.149 --> 01:11:41.159 align:start position:0%
is dragging their heels
 
01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
the Court's primary focus is going to be
 
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
on setting deadlines to get the
 
01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
discovery complete once the discovery is
 
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
complete there's really there should be
 
01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
no impediment to scheduling a final
 
01:11:53.930 --> 01:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
hearing and when they've completed
 
01:11:55.729 --> 01:11:55.739 align:start position:0%
Discovery they know what the issues are
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
going to be and they can tell us if they
 
01:11:59.149 --> 01:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
need a two-hour final hearing or half a
 
01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
day or a full day final hearing so the
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
court I think has an obligation at some
 
01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
point in the in that's in that stage
 
01:12:09.229 --> 01:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
when that's becoming apparent to begin
 
01:12:12.169 --> 01:12:12.179 align:start position:0%
to schedule hearings to set those
 
01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
deadlines to make sure that if there are
 
01:12:16.010 --> 01:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
if there's a need for orders on
 
01:12:17.570 --> 01:12:17.580 align:start position:0%
Discovery those orders get out right
 
01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
away and the parties know what their
 
01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:21.780 align:start position:0%
face it I think most attorneys who are
 
01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
experienced in this area will tell you
 
01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:24.770 align:start position:0%
experienced in this area will tell you
that

01:12:24.770 --> 01:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
the prime time to settle cases is when
 
01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
you get that final hearing schedule
 
01:12:33.290 --> 01:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
that's what you're preparing for for the
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
client there that's when the expenses
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
are going to go up that's when the
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
uncertainty can be nipped in the bud by
 
01:12:40.729 --> 01:12:40.739 align:start position:0%
a settlement and that's the best time to
 
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
settle the cases and we're always
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
looking for ways to get them close to
 
01:12:47.209 --> 01:12:47.219 align:start position:0%
that moment the follow-up to that is
 
01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
that if family and divorce issues are
 
01:12:55.090 --> 01:12:55.100 align:start position:0%
not that legislatively mandated priority
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
is one of the ways to speed up a divorce
 
01:13:02.930 --> 01:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
case for the legislature to make that a
 
01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
mandatory priority with a follow-up I'll
 
01:13:08.689 --> 01:13:08.699 align:start position:0%
put in but if everything becomes
 
01:13:11.630 --> 01:13:11.640 align:start position:0%
mandated nothing is then pretty soon
 
01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
I don't disagree with that last part of
 
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
it it's really a policy question whether
 
01:13:18.169 --> 01:13:18.179 align:start position:0%
you impose those sorts of deadlines on
 
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
us in terms of those cases but
 
01:13:23.169 --> 01:13:23.179 align:start position:0%
in my experience because of the
 
01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
unpredictability of the cases and really
 
01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
the wide spectrum
 
01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
I think there are likely cases that that
 
01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
could never be done
 
01:13:37.970 --> 01:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
properly and fully Within
 
01:13:40.370 --> 01:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
any sort of mandated time constraint
 
01:13:42.290 --> 01:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
there will be those exceptions as judge
 
01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
king mentioned most of our cases get
 
01:13:48.110 --> 01:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
resolved one way or the other we funnel
 
01:13:49.729 --> 01:13:49.739 align:start position:0%
folks into mediation through the first
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
appearance program that's been very
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
successful particularly in resolving the
 
01:13:56.450 --> 01:13:56.460 align:start position:0%
parenting cases that's a that's a high
 
01:13:58.370 --> 01:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
priority for us is to get folks into
 
01:14:00.410 --> 01:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
that process of working together to try
 
01:14:02.689 --> 01:14:02.699 align:start position:0%
to settle the cases as early as we can
 
01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
it's just these outlier cases that are
 
01:14:07.689 --> 01:14:07.699 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult for whatever reason
 
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
extremely time consuming those are going
 
01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
to be very difficult to manage within a
 
01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
mandated period of time
 
01:14:18.530 --> 01:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
thank you I wonder if these two sort of
 
01:14:22.850 --> 01:14:22.860 align:start position:0%
related questions the first uh is would
 
01:14:24.830 --> 01:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
better training of Circuit Court judges
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
reduce the hours needed by judges to
 
01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
deal with contested family cases
 
01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:32.030 align:start position:0%
deal with contested family cases
um

01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:34.729 --> 01:14:34.739 align:start position:0%
uh by by reducing the need for
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
re-hearings that kind of thing and then
 
01:14:40.090 --> 01:14:40.100 align:start position:0%
the second sort of related question is
 
01:14:42.410 --> 01:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
can you uh
 
01:14:42.420 --> 01:14:44.110 align:start position:0%
can you uh
uh

01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:14:47.209 --> 01:14:47.219 align:start position:0%
take just a bit of time to explain to us
 
01:14:50.689 --> 01:14:50.699 align:start position:0%
the the uh the evaluation process of
 
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
Judges how judges are evaluated and how
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
often that happens that kind of thing
 
01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:58.330 align:start position:0%
often that happens that kind of thing
foreign

01:14:58.330 --> 01:14:58.340 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:15:01.310 --> 01:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
the first question deals with training
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
and that's the responsibility of the
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
administrative office and we don't have
 
01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
a one-size-fits-all for judicial
 
01:15:10.130 --> 01:15:10.140 align:start position:0%
training sometimes we'll get two or
 
01:15:12.649 --> 01:15:12.659 align:start position:0%
three judges at once uh and we can put
 
01:15:14.330 --> 01:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
together a more robust training program
 
01:15:16.330 --> 01:15:16.340 align:start position:0%
we're in the process right now of
 
01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
training Judge Amy Manchester she got
 
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
appointed as a one-off judge and so
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
we've cobbled together a training
 
01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
schedule for her
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
um it's it's harder to bring in outside
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
resources for one judge but we we can
 
01:15:32.930 --> 01:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
never do enough training we do a
 
01:15:35.149 --> 01:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
Judicial training every other month for
 
01:15:36.850 --> 01:15:36.860 align:start position:0%
all of our judges in the Circuit Court
 
01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
it could be a topic of any of the three
 
01:15:43.610 --> 01:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
divisions we don't have money to hire
 
01:15:46.189 --> 01:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
outside presenters so we do our own
 
01:15:49.250 --> 01:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
homemade presentations using our judges
 
01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:52.140 align:start position:0%
and staff attorneys and Outsiders as we
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
can get them but I think we can always
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
do more training the second question was
 
01:16:02.290 --> 01:16:02.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a creature of Statute um
 
01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
we're required every three years to do a
 
01:16:11.149 --> 01:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
evaluation of all of our judges uh we
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
had a committee that took a deep dive a
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
few years ago representative Smith was
 
01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
on the committee uh we changed the
 
01:16:19.490 --> 01:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
instrument that we use to do the
 
01:16:21.050 --> 01:16:21.060 align:start position:0%
evaluations we now do them
 
01:16:25.130 --> 01:16:25.140 align:start position:0%
electronically using SurveyMonkey and we
 
01:16:27.229 --> 01:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
Post in the courthouses and in bar news
 
01:16:29.930 --> 01:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
when a certain group of Judges is being
 
01:16:32.810 --> 01:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
evaluated and it's open to anyone who
 
01:16:35.810 --> 01:16:35.820 align:start position:0%
wants to complete the evaluation we
 
01:16:37.970 --> 01:16:37.980 align:start position:0%
typically get anywhere from 30 to 50
 
01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:41.940 align:start position:0%
evaluations back for a judge and then
 
01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
it's my job to analyze those and go
 
01:16:45.709 --> 01:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
through them with the judge and use
 
01:16:47.689 --> 01:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
those as a tool to help performance
 
01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
by and large the judicial and the
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
results not by judge but the results
 
01:16:58.250 --> 01:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
each year are made available to the
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
governor's office office the House and
 
01:17:01.970 --> 01:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
Senate and are on our website in terms
 
01:17:03.530 --> 01:17:03.540 align:start position:0%
of how many judges were evaluated what
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
the mean and median scores were for all
 
01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:07.980 align:start position:0%
judges and by and large our judges even
 
01:17:10.189 --> 01:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
the judges in the Family Division do
 
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
pretty well on their performance
 
01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:14.750 align:start position:0%
pretty well on their performance
evaluations

01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:20.450 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:17:20.450 --> 01:17:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
as someone who's been through that
 
01:17:23.689 --> 01:17:23.699 align:start position:0%
process quite a bit I would just point
 
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
out that
 
01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
judges don't often get feedback about
 
01:17:29.930 --> 01:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
how they're doing
 
01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
that just for whatever reason
 
01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:33.229 align:start position:0%
that just for whatever reason
um

01:17:33.229 --> 01:17:33.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
we're somewhat isolated and attorneys
 
01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
particularly aren't going to come up and
 
01:17:40.669 --> 01:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
tell us often that we've done a terrible
 
01:17:42.410 --> 01:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
job and this is really what we need to
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
refocus on and maybe get some training
 
01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:45.350 align:start position:0%
refocus on and maybe get some training
on

01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
there is a component of the evaluation
 
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
that's a self-evaluation and I've always
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
found that extremely valuable because it
 
01:17:54.530 --> 01:17:54.540 align:start position:0%
gives me a chance to sort of second
 
01:17:56.209 --> 01:17:56.219 align:start position:0%
guess what I've been doing and maybe
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
identify areas that I can do better and
 
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
I think we're still doing it the
 
01:18:05.090 --> 01:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
evaluation process generates
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
a series of particular comments from the
 
01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
evaluators they've been edited so
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
they're sort of anonymous but comments
 
01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
that can be really helpful for a judge
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
reading over and understanding how
 
01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
someone else perceived how they did
 
01:18:22.729 --> 01:18:22.739 align:start position:0%
their job for me both of those
 
01:18:22.739 --> 01:18:24.110 align:start position:0%
their job for me both of those
components

01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
components
 
01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
um sort of take the edge off what
 
01:18:28.189 --> 01:18:28.199 align:start position:0%
otherwise might be sort of an anxious
 
01:18:31.010 --> 01:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
process of getting evaluated but it does
 
01:18:32.810 --> 01:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
generate great information it's helpful
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
for us in our efforts to do our job
 
01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:36.830 align:start position:0%
for us in our efforts to do our job
better

01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a parallel to that
 
01:18:40.970 --> 01:18:40.980 align:start position:0%
could you speak to
 
01:18:44.689 --> 01:18:44.699 align:start position:0%
um the judicial review I mean this this
 
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
is a bit of training but I mean the
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
disciplinary process
 
01:18:52.010 --> 01:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
of when it is alleged that a judge has
 
01:18:57.649 --> 01:18:57.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:59.330 --> 01:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure if I understand the
 
01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
question Mr chairman but there were
 
01:19:03.050 --> 01:19:03.060 align:start position:0%
there were two two avenues that that can
 
01:19:06.530 --> 01:19:06.540 align:start position:0%
go if I know a situation where there is
 
01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
an allegation that the judges in an
 
01:19:11.149 --> 01:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
order made an error of law
 
01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
that goes to Chief Justice McDonald's
 
01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
court and they review that as part of
 
01:19:17.330 --> 01:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
the Appellate process and they either
 
01:19:18.890 --> 01:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
affirm the judge or they reverse the
 
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
judge the second component deals more
 
01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:24.060 align:start position:0%
with behavioral issues on the part of a
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
judge which is maybe what you're getting
 
01:19:28.850 --> 01:19:28.860 align:start position:0%
at there is a Judicial conduct committee
 
01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh Robert middleholtzer is the chairman
 
01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:33.420 align:start position:0%
of that it has a number of members both
 
01:19:34.630 --> 01:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
from the public
 
01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
and the court system and they meet
 
01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
monthly and they review complaints if
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
you will against judges and I I get
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
copies of all of them as they make their
 
01:19:46.430 --> 01:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
way through to the end of the process
 
01:19:48.370 --> 01:19:48.380 align:start position:0%
and by and large
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
most of the complaints against judges
 
01:19:54.649 --> 01:19:54.659 align:start position:0%
that I see in the Circuit Court are
 
01:19:57.290 --> 01:19:57.300 align:start position:0%
Judges who sit in primarily in the
 
01:19:59.930 --> 01:19:59.940 align:start position:0%
Family Division they involve mostly
 
01:20:02.209 --> 01:20:02.219 align:start position:0%
divorce parenting cases and for the most
 
01:20:04.689 --> 01:20:04.699 align:start position:0%
part they go to the merits of the case
 
01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
that the you know the judge came up with
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
the wrong decision if you will which is
 
01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
really something that should go to the
 
01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
Appellate Court if that's the issue if
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
it rises to a serious enough level it's
 
01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:18.780 align:start position:0%
it becomes a public complaint and
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
there's a whole process for that for the
 
01:20:23.149 --> 01:20:23.159 align:start position:0%
judicial conduct committee and they too
 
01:20:25.130 --> 01:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
report their findings at the end of
 
01:20:26.930 --> 01:20:26.940 align:start position:0%
every year how many complaints they
 
01:20:29.470 --> 01:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
received how many resulted in certain
 
01:20:32.149 --> 01:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
outcomes so that's that's a public and
 
01:20:34.610 --> 01:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
transparent process the complaints are
 
01:20:36.890 --> 01:20:36.900 align:start position:0%
confidential until they erase the level
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
of a complaint by the committee could
 
01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:42.719 align:start position:0%
you try to remember a recent year and
 
01:20:45.530 --> 01:20:45.540 align:start position:0%
give us the number of complaints and the
 
01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
number that were
 
01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:49.630 align:start position:0%
number that were
um

01:20:49.630 --> 01:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:54.530 --> 01:20:54.540 align:start position:0%
dismissed for not being what would go
 
01:20:57.950 --> 01:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
forward with any action I I'm losing the
 
01:20:59.630 --> 01:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
term I'm striving for here yeah since
 
01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a function that's
 
01:21:02.630 --> 01:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
outside of the judicial branch I don't
 
01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
have those numbers at hand I I they are
 
01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
available there's a link on the Supreme
 
01:21:09.530 --> 01:21:09.540 align:start position:0%
Court on our judicial branch website to
 
01:21:11.090 --> 01:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
the judicial conduct committee and I
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
think those statistics are available but
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
I'll follow up and see if I can get the
 
01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:18.300 align:start position:0%
most recent report
 
01:21:20.810 --> 01:21:20.820 align:start position:0%
but this is an external it sounds like
 
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
when you said you didn't have that
 
01:21:24.890 --> 01:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
information that means this is somewhat
 
01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
of an external
 
01:21:29.209 --> 01:21:29.219 align:start position:0%
Review Committee it is external to the
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
official Branch it's not the guys
 
01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh this is this is I think an important
 
01:21:42.890 --> 01:21:42.900 align:start position:0%
topic would you please talk about
 
01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:45.780 align:start position:0%
mediation and its effect on caseloads
 
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
and the weighted caseload study are
 
01:21:51.169 --> 01:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
there impediments to structural
 
01:21:54.169 --> 01:21:54.179 align:start position:0%
mediation such as not enough mediators
 
01:21:58.010 --> 01:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:00.300 align:start position:0%
so I can start and maybe judge Garner
 
01:22:01.729 --> 01:22:01.739 align:start position:0%
can talk more specifically about Family
 
01:22:03.950 --> 01:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
Division the office of mediation and
 
01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
arbitration works out of the judicial
 
01:22:10.370 --> 01:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
branch and we have mediation pretty much
 
01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
across all case types some are available
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
at no charge to litigants some have a
 
01:22:18.530 --> 01:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
sliding scale I think in the Family
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
Division and I think all judges strongly
 
01:22:25.550 --> 01:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
encourage various forms of alternative
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution mediation being the
 
01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
primary one it's required in all cases
 
01:22:34.970 --> 01:22:34.980 align:start position:0%
involving parenting cases where the
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
parents are required to go to mediation
 
01:22:38.930 --> 01:22:38.940 align:start position:0%
pretty much out of the gate to try to
 
01:22:40.250 --> 01:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
get those issues resolved and it's
 
01:22:42.530 --> 01:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
highly effective I mean the the success
 
01:22:46.490 --> 01:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
rates are are pretty high in the Circuit
 
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
Court we also have something called
 
01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
neutral case evaluation
 
01:22:52.610 --> 01:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
which has kind of fallen off because we
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
rely on judicial officers to do it but
 
01:22:58.430 --> 01:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
neutral case evaluation is where a judge
 
01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
who is not going to hear the case sits
 
01:23:03.290 --> 01:23:03.300 align:start position:0%
down for a half day or a day with the
 
01:23:05.209 --> 01:23:05.219 align:start position:0%
parties depending on the complexity of
 
01:23:07.970 --> 01:23:07.980 align:start position:0%
the case and you sort of have a almost a
 
01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
mini trial without Witnesses and at the
 
01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
end of the process the judge tells the
 
01:23:15.470 --> 01:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
parties how he or she thinks if they
 
01:23:16.669 --> 01:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
were to have heard the case it would
 
01:23:18.970 --> 01:23:18.980 align:start position:0%
come out so just for example you know
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
let's say it's an alimony issue at the
 
01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
end the judge says you know I think this
 
01:23:25.010 --> 01:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
is a situation where if I were the judge
 
01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
hearing this case based on what I've
 
01:23:29.390 --> 01:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
heard I would be ordering alimony maybe
 
01:23:31.130 --> 01:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
a case where the lawyer's been telling
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
his or her client you're going to pay
 
01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
alimony and they're saying no I'm not
 
01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
and the lawyer's saying yes you are and
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
so you go to neutral case evaluation and
 
01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:42.060 align:start position:0%
experienced judicial officer you know
 
01:23:43.610 --> 01:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
being versed in the law and having heard
 
01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
the facts
 
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
says what they think would happen
 
01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes that is a really good way to
 
01:23:52.130 --> 01:23:52.140 align:start position:0%
get those more difficult cases to settle
 
01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
I did a neutral case evaluation during
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
covid in a trust docket case that
 
01:23:59.149 --> 01:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
involved multi-millions of dollars we
 
01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
had lots of lawyers we started at 8 30
 
01:24:04.010 --> 01:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
in the morning I left the law office at
 
01:24:05.930 --> 01:24:05.940 align:start position:0%
8 30 that night it was a Friday night we
 
01:24:09.890 --> 01:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
spent 12 hours and ultimately and this
 
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
was a case that had gone to mediation
 
01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
and and didn't settle ultimately because
 
01:24:16.610 --> 01:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
I was a judge and I have experience in
 
01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
this area of the law
 
01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
and I was able to tell the parties what
 
01:24:22.330 --> 01:24:22.340 align:start position:0%
I think is going to happen in this case
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
including how the legal fees which were
 
01:24:27.290 --> 01:24:27.300 align:start position:0%
in the millions of dollars might get
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
apportioned if I were to hear the case
 
01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
the parties were able to work with their
 
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
lawyers and get that case resolved
 
01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
that case was scheduled for an eight-day
 
01:24:40.189 --> 01:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
trial in two weeks and so I called the
 
01:24:41.330 --> 01:24:41.340 align:start position:0%
judge when I got home that night and
 
01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
said you owe me one because I just
 
01:24:45.050 --> 01:24:45.060 align:start position:0%
settled an eight-day trial for you but
 
01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
neutral case evaluation is a very good
 
01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
tool and we would like to expand that in
 
01:24:51.770 --> 01:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
the Family Division as we have the
 
01:24:57.050 --> 01:24:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:57.060 --> 01:24:58.250 align:start position:0%
 
perfect

01:24:58.250 --> 01:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
01:25:00.169 --> 01:25:00.179 align:start position:0%
let me just supplement a little bit with
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
a specific procedure that applies in
 
01:25:03.770 --> 01:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
divorce cases with children and
 
01:25:05.450 --> 01:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
parenting cases
 
01:25:07.490 --> 01:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
when the petition is filed and assuming
 
01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
that there are no emergency orders that
 
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
are involved the parties are sent to
 
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
what we call the first appearance
 
01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:15.290 align:start position:0%
what we call the first appearance
session

01:25:15.290 --> 01:25:15.300 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:25:17.570 --> 01:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
pre-covered we were doing these sessions
 
01:25:20.330 --> 01:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
live so typically in the courtroom where
 
01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
I'm able to sit in Laconia we can seat
 
01:25:25.010 --> 01:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
about 25 people we'd have 10 or 12
 
01:25:27.709 --> 01:25:27.719 align:start position:0%
couples come in and they would get
 
01:25:29.930 --> 01:25:29.940 align:start position:0%
directly from me or from whatever judge
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
was doing it that day a basic
 
01:25:34.370 --> 01:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
description of the process the procedure
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
of this involved mention of the
 
01:25:38.689 --> 01:25:38.699 align:start position:0%
mandatory Discovery Rule and a lot of
 
01:25:41.090 --> 01:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
information about mediation and the
 
01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
presumption is and was from that process
 
01:25:47.630 --> 01:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
that unless there was a reason to be
 
01:25:49.729 --> 01:25:49.739 align:start position:0%
exempt from it the parties would go to
 
01:25:51.649 --> 01:25:51.659 align:start position:0%
mediation before they would come back to
 
01:25:54.169 --> 01:25:54.179 align:start position:0%
court for any contested hearings and we
 
01:25:56.330 --> 01:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
had great success at that I should
 
01:25:58.129 --> 01:25:58.139 align:start position:0%
mention as a footnote that there is an
 
01:25:59.810 --> 01:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
exception for cases where there's a
 
01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
domestic violence protective order in
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
effect in those cases we can send the
 
01:26:07.490 --> 01:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
parties to mediation but only if they
 
01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
both agree either one of them gets a
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
veto power and those mediation sessions
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
always occur at the courthouse we've
 
01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:15.719 align:start position:0%
been doing the first appearance sessions
 
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
remotely now because there's a video
 
01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
that the judicial branch created for us
 
01:26:23.450 --> 01:26:23.460 align:start position:0%
we've candidly with speakers who are a
 
01:26:24.890 --> 01:26:24.900 align:start position:0%
lot more effective at it than I was
 
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
doing it live although I still think
 
01:26:28.970 --> 01:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
there was some benefit to having it live
 
01:26:31.970 --> 01:26:31.980 align:start position:0%
but it's been a great program and our
 
01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:33.290 align:start position:0%
but it's been a great program and our
mediators

01:26:33.290 --> 01:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
mediators
 
01:26:35.570 --> 01:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
in a place like Laconia we've been using
 
01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
the same mediators for years and they
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
are fully expert at what they do and
 
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
they're very nice people and they create
 
01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
an atmosphere there's much more
 
01:26:45.770 --> 01:26:45.780 align:start position:0%
congenial and productive than the sort
 
01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
of formal courtroom atmosphere that
 
01:26:49.129 --> 01:26:49.139 align:start position:0%
they're going to be facing if the
 
01:26:51.169 --> 01:26:51.179 align:start position:0%
mediation doesn't work out so it's been
 
01:26:52.669 --> 01:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
a great program and we completely
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
encourage it
 
01:26:58.129 --> 01:26:58.139 align:start position:0%
so this uh one of the questions I think
 
01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
this is this is a a point that needs to
 
01:27:02.229 --> 01:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
be made
 
01:27:05.450 --> 01:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
can you just explain to us let's talk
 
01:27:07.070 --> 01:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
about I'm not talking about part-time
 
01:27:09.470 --> 01:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
judges but a full-time judge can you
 
01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
just explain our full-time judges
 
01:27:14.990 --> 01:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
permitted to have any other employment
 
01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
and are there any are there limits on a
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
judge's ability to earn income outside
 
01:27:26.810 --> 01:27:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:28.070 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
there is a limitation judges are allowed
 
01:27:32.770 --> 01:27:32.780 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:27:35.330 --> 01:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
teaching I think is pretty much the only
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
outside employment that they're allowed
 
01:27:39.229 --> 01:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
to do only with the permission written
 
01:27:41.570 --> 01:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
permission of the Chief Justice and
 
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
their salary cannot exceed I think it's
 
01:27:47.810 --> 01:27:47.820 align:start position:0%
15 of the judge's salary
 
01:27:49.490 --> 01:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
um I just I can tell you from experience
 
01:27:51.290 --> 01:27:51.300 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court judges don't have time
 
01:27:52.669 --> 01:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
to teach
 
01:27:52.679 --> 01:27:53.270 align:start position:0%
to teach
um

01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
I don't I'm not sure if we have any uh
 
01:27:57.649 --> 01:27:57.659 align:start position:0%
active I think we may have some judges
 
01:27:59.750 --> 01:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
who teach uh trial ad at the law school
 
01:28:01.250 --> 01:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
some Superior Court judges and I think
 
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
we might have one circuit court judge
 
01:28:04.669 --> 01:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
that does it but it's pretty Limited
 
01:28:07.129 --> 01:28:07.139 align:start position:0%
can't practice law at all under rule 38
 
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
which is the code of judicial conduct
 
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
I want to follow up on the judicial
 
01:28:14.270 --> 01:28:14.280 align:start position:0%
conduct committee uh the questionnaire
 
01:28:16.250 --> 01:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if this is correct or
 
01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
not I'll just read the card why do the
 
01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
members of the judicial conduct
 
01:28:23.450 --> 01:28:23.460 align:start position:0%
committee number one not have to take an
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
oath of office I'm not sure what that
 
01:28:27.830 --> 01:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
means and secondly and I know the answer
 
01:28:29.629 --> 01:28:29.639 align:start position:0%
to this one had there why do they have
 
01:28:32.090 --> 01:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
their meetings in secret
 
01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
well by rule the process is confidential
 
01:28:36.530 --> 01:28:36.540 align:start position:0%
unless as I said earlier the complaint
 
01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
the the cases risen to the level of a
 
01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
complaint I have no idea whether they
 
01:28:42.290 --> 01:28:42.300 align:start position:0%
take an oath of office or not
 
01:28:44.450 --> 01:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
okay I don't know why they
 
01:28:46.490 --> 01:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
I don't know why they would but they not
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
I don't know that they do or don't in
 
01:28:51.169 --> 01:28:51.179 align:start position:0%
terms of meetings in secret
 
01:28:53.209 --> 01:28:53.219 align:start position:0%
if I was accused of something I would
 
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
want it to be substantiated before I
 
01:28:58.129 --> 01:28:58.139 align:start position:0%
read about it in the union later
 
01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
you know you wouldn't read about in the
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
union leader until it was risen to the
 
01:29:02.750 --> 01:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
level of the complaint and then the
 
01:29:05.090 --> 01:29:05.100 align:start position:0%
process is the judge gets the complaint
 
01:29:07.490 --> 01:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
and has 30 days to respond to it and
 
01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:08.820 align:start position:0%
then the committee sort of takes off
 
01:29:11.810 --> 01:29:11.820 align:start position:0%
from there so at the end of the case the
 
01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
judge always gets a copy and the
 
01:29:16.910 --> 01:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
resolution but
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
um you wouldn't want a judge to know in
 
01:29:19.610 --> 01:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
the middle of a case that someone would
 
01:29:21.470 --> 01:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
file a complaint so there's two sides to
 
01:29:25.450 --> 01:29:25.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:27.229 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:29:27.229 --> 01:29:27.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:27.239 --> 01:29:28.070 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
this this uh the questioner asks why are
 
01:29:35.390 --> 01:29:35.400 align:start position:0%
Judges not ending cases
 
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
um sooner and allowing frivolous motions
 
01:29:42.290 --> 01:29:42.300 align:start position:0%
um that's that's the question I so I put
 
01:29:45.649 --> 01:29:45.659 align:start position:0%
it to to you uh you know what is that is
 
01:29:48.890 --> 01:29:48.900 align:start position:0%
that true and uh what what you know what
 
01:29:52.610 --> 01:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
why what are the processes for for sort
 
01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:53.570 align:start position:0%
why what are the processes for for sort
of

01:29:53.570 --> 01:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:29:56.090 --> 01:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
truncating cases that seem to go on
 
01:29:56.100 --> 01:30:00.770 align:start position:0%
truncating cases that seem to go on
forever

01:30:00.770 --> 01:30:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
the question of frivolity I think may be
 
01:30:05.570 --> 01:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
something that's uh in the eye of the
 
01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:06.770 align:start position:0%
something that's uh in the eye of the
beholder

01:30:06.770 --> 01:30:06.780 align:start position:0%
beholder
 
01:30:09.709 --> 01:30:09.719 align:start position:0%
but we have an obligation to move the
 
01:30:13.070 --> 01:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
cases along and to provide good orders
 
01:30:15.050 --> 01:30:15.060 align:start position:0%
within a reasonable and fair period of
 
01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:15.890 align:start position:0%
within a reasonable and fair period of
time

01:30:15.890 --> 01:30:15.900 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
and so to the extent that motions to us
 
01:30:20.810 --> 01:30:20.820 align:start position:0%
appear to be frivolous
 
01:30:23.810 --> 01:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
will typically make a finding we may
 
01:30:27.050 --> 01:30:27.060 align:start position:0%
make immediate rulings on those sorts of
 
01:30:30.290 --> 01:30:30.300 align:start position:0%
motions so to convey the message at some
 
01:30:32.570 --> 01:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
point in the process I think we have
 
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
authority although I think it's rarely
 
01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:35.750 align:start position:0%
authority although I think it's rarely
used

01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
used
 
01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
to limit A party's right to file
 
01:30:41.689 --> 01:30:41.699 align:start position:0%
additional motions I don't know that
 
01:30:45.530 --> 01:30:45.540 align:start position:0%
we're ever going to be able to justify
 
01:30:47.689 --> 01:30:47.699 align:start position:0%
preventing a party from filing some
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
things that's an access to justice issue
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
that is really fundamental to what we do
 
01:30:55.270 --> 01:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
but we can impose sanctions and we can
 
01:30:58.910 --> 01:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
impose requirements on filings that will
 
01:31:01.729 --> 01:31:01.739 align:start position:0%
to some degree enhance the likelihood
 
01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
that the Motions are not going to be
 
01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
frivolous in terms of resolving the
 
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
cases sooner
 
01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
I think there are two processes there
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
one is the process of our workload
 
01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:14.390 align:start position:0%
one is the process of our workload
so

01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
currently if you were to have a
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
pre-trial conference with us today and
 
01:31:21.110 --> 01:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
you needed a full day final hearing
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
we're scheduling about three months out
 
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
so that's that's time you're going to
 
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
wait to get to that hearing with nothing
 
01:31:28.610 --> 01:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
else going on
 
01:31:31.970 --> 01:31:31.980 align:start position:0%
but there are also
 
01:31:36.770 --> 01:31:36.780 align:start position:0%
cases in which we can intervene if you
 
01:31:40.430 --> 01:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
will or help the parties in a direction
 
01:31:42.649 --> 01:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
of mediation or neutral case evaluation
 
01:31:45.050 --> 01:31:45.060 align:start position:0%
that may help the case get resolved
 
01:31:47.450 --> 01:31:47.460 align:start position:0%
sooner it's in our interest and it's
 
01:31:49.490 --> 01:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
certainly in the party's interests to
 
01:31:51.290 --> 01:31:51.300 align:start position:0%
get cases resolved as soon as they can
 
01:31:53.090 --> 01:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
be fairly resolved meaning that all the
 
01:31:54.830 --> 01:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
relevant information is available to
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
them to present and meaning that they've
 
01:31:59.330 --> 01:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
exhausted all the possibilities of
 
01:32:02.810 --> 01:32:02.820 align:start position:0%
negotiation so I think we have a common
 
01:32:05.570 --> 01:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
goal with folks in that our workload is
 
01:32:07.550 --> 01:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
a bit of an impediment in terms of the
 
01:32:10.129 --> 01:32:10.139 align:start position:0%
time we have available and the nature of
 
01:32:12.729 --> 01:32:12.739 align:start position:0%
some of the cases makes it basically
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
challenging to get them ready for a
 
01:32:18.890 --> 01:32:18.900 align:start position:0%
final Hearing in a in a brief period of
 
01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:20.930 align:start position:0%
final Hearing in a in a brief period of
time

01:32:20.930 --> 01:32:20.940 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
I wonder if the next question which I
 
01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
think judge Garner you may have touched
 
01:32:29.149 --> 01:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
on this a little bit earlier but
 
01:32:31.010 --> 01:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
um could you could any of you really
 
01:32:34.970 --> 01:32:34.980 align:start position:0%
give us your thoughts on what what would
 
01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:36.719 align:start position:0%
be the effect
 
01:32:39.709 --> 01:32:39.719 align:start position:0%
if that's a general matter in family law
 
01:32:43.310 --> 01:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
cases the burden of proof were elevated
 
01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
in other words instead of preponderance
 
01:32:48.050 --> 01:32:48.060 align:start position:0%
of the evidence which is generally the
 
01:32:50.209 --> 01:32:50.219 align:start position:0%
standard that applies it were elevated
 
01:32:52.250 --> 01:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
to either clear and convincing evidence
 
01:32:55.010 --> 01:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
or proof Beyond A Reasonable Doubt what
 
01:32:57.290 --> 01:32:57.300 align:start position:0%
can you just tell us what your sense of
 
01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:00.719 align:start position:0%
what the effect of that would be
 
01:33:03.050 --> 01:33:03.060 align:start position:0%
the clear and convincing standard is
 
01:33:05.090 --> 01:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
already in place in cases that are
 
01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
brought forward on parenting issues so
 
01:33:10.729 --> 01:33:10.739 align:start position:0%
under 461a 11 1 at least two of those
 
01:33:13.010 --> 01:33:13.020 align:start position:0%
subsections require clear and convincing
 
01:33:15.290 --> 01:33:15.300 align:start position:0%
evidence before the court can modify an
 
01:33:17.689 --> 01:33:17.699 align:start position:0%
existing parenting plan so it's not a
 
01:33:20.270 --> 01:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
standard that we're unused to
 
01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's a I think a difficult standard to
 
01:33:26.810 --> 01:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
articulate for uh for parties who are
 
01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:28.370 align:start position:0%
articulate for uh for parties who are
self-represented

01:33:28.370 --> 01:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
self-represented
 
01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:29.750 align:start position:0%
self-represented
and

01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:30.890 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:33:30.890 --> 01:33:30.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:33.129 --> 01:33:33.139 align:start position:0%
to some degree the there is no
 
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
particular burden of proof in the first
 
01:33:38.810 --> 01:33:38.820 align:start position:0%
the first time around in Family Division
 
01:33:40.610 --> 01:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
cases there's a presumption of joint
 
01:33:42.830 --> 01:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
decision making there's a presumption
 
01:33:44.689 --> 01:33:44.699 align:start position:0%
that regular and frequent contact with
 
01:33:46.430 --> 01:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
children is consistent with their best
 
01:33:49.310 --> 01:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
interests and the standard for orders
 
01:33:51.169 --> 01:33:51.179 align:start position:0%
that relate to Children is what's in the
 
01:33:53.570 --> 01:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
best interests of the child rather than
 
01:33:55.370 --> 01:33:55.380 align:start position:0%
a formal assignment of burden of proof
 
01:33:56.990 --> 01:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
to one side or the other
 
01:33:58.910 --> 01:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
so I think it starts with a More Level
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
Playing Field if
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
there's no reason in my view to require
 
01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
parties both to prove something by
 
01:34:06.890 --> 01:34:06.900 align:start position:0%
clearing convincing evidence the first
 
01:34:09.530 --> 01:34:09.540 align:start position:0%
time around the statutory standard in
 
01:34:12.350 --> 01:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
for modification of parenting is there
 
01:34:16.189 --> 01:34:16.199 align:start position:0%
because the legislature recognized that
 
01:34:18.229 --> 01:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
stability is really important for
 
01:34:20.149 --> 01:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
children they wanted to make it a little
 
01:34:22.129 --> 01:34:22.139 align:start position:0%
more difficult for someone seeking to
 
01:34:25.250 --> 01:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
modify a parenting plan to come back and
 
01:34:27.649 --> 01:34:27.659 align:start position:0%
and get a modification so they impose
 
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
that standard under those two
 
01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:30.530 align:start position:0%
that standard under those two
subsections

01:34:30.530 --> 01:34:30.540 align:start position:0%
subsections
 
01:34:32.930 --> 01:34:32.940 align:start position:0%
so beyond a reasonable doubt I I won't
 
01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
address that I
 
01:34:38.330 --> 01:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:40.430 --> 01:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
um the next question I I think this is
 
01:34:42.530 --> 01:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
really this is a value one why did the
 
01:34:44.990 --> 01:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
court system not request in the budget
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
the number of Judges indicated by the
 
01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:53.810 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:34:53.810 --> 01:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
it is about a question
 
01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:57.229 align:start position:0%
it is about a question
um

01:34:57.229 --> 01:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
we we and I want to be clear this is we
 
01:35:05.510 --> 01:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
our request this year is a significant
 
01:35:10.189 --> 01:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
step towards addressing or uh needs but
 
01:35:12.649 --> 01:35:12.659 align:start position:0%
it's not the final step and we're also
 
01:35:16.129 --> 01:35:16.139 align:start position:0%
mindful of the larger context in which
 
01:35:18.050 --> 01:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
we operate and we try to be good
 
01:35:21.229 --> 01:35:21.239 align:start position:0%
partners in state government and uh good
 
01:35:23.570 --> 01:35:23.580 align:start position:0%
stewards of the taxpayers dollars
 
01:35:26.510 --> 01:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
um and all of those factors played into
 
01:35:28.850 --> 01:35:28.860 align:start position:0%
our ultimate decision to ask for seven
 
01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
in the circuit court and one in the
 
01:35:33.169 --> 01:35:33.179 align:start position:0%
Superior Court
 
01:35:36.050 --> 01:35:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:38.570 --> 01:35:38.580 align:start position:0%
um and and you know by the time we're
 
01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
developing our next budget we'll have
 
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
better we'll have
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
good insight as to hopefully or how our
 
01:35:48.350 --> 01:35:48.360 align:start position:0%
additional resources are helping our
 
01:35:50.030 --> 01:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
caseload and we'll be able to come back
 
01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:52.679 align:start position:0%
to the legislature again informed with
 
01:35:55.370 --> 01:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
with whether what what further
 
01:36:00.530 --> 01:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
can um I wonder uh maybe this would be
 
01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
for you judge king of the of the 126
 
01:36:09.950 --> 01:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
000 or so uh
 
01:36:12.590 --> 01:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
circuit court cases can you give us a
 
01:36:16.209 --> 01:36:16.219 align:start position:0%
rough idea of approximately how many are
 
01:36:18.530 --> 01:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
dcyf related in other words that have
 
01:36:19.790 --> 01:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
the division
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh for children youth and families
 
01:36:26.090 --> 01:36:26.100 align:start position:0%
involved uh at some level
 
01:36:28.189 --> 01:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
so you
 
01:36:30.169 --> 01:36:30.179 align:start position:0%
talking pretty much about abuse neglect
 
01:36:33.410 --> 01:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
and and delinquency cases
 
01:36:36.530 --> 01:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
um and so I'll use uh 2020 two numbers
 
01:36:36.540 --> 01:36:37.530 align:start position:0%
um and so I'll use uh 2020 two numbers
uh

01:36:37.530 --> 01:36:37.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:37.540 --> 01:36:47.709 align:start position:0%
uh
[Music]

01:36:47.709 --> 01:36:47.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:50.169 --> 01:36:50.179 align:start position:0%
looks like about
 
01:36:55.070 --> 01:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
2600 cases in 2022 would have involved
 
01:36:57.110 --> 01:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
the division directly
 
01:36:59.030 --> 01:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
well and then there's another 560
 
01:37:00.709 --> 01:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
determination of parental rights cases
 
01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
which that's sort of the back end of the
 
01:37:05.149 --> 01:37:05.159 align:start position:0%
abuse neglect typically so
 
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
um north of 3000 cases
 
01:37:24.370 --> 01:37:24.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
I think on slide eight if you look at
 
01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
the Circle to identified as juvenile
 
01:37:34.930 --> 01:37:34.940 align:start position:0%
yep identifies the number of case
 
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
juvenile related cases for the years
 
01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:46.910 --> 01:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
um the next question uh do judges still
 
01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:48.490 align:start position:0%
um the next question uh do judges still
order

01:37:48.490 --> 01:37:48.500 align:start position:0%
order
 
01:37:51.770 --> 01:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
parent-child unification therapy and if
 
01:37:56.290 --> 01:37:56.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:59.860 --> 01:37:59.870 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:59.870 --> 01:38:02.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
that process is not currently
 
01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
unavailable to us
 
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
but there are some elements of the
 
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
process that make it extremely rare
 
01:38:17.810 --> 01:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
if I understand the process it is that a
 
01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
reunification therapist
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
is appointed presumably with the consent
 
01:38:25.610 --> 01:38:25.620 align:start position:0%
of the parties but by order of the Court
 
01:38:28.129 --> 01:38:28.139 align:start position:0%
to conduct a reunification therapy to
 
01:38:30.490 --> 01:38:30.500 align:start position:0%
allow and enhance and encourage a child
 
01:38:33.770 --> 01:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
to reunify with one parent the
 
01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
question of the word reunification is a
 
01:38:39.590 --> 01:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
bit ambiguous whether it means just some
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
regular contact or whether it means a
 
01:38:43.070 --> 01:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
full reunification under a shared
 
01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
residential schedule but it's a process
 
01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
in which typically there are there's a
 
01:38:49.129 --> 01:38:49.139 align:start position:0%
therapist or the child
 
01:38:51.110 --> 01:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
there may be a therapist for the parent
 
01:38:53.149 --> 01:38:53.159 align:start position:0%
but there's a reunification therapist
 
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
who provides the Forum and provides some
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
of the therapy and helps all of them
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
work together to try to reunify the
 
01:39:00.719 --> 01:39:02.090 align:start position:0%
work together to try to reunify the
relationship

01:39:02.090 --> 01:39:02.100 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
01:39:05.410 --> 01:39:05.420 align:start position:0%
because it is
 
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
an intense pretty intense process it's I
 
01:39:12.350 --> 01:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
think rarely used it's probably an
 
01:39:14.930 --> 01:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
expensive process and I'll say as a
 
01:39:16.729 --> 01:39:16.739 align:start position:0%
caveat I've never had a case where I've
 
01:39:19.189 --> 01:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
actually presided over the process
 
01:39:19.199 --> 01:39:20.629 align:start position:0%
actually presided over the process
although

01:39:20.629 --> 01:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
although
 
01:39:20.639 --> 01:39:21.590 align:start position:0%
although
um

01:39:21.590 --> 01:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:23.570 --> 01:39:23.580 align:start position:0%
is not completely unknown to me because
 
01:39:24.890 --> 01:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
of some things that have come up in
 
01:39:26.209 --> 01:39:26.219 align:start position:0%
other cases but I won't mention
 
01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
specifically but it's a um
 
01:39:31.790 --> 01:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
it's a process in which I think some of
 
01:39:35.090 --> 01:39:35.100 align:start position:0%
the therapists have great faith and it
 
01:39:36.430 --> 01:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:39:38.689 --> 01:39:38.699 align:start position:0%
just thinking globally it would be
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
something that would be used in the rare
 
01:39:43.129 --> 01:39:43.139 align:start position:0%
occasion and often is virtually a last
 
01:39:45.709 --> 01:39:45.719 align:start position:0%
resort when the relationship between a
 
01:39:47.450 --> 01:39:47.460 align:start position:0%
parent and a child for whatever reason
 
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
is so distant and so is strange that
 
01:39:52.970 --> 01:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
without professional input and
 
01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
professional assistance it may not be
 
01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:57.290 align:start position:0%
professional assistance it may not be
salvageable

01:39:57.290 --> 01:39:57.300 align:start position:0%
salvageable
 
01:39:59.689 --> 01:39:59.699 align:start position:0%
so that's my quick take I'll know more
 
01:40:01.550 --> 01:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
if I ever get to a series of hearings
 
01:40:03.890 --> 01:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
that involve that but that's my
 
01:40:05.689 --> 01:40:05.699 align:start position:0%
understanding of the process and and
 
01:40:08.510 --> 01:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
some of the pitfalls
 
01:40:10.790 --> 01:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh judge king I think this probably
 
01:40:12.590 --> 01:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
would be the best the best address to
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
you um
 
01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
you mentioned I think earlier in your
 
01:40:19.090 --> 01:40:19.100 align:start position:0%
remarks that uh there were no more
 
01:40:21.229 --> 01:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
marital Masters
 
01:40:23.870 --> 01:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
um on the bench um
 
01:40:26.510 --> 01:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh they that that many of them had
 
01:40:28.850 --> 01:40:28.860 align:start position:0%
retired and then I apparently at some
 
01:40:30.770 --> 01:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
point at some point later you mentioned
 
01:40:33.590 --> 01:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
that um uh some marital masses had
 
01:40:35.450 --> 01:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
become judges in fact I think judge
 
01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
Garner so could you just can you just
 
01:40:39.470 --> 01:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
kind of explain how I mean is it is that
 
01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:40.430 align:start position:0%
kind of explain how I mean is it is that
a

01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:40:43.550 --> 01:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
a sort of usual course or when we did
 
01:40:45.590 --> 01:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
have marital Masters was it was is that
 
01:40:47.390 --> 01:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
something that you know to go from being
 
01:40:49.070 --> 01:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
a marital Master to a judge to something
 
01:40:51.110 --> 01:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
that happened in with some some
 
01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:53.149 align:start position:0%
that happened in with some some
regularity

01:40:53.149 --> 01:40:53.159 align:start position:0%
regularity
 
01:40:55.490 --> 01:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
I think it was probably unheard of until
 
01:40:58.010 --> 01:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
we created the Circuit Court back when
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court had jurisdiction over
 
01:41:02.689 --> 01:41:02.699 align:start position:0%
divorces before you cleverly passed them
 
01:41:04.129 --> 01:41:04.139 align:start position:0%
on to us
 
01:41:04.139 --> 01:41:04.970 align:start position:0%
on to us
um

01:41:04.970 --> 01:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:06.530 --> 01:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
I think the mayoral Masters were
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
creation of the Superior Court initially
 
01:41:09.950 --> 01:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
because the judges didn't want to hear
 
01:41:11.450 --> 01:41:11.460 align:start position:0%
marital cases so they found a way to
 
01:41:13.850 --> 01:41:13.860 align:start position:0%
have someone else hear them and then as
 
01:41:16.430 --> 01:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
we rolled the Family Division out on by
 
01:41:19.310 --> 01:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
Statute we began to inherit the superior
 
01:41:21.830 --> 01:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
Court's marital Masters until July 1st
 
01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
2011 as I said there were 13 left we got
 
01:41:25.550 --> 01:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
them all
 
01:41:28.490 --> 01:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
as part of House Bill 609 which was the
 
01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
bill that created the Circuit Court in
 
01:41:32.990 --> 01:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
2011 uh
 
01:41:35.629 --> 01:41:35.639 align:start position:0%
under speaker O'Brien there was a
 
01:41:37.790 --> 01:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
provision put into for an IDF that said
 
01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
as a marital Masters term expires and
 
01:41:42.410 --> 01:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
they were they were appointed for
 
01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:44.159 align:start position:0%
five-year terms
 
01:41:47.330 --> 01:41:47.340 align:start position:0%
or they retired they couldn't they they
 
01:41:49.250 --> 01:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
would be converted to a Judicial
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
position as the budget allowed there
 
01:41:55.250 --> 01:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
were three marital Masters in that one
 
01:41:57.729 --> 01:41:57.739 align:start position:0%
year that 2011 window
 
01:42:02.330 --> 01:42:02.340 align:start position:0%
whose terms expired David Forrest and
 
01:42:04.430 --> 01:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
barber and Phil cross
 
01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:06.719 align:start position:0%
those three marital Masters were
 
01:42:08.810 --> 01:42:08.820 align:start position:0%
terminated their their positions were
 
01:42:11.149 --> 01:42:11.159 align:start position:0%
ended and Barbara went into the
 
01:42:13.609 --> 01:42:13.619 align:start position:0%
practices of law day Forest I think
 
01:42:15.470 --> 01:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
taught at Keen for a while and Phil
 
01:42:17.450 --> 01:42:17.460 align:start position:0%
cross became a mediator
 
01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
the next but the next session of the
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
legislature we went back and we said can
 
01:42:23.090 --> 01:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
we change that because that seems unfair
 
01:42:27.109 --> 01:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
can we change it to when a judge retires
 
01:42:29.330 --> 01:42:29.340 align:start position:0%
um or is not reappointed that the
 
01:42:31.370 --> 01:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
position would convert and the statute
 
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
was amended so that marital Masters
 
01:42:35.689 --> 01:42:35.699 align:start position:0%
terms could be extended if they wanted
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
to stay over the course of time marital
 
01:42:42.050 --> 01:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
Mass has retired some then did apply to
 
01:42:44.750 --> 01:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
become judges including judge Garner
 
01:42:47.330 --> 01:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
judge Croc Phil cross applied for a
 
01:42:49.850 --> 01:42:49.860 align:start position:0%
Judicial position he's now a judge Dave
 
01:42:52.370 --> 01:42:52.380 align:start position:0%
Forrest is a judge Jen Lemire who I
 
01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
think this committee's heard from on a
 
01:42:56.930 --> 01:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
couple of occasions is a judge Bob Foley
 
01:42:58.669 --> 01:42:58.679 align:start position:0%
was a marital Master he became a judge
 
01:43:00.890 --> 01:43:00.900 align:start position:0%
he's now a retired judge
 
01:43:02.689 --> 01:43:02.699 align:start position:0%
did I miss anyone
 
01:43:02.699 --> 01:43:03.770 align:start position:0%
did I miss anyone
okay

01:43:03.770 --> 01:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:43:07.970 --> 01:43:07.980 align:start position:0%
and so Tom Cooper was the last marital
 
01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
Master to retire he retired last year
 
01:43:13.310 --> 01:43:13.320 align:start position:0%
and he is the one mayoral master that
 
01:43:16.490 --> 01:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
still sits very occasionally he's been
 
01:43:18.290 --> 01:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
great to cover for us when we've had a
 
01:43:20.090 --> 01:43:20.100 align:start position:0%
coveted illness or something he's gone
 
01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
and covered dockets for us but we're we
 
01:43:24.530 --> 01:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
basically have no more marital Masters
 
01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:28.490 align:start position:0%
basically have no more marital Masters
left

01:43:28.490 --> 01:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:30.590 --> 01:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
um all right so
 
01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:31.550 align:start position:0%
um all right so
um

01:43:31.550 --> 01:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:34.850 --> 01:43:34.860 align:start position:0%
with the f um
 
01:43:37.490 --> 01:43:37.500 align:start position:0%
with the efforts of Juvenile Diversion
 
01:43:40.850 --> 01:43:40.860 align:start position:0%
do you see a reduction in uh the time
 
01:43:43.129 --> 01:43:43.139 align:start position:0%
that that circuit court judges are
 
01:43:47.450 --> 01:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
spending on juvenile related cases
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
so judge Ashley's the expert on that
 
01:43:51.530 --> 01:43:51.540 align:start position:0%
she's the deputy administrative judge
 
01:43:53.209 --> 01:43:53.219 align:start position:0%
and I know only from speaking with her
 
01:43:55.669 --> 01:43:55.679 align:start position:0%
that the number of cases that actually
 
01:43:59.330 --> 01:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
become cases now is has been decreased
 
01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
dramatically because of the requirement
 
01:44:04.609 --> 01:44:04.619 align:start position:0%
to have an evaluation done before the
 
01:44:06.770 --> 01:44:06.780 align:start position:0%
charge can be filed and I think that's
 
01:44:08.750 --> 01:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
made a big difference and I think it's
 
01:44:12.050 --> 01:44:12.060 align:start position:0%
keeping a lot of kids out of court that
 
01:44:13.850 --> 01:44:13.860 align:start position:0%
otherwise would find themselves tied up
 
01:44:15.709 --> 01:44:15.719 align:start position:0%
in the in the judicial system I think
 
01:44:17.090 --> 01:44:17.100 align:start position:0%
it's been a I think she would say it's
 
01:44:21.229 --> 01:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:23.209 --> 01:44:23.219 align:start position:0%
I wonder if you could talk generally
 
01:44:26.270 --> 01:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
about the use of guardian ad litem
 
01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
Guardians Adel item in uh in family law
 
01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:37.370 align:start position:0%
Guardians Adel item in uh in family law
cases

01:44:37.370 --> 01:44:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:40.030 --> 01:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
before the Circuit Court came into being
 
01:44:43.129 --> 01:44:43.139 align:start position:0%
Guardians ad litem were I think more
 
01:44:46.370 --> 01:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
numerous than they are currently
 
01:44:48.649 --> 01:44:48.659 align:start position:0%
there was a period of time when we had a
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
state fund that would pay some of the
 
01:44:52.729 --> 01:44:52.739 align:start position:0%
fees for Guardians at Litem for folks
 
01:44:54.350 --> 01:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
who were eligible for those kinds of
 
01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:55.490 align:start position:0%
who were eligible for those kinds of
services

01:44:55.490 --> 01:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:44:58.250 --> 01:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
part of the creation of the Circuit
 
01:45:01.729 --> 01:45:01.739 align:start position:0%
Court was to emphasize mediation as a
 
01:45:04.010 --> 01:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
way to resolve cases and I think the
 
01:45:06.410 --> 01:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
theory was that if cases were mediated
 
01:45:08.209 --> 01:45:08.219 align:start position:0%
and resolved by agreement between the
 
01:45:10.129 --> 01:45:10.139 align:start position:0%
parties we wouldn't need Guardians I'd
 
01:45:13.250 --> 01:45:13.260 align:start position:0%
lie to the extent that they were sort of
 
01:45:15.410 --> 01:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
the rule of the day in the days when
 
01:45:17.229 --> 01:45:17.239 align:start position:0%
these cases were heard in Superior Court
 
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
there are still Guardians at Litem who
 
01:45:22.910 --> 01:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
are practicing there are not nearly as
 
01:45:25.129 --> 01:45:25.139 align:start position:0%
many as there were and the state fund
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
that used to pay for their fees for
 
01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:30.300 align:start position:0%
eligible parties is now hasn't been in
 
01:45:32.510 --> 01:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
place for a number of years
 
01:45:35.149 --> 01:45:35.159 align:start position:0%
so they potentially have a role to play
 
01:45:39.109 --> 01:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
as a as a judge who hears a lot of these
 
01:45:41.930 --> 01:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
cases and as someone who did Guardian Ad
 
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
Litem work when I was in private
 
01:45:45.850 --> 01:45:45.860 align:start position:0%
practice I think there's a role for them
 
01:45:48.290 --> 01:45:48.300 align:start position:0%
they can be very helpful in the right
 
01:45:51.169 --> 01:45:51.179 align:start position:0%
case they are
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
simply because of the finances only now
 
01:45:56.030 --> 01:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
available to folks who can afford to pay
 
01:45:57.290 --> 01:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
for their fees
 
01:45:59.330 --> 01:45:59.340 align:start position:0%
and those fees can be significant
 
01:46:02.090 --> 01:46:02.100 align:start position:0%
particularly Guardians ad litem who are
 
01:46:04.370 --> 01:46:04.380 align:start position:0%
practicing attorneys will they may not
 
01:46:06.169 --> 01:46:06.179 align:start position:0%
charge exactly what they would charge a
 
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
private client but
 
01:46:10.370 --> 01:46:10.380 align:start position:0%
um they need to charge enough money to
 
01:46:12.649 --> 01:46:12.659 align:start position:0%
make the work attractive to them and
 
01:46:14.689 --> 01:46:14.699 align:start position:0%
that's what they do so we have Guardians
 
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
that light them available in Laconia
 
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
we've got three or four on a list they
 
01:46:20.810 --> 01:46:20.820 align:start position:0%
get some cases but we always have to be
 
01:46:22.490 --> 01:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
very careful with the parties to let
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
them know that the fees are on them and
 
01:46:26.930 --> 01:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
and there's no other way to pay for
 
01:46:30.530 --> 01:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
those Services I could go into
 
01:46:33.890 --> 01:46:33.900 align:start position:0%
endless detail about the role and the
 
01:46:36.109 --> 01:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
history but I think the short answer is
 
01:46:37.669 --> 01:46:37.679 align:start position:0%
that Guardians at Litem are available
 
01:46:40.270 --> 01:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
but only to a certain select few of our
 
01:46:45.129 --> 01:46:45.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:47.629 --> 01:46:47.639 align:start position:0%
why are the members of family law
 
01:46:49.729 --> 01:46:49.739 align:start position:0%
committee not required to serve a number
 
01:46:52.370 --> 01:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
of hours observing what really happens
 
01:46:53.570 --> 01:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
in court
 
01:46:56.570 --> 01:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
stay tuned we're going on field trips
 
01:47:01.870 --> 01:47:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
this question I think is
 
01:47:05.689 --> 01:47:05.699 align:start position:0%
um I I think it's probably something
 
01:47:08.030 --> 01:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
that would be important to discuss
 
01:47:11.149 --> 01:47:11.159 align:start position:0%
um can you just whoever would be the
 
01:47:13.850 --> 01:47:13.860 align:start position:0%
most uh the most appropriate one to
 
01:47:15.050 --> 01:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
answer this but can you just talk
 
01:47:18.430 --> 01:47:18.440 align:start position:0%
generally about the effect of delay
 
01:47:22.250 --> 01:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
in in coming to an accurate you know an
 
01:47:23.930 --> 01:47:23.940 align:start position:0%
accurate decision in the case in other
 
01:47:27.050 --> 01:47:27.060 align:start position:0%
words you know we've we're obviously as
 
01:47:28.910 --> 01:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
time goes by memories fade that kind of
 
01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
thing but in the particularly in the
 
01:47:32.570 --> 01:47:32.580 align:start position:0%
family law context
 
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
um can you can you talk about that a
 
01:47:37.490 --> 01:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
little bit how delay and and uh and
 
01:47:39.290 --> 01:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
having cases adjudicated how that can
 
01:47:43.970 --> 01:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
affect the accuracy of of fact finding
 
01:47:46.790 --> 01:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
you mean delay during the process of
 
01:47:48.649 --> 01:47:48.659 align:start position:0%
getting to the final hearing or delay
 
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
after the final hearings taken place
 
01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
well I guess both really maybe uh but
 
01:47:55.250 --> 01:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
but probably more more of the former
 
01:48:00.109 --> 01:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:02.570 --> 01:48:02.580 align:start position:0%
most of our divorce cases are based on
 
01:48:04.790 --> 01:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
irreconcilable differences now there are
 
01:48:06.649 --> 01:48:06.659 align:start position:0%
foregrounds available but they're rarely
 
01:48:09.890 --> 01:48:09.900 align:start position:0%
pled and rarely uh hotly litigated and
 
01:48:13.550 --> 01:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
so the question of delay comes up if
 
01:48:16.729 --> 01:48:16.739 align:start position:0%
there are changes in values for a
 
01:48:18.229 --> 01:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
property that's going to be distributed
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
for example the parties separate and a
 
01:48:21.770 --> 01:48:21.780 align:start position:0%
year later the house is worth something
 
01:48:24.410 --> 01:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
different than it was that can create an
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
issue for parties depending on how the
 
01:48:27.590 --> 01:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
market is doing
 
01:48:31.370 --> 01:48:31.380 align:start position:0%
there is delay affects children
 
01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
in practical ways children whose parents
 
01:48:36.410 --> 01:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
have separated and whose future with
 
01:48:37.850 --> 01:48:37.860 align:start position:0%
either parent may be a little bit
 
01:48:40.129 --> 01:48:40.139 align:start position:0%
uncertain creates anxiety and problems
 
01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
for them behavioral problems for them
 
01:48:45.530 --> 01:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
that's sort of a dramatic impact of the
 
01:48:47.209 --> 01:48:47.219 align:start position:0%
delay in the process
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
some delay in the process is inherent
 
01:48:50.810 --> 01:48:50.820 align:start position:0%
because the parties still need to
 
01:48:54.290 --> 01:48:54.300 align:start position:0%
reassess what they have and and do their
 
01:48:56.209 --> 01:48:56.219 align:start position:0%
Discovery and be prepared for a final
 
01:48:58.729 --> 01:48:58.739 align:start position:0%
hearing and and to look into negotiated
 
01:49:01.970 --> 01:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
settlement but delay in the process is
 
01:49:01.980 --> 01:49:03.410 align:start position:0%
settlement but delay in the process is
almost

01:49:03.410 --> 01:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
almost
 
01:49:06.410 --> 01:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
never a good thing unless something is
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
happening in the meantime to help the
 
01:49:11.090 --> 01:49:11.100 align:start position:0%
parties toward resolution so if a case
 
01:49:13.189 --> 01:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
is going to go out several months
 
01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
without anything being scheduled we'll
 
01:49:16.970 --> 01:49:16.980 align:start position:0%
talk to the parties about using the rest
 
01:49:18.770 --> 01:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
of their mediation time
 
01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
if they haven't used all of their
 
01:49:22.250 --> 01:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
mediation time or we might arrange for a
 
01:49:23.930 --> 01:49:23.940 align:start position:0%
neutral case evaluation once the
 
01:49:25.970 --> 01:49:25.980 align:start position:0%
discovery is done to give them a handle
 
01:49:27.290 --> 01:49:27.300 align:start position:0%
on what to expect
 
01:49:28.729 --> 01:49:28.739 align:start position:0%
so it is
 
01:49:28.739 --> 01:49:29.570 align:start position:0%
so it is
um

01:49:29.570 --> 01:49:29.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:32.450 --> 01:49:32.460 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the parties emotionally
 
01:49:35.570 --> 01:49:35.580 align:start position:0%
it can be detrimental to the family and
 
01:49:38.930 --> 01:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
it can make it can make valuation issues
 
01:49:41.570 --> 01:49:41.580 align:start position:0%
taking place months after the moment of
 
01:49:44.149 --> 01:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
separation more difficult for the court
 
01:49:45.950 --> 01:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
but really more the former than the
 
01:49:47.870 --> 01:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
latter we can manage the valuation
 
01:49:50.930 --> 01:49:50.940 align:start position:0%
issues already it's the it's the sort of
 
01:49:53.570 --> 01:49:53.580 align:start position:0%
ongoing anxiety and
 
01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
chronic emotional outfall that we really
 
01:49:59.810 --> 01:49:59.820 align:start position:0%
worry about for folks
 
01:50:01.490 --> 01:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
and I should say that's true after the
 
01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
final hearing has taken place too that's
 
01:50:05.570 --> 01:50:05.580 align:start position:0%
a terrible time for folks to be waiting
 
01:50:08.390 --> 01:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
for their orders and we would always
 
01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
like to get the orders out as soon as
 
01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
possible as soon as we can review the
 
01:50:15.109 --> 01:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
evidence write the order and be
 
01:50:21.310 --> 01:50:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:24.109 --> 01:50:24.119 align:start position:0%
so I wonder if I just really addressed
 
01:50:27.709 --> 01:50:27.719 align:start position:0%
to to uh to any of you but um as you I
 
01:50:30.649 --> 01:50:30.659 align:start position:0%
think as you both as you've some of you
 
01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
have reflected on before
 
01:50:33.119 --> 01:50:34.129 align:start position:0%
have reflected on before
um

01:50:34.129 --> 01:50:34.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:37.609 --> 01:50:37.619 align:start position:0%
the family cases it was my experience
 
01:50:38.990 --> 01:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
when I was in the judicial branch and
 
01:50:41.390 --> 01:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it's your family cases are the
 
01:50:44.570 --> 01:50:44.580 align:start position:0%
ones that tend to generate the most
 
01:50:47.870 --> 01:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
complaints to us as legislators to the
 
01:50:50.570 --> 01:50:50.580 align:start position:0%
judicial conduct committee
 
01:50:52.370 --> 01:50:52.380 align:start position:0%
um you know complaints in the media that
 
01:50:54.590 --> 01:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
kind of I wonder if you could and I
 
01:50:56.930 --> 01:50:56.940 align:start position:0%
should say my understanding and correct
 
01:50:58.910 --> 01:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
me if things have changed in the last
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
three and a half years but the
 
01:51:03.109 --> 01:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
overwhelming majority of complaints that
 
01:51:04.490 --> 01:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
are made to the judicial conduct
 
01:51:07.129 --> 01:51:07.139 align:start position:0%
Committee in family cases are found to
 
01:51:09.229 --> 01:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
be non-meritorious there are that's not
 
01:51:11.570 --> 01:51:11.580 align:start position:0%
to say all of them but but the vast
 
01:51:14.090 --> 01:51:14.100 align:start position:0%
majority of them but I wonder if you
 
01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
could offer any insights as to why you
 
01:51:19.189 --> 01:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
think that is that that um
 
01:51:21.290 --> 01:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
family cases in particular tend to
 
01:51:29.350 --> 01:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:31.609 --> 01:51:31.619 align:start position:0%
I'll just talk generically and I'm not
 
01:51:35.689 --> 01:51:35.699 align:start position:0%
the expert on the marital law as judge
 
01:51:37.729 --> 01:51:37.739 align:start position:0%
Garner is if I've been a judge for 33
 
01:51:38.930 --> 01:51:38.940 align:start position:0%
years nobody would want me hearing the
 
01:51:40.669 --> 01:51:40.679 align:start position:0%
divorce case it's outside of my area of
 
01:51:43.250 --> 01:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
expertise but I do review all of the
 
01:51:45.350 --> 01:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
complaints because I get them at the end
 
01:51:47.030 --> 01:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
of the process and I think they're just
 
01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
there as you well know representative
 
01:51:52.609 --> 01:51:52.619 align:start position:0%
Lynn they're high emotion cases people
 
01:51:54.709 --> 01:51:54.719 align:start position:0%
are very set in their ways they feel
 
01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
very strongly about their position for
 
01:51:59.270 --> 01:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
good reasons and when the case doesn't
 
01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159 align:start position:0%
go the way they wanted to then the
 
01:52:04.070 --> 01:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
they're angry at the judge they're angry
 
01:52:06.229 --> 01:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
at the process they file appeals they
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
file complaints and
 
01:52:10.189 --> 01:52:10.199 align:start position:0%
we they want us to make their lives
 
01:52:12.050 --> 01:52:12.060 align:start position:0%
better and that's and we just don't have
 
01:52:13.490 --> 01:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
that ability to put their lives back
 
01:52:15.410 --> 01:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
together that the judges just can't do
 
01:52:18.229 --> 01:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
that and you know as you heard divorce
 
01:52:19.550 --> 01:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
cases in the Superior Court when you
 
01:52:21.649 --> 01:52:21.659 align:start position:0%
were judged I worked with judge
 
01:52:23.689 --> 01:52:23.699 align:start position:0%
Manchester this morning we were going
 
01:52:25.609 --> 01:52:25.619 align:start position:0%
over the code of judicial conduct and
 
01:52:27.350 --> 01:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
01:52:29.149 --> 01:52:29.159 align:start position:0%
um disqualification and we're talking
 
01:52:31.129 --> 01:52:31.139 align:start position:0%
about the judicial conduct committee and
 
01:52:32.810 --> 01:52:32.820 align:start position:0%
the Tapley case is the case that we
 
01:52:34.189 --> 01:52:34.199 align:start position:0%
train on and that was your case that
 
01:52:35.689 --> 01:52:35.699 align:start position:0%
went to the Supreme Court and I think
 
01:52:37.070 --> 01:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
you had
 
01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
four if not five JCC complaints filed
 
01:52:42.770 --> 01:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
against you in that case and you stayed
 
01:52:44.390 --> 01:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
with the case because you felt you
 
01:52:45.649 --> 01:52:45.659 align:start position:0%
didn't have a conflict in the Supreme
 
01:52:48.229 --> 01:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
Court affirmed you but you you certainly
 
01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:50.340 align:start position:0%
have a sense for how emotionally
 
01:52:52.189 --> 01:52:52.199 align:start position:0%
draining these cases are and how people
 
01:52:54.410 --> 01:52:54.420 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes file complaints out
 
01:52:56.209 --> 01:52:56.219 align:start position:0%
of out of anger because the case didn't
 
01:53:02.290 --> 01:53:02.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:05.890 --> 01:53:05.900 align:start position:0%
I gotta read it our judges paid a salary
 
01:53:09.169 --> 01:53:09.179 align:start position:0%
or is there a financial incentive for
 
01:53:12.169 --> 01:53:12.179 align:start position:0%
them to hear more emotions in a case
 
01:53:14.030 --> 01:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
so I can answer that question I think
 
01:53:15.590 --> 01:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
everyone don't mind Mr chairman I'll go
 
01:53:16.850 --> 01:53:16.860 align:start position:0%
back and just add something to the
 
01:53:20.209 --> 01:53:20.219 align:start position:0%
previous the answer is yes we are paid a
 
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
salary and no there is no Financial
 
01:53:23.810 --> 01:53:23.820 align:start position:0%
incentive for us to have more motions
 
01:53:26.629 --> 01:53:26.639 align:start position:0%
filed ask
 
01:53:29.629 --> 01:53:29.639 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to add that
 
01:53:32.270 --> 01:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
I think some of the difficulties
 
01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:33.229 align:start position:0%
I think some of the difficulties
um

01:53:33.229 --> 01:53:33.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:35.450 --> 01:53:35.460 align:start position:0%
that are inherent with Family Division
 
01:53:38.750 --> 01:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
cases and particularly parenting cases
 
01:53:40.970 --> 01:53:40.980 align:start position:0%
come about because
 
01:53:43.370 --> 01:53:43.380 align:start position:0%
the relationship typically at one time
 
01:53:45.470 --> 01:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
was a good relationship between the
 
01:53:46.910 --> 01:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
parties if they have children or if
 
01:53:48.350 --> 01:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
they've been married for a long time and
 
01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:49.129 align:start position:0%
they've been married for a long time and
now

01:53:49.129 --> 01:53:49.139 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:53:51.410 --> 01:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
something's gone wrong sometimes
 
01:53:53.870 --> 01:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
something terribly wrong so there's a
 
01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
history and there's a sense from the
 
01:53:56.990 --> 01:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
parties that they're looking back and
 
01:53:58.390 --> 01:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
they're asking the court to look back
 
01:54:00.470 --> 01:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
throughout the course of what may have
 
01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
been a very long-term relationship with
 
01:54:05.330 --> 01:54:05.340 align:start position:0%
ups and downs but carrying forward as a
 
01:54:06.770 --> 01:54:06.780 align:start position:0%
team and now they're not a team anymore
 
01:54:10.129 --> 01:54:10.139 align:start position:0%
so there's a real emotional component
 
01:54:12.350 --> 01:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
there there's also the sense I think
 
01:54:14.209 --> 01:54:14.219 align:start position:0%
from litigants who are involved in these
 
01:54:16.970 --> 01:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
cases that their whole world in terms of
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
where they live what they do what they
 
01:54:21.169 --> 01:54:21.179 align:start position:0%
can rely on for finances
 
01:54:24.109 --> 01:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
is being turned upside down and in some
 
01:54:26.450 --> 01:54:26.460 align:start position:0%
ways is being shaken by the process to
 
01:54:29.930 --> 01:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
see what sorts out and
 
01:54:32.450 --> 01:54:32.460 align:start position:0%
finally if it's a contested parenting
 
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
issue there's nothing that touches
 
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
people more closely than their
 
01:54:37.250 --> 01:54:37.260 align:start position:0%
relationship with their children
 
01:54:39.649 --> 01:54:39.659 align:start position:0%
and that's at risk and they find
 
01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
themselves in a process that's sort of
 
01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
foreign to them in terms of the
 
01:54:45.470 --> 01:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
terminology and the forms and someone
 
01:54:48.169 --> 01:54:48.179 align:start position:0%
from their point of view is reaching out
 
01:54:51.109 --> 01:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
to change that relationship that they
 
01:54:53.450 --> 01:54:53.460 align:start position:0%
have with their children it's it's not a
 
01:54:56.169 --> 01:54:56.179 align:start position:0%
Wonder to me at all that it's a very
 
01:54:59.689 --> 01:54:59.699 align:start position:0%
tense emotional kind of a process all we
 
01:55:01.490 --> 01:55:01.500 align:start position:0%
can do is try to make it as Fair as we
 
01:55:03.890 --> 01:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
can and and let the parties do as much
 
01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
as they can Empower them to do as much
 
01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
as they can to try to resolve their
 
01:55:09.530 --> 01:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
cases on their own it's their children
 
01:55:11.689 --> 01:55:11.699 align:start position:0%
it's their lives we really don't want to
 
01:55:14.090 --> 01:55:14.100 align:start position:0%
be rearranging those things if we don't
 
01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
have to and if they can do it so we
 
01:55:17.810 --> 01:55:17.820 align:start position:0%
encourage that but it doesn't make the
 
01:55:19.370 --> 01:55:19.380 align:start position:0%
cases much easier
 
01:55:22.129 --> 01:55:22.139 align:start position:0%
before we listen to the final few
 
01:55:25.070 --> 01:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
questions I want everybody to know that
 
01:55:27.950 --> 01:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
we will be adjourning at 4 30 or in your
 
01:55:31.810 --> 01:55:31.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:37.850 --> 01:55:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:40.790 --> 01:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
no they get us they get a salary I know
 
01:55:43.129 --> 01:55:43.139 align:start position:0%
so um we'll have a few more questions
 
01:55:46.430 --> 01:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
and any of you who may stay please do
 
01:55:49.970 --> 01:55:49.980 align:start position:0%
and we'll hang out and ask you private
 
01:55:49.980 --> 01:55:50.870 align:start position:0%
and we'll hang out and ask you private
questions

01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:55:53.930 --> 01:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
you know uh this question I'm I'm I'm
 
01:55:56.330 --> 01:55:56.340 align:start position:0%
altering it just a little bit to make it
 
01:55:57.770 --> 01:55:57.780 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bit broader to capture
 
01:56:00.109 --> 01:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
what I think are is a matter that that
 
01:56:02.570 --> 01:56:02.580 align:start position:0%
I've heard issues on
 
01:56:04.910 --> 01:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
um people raising questions about
 
01:56:08.570 --> 01:56:08.580 align:start position:0%
um can you explain the process for uh by
 
01:56:12.169 --> 01:56:12.179 align:start position:0%
which the uh the record is made uh when
 
01:56:15.530 --> 01:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
when a case is being heard uh how a
 
01:56:18.649 --> 01:56:18.659 align:start position:0%
party can get a copy of the of the
 
01:56:18.659 --> 01:56:19.850 align:start position:0%
party can get a copy of the of the
record

01:56:19.850 --> 01:56:19.860 align:start position:0%
record
 
01:56:21.350 --> 01:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
um and if there are you know if the
 
01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
party is Indigent are there funds
 
01:56:27.490 --> 01:56:27.500 align:start position:0%
available to to to Aid that process and
 
01:56:31.189 --> 01:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
when if ever is the wreck is a record
 
01:56:36.530 --> 01:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:39.410 --> 01:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
first thing I do when we get new judges
 
01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
is tell them that the record you do not
 
01:56:44.209 --> 01:56:44.219 align:start position:0%
want to do anything that's not on the
 
01:56:46.430 --> 01:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
record the old days when we practice law
 
01:56:48.649 --> 01:56:48.659 align:start position:0%
on Spirit core a lot was done in
 
01:56:50.390 --> 01:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
Chambers law was done off the record
 
01:56:52.070 --> 01:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
deals were made
 
01:56:54.770 --> 01:56:54.780 align:start position:0%
we tell our new judges everything is
 
01:56:58.010 --> 01:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
done in open court on the record our
 
01:57:01.609 --> 01:57:01.619 align:start position:0%
FTR for the record equipment is kind of
 
01:57:03.470 --> 01:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
antiquated some of it's some of the
 
01:57:05.090 --> 01:57:05.100 align:start position:0%
machines that we have in the courts are
 
01:57:07.129 --> 01:57:07.139 align:start position:0%
are older than others some are hooked
 
01:57:09.830 --> 01:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
into our Network we have varying stages
 
01:57:12.470 --> 01:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
of equipment and we're trying to replace
 
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
it as we have the funds to do that it's
 
01:57:18.589 --> 01:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
the judge's responsibility to make sure
 
01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
that the record is on when there's a
 
01:57:21.589 --> 01:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
hearing going
 
01:57:24.229 --> 01:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
as I said at the outset sometimes the
 
01:57:26.330 --> 01:57:26.340 align:start position:0%
judge him or herself or a court security
 
01:57:27.649 --> 01:57:27.659 align:start position:0%
officer someone is actually the one
 
01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
that's turning the machine on we don't
 
01:57:31.490 --> 01:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
have court monitors and we've had
 
01:57:34.010 --> 01:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
certainly cases where everyone thought
 
01:57:36.169 --> 01:57:36.179 align:start position:0%
the record was running and the case is
 
01:57:37.790 --> 01:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
done and someone files as a notice of
 
01:57:39.649 --> 01:57:39.659 align:start position:0%
appeal and they go to retrieve the
 
01:57:41.089 --> 01:57:41.099 align:start position:0%
record and it's not there because it was
 
01:57:43.310 --> 01:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
some kind of a malfunction because we
 
01:57:45.950 --> 01:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
don't have court monitors sitting there
 
01:57:47.870 --> 01:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
making sure the record's you know
 
01:57:50.270 --> 01:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
working all the time that's not a good
 
01:57:51.649 --> 01:57:51.659 align:start position:0%
thing I would love to have court
 
01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
monitors like the superior report does
 
01:57:56.149 --> 01:57:56.159 align:start position:0%
which would pretty much ensure that in
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
every case the record will be done and
 
01:58:04.010 --> 01:58:04.020 align:start position:0%
operating properly anyone can order a
 
01:58:08.030 --> 01:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
copy of the audio from a hearing they do
 
01:58:09.410 --> 01:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
it through the clerk's office as a fee I
 
01:58:11.709 --> 01:58:11.719 align:start position:0%
think it's 25 to get a copy of the CD
 
01:58:13.609 --> 01:58:13.619 align:start position:0%
transcripts are ordered through and out
 
01:58:15.709 --> 01:58:15.719 align:start position:0%
we Outsource those to escribers which is
 
01:58:18.950 --> 01:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
an independent company that we they
 
01:58:21.169 --> 01:58:21.179 align:start position:0%
download the audio to them and they have
 
01:58:22.490 --> 01:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
transcriptionists that type the record
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
in cases where parties are Indigent and
 
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
qualify for appointed counsel like a
 
01:58:29.330 --> 01:58:29.340 align:start position:0%
public defender situation the state pays
 
01:58:31.189 --> 01:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
the cost of the transcripts if it's a
 
01:58:32.810 --> 01:58:32.820 align:start position:0%
civil case and the parties are appealing
 
01:58:34.490 --> 01:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
or just want a copy of the record they
 
01:58:37.850 --> 01:58:37.860 align:start position:0%
pay a per page cost it it goes up
 
01:58:39.830 --> 01:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
depending on how quickly you want the
 
01:58:41.510 --> 01:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
transcript if you want it in seven days
 
01:58:43.850 --> 01:58:43.860 align:start position:0%
it's so much a page if you can wait 30
 
01:58:46.910 --> 01:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
days it the cost is reduced but there
 
01:58:48.350 --> 01:58:48.360 align:start position:0%
should be a record available
 
01:58:51.290 --> 01:58:51.300 align:start position:0%
for every case in the Circuit Court in
 
01:58:53.270 --> 01:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
Superior Court as well and and hopefully
 
01:58:55.550 --> 01:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
the equipment's functioning properly the
 
01:58:57.530 --> 01:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
judges during the course of a hearing I
 
01:58:58.729 --> 01:58:58.739 align:start position:0%
know you may have heard some testimony
 
01:59:01.129 --> 01:59:01.139 align:start position:0%
during a hearing judge doesn't have a
 
01:59:03.050 --> 01:59:03.060 align:start position:0%
secret lever on the bench that they can
 
01:59:04.910 --> 01:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
turn off and on
 
01:59:06.830 --> 01:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
um secretly turn the record on and off
 
01:59:08.570 --> 01:59:08.580 align:start position:0%
the Record is either on or it's not and
 
01:59:10.550 --> 01:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
you'll if when you go to visit courts
 
01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
and I encourage you all of you to do
 
01:59:14.270 --> 01:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
that we'll be be happy to host you on
 
01:59:16.729 --> 01:59:16.739 align:start position:0%
the judge's bench you'll see a digital
 
01:59:19.490 --> 01:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
display with a Time on it in Big Red
 
01:59:22.070 --> 01:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
Letters and those numbers are turning
 
01:59:24.169 --> 01:59:24.179 align:start position:0%
that means the records that means the
 
01:59:26.270 --> 01:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
record's on the recording is on
 
01:59:28.129 --> 01:59:28.139 align:start position:0%
and that the record is functioning
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
hopefully properly again in the Superior
 
01:59:32.450 --> 01:59:32.460 align:start position:0%
Court you'll see a court monitor sitting
 
01:59:34.510 --> 01:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
in front of the bench with headphones on
 
01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
and they're constantly making sure all
 
01:59:38.870 --> 01:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
the microphones are working and that
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
there's no hiccups with the record we we
 
01:59:42.709 --> 01:59:42.719 align:start position:0%
don't have that we just don't have that
 
01:59:44.570 --> 01:59:44.580 align:start position:0%
luxury and fortunately most of the time
 
01:59:46.910 --> 01:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
the record is okay but as I said from
 
01:59:49.070 --> 01:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
time to time we'll have an appeal filed
 
01:59:50.270 --> 01:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
and there'll be a problem with a record
 
01:59:52.370 --> 01:59:52.380 align:start position:0%
and typically in that case the case has
 
01:59:54.290 --> 01:59:54.300 align:start position:0%
to be retried there's really no other
 
01:59:58.149 --> 01:59:58.159 align:start position:0%
remedy so we don't want that to happen
 
02:00:01.550 --> 02:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
one more question or topic
 
02:00:05.950 --> 02:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
so um this question uh
 
02:00:09.649 --> 02:00:09.659 align:start position:0%
why do judges call suisponty hearings
 
02:00:12.050 --> 02:00:12.060 align:start position:0%
not at the request of either party can
 
02:00:13.910 --> 02:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
you just sort of
 
02:00:15.770 --> 02:00:15.780 align:start position:0%
tell us if that happens with any
 
02:00:24.890 --> 02:00:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:27.109 --> 02:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
it probably happens from time to time
 
02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
when a case has been sitting for a
 
02:00:31.370 --> 02:00:31.380 align:start position:0%
period of time and something hasn't been
 
02:00:34.129 --> 02:00:34.139 align:start position:0%
scheduled for example if there were a
 
02:00:36.350 --> 02:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
temporary Hearing in temporary orders
 
02:00:38.209 --> 02:00:38.219 align:start position:0%
were entered and there was no order then
 
02:00:40.010 --> 02:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
for a pre-trial conference or for a
 
02:00:42.169 --> 02:00:42.179 align:start position:0%
final hearing whatever it might be and
 
02:00:43.490 --> 02:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
the case is sat for a little while
 
02:00:44.930 --> 02:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
because the court was expecting
 
02:00:46.669 --> 02:00:46.679 align:start position:0%
something to be filed or something had
 
02:00:48.229 --> 02:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
been filed and we were waiting for the
 
02:00:48.239 --> 02:00:49.189 align:start position:0%
been filed and we were waiting for the
objection

02:00:49.189 --> 02:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
objection
 
02:00:51.950 --> 02:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
then the court might the court clerk
 
02:00:54.109 --> 02:00:54.119 align:start position:0%
might bring the case to the judge's
 
02:00:55.729 --> 02:00:55.739 align:start position:0%
attention and say what's going on with
 
02:00:58.129 --> 02:00:58.139 align:start position:0%
this what do we need and then we would
 
02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
typically we'd look at it and typically
 
02:01:02.750 --> 02:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
schedule a status conference or a
 
02:01:04.370 --> 02:01:04.380 align:start position:0%
pre-trial conference if one hasn't
 
02:01:07.490 --> 02:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
happened to keep the case moving
 
02:01:07.500 --> 02:01:08.149 align:start position:0%
happened to keep the case moving
um

02:01:08.149 --> 02:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:10.430 --> 02:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
those are the only circumstances I can
 
02:01:12.229 --> 02:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
think of outside of the emergency
 
02:01:15.050 --> 02:01:15.060 align:start position:0%
category when something is filed as an
 
02:01:16.490 --> 02:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
emergency and something has to happen
 
02:01:17.810 --> 02:01:17.820 align:start position:0%
right away
 
02:01:19.790 --> 02:01:19.800 align:start position:0%
cord is going to schedule a hearing it's
 
02:01:21.109 --> 02:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
either going to be after Services
 
02:01:23.209 --> 02:01:23.219 align:start position:0%
achieved on the other on the other party
 
02:01:25.550 --> 02:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
or if it's a pending case it's going to
 
02:01:27.229 --> 02:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
be within a period of time that the
 
02:01:28.910 --> 02:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
court thinks necessary to let the
 
02:01:31.310 --> 02:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
parties prepare but to get orders out as
 
02:01:33.530 --> 02:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible after a hearing so
 
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
from time to time the clerks will bring
 
02:01:37.669 --> 02:01:37.679 align:start position:0%
cases to our attention and just ask what
 
02:01:39.169 --> 02:01:39.179 align:start position:0%
should we schedule here nothing's been
 
02:01:41.390 --> 02:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
scheduled and we'll do that
 
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
um so I guess it is suicante but it's
 
02:01:45.470 --> 02:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
really just typically a means of getting
 
02:01:48.770 --> 02:01:48.780 align:start position:0%
the case back on track in the usual case
 
02:01:50.629 --> 02:01:50.639 align:start position:0%
when we do a temporary hearing part of
 
02:01:52.970 --> 02:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
the temporary orders will say Discovery
 
02:01:54.830 --> 02:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
to be complete by this period of time
 
02:01:56.629 --> 02:01:56.639 align:start position:0%
schedule a pre-trial conference after
 
02:01:59.209 --> 02:01:59.219 align:start position:0%
discovery is complete or if the case has
 
02:02:01.010 --> 02:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
limited issues and we can schedule a
 
02:02:02.629 --> 02:02:02.639 align:start position:0%
final hearing with confidence that they
 
02:02:04.250 --> 02:02:04.260 align:start position:0%
need the amount of time being scheduled
 
02:02:06.530 --> 02:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
we'll just schedule a final hearing then
 
02:02:08.930 --> 02:02:08.940 align:start position:0%
that issue is taken care of so it does
 
02:02:11.209 --> 02:02:11.219 align:start position:0%
happen sometimes and typically it's just
 
02:02:13.729 --> 02:02:13.739 align:start position:0%
the Court's way of nudging the case back
 
02:02:15.649 --> 02:02:15.659 align:start position:0%
onto track
 
02:02:17.950 --> 02:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:20.990 --> 02:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
well I'm going to let you bang the gavel
 
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
because I started
 
02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:24.050 align:start position:0%
because I started
um

02:02:24.050 --> 02:02:24.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:27.050 --> 02:02:27.060 align:start position:0%
this concludes our wonderful two-hour
 
02:02:29.870 --> 02:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
presentation thank you and I hope this
 
02:02:31.550 --> 02:02:31.560 align:start position:0%

02:02:43.990 --> 02:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
