okay once again thank you for being here
 
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
today this is the second meeting of the
 
00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
HB 9 subcommittee our first meeting was
 
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 align:start position:0%
on October the 3 and at that meeting we
 
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
decided to we reviewed a uh some draft
 
00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
legislation that we would consider for
 
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
an amendment for HB
 
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 align:start position:0%
609 and we went over that draft
 
00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 align:start position:0%
legislation and came up with some
 
00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 align:start position:0%
changes that we thought needed to be
 
00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 align:start position:0%
made one of those changes was to the
 
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
role of the site evaluation committee
 
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
administrator the other was to Define
 
00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
what substantial change
 
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
means and the third definite that we
 
00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 align:start position:0%
wanted to add to this potential
 
00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
amendment was some language to describe
 
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
how a special track or a fast track for
 
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
um energy projects that are going to be
 
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
built on an existing site how that would
 
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
work and then the other possibility that
 
00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
we considered was to move forward with a
 
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 align:start position:0%
change in the makeup of the site
 
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee reducing the
 
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
current number of members from nine to a
 
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 align:start position:0%
future number of five and that uh number
 
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
of five would be described as the three
 
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
members of the Pu the commissioner of
 
00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 align:start position:0%
and a public member and at the time we
 
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
discussed the possibility that that
 
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
public member would be an attorney
 
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
with expertise in land use
 
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
planning and after discussing that idea
 
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
with uh Tom getts who has been a
 
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
consultant for us on this project and
 
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
some other
 
00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
folks it became obvious that restricting
 
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
it to an attorney land use planning
 
00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 align:start position:0%
expertise would narrow the field to such
 
00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 align:start position:0%
a degree that we might have trouble
 
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
filling that
 
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.629 align:start position:0%
filling that
role

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
role
 
00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
so we've had a redraft of
 
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
the proposed
 
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
amendment and there are copies up here a
 
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
few extra copies if anybody out there
 
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
would like to have a look at what we're
 
00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 align:start position:0%
going to be working from here today and
 
00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
what we decided to go
 
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
with was the existing statutory
 
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 align:start position:0%
members such public members and I'm
 
00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:11.319 align:start position:0%
going to read from the statute that's
 
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 align:start position:0%
RSA 162 H colon
 
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
4-b number one such public members shall
 
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 align:start position:0%
be residents of the State of New
 
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with expertise or experience
 
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
in one or more of the following areas
 
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%

governing of unincorporated
 
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
places that I believe will provide a
 
00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
adequate number of potential candidates
 
00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
so that we can find a public member
 
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
and an alternate public member that
 
00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 align:start position:0%
would be well qualified to participate
 
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
in the SEC
 
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.909 align:start position:0%
in the SEC
process

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:10.919 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
so that's the first change that the
 
00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
proposed uh legislation that I the draft
 
00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
legislation that each member of the
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee has before you here that's
 
00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
the first change that
 
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
um that this draft reflects now
 
00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
suggestion to add some language to one
 
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
public member specifying that it'd be
 
00:07:41.309 --> 00:07:41.319 align:start position:0%
chosen by the governor and Council but
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
that language is also part of
 
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.950 align:start position:0%
that language is also part of
H4

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
H4
 
00:07:49.309 --> 00:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
DB where it says the governor with the
 
00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
consent of the council shall appoint one
 
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
public member and an alternate public
 
00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
member so that language is there um I
 
00:07:59.550 --> 00:07:59.560 align:start position:0%
think we we potentially could ad
 
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
language that says um one public member
 
00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:07.919 align:start position:0%
as specified in RSA 162
 
00:08:10.909 --> 00:08:10.919 align:start position:0%
h-4 col
 
00:08:14.909 --> 00:08:14.919 align:start position:0%
b or whatever the exact H col
 
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
4-b the exact
 
00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
there there is one other change in that
 
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
section and that is that three members
 
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
of the committee shall constitute a
 
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
quorum for the purpose of conducting the
 
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
committee's business except that the
 
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
three Public Utilities Commissioners
 
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
alone shall not constitute a quum I
 
00:08:40.949 --> 00:08:40.959 align:start position:0%
think that was language that we agreed
 
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
was important to add to our at our last
 
00:08:49.389 --> 00:08:49.399 align:start position:0%
meeting the next section that I think
 
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
needs review is Section
 
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
Five which says that the senior serving
 
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
attorney member of the Public Utilities
 
00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
Commission Shall Serve as the
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
chairperson and Ching chief executive of
 
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
the committee and May and then it goes
 
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
on to describe exactly what the the
 
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
chairperson can and cannot do or should
 
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
be responsible for and I understand from
 
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
talking to several people about this
 
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
that this could be
 
00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:20.360 align:start position:0%
controversial so I've asked the Public
 
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission to come here this
 
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
morning to talk to us about this and we
 
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:28.440 align:start position:0%

microphone here and let us know what the
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
commission thinks of the idea of making
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
the senior attorney on the commission be
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:59.949 --> 00:09:59.959 align:start position:0%

Harrington um representative Harrington

and I worked together at the commission
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
years ago and I would like to offer in
 
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
the first instance that the commission
 
00:10:17.829 --> 00:10:17.839 align:start position:0%
would abide by any determinations made
 
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
by the general court as part of this
 
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
bill or any enactment of this bill but I
 
00:10:25.389 --> 00:10:25.399 align:start position:0%
can offer some historical perspective
 
00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:27.399 align:start position:0%
and experience on how
 
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
administratively things work at the
 
00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
Commission in conjunction with the site
 
00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.590 align:start position:0%

00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839 align:start position:0%
committee so around 2015 it was the year
 
00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:40.519 align:start position:0%
2015 I was appointed by chairman Martin
 
00:10:42.629 --> 00:10:42.639 align:start position:0%

and that process proceeded for about 90
 
00:10:57.069 --> 00:10:57.079 align:start position:0%
days it was a very successful process in
 
00:10:59.949 --> 00:10:59.959 align:start position:0%
so far as the party including Citizen
 
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:02.680 align:start position:0%

00:11:04.509 --> 00:11:04.519 align:start position:0%

departments and the applicant were able
 
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
to negotiate and Advocates were able to
 
00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
negotiate a settlement resolving all
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
issues and essentially recommending that
 
00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:15.959 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee approve an exemption
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
request from full sight evaluation
 
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
committee review and as the presiding
 
00:11:22.829 --> 00:11:22.839 align:start position:0%
officer together with my colleagues on
 
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee we approve that request
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
through the settled
 
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
process throughout this process reported
 
00:11:32.829 --> 00:11:32.839 align:start position:0%
to Chairman Martin honberg who was the
 
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
chairman of the Public Utilities
 
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
Commission and also chairman of the site
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee and in the view of
 
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
the commission it would be optimal to
 
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
maintain a clear designation of
 
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
authority of lines of authority and
 
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
lines of personnel um I would say
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility and reporting to the
 
00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
chair Anderson of the Public Utilities
 
00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:55.720 align:start position:0%
Commission whether they are an attorney
 
00:11:59.190 --> 00:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
or not because uh in any agency it's
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
important to maintain clear lines of
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility and Reporting and the
 
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
chairperson of the Public Utilities
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
Commission is really the ideal Hub of
 
00:12:08.959 --> 00:12:09.670 align:start position:0%
Commission is really the ideal Hub of
the

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
puc and so we have had non-attorney
 
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
chairpersons we have one right now who's
 
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
an engineer and I think to um I think
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
the phrase that fits would be to
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
privilege experience in an attorney over
 
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:31.160 align:start position:0%
experience in an engineer or a scientist
 
00:12:34.829 --> 00:12:34.839 align:start position:0%
or an economic person would be a mistake
 
00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
because I think any chair person that
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
has been put in that position of
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
authority by the governor and the
 
00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:42.839 align:start position:0%
executive councel is usually Stellar
 
00:12:45.629 --> 00:12:45.639 align:start position:0%
professional who's capable of managing
 
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
the SEC process and the Pu process so I
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
just recommend and advise that we stick
 
00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:55.839 align:start position:0%
with the concept of the governing
 
00:12:59.550 --> 00:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
Authority within the PC and the p 's
 
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
operations within the site evaluation
 
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
committee to be maintained within the
 
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:07.240 align:start position:0%
person of the chairperson thank
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
you thank you so did I understand you to
 
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
say that if the Pu chair and the secc
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
chair were different people that it
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
would create problems with regard
 
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
to reporting and other administrative
 
00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
activity within the two
 
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
groups I would say that if the general
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
court wanted to make the chairman of the
 
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities
 
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
Commission uh the
 
00:13:39.629 --> 00:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
primary responsible person from the
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission at the SEC
 
00:13:43.949 --> 00:13:43.959 align:start position:0%
and then have a separate attorney
 
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
design out there being the chairperson
 
00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:50.519 align:start position:0%
that could cause some problems because
 
00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:53.759 align:start position:0%
you may have designes and folks on the
 
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittees that are being selected by
 
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the Public Utilities
 
00:13:59.389 --> 00:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
Commission to work on sub subcommittee
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
work and to do other such activities um
 
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
not necessarily having clear lines of
 
00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
Direction and so far as you may have two
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
Personnel at the P assuming that they
 
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
are two Commissioners providing uh
 
00:14:13.949 --> 00:14:13.959 align:start position:0%
concurrent advice regarding what the
 
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
Personnel should be up to and so I did
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
report to Chairman honigberg when I was
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
at the Pu as a site evaluation committee
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
design I would check in with him to make
 
00:14:27.389 --> 00:14:27.399 align:start position:0%
sure that our overall operational
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
Direction was satisfactory he did not
 
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
interfere in day-to-day operations or
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
decision- making but I would double
 
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
check to make sure that our general
 
00:14:36.509 --> 00:14:36.519 align:start position:0%
thrust of Direction was in the right
 
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
direction so I just offer that thank
 
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
you okay uh representative m McGee has a
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
question but before we get to that I
 
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
just want one more
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
clarification the draft from which we
 
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
are working which reduces the number of
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
SEC members from 9 to
 
00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
five in addition to making this suggest
 
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
change that we're discussing right now
 
00:15:03.389 --> 00:15:03.399 align:start position:0%
it also eliminates subcommittees it
 
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
repeals the part of part of Statute that
 
00:15:08.749 --> 00:15:08.759 align:start position:0%
creates or allows for the use of
 
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittees so that all SEC business
 
00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:12.550 align:start position:0%
subcommittees so that all SEC business
would

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.670 align:start position:0%
would
become

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
become
 
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:17.720 align:start position:0%
uh full SEC business there would be no
 
00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.069 align:start position:0%
uh full SEC business there would be no
more

00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
subcommittees so the piece the the
 
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
clarification I need here is that if
 
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
there were no subcommittees would there
 
00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
still be some kind of a reporting
 
00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.949 align:start position:0%
still be some kind of a reporting
conflict

00:15:31.949 --> 00:15:31.959 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
potentially between the Pu
 
00:15:38.189 --> 00:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
chair and a different person acting as
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
the SEC chair namely the attorney
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
Pu one question I would have in terms of
 
00:15:52.189 --> 00:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
how you all imagine this would operate
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
is would there be any need for
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
supporting pu Personnel to offer
 
00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
analytical services to the site
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee is there an
 
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
expectation that the site evaluation
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
Committee in its new form would leverage
 
00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:07.759 align:start position:0%
and utilize the anical analytical
 
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
resources of the senior advisers and
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
Attorneys at the
 
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
Pu I think the answer to that is
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
yes so in that instance or I would
 
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
reiterate that it would be best to have
 
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
those people reporting to and responding
 
00:16:23.069 --> 00:16:23.079 align:start position:0%
to the directives of the chairman of the
 
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities
 
00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:26.959 align:start position:0%
Commission okay representative McGee has
 
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
a question thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um so when
 
00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:35.839 align:start position:0%
you explained that you were a design
 
00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:38.680 align:start position:0%
that was allowed to run a committee or
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
an SEC uh docket or process uh you said
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
that you reported directly back to the
 
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
chairman of the
 
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
Pu Mr honberg
 
00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
hburg is that correct yes Martin
 
00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:54.279 align:start position:0%
honigberg he's now correct at the
 
00:16:56.269 --> 00:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
current time um a Justice of the
 
00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
superior court I I remember him I when
 
00:17:02.069 --> 00:17:02.079 align:start position:0%
he was at at the SEC um so I guess what
 
00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:05.919 align:start position:0%
I'm confused about is if if the
 
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill moves forward
 
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
naming uh the attorney currently serving
 
00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
on the puc as the person who would head
 
00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:17.959 align:start position:0%
up the adjudicative proceedings for the
 
00:17:22.029 --> 00:17:22.039 align:start position:0%
SEC wouldn't that person still have the
 
00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839 align:start position:0%
same communication vehicle with the
 
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
chair that you had when you ran the
 
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
process that you said was so successful
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
well I don't want to necessarily assume
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
um Madame representative that I would
 
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
know all the permutations of how this
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
would play out in real time but I would
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
offer this that there could be a
 
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.270 align:start position:0%
offer this that there could be a
circumstance

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
circumstance
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
where the most senior attorney on the
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
commission is not necessarily the
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
chairperson so you know that kind of
 
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
creates an inherent tension
 
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
because especially in the current format
 
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
of the commission you really do directly
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh respond and are on a Personnel level
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
responsible to the chairperson of the
 
00:18:08.909 --> 00:18:08.919 align:start position:0%
commission so it's that classic example
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
of what happens when you have two
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
captains of the ship where do you go as
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
a subordinate employee I'm just speaking
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
for myself kind of my own sense of how
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
this would play out because I'm always
 
00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:23.480 align:start position:0%
very responsive to what my uh
 
00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:26.799 align:start position:0%
supervising people are interested in my
 
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
advice for but also to whatever they
 
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
would like me to um do and where they
 
00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
would like to guide me I don't want to
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily find myself as a senior
 
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
adviser in a position of having to um
 
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
deal with contradictory guidance so I I
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
would say that again I would reiterate
 
00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
that to have that setup could create
 
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
problems on a Personnel basis uh at the
 
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission because you
 
00:18:57.149 --> 00:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
would have a junior commissioner who is
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
not a chairperson
 
00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
um operating in this framework you have
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
subordinate employees of which there are
 
00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:06.919 align:start position:0%
not very many in the commission having
 
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:09.400 align:start position:0%
to engage in site evaluation committee
 
00:19:11.909 --> 00:19:11.919 align:start position:0%
business and potentially receiving
 
00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
contradictory direction from two
 
00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
different people it's just the nature of
 
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
things and I would further add that the
 
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
commission by Design is a bipartisan
 
00:19:26.909 --> 00:19:26.919 align:start position:0%
structure so there's often um you you
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
have essentially a
 
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
multiple potential for confusion or lack
 
00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
of clarity on how things are approached
 
00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:37.799 align:start position:0%
may I follow
 
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
up thank you um okay so I I understand
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
what you're what you're
 
00:19:46.149 --> 00:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
saying um
 
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
now Martin hburg was an attorney and I
 
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
think one of the objectives that we had
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
in in requesting that the attorney
 
00:19:56.149 --> 00:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
representative on the Pu be the person
 
00:19:58.510 --> 00:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
who heads up the SEC is because we
 
00:19:59.909 --> 00:19:59.919 align:start position:0%
thought there was a value in having
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
someone with direct adjudicative
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
experience in that role um my
 
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
understanding of the appointment of the
 
00:20:11.149 --> 00:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
current chair of the Pu is that his
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
background he had no background in in
 
00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:18.200 align:start position:0%
energy and no background um that would
 
00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:20.360 align:start position:0%
be relevant to the role that that he's
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
currently presiding in his chair uh
 
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:25.799 align:start position:0%
certainly for site evaluation and so I'm
 
00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
not trying to diminish
 
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
um you know his contribution and his
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
ability and his his business background
 
00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
and all that but I um I think the
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
concern is that we not give all of the
 
00:20:44.549 --> 00:20:44.559 align:start position:0%
responsibility to just the person who
 
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
currently resides in that chairship um
 
00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why someone junior or
 
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
otherwise who serves as a pu
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner couldn't take on those
 
00:20:59.149 --> 00:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
responsibilities especially if they have
 
00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
again the adjudicative U background and
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
also background in New Hampshire's
 
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
energy uh that the other two
 
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.870 align:start position:0%
energy uh that the other two
Commissioners

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
Commissioners
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
possess so it's just it's my perspective
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
that we've had some issues with with
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
legislative directives and the way
 
00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
they've been carried out under the
 
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
interpretations of a person who doesn't
 
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
really have a lot of experience and
 
00:21:22.269 --> 00:21:22.279 align:start position:0%
energy and I have to bring that up in
 
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
the hearing here because we've we've
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
already had
 
00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
to uh rework or undo or go back and try
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
and address issues that have come up
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
before the Pu uh in its current
 
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
formation because it was not um
 
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
interpreted in the way that it was
 
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
intended so so do you have a question
 
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
for yeah I mean that's what I'm saying
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
I'm saying uh identifying having a
 
00:21:54.029 --> 00:21:54.039 align:start position:0%
judicative experience directly as being
 
00:21:55.789 --> 00:21:55.799 align:start position:0%
the chair for the SEC which is a
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
separate process uh it's not part of the
 
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:01.640 align:start position:0%
Pu it's just that the Pu has always been
 
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
part of you know has always participated
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
in that board in that committee um I I
 
00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm asking is what relevant
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
experience you think the current chair
 
00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
brings to the SEC
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
process um that would make it important
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
for him to be in charge of both I don't
 
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
think you need to answer that question I
 
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
I think that question is kind of
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
irrelevant to the subject we're
 
00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:30.559 align:start position:0%
discussing here we're trying to come up
 
00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
with a process that will
 
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
work uh going
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
forward and so we don't need to to
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
discuss the personalities or the the
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
qualifications of the current employees
 
00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:48.200 align:start position:0%
of the of the commission or the SEC what
 
00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do here is create a
 
00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:53.480 align:start position:0%
process that will allow whoever is
 
00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
serving and whoever is appointed
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
remembering that these appointment are
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
typically made by the governor right and
 
00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:02.559 align:start position:0%
Council and I think I guess my point is
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
to go back to the the point that is
 
00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
being presented to us is that
 
00:23:10.269 --> 00:23:10.279 align:start position:0%
administratively it would be messy if
 
00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:12.200 align:start position:0%
the head of the SEC is not the same as
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
the head of the Pu and my question is
 
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
really give us some details of that
 
00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
because I I I just think you gave us an
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
example where you headed up an SEC
 
00:23:27.149 --> 00:23:27.159 align:start position:0%
proceeding and reported back to the
 
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
chair of the people you see and didn't
 
00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:33.039 align:start position:0%
run into any problems so uh I just don't
 
00:23:35.549 --> 00:23:35.559 align:start position:0%
see how the configuration that we've
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
work yes if you have any details that
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
yes or examples of how such an
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
arrangement could be difficult we'd love
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
to hear those so I would just like to
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
reiterate that especially in the current
 
00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
structure because in the old puc that
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
was combined with the department of
 
00:23:59.909 --> 00:23:59.919 align:start position:0%
energy was a bigger
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
agency um essentially had all the
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
Personnel under the rubric of the Public
 
00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission and you had
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
intermediary management personnel with
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
titles such as executive director and
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
general counsel and so forth um but here
 
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
it's a very small flat agency so I
 
00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
report directly to the
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
chairman uh Mr uh Dan goldner so it's a
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
very direct connection and I think the
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
answer that was provided by
 
00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:32.039 align:start position:0%
representative Vose was well we're going
 
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
to expect the senior advisers at the
 
00:24:36.389 --> 00:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission you know we
 
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
have a lot of expertise in this area um
 
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of experience we're going to be
 
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
expected to help out the state through
 
00:24:45.389 --> 00:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee through
 
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
the analytical process and the legal
 
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
analysis process and the leg work
 
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
process of preparing the orders and so
 
00:24:53.269 --> 00:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
forth so if you
 
00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:55.720 align:start position:0%
have if you're putting those employees
 
00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
in a position where you're report
 
00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
according to a junior commissioner
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
instead of your chairperson and I'm
 
00:25:02.669 --> 00:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
talking about the future I think
 
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
representative V was exactly on target
 
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
with that I'm talking about 20 years in
 
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
the future and it's not necessarily
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
about me personally it's about the
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
future subordinate employees of the
 
00:25:14.029 --> 00:25:14.039 align:start position:0%
commission as it's currently constituted
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
they could be put in an uncomfortable or
 
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
confusing situation and regarding the
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
qualifications of the current chairman
 
00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
or someone like that in the future um he
 
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
is a business exec ative of 35 years
 
00:25:33.389 --> 00:25:33.399 align:start position:0%
experience in the semiconductor industry
 
00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
in the defense industry uh he's a very
 
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
highly educated electrical engineer he
 
00:25:41.389 --> 00:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
has a lot of insight on how
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
international business works and how
 
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
business at large works so there are
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
skill sets beyond the attorney skill set
 
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
that can offer a lot to the site
 
00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
evaluation Committee in future for
 
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
instance we could have a research
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
scientist a physicist or someone like
 
00:25:58.909 --> 00:25:58.919 align:start position:0%
that who would serve as chairperson of
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
the SEC and they wouldn't necessarily be
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
the attorney but as
 
00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
a as a captain of the ship as a leader
 
00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039 align:start position:0%
of the agency they could provide a lot
 
00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
of assistance to the SEC effort and
 
00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
reassure their subordinate employees
 
00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
that when they're helping out on that
 
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
they're getting clear Direction on what
 
00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
to do so I would encourage consideration
 
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
of that point um um representative Vose
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
do you think uh you I've answered all
 
00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
your questions I think you have thank
 
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
you now there may be other questions
 
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
from other members here so
 
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington for example
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you thank you for
 
00:26:36.669 --> 00:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question it's nice to see you
 
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
again too same here thank you it's been
 
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
a long time um I I think on what I'm
 
00:26:42.909 --> 00:26:42.919 align:start position:0%
trying to see here is that you're
 
00:26:44.389 --> 00:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
talking about the when you go down the
 
00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
middle of the page five there it says
 
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
senior serving attorney member of the
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission Shall Serve
 
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:50.750 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission Shall Serve
as

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
chairperson and as chief executive of
 
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:54.549 align:start position:0%
chairperson and as chief executive of
the

00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
committee but then the committee is is
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
attached to the Department of energy
 
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:01.240 align:start position:0%
administratively is that where the
 
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
confusion part is coming from and also
 
00:27:05.549 --> 00:27:05.559 align:start position:0%
so followup to that maybe it's in here
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
someplace that I'm missing it but I
 
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
don't see anybody being named chair of
 
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee there's
 
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:13.559 align:start position:0%
just the members are listed but no one
 
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
is listed as chair so if that was
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
defined as let's just say for example
 
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
the the chair of the Pu would that make
 
00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:23.480 align:start position:0%
this more operable for you in this way
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
or is the fact that it's
 
00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:26.360 align:start position:0%
administratively assigned to the
 
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
Department of energy causing the
 
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
confusion if it is I missed it can you
 
00:27:34.029 --> 00:27:34.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
is you just
 
00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
read the senior serving member of the
 
00:27:41.509 --> 00:27:41.519 align:start position:0%
public utilities the senior serving
 
00:27:42.909 --> 00:27:42.919 align:start position:0%
member of the Public Utilities
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
Commission shall Ser oh okay I I thought
 
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
that minute I thought I I read that as a
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
staff attorney not the fact that one of
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners is an attorney that's
 
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
what you're referring to okay all right
 
00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
so that's what so what we're discing so
 
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
forget about that then the confusion
 
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
factor is that you have
 
00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:00.200 align:start position:0%
people that is it attached to the
 
00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
Department of energy but your the
 
00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.750 align:start position:0%
Department of energy but your the
whatever

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
this you have people working for the
 
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:08.440 align:start position:0%
commission at the same time is that
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
where the confusions com from um I don't
 
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
think so representative Harrington I I
 
00:28:14.509 --> 00:28:14.519 align:start position:0%
just read the language a few moments ago
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
was presented to me just a few moments
 
00:28:18.669 --> 00:28:18.679 align:start position:0%
ago to to the room so to speak and uh I
 
00:28:21.509 --> 00:28:21.519 align:start position:0%
will offer this that the same rubric of
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
being attached to the administratively
 
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
attached to the Department of energy
 
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
pertains to the Public Utilities
 
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
Commission itself under sb2 so that
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
means the mechanics of for example we
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
have Personnel over in the department of
 
00:28:34.269 --> 00:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
energy that help us out with our
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
business office needs so for instance
 
00:28:38.509 --> 00:28:38.519 align:start position:0%
things such as reimbursement of travel
 
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
expenses and uh Human Resources type
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
things such as health insurance and
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
things like that so I think that's what
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
that refers to and perhaps the new
 
00:28:50.509 --> 00:28:50.519 align:start position:0%
Personnel um the administrator coming
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
into the P Mothership so to speak also
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
being able to make use of the
 
00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
administrative attachment to the
 
00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
Department of energy the department of
 
00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
energy also does more mundane things for
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
us such as I believe office supplies
 
00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
acquisition of some of that material and
 
00:29:07.149 --> 00:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
things of that nature okay all right and
 
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
just one followup I think you know I I
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
think it' be easy to make the mistake
 
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
that I just made because when you refer
 
00:29:15.789 --> 00:29:15.799 align:start position:0%
to a member of the Public Utilities
 
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
Commission that can always be looked at
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
as anybody that works for the commission
 
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
not just Commissioners normally when we
 
00:29:24.909 --> 00:29:24.919 align:start position:0%
refer to Commissioners we we spell it
 
00:29:26.149 --> 00:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
out so it would have to be something
 
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
like the senior the commissioner who's
 
00:29:32.029 --> 00:29:32.039 align:start position:0%
the senior serving attorney of the
 
00:29:33.549 --> 00:29:33.559 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission so it's
 
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:34.600 align:start position:0%
clear that we're talking about a
 
00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:36.559 align:start position:0%
commissioner here and not I read it as
 
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:38.440 align:start position:0%
the senior attorney that worked for the
 
00:29:41.149 --> 00:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
commission not being a commissioner so I
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
think that would help clarify it thank
 
00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
you that's a good clarification thank
 
00:29:48.389 --> 00:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
you representative Corman do you have a
 
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh and
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
actually this is probably more of a
 
00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559 align:start position:0%
question for the chair but uh you
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
referred to
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
um uh the possibility of of designes of
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
the uh pu serving on the site evaluation
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
commission as I think I heard you say
 
00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
that well that was in the past that was
 
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
in 2015 when we had the subcommittee
 
00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:14.360 align:start position:0%
structure and I believe we still have it
 
00:30:17.549 --> 00:30:17.559 align:start position:0%
in theory now but in you it appears that
 
00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
in the latest you know this subcommittee
 
00:30:21.549 --> 00:30:21.559 align:start position:0%
question has gone through some to and
 
00:30:24.909 --> 00:30:24.919 align:start position:0%
fro over the last uh year or so and it
 
00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:27.320 align:start position:0%
seems that now you're toggling into the
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
no category on the subcommittee question
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
right right so I just want to verify uh
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
I guess with with the chair uh as I read
 
00:30:37.509 --> 00:30:37.519 align:start position:0%
the current draft it doesn't even admit
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
for designes of the Pu Commissioners it
 
00:30:43.509 --> 00:30:43.519 align:start position:0%
would just be the three pu Commissioners
 
00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:46.919 align:start position:0%
yes correct okay thank you um I do have
 
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
a separate well a comment more than a
 
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
question um I'm just thinking about this
 
00:30:55.629 --> 00:30:55.639 align:start position:0%
this issue of let's say authority of of
 
00:30:58.990 --> 00:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
a subordinate commissioner serving as
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
chair of the
 
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
SEC when when it's not necess yes
 
00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
serving as chair of the SEC and not
 
00:31:08.909 --> 00:31:08.919 align:start position:0%
necessarily the puc chair so that you
 
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
sort of have an inversion there
 
00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:14.559 align:start position:0%
um it's not directly relevant but I just
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
want to point out I I I chaired
 
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
departments uh at Dartmouth for 10 years
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
and we would often have committees
 
00:31:25.629 --> 00:31:25.639 align:start position:0%
within the Departments and I we'd have a
 
00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
chair of the committee who wasn't me as
 
00:31:30.509 --> 00:31:30.519 align:start position:0%
as department chair and I would serve on
 
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
the committee and you know I can just
 
00:31:34.629 --> 00:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
say there there was never an issue was
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
clear what the lines of authority were
 
00:31:40.029 --> 00:31:40.039 align:start position:0%
within that Committee of the department
 
00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:41.240 align:start position:0%
and it was clear what the lines of
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
authority were within the department as
 
00:31:46.509 --> 00:31:46.519 align:start position:0%
a whole so I think this can be worked
 
00:31:48.669 --> 00:31:48.679 align:start position:0%
out and you know I just don't really see
 
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:54.629 --> 00:31:54.639 align:start position:0%
here all right well this seems to be an
 
00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
issue that needs further discussion so I
 
00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
want to thank you Mr spidel for being
 
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
here and giving giving us your
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
perspective thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:03.880 align:start position:0%
I'd like to hear maybe from the
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
Department of energy uh Mr Elms and Mr
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
shulock if you could give us your
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
perspective on this question of whether
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
having the senior serving attorney
 
00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:18.039 align:start position:0%
member of the Public Utilities
 
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
Commission or serve as the
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%

chairperson and chief chief executive of
the

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:29.629 --> 00:32:29.639 align:start position:0%
SEC is a conflict a good idea a bad idea
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
what do you think sure uh for the record
 
00:32:33.389 --> 00:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
Chris Elms Deputy Commissioner of the
 
00:32:34.629 --> 00:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of energy and
 
00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
I'm joined by David shulock our general
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
counsel um I'd like to preface my
 
00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:41.240 align:start position:0%
comments by saying that I think Carlton
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
Simpson is a fabulous job uh in his
 
00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
current role I think he'd be a fabulous
 
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
chairman of any committee or
 
00:32:47.549 --> 00:32:47.559 align:start position:0%
commissioner whatever you put him in
 
00:32:50.509 --> 00:32:50.519 align:start position:0%
charge of but I personally and and again
 
00:32:52.629 --> 00:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
doe we're not a part of this this is
 
00:32:54.909 --> 00:32:54.919 align:start position:0%
just our perspective as fellow state
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
agencies and and with some so certainly
 
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
experience uh in this realm when when it
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
was at when we were the Pu um we would
 
00:33:05.629 --> 00:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
be opposed to this provision I think you
 
00:33:07.549 --> 00:33:07.559 align:start position:0%
know when we saw the language we were a
 
00:33:09.789 --> 00:33:09.799 align:start position:0%
little bit you know kind of questioning
 
00:33:12.269 --> 00:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
what is the problem that we're here to
 
00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
solve you know I I I'm sure you all have
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
the same experience that I have which is
 
00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:19.880 align:start position:0%
experience with chairman of various
 
00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
committees commissions whatever who
 
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
aren't attorneys who do an excellent job
 
00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure we've all dealt with
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
attorneys who and you know no all due
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
respect to the attorneys in the room
 
00:33:31.549 --> 00:33:31.559 align:start position:0%
including the one to my right but who
 
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
can get bogged down in minutia or
 
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be who might not be
 
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
the most effective um in an adjudicative
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
session um setting uh and and frankly I
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
don't think an attorney Alone um has
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily A judicative experience
 
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
Beyond um you know someone else I think
 
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh you
 
00:33:57.669 --> 00:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
know what I've heard here here is that
 
00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
part of what we're looking at in terms
 
00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:02.519 align:start position:0%
of making this change is uh in part due
 
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
to ideological misalignment with the
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
current chairman of the Public Utilities
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
Commission um I don't know of any
 
00:34:10.829 --> 00:34:10.839 align:start position:0%
problems that the SEC has had in terms
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
of their fulfilling their adjudicative
 
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
responsibilities uh there was an example
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
used that the legislature has had to
 
00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
come in and fix things uh the one
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
example I can think of is obviously
 
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill 549 which our agency was uh
 
00:34:27.149 --> 00:34:27.159 align:start position:0%
you know involved in the in the draft
 
00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:29.240 align:start position:0%
and passage of with the legislature
 
00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:31.839 align:start position:0%
including folks in the room uh I I would
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
point out that the decision that that
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
was in response to was made under uh a
 
00:34:37.629 --> 00:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
chairman who was an attorney and no
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
longer works at the commission uh so I I
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
don't see how that would be a relevant
 
00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
example in this case of solving um you
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
know a problem with an attorney not
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
doing a great job um you know the way we
 
00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:55.480 align:start position:0%
see it is that the individual matters
 
00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:57.640 align:start position:0%
and that you know the way it's been set
 
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
up with the Pu and the SEC has been
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
successful the venue for issues related
 
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
to Personnel uh would probably be more
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the governor and Council
 
00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
and not uh legislation um obviously the
 
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
legislature has the prerogative to do
 
00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
what you'd
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
like but I think you might want to ask
 
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
yourself whether or not legislating on
 
00:35:22.109 --> 00:35:22.119 align:start position:0%
the basis of an
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
individual um who has a term and you
 
00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
know there is a process to to go through
 
00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:32.440 align:start position:0%
that and that is uh the governor and
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
councel uh David do you have anything
 
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
that you want to add to that
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
no nothing to add representative
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
Harrington has a question thank you and
 
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question just as
 
00:35:44.829 --> 00:35:44.839 align:start position:0%
a based on your experience I'm wondering
 
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
if this creates a bit of confusion as
 
00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
well we have the uh what we now know is
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
the commission the Pu commissioner who's
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
the senior serving attorney Shall Serve
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
as is the chief executive officer of the
 
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:01.160 align:start position:0%
committee um and list all the things he
 
00:36:03.069 --> 00:36:03.079 align:start position:0%
does but then we talk about the
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
administrator and the administrator she
 
00:36:07.109 --> 00:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
be hired by and under the supervision of
 
00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
the chairperson of the Public Utilities
 
00:36:11.309 --> 00:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
Commission who in many cases might not
 
00:36:14.349 --> 00:36:14.359 align:start position:0%
be the senior attorney and he duties as
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
assigned and extent blah blah blah blah
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
so you have administrator who reports to
 
00:36:20.829 --> 00:36:20.839 align:start position:0%
the chair of the Pu and then you have an
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
SEC who was chaired by someone other
 
00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:25.640 align:start position:0%
than the chair of the Pu does that build
 
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
in confusion in your mind yeah and and I
 
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
would say that it's you know as as
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
attorney spidel alluded to nothing is
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
insurmountable and if the general court
 
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:36.040 align:start position:0%
wants to go in that direction I'm sure
 
00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
they will figure it out um but it does
 
00:36:41.309 --> 00:36:41.319 align:start position:0%
introduce a level of structural
 
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
awkwardness that is is just going to
 
00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
make the process less efficient and it's
 
00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
going to make the process a little more
 
00:36:50.069 --> 00:36:50.079 align:start position:0%
difficult to achieve and could lead to a
 
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
situation where folks are not as able to
 
00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
as effectively do their jobs in either
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
the Pu or the the SEC and if you know
 
00:37:03.309 --> 00:37:03.319 align:start position:0%
for us as we see it uh is the juice
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
worth the squeeze right is the problem
 
00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
that you're solving going to be balanced
 
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
out by the difficulties you're
 
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
introducing I I would say no but
 
00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
prerogative anything to add Mr
 
00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
shulok um I I think I would add that it
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
it is going to be very confusing for
 
00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
employees at the Pu to understand which
 
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
Master they should listen to um and the
 
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
the system that you're setting up
 
00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:38.200 align:start position:0%
depends upon those two masters getting
 
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
along communicating well with one
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
another and agreeing on how um the pu's
 
00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
assets um Personnel assets will will be
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
utilized right and it's wonderful when
 
00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
those three Commissioners get along but
 
00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:56.920 align:start position:0%
I can tell you they don't always I have
 
00:37:59.950 --> 00:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
witnessed it it is paralyzing and you
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
could paralyze two agencies um by having
 
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
disagreement among the two chiefs so
 
00:38:10.309 --> 00:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
it's really something I would recommend
 
00:38:13.349 --> 00:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
against as a um
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
open so to follow up on representative
 
00:38:21.069 --> 00:38:21.079 align:start position:0%
Harrington's question if the puc
 
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner is responsible
 
00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
for supervising the
 
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
employee who is
 
00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
occasionally design designated to be the
 
00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:35.829 align:start position:0%
occasionally design designated to be the
SEC

00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
administrator could
 
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
he cause problems by not allowing that
 
00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.950 align:start position:0%
he cause problems by not allowing that
person

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
to serve an adequate amount of time to
 
00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:50.200 align:start position:0%
serve the the position that he's being
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
asked to serve as SEC administrator I I
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
do think that's what you're setting up
 
00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
so you know
 
00:38:59.470 --> 00:38:59.480 align:start position:0%
part of the the thinking of this is you
 
00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
bring the administrator inside so that
 
00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
um there is no downtime for that
 
00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
employee right um that their extra time
 
00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
is covered by work at the Pu and paid
 
00:39:14.829 --> 00:39:14.839 align:start position:0%
for by the assessment right so uh so
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
that there's a free flow of money that's
 
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
the Pu
 
00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
Chairman's prerogative right
 
00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:26.200 align:start position:0%
so they're going to be a that chair
 
00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
person is going to be assigning work to
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
be done at the Pu right and could just
 
00:39:36.309 --> 00:39:36.319 align:start position:0%
load it up
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
right thank you the SEC chair could do
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
the same right and then you're just you
 
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
know if they're if you assume that
 
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to get along and they're
 
00:39:48.109 --> 00:39:48.119 align:start position:0%
going to communicate and you know there
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
are enough hours to go around
 
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
everything's wonderful but TR trust me
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
they don't
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
always okay representative Harrington as
 
00:39:59.470 --> 00:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
I would agree with that last statement
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
been there and lived it um I think we're
 
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
kind of chasing a red herring here I
 
00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
mean we somehow we're coming with the
 
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
assumption that the chair of the Pu is
 
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
not qualified to run to be chair of the
 
00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee yet he's been
 
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
appointed chair of the Pu which is going
 
00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
to be meeting on a much more regular
 
00:40:19.309 --> 00:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
basis having a lot more money involved
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
in it and they've been appointed by the
 
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:22.280 align:start position:0%
governor confirmed by the executive
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
counsel as being able to fulfill the
 
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
duties of the chair of the Pu so to say
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
that somehow because he's not a lawyer
 
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
if that's the case he's not allowed to
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
be able to fulfill the duties of the
 
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
fite evaluation committee I think he's a
 
00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:36.440 align:start position:0%
red hering we're chasing we just should
 
00:40:38.309 --> 00:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
there's no need for this put one person
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
in charge and if that person happens to
 
00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:41.960 align:start position:0%
be a lawyer great if he's not he's got
 
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
great legal staff that he can contact I
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
just think this is a problem that
 
00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
solve okay do either of you have a
 
00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:58.349 align:start position:0%
 
gentlemen

00:40:58.349 --> 00:40:58.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.069 --> 00:41:01.079 align:start position:0%
all right thank you we appreciate you
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
being here to answer our questions and I
 
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
reserve the right to call you back as we
 
00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
go through other parts of this
 
00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
legislation to
 
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
clarify other aspects of the amendment
 
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
here so section five under um H3 seems
 
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
to be problematic and we'll have to have
 
00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:27.160 align:start position:0%
a further discussion about what to do
 
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
with that but before we do that let's
 
00:41:31.309 --> 00:41:31.319 align:start position:0%
move on and talk about some of the other
 
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
changes that this draft
 
00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:37.880 align:start position:0%
makes um so that we can decide whether
 
00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
or not certain language stays or certain
 
00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:44.790 align:start position:0%
or not certain language stays or certain
language

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
goes section six which uh is the very
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
next section of H3 lets the commissioner
 
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Environmental
 
00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
Services designate other
 
00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
people to serve in his stead on a
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
specific SEC proceeding that person
 
00:42:09.069 --> 00:42:09.079 align:start position:0%
could be an employee from the Department
 
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
of Transportation the Department of
 
00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
Natural and cultural resources the
 
00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Business and economic
 
00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
Affairs etc
 
00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
etc that is a change from
 
00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
existing statute it would be necess
 
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
necessitated by the reduction of
 
00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
an SEC of nine members down to five
 
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
members do you see that as as being
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
useful or do we need to ask questions
 
00:42:36.319 --> 00:42:37.309 align:start position:0%
useful or do we need to ask questions
about

00:42:37.309 --> 00:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
Corman yeah um I have no objection to
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
that my only concern is that uh I found
 
00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
the language potentially ambiguous as to
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
whether the design would be uh in
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
addition to the dees commissioner or in
 
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
in instead of the the dees commissioner
 
00:43:00.309 --> 00:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
and i' I'd like the wording to make it
 
00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:01.839 align:start position:0%
clear that we're talking about somebody
 
00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:06.200 align:start position:0%
who would be substituting for the dees
 
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner okay that's that's a good
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
point uh I I think the intent of
 
00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
the paragraph is to allow the dees
 
00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:24.589 --> 00:43:24.599 align:start position:0%
substitute someone else for himself but
 
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
we we will get clarification on
 
00:43:31.549 --> 00:43:31.559 align:start position:0%
that representative Harrington yeah just
 
00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
to follow up on that same paragraph I
 
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
think that's a good point I had the same
 
00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
question it wasn't clear if it was in
 
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
addition to but I think it the intent is
 
00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
here in place of um this seems to give
 
00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
the uh unilateral authority to the
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Dees to decide I'm out
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
but the Department of Natural Resources
 
00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:53.720 align:start position:0%
and natural and cultural resources is in
 
00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:55.720 align:start position:0%
um of course they'd have to agree to do
 
00:43:59.230 --> 00:43:59.240 align:start position:0%
it but but um I'm just wondering if we
 
00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
would want to have the commission make
 
00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
that that the SEC make that decision
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
that a recommendation by the department
 
00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
of environmental resources commissioner
 
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
saying in this particular case I think
 
00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation would
 
00:44:12.829 --> 00:44:12.839 align:start position:0%
be better represented but be more more
 
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
helpful than um the uh Dees on the
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
commission so I'm recommending to the
 
00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
commission to the SEC that they replace
 
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
me with them it just seems to make a
 
00:44:26.589 --> 00:44:26.599 align:start position:0%
little bit more sense that we have since
 
00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
we are talking about a major change here
 
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
because it's not saying that the dees
 
00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner if they're going to just
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
say which happens many times on the side
 
00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
of valuation committee I simply can't
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
make this as commissioner so I'm going
 
00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
to appoint my senior staff member in Li
 
00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:42.200 align:start position:0%
of me but he's still a department member
 
00:44:45.069 --> 00:44:45.079 align:start position:0%
who reports to me uh this says I'm going
 
00:44:47.069 --> 00:44:47.079 align:start position:0%
to repoint someone from a totally
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
different oops totally different
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
department which I have no authority
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
over and they're going to come in and
 
00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
have now have a vote and I just think
 
00:44:55.549 --> 00:44:55.559 align:start position:0%
that should be subject to review of the
 
00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
commission as a whole of this SEC as a
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
whole so if we added language to the end
 
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:02.200 align:start position:0%
of that paragraph that said subject to
 
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
approval of the full committee yeah
 
00:45:06.109 --> 00:45:06.119 align:start position:0%
would that address your
 
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:09.640 align:start position:0%
issues okay thank you further comment on
 
00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:10.390 align:start position:0%
issues okay thank you further comment on
this

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:17.240 align:start position:0%
section okay next is the uh 162 H3 D
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
administrator and other committee
 
00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
support now this is language that
 
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
changes the current SEC administrator
 
00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:29.480 align:start position:0%
from a full-time employee of the
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
SEC even though he's paid for by the
 
00:45:35.069 --> 00:45:35.079 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission to a
 
00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
full-time employee of the Public
 
00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:39.079 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission who can float
 
00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
between duties at the Pu and the
 
00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:44.589 align:start position:0%
between duties at the Pu and the
secc

00:45:44.589 --> 00:45:44.599 align:start position:0%
secc
 
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
and this is one of the I think more
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
important changes that we can make to
 
00:45:53.549 --> 00:45:53.559 align:start position:0%
streamline the operation of the
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
SEC I think we should go forward with
 
00:45:59.710 --> 00:45:59.720 align:start position:0%
this uh with this change unless there is
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
any objection or I heard this morning
 
00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:04.829 align:start position:0%
any objection or I heard this morning
was

00:46:04.829 --> 00:46:04.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
that please turn on your mic thank you
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um yeah what what what we
 
00:46:11.549 --> 00:46:11.559 align:start position:0%
heard just briefly this morning was that
 
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
it might be problematic if the schedule
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
of that administrator is loaded up by
 
00:46:18.549 --> 00:46:18.559 align:start position:0%
the Pu right if they find a bunch of
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
work for them then they may not may not
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
have time to do the SEC work so we
 
00:46:25.069 --> 00:46:25.079 align:start position:0%
probably do need to legislatively figure
 
00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
out what we can put in here to ensure
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
that when there's an
 
00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
SEC project that that administrator is
 
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
allowed to devote their time you know
 
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
sufficient time to that project because
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise it will not be properly
 
00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:41.800 align:start position:0%
supported any ideas any ideas follow on
 
00:46:45.069 --> 00:46:45.079 align:start position:0%
that I think if we um if if we address
 
00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:47.240 align:start position:0%
the issue that I brought up earlier and
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
let's just say we go with the
 
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
chairperson of the Pu being the head of
 
00:46:54.069 --> 00:46:54.079 align:start position:0%
the SEC and the Pu that will correct
 
00:46:56.069 --> 00:46:56.079 align:start position:0%
that problem because one person is not
 
00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
going to say you got to work 35 hours a
 
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
week on this project for the Pu but I'm
 
00:47:03.549 --> 00:47:03.559 align:start position:0%
also telling you to work 35 hours a week
 
00:47:05.349 --> 00:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
for this project on the SEC because
 
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:07.480 align:start position:0%
making a singular person have the
 
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
authority for both will eliminate the
 
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
problem it's a legitimate concern the
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
way it's written but I think that'll get
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
that'll eliminate it yeah that's a good
 
00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:16.309 align:start position:0%
that'll eliminate it yeah that's a good
point

00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:47:19.109 --> 00:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
um having the Pu commissioner be the
 
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
chair of the would eliminate that
 
00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.710 align:start position:0%
chair of the would eliminate that
problem

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
agreed representative Corman thank you
 
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:30.200 align:start position:0%
um might it be worth actually including
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
in the statute language saying that the
 
00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
administrator uh shall prioritize work
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:54.720 --> 00:48:01.069 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:48:01.069 --> 00:48:01.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
that language seems reasonable at first
 
00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
blush but if the Pu commissioner is the
 
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:16.589 --> 00:48:16.599 align:start position:0%
employee then the employee himself can't
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
prioritize right his work on the SEC it
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
would have to be the
 
00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner himself who prioritized
 
00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
this person's work on the SEC
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
I I would I think what I'm hearing from
 
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
representative Corman is the idea that
 
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
the administrator who is currently an
 
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
SEC resource and is now being asked to
 
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
take on puc work in the time that he's
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
idle that there has to be some language
 
00:48:45.549 --> 00:48:45.559 align:start position:0%
in here that basically states that his
 
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
role is that support role and that that
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
should take priority maybe he can't make
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
it a priority but we should maybe state
 
00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
that his his priority job is support of
 
00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
the SEC and his additional time will be
 
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
taken up with pu duties uh as he is
 
00:49:08.349 --> 00:49:08.359 align:start position:0%
available right so so so
 
00:49:11.069 --> 00:49:11.079 align:start position:0%
something um something that states that
 
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
SEC comes first in terms of why he was
 
00:49:15.309 --> 00:49:15.319 align:start position:0%
hired and what his job is right and that
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:26.390 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:38.589 --> 00:49:38.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:44.349 --> 00:49:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
be but says that the position may be
 
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
filled by an independent contractor as
 
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's currently worded because it because
 
00:49:53.789 --> 00:49:53.799 align:start position:0%
it won't necessarily always be the same
 
00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
person as we were discussing in the
 
00:49:58.030 --> 00:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
other sections but this definition goes
 
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
on to the second page and it basically
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
says uh the chair um reports is under
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
the supervision of the chairperson of
 
00:50:08.789 --> 00:50:08.799 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission shall
 
00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
perform duties for the Public Utilities
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
Commission and the site evaluation
 
00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:15.640 align:start position:0%
committee as directed by the chairperson
 
00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
of the Pu so maybe it should be site
 
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
um I think there should be a statement
 
00:50:29.549 --> 00:50:29.559 align:start position:0%
that this person is a resource to the
 
00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee first I don't
 
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
know how we're going to word it
 
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
but okay so change the priority to make
 
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
SEC first
 
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
duties and work on other yeah secondary
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:02.589 --> 00:51:02.599 align:start position:0%
responsibilities just another comment on
 
00:51:05.309 --> 00:51:05.319 align:start position:0%
that section well going along with the
 
00:51:07.069 --> 00:51:07.079 align:start position:0%
having the two separate people be in
 
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
charge because we've also say here now
 
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
any person hired by the administrator
 
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
shall be approved by the chairperson of
 
00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission so as
 
00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
written the chair of the site evaluation
 
00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
committee would not approve the hiring
 
00:51:22.789 --> 00:51:22.799 align:start position:0%
of outside contractors for the site
 
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee but the chair of
 
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
the Pu would so I think it's that's
 
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
another example why we have to make
 
00:51:34.789 --> 00:51:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
same okay good
 
00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
point any other problems with the
 
00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
language in this section yes
 
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative Corman yes I think I
 
00:51:47.549 --> 00:51:47.559 align:start position:0%
noted this uh in email I sent around to
 
00:51:50.309 --> 00:51:50.319 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee really minor thing the
 
00:51:53.069 --> 00:51:53.079 align:start position:0%
stricken material at the end of this
 
00:51:56.309 --> 00:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
section actually is in is stricken but
 
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
from the wrong section it should be from
 
00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
h3a where is that so the the the
 
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
stricken material that starts in the
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
case of a public member yeah the
 
00:52:17.829 --> 00:52:17.839 align:start position:0%
procedure outlined in RSA Etc that here
 
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
it appears at the end of section
 
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
h3a but in current statute it's actually
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
at the end of section H3
 
00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
B yeah but the actual text that's
 
00:52:34.789 --> 00:52:34.799 align:start position:0%
stricken if you look at the current
 
00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:37.480 align:start position:0%
statute it's not at the end of h3a it's
 
00:52:39.309 --> 00:52:39.319 align:start position:0%
at the end of H3 I'm I'm just saying
 
00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:41.960 align:start position:0%
that this is this needs to be moved uh
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
it's going to be stricken but it needs
 
00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:44.680 align:start position:0%
to be moved to the correct place where
 
00:52:46.349 --> 00:52:46.359 align:start position:0%
it's going to be stricken which is at
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
H3 I made a note of that so talk the
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:58.510 align:start position:0%
 
all

00:52:58.510 --> 00:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:01.720 align:start position:0%
right the next
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
section can I ask a question on that oh
 
00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
yes of course thanks um I was looking at
 
00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
that earlier and my question is is there
 
00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
a point to people having training in
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
terms of what they're doing on the site
 
00:53:14.589 --> 00:53:14.599 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee that we're saying
 
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
they don't need any training they're
 
00:53:18.510 --> 00:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
just going to make make decisions on I
 
00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
mean I I think the decisions are
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
supposed to be objectively made based on
 
00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
the findings of what's presented to the
 
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
committee but is there any benefit to
 
00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
the training that we're
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
eliminating the training was added to
 
00:53:35.109 --> 00:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
statute and I remember this well because
 
00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:37.160 align:start position:0%
I sponsored the amendment that added
 
00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:39.559 align:start position:0%
that section to the
 
00:53:42.589 --> 00:53:42.599 align:start position:0%
statute was aimed primarily at the
 
00:53:42.599 --> 00:53:43.910 align:start position:0%
statute was aimed primarily at the
public

00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
members and was
 
00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
also aimed at dealing with the churn
 
00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
where there were there was an on some
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
occasions as many as 40 different people
 
00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
serving on the site evaluation committee
 
00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
all with different training and
 
00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
expertise and so this this part of the
 
00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:09.160 align:start position:0%
statute was added when when we had that
 
00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
chur in situation the changes that we're
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
seeking to make here would eliminate
 
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
that churn and therefore potentially
 
00:54:18.549 --> 00:54:18.559 align:start position:0%
eliminate the need for the training
 
00:54:18.559 --> 00:54:21.190 align:start position:0%
eliminate the need for the training
thank

00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:26.200 align:start position:0%
you okay next is um
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:38.549 --> 00:54:38.559 align:start position:0%
um would keep hb4 the public members
 
00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
section whereas it would have been
 
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
repealed under the previous version we
 
00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
did skip the hb4a subcommittee repeal
 
00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
discuss that coming out FAS that's next
 
00:54:53.789 --> 00:54:53.799 align:start position:0%
what's that that's next oh okay I
 
00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:59.150 --> 00:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
that's next what do you mean that's next
 
00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:02.200 align:start position:0%
oh he's talking about the sub gone away
 
00:55:04.789 --> 00:55:04.799 align:start position:0%
just the subcommittee Sor the
 
00:55:06.190 --> 00:55:06.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittees were repealed because we
 
00:55:07.589 --> 00:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
don't have subcommittees anymore so that
 
00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:12.680 align:start position:0%
section h4a is no longer okay exist
 
00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:13.990 align:start position:0%
section h4a is no longer okay exist
right

00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
okay so that might necessitate a change
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
in numbering
 
00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
yeah or we'll let 's figure that out
 
00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:30.109 --> 00:55:30.119 align:start position:0%
so then the language on public members
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
is basically there to
 
00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
clarify when a public member has to
 
00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
recuse himself or has to be absent
 
00:55:43.349 --> 00:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
Etc that the alternate member would
 
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
would take his
 
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
place on any proceeding that was active
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
at the
 
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
time and um there's also some language
 
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
here about how they get
 
00:55:58.670 --> 00:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
comp compensated for
 
00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:07.400 align:start position:0%
service representative Corman thank you
 
00:56:11.549 --> 00:56:11.559 align:start position:0%
um so when I looked at the uh the list
 
00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:13.480 align:start position:0%
of areas that we are looking for
 
00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
expertise from the public
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
member it's a pretty long list and it
 
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
looks like at least the first item or
 
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
two are Maybe duplic duplicative of what
 
00:56:30.349 --> 00:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
we already have on the SEC especially
 
00:56:32.589 --> 00:56:32.599 align:start position:0%
public deliberative or adjudicative
 
00:56:35.069 --> 00:56:35.079 align:start position:0%
proceedings we already have the Pu
 
00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:37.160 align:start position:0%
Commissioners they they have experience
 
00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
in that area um i' I'd really rather see
 
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
really the Environmental Protection
 
00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:45.720 align:start position:0%
natural resource protection pretty much
 
00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:47.960 align:start position:0%
everything starting from Environmental
 
00:56:50.109 --> 00:56:50.119 align:start position:0%
Protection I think those are the areas
 
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
of expertise that would be not
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
represented on the SEC without a public
 
00:56:54.559 --> 00:56:55.710 align:start position:0%
represented on the SEC without a public
member

00:56:55.710 --> 00:56:55.720 align:start position:0%
member
 
00:56:58.069 --> 00:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure on Miss business
 
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
management I'm lukewarm on that but I I
 
00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:02.680 align:start position:0%
feel like we could remove public
 
00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
deliberative or adjudicative proceedings
 
00:57:07.069 --> 00:57:07.079 align:start position:0%
because we already have that and it's
 
00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
more important to get expertise in the
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
other areas in that list
 
00:57:15.069 --> 00:57:15.079 align:start position:0%
yeah I wouldn't object to that that's
 
00:57:18.349 --> 00:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
sounds reasonable Mr I would go along
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
with getting R of the public defend uh
 
00:57:22.349 --> 00:57:22.359 align:start position:0%
adjudicative proceeding but business
 
00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:23.839 align:start position:0%
management is actually part of the
 
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
evaluation they have to one of the part
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
of the evaluation is can the company
 
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
build the project and so I think
 
00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:38.589 --> 00:57:38.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
too any other further discussion of
 
00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:50.109 --> 00:57:50.119 align:start position:0%
DB all right moving to section H callon
 
00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
5 prohibitions and
 
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
restrictions the significant change here
 
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
is the last four lines which defines
 
00:58:05.069 --> 00:58:05.079 align:start position:0%
what a substantial change or addition
 
00:58:10.589 --> 00:58:10.599 align:start position:0%
means and the language chosen for this
 
00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:14.200 align:start position:0%
definition is a greater than onethird
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
increase in the capital investment
 
00:58:18.789 --> 00:58:18.799 align:start position:0%
capacity footprint or height of an
 
00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
existing energy
 
00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
facility or a change in the energy
 
00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
source for an electric Generating
 
00:58:30.789 --> 00:58:30.799 align:start position:0%
Station or other reuse of a
 
00:58:35.309 --> 00:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
site as an reuse of a site as an energy
 
00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
facility now in a separate document that
 
00:58:40.349 --> 00:58:40.359 align:start position:0%
I handed out to
 
00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:43.400 align:start position:0%
everyone there is a proposal for
 
00:58:47.349 --> 00:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
creating an advanced track or a
 
00:58:49.549 --> 00:58:49.559 align:start position:0%
condensed track a fast
 
00:58:52.109 --> 00:58:52.119 align:start position:0%
track that would allow changes to an
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
existing site to be made more
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
expeditiously in 180 days as opposed to
 
00:58:57.599 --> 00:58:59.150 align:start position:0%
expeditiously in 180 days as opposed to
360

00:58:59.150 --> 00:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
360
 
00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
days and the specifics of the process
 
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
that we're
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
envisioned or are envisioned are set out
 
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
here and the question then becomes do we
 
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:19.880 align:start position:0%
need all of this information in an
 
00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
append in an amendment in statutory
 
00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
language or is this something that the
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
SEC might work out in
 
00:59:34.589 --> 00:59:34.599 align:start position:0%
rules which would indicate that maybe
 
00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
the statutes should say uh the
 
00:59:41.230 --> 00:59:41.240 align:start position:0%
commission will develop rules to handle
 
00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
FastTrack changes to existing facilities
 
00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:45.640 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington yeah yeah
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
having lived through a very very lengthy
 
00:59:49.470 --> 00:59:49.480 align:start position:0%
discussion on what a substantial
 
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
increase is and this is sort of the same
 
00:59:53.309 --> 00:59:53.319 align:start position:0%
thing this idea what constitutes a fast
 
00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
trck I would think the leg legisl should
 
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
give guidance on this and not leave it
 
01:00:00.990 --> 01:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
uh just uh figure it out yourself SEC
 
01:00:02.829 --> 01:00:02.839 align:start position:0%
and go write some rules because that
 
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
could come out like I say I have a bill
 
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
out there now where we the legislature
 
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
passed a section of this bill which
 
01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
directly and only applies to win
 
01:00:13.029 --> 01:00:13.039 align:start position:0%
facilities but when the SEC wrote their
 
01:00:15.029 --> 01:00:15.039 align:start position:0%
rules they applied all those new
 
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
restrictions to every type of facility
 
01:00:19.029 --> 01:00:19.039 align:start position:0%
even though it was never in the law so I
 
01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
don't want to give the uh rulemaking
 
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
that much leeway I think we need to
 
01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:29.950 --> 01:00:29.960 align:start position:0%
okay given that reality I think that
 
01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
this outline of a process for doing a
 
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
FastTrack which is fully two pages
 
01:00:42.029 --> 01:00:42.039 align:start position:0%
long may be beyond our capability to
 
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
produce an amendment for this this year
 
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
and might require the submission of a a
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
new bill in order to make this happen Mr
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
chairman do we have a v vehicle that we
 
01:00:59.430 --> 01:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
could use for updates in the coming
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
year do you know I don't I haven't
 
01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
looked at the LSR list I don't know if
 
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
there are any SEC bills on that list or
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
not however the Senate could submit a
 
01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
bill to do this fast track uh I don't
 
01:01:19.470 --> 01:01:19.480 align:start position:0%
think that maybe this
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
amendment is the place to do
 
01:01:26.069 --> 01:01:26.079 align:start position:0%
this representative Harrington what do
 
01:01:27.549 --> 01:01:27.559 align:start position:0%
you think of the definition of
 
01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
substantial change or addition um I
 
01:01:32.589 --> 01:01:32.599 align:start position:0%
think it's well worked out with I have
 
01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
one question on it though and then this
 
01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
is a u just an aging factor I guess if
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
you want to substantial change talks
 
01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
about greater than onethird increase in
 
01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:43.720 align:start position:0%
the in capital investment well let's say
 
01:01:48.029 --> 01:01:48.039 align:start position:0%
the the uh facility is 30 years old and
 
01:01:51.269 --> 01:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
it was built for $100 million and now
 
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
you want to put in some change that's
 
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
going to cost 80 Mill million so that
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
would not cover a sub be it would be
 
01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
considered a substantial change but if
 
01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:01.240 align:start position:0%
you would have build the original
 
01:02:03.789 --> 01:02:03.799 align:start position:0%
facility today it would cost $800
 
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
million so using that logic it wasn't a
 
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
substantial change so somehow we're
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
going to have to make sure that the
 
01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:12.839 align:start position:0%
capital investment as adjusted for
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
inflation or something because otherwise
 
01:02:17.230 --> 01:02:17.240 align:start position:0%
uh you're going to get an awful lot of
 
01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
things that because things have just
 
01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:21.160 align:start position:0%
gotten so expensive over the last 20 30
 
01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
years that you would be would everyone
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
would look at as being that's not
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
substantial change but it's going to be
 
01:02:28.029 --> 01:02:28.039 align:start position:0%
more than onethird of the original
 
01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
capital costs so you can have adjusted
 
01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
for inflation or something good point
 
01:02:36.029 --> 01:02:36.039 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you uh so I
 
01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:38.200 align:start position:0%
I actually had a similar thought to
 
01:02:42.069 --> 01:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington's thought um
 
01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%
but well we we've agreed in the past on
 
01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
on rare occasion um but I also was
 
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
thinking uh typically the capital
 
01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
investment isn't always just like once
 
01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
at the beginning it's it's you know over
 
01:02:59.309 --> 01:02:59.319 align:start position:0%
a period of time uh I'm just thinking
 
01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
how difficult that would be to actually
 
01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
account for with you know with the
 
01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
discount rate and all that um I had one
 
01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
other comment which is when we talk
 
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
about a onethird increase in say
 
01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
capacity or or yeah name let's say name
 
01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.029 align:start position:0%
capacity or or yeah name let's say name
plate

01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
plate
 
01:03:21.309 --> 01:03:21.319 align:start position:0%
capacity for a large plant a onethird
 
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
increase is a really big increase um for
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
a small plant you know it's not that big
 
01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
a deal but for a large plant a one-third
 
01:03:30.269 --> 01:03:30.279 align:start position:0%
increase could really be a significant
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
increase with a significant impact so
 
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not really sure how to go about that
 
01:03:36.910 --> 01:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
but I feel
 
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
like we might want to have some absolute
 
01:03:43.150 --> 01:03:43.160 align:start position:0%
number a one-third increase or an
 
01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:46.599 align:start position:0%
increase over a certain capacity a
 
01:03:48.670 --> 01:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
certain certain amount of
 
01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
Generation Um and either one would would
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
trigger um well yeah representative
 
01:03:58.990 --> 01:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
McGee My thought might be that the
 
01:04:02.309 --> 01:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
trigger would be if the change at the
 
01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:04.520 align:start position:0%
plant were to increase beyond the name
 
01:04:09.069 --> 01:04:09.079 align:start position:0%
plate capacity by a quarter or more um
 
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
well it could be a third or it could be
 
01:04:14.789 --> 01:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
30% but
 
01:04:19.549 --> 01:04:19.559 align:start position:0%
um to representative corman's point in
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
some cases that's a significant
 
01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:25.190 align:start position:0%
some cases that's a significant
increase

01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
well to use his example let's say it was
 
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
a 30 megawatt solar facility a onethird
 
01:04:37.029 --> 01:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
increase would be 10 y but let's say
 
01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a 700 megawatt gas
 
01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
plant a onethird increase would be much
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:50.109 --> 01:04:50.119 align:start position:0%
so I just comment on this I I would to
 
01:04:52.510 --> 01:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
agree because
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
um if you are talking about increasing
 
01:04:59.870 --> 01:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh by say over 100 megaw I mean we
 
01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:01.640 align:start position:0%
already have a provision that says
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
anything over 30 megawatts new has to go
 
01:05:06.510 --> 01:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
to the site evaluation committee so I
 
01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:08.799 align:start position:0%
would think that that's uh that's a see
 
01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
we've agreed again um but today we got
 
01:05:13.549 --> 01:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
to write this one down um that that
 
01:05:14.829 --> 01:05:14.839 align:start position:0%
that's a good point because you if
 
01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
you're talking about putting in you know
 
01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
if you had that 700 or 900 megawatt gas
 
01:05:22.349 --> 01:05:22.359 align:start position:0%
plant and you increased it by 250 megaw
 
01:05:24.269 --> 01:05:24.279 align:start position:0%
that that's a substantial change I I
 
01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
think and you're talking about you know
 
01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:28.760 align:start position:0%
increasing uh pipeline boiler emissions
 
01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that so some cap I don't
 
01:05:33.269 --> 01:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
know what a logical number would be but
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
it's going to be somewhat
 
01:05:37.470 --> 01:05:37.480 align:start position:0%
arbitrary 100 megawatts not to exceed
 
01:05:39.309 --> 01:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
100 megawatts or not to exceed 50
 
01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
megawatts or something like that would
 
01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
be uh would be something that would be
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
worthwhile putting in because you are
 
01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
opening up something there for I mean
 
01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
let's just say for example CBR decided I
 
01:05:50.829 --> 01:05:50.839 align:start position:0%
don't see how they would do this but
 
01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
this decided they wanted to increase by
 
01:05:56.029 --> 01:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
uh they could increase uh you know 400
 
01:05:58.430 --> 01:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
megaw and uh it would involve new
 
01:06:00.670 --> 01:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
transmission lines and new emissions
 
01:06:02.269 --> 01:06:02.279 align:start position:0%
maybe some new cooling systems or
 
01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
whatever but that's a massive amount of
 
01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
change and this is what this committee
 
01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
is supposed to look at so I'd have to
 
01:06:09.870 --> 01:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
set some cap now what would be rational
 
01:06:11.710 --> 01:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
on that that's one of the things I'd
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
like some input from some of the people
 
01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:15.640 align:start position:0%
in the back of the room that may be
 
01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
contemplating doing something like this
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
but uh I I think something like 100
 
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
megawatts would clearly be something you
 
01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to go over
 
01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:38.309 --> 01:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
question um not specifically on the
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
point that representative Harrington was
 
01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
making but just wanted to um also add I
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
think the issue of the capital
 
01:06:48.109 --> 01:06:48.119 align:start position:0%
investment related to the increase is is
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
problematic and confusing uh as
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative Corman and Harrington
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
pointed out is that you know the point
 
01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
of the original project increased by
 
01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
inflation is it you know the most recent
 
01:07:04.589 --> 01:07:04.599 align:start position:0%
capital investment I I I'm not sure it
 
01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
adds value and I think it confuses the
 
01:07:11.269 --> 01:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
matter um so just wanted to put a fine
 
01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
point uh I I don't have an opinion on
 
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just seeing this for the first time
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh on the you know increase in
 
01:07:20.349 --> 01:07:20.359 align:start position:0%
generating capacity but the I think the
 
01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
capital investment language is
 
01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
atic okay thank you Mr manahan do you
 
01:07:34.029 --> 01:07:34.039 align:start position:0%
have uh some comments to make about this
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
question I noticed that the document
 
01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
called SEC reform condensed tract for
 
01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
changes to existing facilities does have
 
01:07:49.309 --> 01:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
criteria um repowering of a facility can
 
01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
be no larger than existing name plate
 
01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
capacity a project which is expanded or
 
01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
added added to an existing facility may
 
01:07:59.109 --> 01:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
not increase the existing name plate by
 
01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
more than
 
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
50% etc
 
01:08:05.870 --> 01:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
etc it seems to me that for the purposes
 
01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
of creating an amendment here this may
 
01:08:10.750 --> 01:08:10.760 align:start position:0%
be more complicated than what we can
 
01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
accomplish in the next week and a half
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
which we have to do in order to get an
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
amendment ready for an exact session on
 
01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.349 align:start position:0%
amendment ready for an exact session on
November

01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
November
 
01:08:23.829 --> 01:08:23.839 align:start position:0%
6th I kind of agree except that if
 
01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington and Corman are
 
01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
agreeing on so much today anything's
 
01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
possible but um yeah I I I should say I
 
01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
did knowing that we weren't I wasn't
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
sure how far um House Bill 609 was going
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
to go I did speak with Senator Waters
 
01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
during the Senate filing period about
 
01:08:42.510 --> 01:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
potentially filing a bill and I think he
 
01:08:45.669 --> 01:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
filed a title uh to address to address
 
01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
this concept uh which is different a
 
01:08:51.070 --> 01:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
different animal than the substantial or
 
01:08:54.789 --> 01:08:54.799 align:start position:0%
sizable addition um section of it um so
 
01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
um I do
 
01:08:58.870 --> 01:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
think that should be separate tracks for
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
that um and then I what I would observe
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
on the uh sizable addition language that
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
you have before you today um two weeks
 
01:09:08.910 --> 01:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
ago when we met I kind of observed that
 
01:09:12.070 --> 01:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
maybe uh eliminating the
 
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
capital um section of it might make
 
01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
sense for all the reasons that
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
representative Forman and and hary
 
01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
observe trying to guess U the way to say
 
01:09:22.749 --> 01:09:22.759 align:start position:0%
you know is it a fixed dollar amount
 
01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
that you wouldn't want to put in Bill uh
 
01:09:26.669 --> 01:09:26.679 align:start position:0%
you know and if a plant was built 30
 
01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
years ago it's just hard to I think with
 
01:09:31.149 --> 01:09:31.159 align:start position:0%
the other criteria you could the
 
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
commission's capable of figuring out
 
01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:35.560 align:start position:0%
what in the legislature what sizable
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
is so um the other issue I you know I'm
 
01:09:41.149 --> 01:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
seeing again for the first time today
 
01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:43.400 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get my arms around is the
 
01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh restriction on the fuel source um
 
01:09:50.349 --> 01:09:50.359 align:start position:0%
that's included in it uh I I can kind of
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate that but I also know what's
 
01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
in the pipeline uh is probably
 
01:09:59.669 --> 01:09:59.679 align:start position:0%
facilities that you know big facilities
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
that want to add storage or big
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
facilities that want to add solar at a
 
01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
nons siiz um change it would invite you
 
01:10:10.709 --> 01:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to use that U you know
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
if if cwork station was going to put in
 
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
a you know a 30 megawatt um solar
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
project uh that's not sizable comp was
 
01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
it 1300 megaw like yeah so this would be
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
small piece but because there's a
 
01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
different fuel type you wouldn't be able
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
to do it under the uh this the um
 
01:10:35.310 --> 01:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
sizable addition um uh allowance
 
01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
so so you're talking about the language
 
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
that says or a change in the energy
 
01:10:43.870 --> 01:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
source yes yeah okay no I understand
 
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
there's lots
 
01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
of stuff buried in there but as we said
 
01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
before this is not going to be an easy
 
01:10:52.350 --> 01:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
section to write um and then for example
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
if a you in order to comply with
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
reliability expectations if somebody
 
01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to add a a fuel storage tank you
 
01:11:04.990 --> 01:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
know a oil tank at their gas facility um
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh for winter backup it's a different
 
01:11:09.669 --> 01:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
fuel source and so you know again they
 
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to do it uh as a um uh
 
01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
a sizable addition
 
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
allowance and it would take them more
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
than a year to get through the site
 
01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:21.070 align:start position:0%
than a year to get through the site
evaluation

01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
evaluation
 
01:11:23.709 --> 01:11:23.719 align:start position:0%
committee I can see that a change in the
 
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
energy source and fuel source might be
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
different things but you're right it is
 
01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
problematical language I agree y
 
01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative McGee did you have a
 
01:11:37.229 --> 01:11:37.239 align:start position:0%
comment I just uh wanted to ask Mr Mahan
 
01:11:41.149 --> 01:11:41.159 align:start position:0%
if he had heard any Rumblings among the
 
01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
other people who watch uh about the idea
 
01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
of putting in language about
 
01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
non-emitting sources because you seemed
 
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
like you were alluding to different
 
01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
types of fuel that could be added to
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
different facilities it seems that most
 
01:11:58.870 --> 01:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
of the uh plants in the area when
 
01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
they're looking at augmentation or
 
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
storage or reliability they are trying
 
01:12:06.189 --> 01:12:06.199 align:start position:0%
to move toward cleaner sources but um do
 
01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
you think it's appropriate for us to
 
01:12:09.189 --> 01:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
consider any of that in terms of the
 
01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
language here yeah I did talk again this
 
01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
would probably be more in the potential
 
01:12:15.229 --> 01:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
Center Waters build than on the sizeable
 
01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
Edition piece but I did have a good
 
01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
conversation with folks from
 
01:12:20.110 --> 01:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
environmental Community um the end of
 
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
last week to try to get our arms around
 
01:12:23.189 --> 01:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
that I'm a little hesitant to do it
 
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
because I don't know what is an aobc
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
digestor uh admit you know does a
 
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
biomass plant admit um does um a uh the
 
01:12:36.189 --> 01:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
production of um uh renewable natural
 
01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
gas which the legislature endorsed a
 
01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
couple years ago is that admitting so de
 
01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:42.280 align:start position:0%
generally speaking I think everything
 
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
that's coming down the line is cleaner
 
01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
um but I'm not sure that um we know with
 
01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
Precision what it all be that it would
 
01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
that it's best to put that in the
 
01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
statute but I I want to work with people
 
01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
because I'm trying to get everyone to
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
yes on
 
01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
this representative Harrington yeah I
 
01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:01.480 align:start position:0%
realize this is a really tough nut to
 
01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
crack the example you gave on the dual
 
01:13:05.229 --> 01:13:05.239 align:start position:0%
fuel is you know it's that's right on
 
01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
because it's something that I'm not sure
 
01:13:08.629 --> 01:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
the status of the plants in New
 
01:13:10.709 --> 01:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if there's if there gas only
 
01:13:12.510 --> 01:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
that don't have dual fuel capability but
 
01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
there certainly could be one um on the
 
01:13:17.790 --> 01:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
other side of it though it's you You'
 
01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
really got to watch it on this one
 
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
because let's just say you had a u i
 
01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
don't know 100 megawatt Wind Facility
 
01:13:26.189 --> 01:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
that was existing and they decided in
 
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
order to go with their intermittency
 
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
that they they decided to put in some
 
01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
gas turbin and there actually GE
 
01:13:36.189 --> 01:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
actually does make a turbine gas turbine
 
01:13:38.990 --> 01:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
wind turbine combination so one runs the
 
01:13:40.709 --> 01:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
other one doesn't so maybe you decide
 
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
let's add the gas I can't see people
 
01:13:44.430 --> 01:13:44.440 align:start position:0%
saying well we're just adding some more
 
01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
gas turbines in out there they only run
 
01:13:47.629 --> 01:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
when the wind's not blowing don't worry
 
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
it's not a sizable addition I can see a
 
01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
lot of people getting very excited about
 
01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
adding new gas turbin um so I'm just not
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not I don't have a solution to it
 
01:13:57.310 --> 01:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
but I'm just saying eliminating it is
 
01:13:58.590 --> 01:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
not the answer there going to be some
 
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
caveat there I think so and I'm not you
 
01:14:03.149 --> 01:14:03.159 align:start position:0%
maybe it has maybe it gets to do it has
 
01:14:06.149 --> 01:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
to do with I was going to say you know
 
01:14:08.629 --> 01:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
the it won't work to make the current
 
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
facility operate more efficiently so
 
01:14:13.149 --> 01:14:13.159 align:start position:0%
that you don't have to rely on admitting
 
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
base load you know intermittent would be
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
a good good cleaner investment but it's
 
01:14:21.189 --> 01:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
hard to write that into into uh into 609
 
01:14:22.590 --> 01:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
maybe that's maybe we address that in
 
01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:29.229 --> 01:14:29.239 align:start position:0%
that representative Corbin thank you uh
 
01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:31.400 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean it seems to me that there
 
01:14:33.390 --> 01:14:33.400 align:start position:0%
are various permutations that could
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
happen here right you know what if they
 
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to put wind in uh you know some
 
01:14:41.149 --> 01:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
some wind turbines in in a solar
 
01:14:43.229 --> 01:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
installation that was somewhere near
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
residential you
 
01:14:48.270 --> 01:14:48.280 align:start position:0%
know my feeling is that we can't really
 
01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:50.070 align:start position:0%
know my feeling is that we can't really
cover

01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
cover
 
01:14:52.229 --> 01:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
everything that's possible that could
 
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
possibly happen here
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
so if that's true then how do we air do
 
01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
we air on the side of more caution or
 
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
air on the side of less caution and I
 
01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
would air on the side of more caution
 
01:15:06.149 --> 01:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
and I would leave in the change in
 
01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
energy source recognizing yeah there may
 
01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
be a time when it probably isn't a big
 
01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
deal but I'd rather capture the times
 
01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
deal one other possibility
 
01:15:22.149 --> 01:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington yeah one other
 
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
possibility is I I agree that the uh
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
it's it could be a big deal I mean if
 
01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
someone decided to drop an SMR in
 
01:15:31.629 --> 01:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
someplace that was only 40 megawatts
 
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
because it was a you know a 500 megawatt
 
01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
gas plant for whatever reason uh I'm
 
01:15:38.669 --> 01:15:38.679 align:start position:0%
sure there'd be people Marching In the
 
01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
Streets about you're putting a nuclear
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
plant out there and we don't even get to
 
01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
talk about it so um but I also think
 
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's going to be very hard not to
 
01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
crack and since we it sounds like we're
 
01:15:51.790 --> 01:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
working on the uh changes to existing
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
facilities which is sort of like a rep
 
01:15:55.870 --> 01:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
powering and changeing energy energy
 
01:15:58.629 --> 01:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
source uh or other reuse of the sers and
 
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
energy facilities kind of fits into what
 
01:16:03.390 --> 01:16:03.400 align:start position:0%
we've got over on the repowering portion
 
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
maybe we can just leave that stuff off
 
01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
with the idea we'll pick it up on the
 
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
other bill because it seems it seems to
 
01:16:12.110 --> 01:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
be more in that and probably
 
01:16:15.149 --> 01:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
deserves uh more attention that we can
 
01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
give it in one paragraph in this one
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe that's the way to get it
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
because if you look at some of the
 
01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
things that you know weren't you know
 
01:16:25.229 --> 01:16:25.239 align:start position:0%
like changes at the switch card um or a
 
01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
new Bank of Transformers or things like
 
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
that those are things that got pulled
 
01:16:31.229 --> 01:16:31.239 align:start position:0%
into the set evaluation committee
 
01:16:33.070 --> 01:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
because the the amount of money because
 
01:16:34.669 --> 01:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
of the capital investment so I think
 
01:16:35.910 --> 01:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
we're already talking about trying to
 
01:16:37.990 --> 01:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
address that um so I think it's that
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
type of thing where there has been some
 
01:16:42.669 --> 01:16:42.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunate lengthy regulatory processes
 
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
um we still haven't resolved the issue
 
01:16:46.189 --> 01:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
of you know backup fuel source and
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
things like that but maybe right maybe
 
01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
the other bill is for that yeah I think
 
01:16:51.510 --> 01:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
if we use that we could still put in the
 
01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh capacity and footprint uh and so
 
01:16:56.189 --> 01:16:56.199 align:start position:0%
forth take this part out put it with the
 
01:16:57.830 --> 01:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
other Bill where because we could put
 
01:17:00.629 --> 01:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
more work into it and more specifics as
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
to you know it's more of a reuse or
 
01:17:06.629 --> 01:17:06.639 align:start position:0%
repowering issue rather than a you know
 
01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
I'm looking like what you do where they
 
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
have the problem now with someone comes
 
01:17:11.310 --> 01:17:11.320 align:start position:0%
in and says well we've got to replace
 
01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
the switch yard on our whatever plant
 
01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
because it's 40 years old and it's now
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
going to cost uh you know we going to
 
01:17:19.149 --> 01:17:19.159 align:start position:0%
replace part of it and it's going to
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
cost hundred million do to do it but
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
we're basically putting the same thing
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
in we took out out so uh there really
 
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
isn't any impact on anybody if anything
 
01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
is probably been more efficient now than
 
01:17:30.310 --> 01:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
they were when the old ones were bought
 
01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
that's the one we want to exempt from
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
the full side of evaluation committee so
 
01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
I think that would leaving these words
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
out would do that as long as we pick
 
01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:38.440 align:start position:0%
them up on the other side so we do
 
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
address them because that is going to be
 
01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:41.800 align:start position:0%
an issue repowering down the road though
 
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's something we have to
 
01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
address in the next two weeks whatever
 
01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:48.440 align:start position:0%
we have Mr chairman right I'd only say I
 
01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
would you know be my commitment to work
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
with I don't want to wait wait until
 
01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
April in crossover for uh this
 
01:17:56.350 --> 01:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or this committee to get it
 
01:17:58.430 --> 01:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
so I will speak with senat Waters
 
01:18:00.229 --> 01:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
confirm it was filed and maybe invite
 
01:18:01.950 --> 01:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
some of you to join as co-sponsors so
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
you're part of the process as it moves
 
01:18:05.950 --> 01:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
through the Senate as
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
well that makes sense so from what I'm
 
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
hear I think it's best if we
 
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
drop uh all this language from our
 
01:18:18.990 --> 01:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment for HB 609 and let that be
 
01:18:21.629 --> 01:18:21.639 align:start position:0%
covered with additional legislation
 
01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
going forward talking about I was
 
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we drop we we leave the
 
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
greater than onethird increase in
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
capacity footprint or height of an
 
01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
existing energy facility take out the
 
01:18:35.070 --> 01:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
rest of the stuff and put it in the
 
01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
other bill but leave that in so if there
 
01:18:39.790 --> 01:18:39.800 align:start position:0%
is like like the example that was given
 
01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
if someone has to go in and replace uh a
 
01:18:44.910 --> 01:18:44.920 align:start position:0%
bunch of Transformers which you're gone
 
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
price has gone out of sight on so it
 
01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
would be costly but it's basically a one
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
for one replacement but it's you know
 
01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to be something somewhat
 
01:18:54.149 --> 01:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
different cuz they're going to be they
 
01:18:56.110 --> 01:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturing today rather than 40 years
 
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
ago so if we left that in that would
 
01:19:00.189 --> 01:19:00.199 align:start position:0%
still cover that part and then on the
 
01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
bigger project we would Encompass the
 
01:19:03.149 --> 01:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
rest of the stuff because that's going
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
to be a lot more work to get that done
 
01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
so you would like to see the language
 
01:19:10.149 --> 01:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
that says a substantial change or
 
01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
addition means a greater than onethird
 
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
increase in capacity footprint or height
 
01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
of an existing energy facility and and
 
01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
and possibly add that we
 
01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
discussed one at increase in capacity
 
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
not to exceed 100 megawatt okay not have
 
01:19:31.830 --> 01:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
that in there okay I I'm I would be good
 
01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
with leaving that language in but we
 
01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
have to take the following paragraph
 
01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
which design tries to Define this F Fast
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
Track process we have to take that out I
 
01:19:45.149 --> 01:19:45.159 align:start position:0%
mean there's just no way we can yeah two
 
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
yeah just put that in put that in the
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
waters future Bill yes yeah
 
01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:53.350 align:start position:0%
waters future Bill yes yeah
yes

01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
all right all right so that's a plan a
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
question on that the end of that uh
 
01:20:02.910 --> 01:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
section uh which is two and
 
01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
three get a question from back there why
 
01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:07.480 align:start position:0%
you address them first Mr shulock please
 
01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:16.709 align:start position:0%
you address them first Mr shulock please
come

01:20:16.709 --> 01:20:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:20.270 --> 01:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
up just trying to work my way through
 
01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
the language with examples to see how
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
you might want it to work um and so a
 
01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
substantial change means a change in the
 
01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:31.629 align:start position:0%
substantial change means a change in the
energy

01:20:31.629 --> 01:20:31.639 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
source okay and so if you're changing
 
01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
the energy source then you would get the
 
01:20:38.830 --> 01:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
fast track under two if you leave that
 
01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
there or whatever benefit you get from
 
01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
just making a substantial change under
 
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
the current rules right um but if you
 
01:20:54.629 --> 01:20:54.639 align:start position:0%
make a greater than 1ir increase in the
 
01:20:54.639 --> 01:20:56.550 align:start position:0%
make a greater than 1ir increase in the
footprint

01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
footprint
 
01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:00.199 align:start position:0%
right you get the fast trck don't you
 
01:21:02.830 --> 01:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
really want that to be if it's the Le if
 
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
if you're doing something less than
 
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
onethird of the footprint then you get
 
01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
the fast track or whatever benefit you
 
01:21:10.350 --> 01:21:10.360 align:start position:0%
currently get right I think that's the
 
01:21:12.510 --> 01:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
way it's written isn't it a substantial
 
01:21:14.990 --> 01:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
change means an increase of more than
 
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
the third so if it's less than a third
 
01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
it's not a substantial change and if
 
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
it's not a substantial change under the
 
01:21:22.709 --> 01:21:22.719 align:start position:0%
existing rules of law you already get
 
01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
the fast track okay but under two you
 
01:21:29.310 --> 01:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
get the fast track if it's a substantial
 
01:21:31.390 --> 01:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
change oh I see what you're saying if we
 
01:21:34.110 --> 01:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
eliminate two then there's no mechanism
 
01:21:36.510 --> 01:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
for any fast track so we need to leave
 
01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:39.110 align:start position:0%
for any fast track so we need to leave
two

01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:41.350 --> 01:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
in well I'm just not sure you want to
 
01:21:43.950 --> 01:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
get a fast track if somebody quadruples
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
the size right right it would only be if
 
01:21:49.870 --> 01:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
it's less than a third no but it says
 
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
greater than a
 
01:21:51.639 --> 01:21:53.709 align:start position:0%
greater than a
third

01:21:53.709 --> 01:21:53.719 align:start position:0%
third
 
01:21:56.590 --> 01:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
see up up in yeah colon five it says
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
greater than a third so that makes it a
 
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
substantial change and a substantial
 
01:22:03.149 --> 01:22:03.159 align:start position:0%
change doesn't get the fast track no
 
01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
under two substantial change does get
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:15.629 --> 01:22:15.639 align:start position:0%
okay that's why I was oh okay that's why
 
01:22:17.950 --> 01:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
I was suggesting we leave this whole
 
01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
issue until later needs some work
 
01:22:22.350 --> 01:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
because I think it needs more work I I
 
01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
don't think that for the purposes of the
 
01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:26.719 align:start position:0%
amendment we're trying to create for HB
 
01:22:31.629 --> 01:22:31.639 align:start position:0%
609 that we can do justice to everything
 
01:22:34.629 --> 01:22:34.639 align:start position:0%
that needs to happen to make this
 
01:22:37.709 --> 01:22:37.719 align:start position:0%
definition and what happens after the
 
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
definition is
 
01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
made uh as rigorous as it needs to be
 
01:22:46.590 --> 01:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
and that's what Senator Waters Bill
 
01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
presumably will allow us to do so that's
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
why I think we should just drop this
 
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
change Al together yeah I have to agree
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
with you it's getting getting overly
 
01:22:56.629 --> 01:22:56.639 align:start position:0%
complicated to try to get this thing
 
01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
through and uh in reality to my
 
01:23:02.229 --> 01:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
knowledge it's only be been a real major
 
01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
issue uh on the scrubber at meramac
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
where we battled for a long time over
 
01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:09.560 align:start position:0%
what a substantial change was it wasn't
 
01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
but I don't think it's come up all that
 
01:23:13.709 --> 01:23:13.719 align:start position:0%
often that waiting another year will
 
01:23:16.229 --> 01:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
really hurt too
 
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
much representative I don't disagree but
 
01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
I I get the feeling that attorney
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
shulock is trying to help us be
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
consistent with ourselves because if
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to pass the first section as
 
01:23:29.390 --> 01:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
part of this bill we may be inconsistent
 
01:23:32.910 --> 01:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
if we don't have something to modify it
 
01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
as currently is it may not be the
 
01:23:36.669 --> 01:23:36.679 align:start position:0%
correct thing in section two but if we
 
01:23:38.629 --> 01:23:38.639 align:start position:0%
don't pass them at the same time and we
 
01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
don't know if the other bill is going to
 
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
pass it may create some problems within
 
01:23:45.910 --> 01:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
the statute in terms of clarity yeah so
 
01:23:47.669 --> 01:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
what I'm advocating is that we don't
 
01:23:49.310 --> 01:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
change number
 
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
one well I'm talking about number two
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
going with number number one something
 
01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
needs to be there I think well we don't
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
change number one number two is is um a
 
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
proposal a new proposal so that won't go
 
01:24:04.470 --> 01:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
forward either I'm saying we're not
 
01:24:07.310 --> 01:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
going to touch this existing part of
 
01:24:08.629 --> 01:24:08.639 align:start position:0%
Statute at all so we're going to leave
 
01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
out the substantial redefinition we're
 
01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
gonna have to push that out well then
 
01:24:14.910 --> 01:24:14.920 align:start position:0%
there's no inconsistency yeah thank you
 
01:24:17.709 --> 01:24:17.719 align:start position:0%
for recognizing me okay thank you so
 
01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:20.440 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting that we leave section
 
01:24:24.590 --> 01:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
H5 as it is is in current statute yes
 
01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
yes all right so the next section then
 
01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
would be application for a
 
01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
certificate excuse me Mr chairman I'm
 
01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
just yes go ahead at the top of that
 
01:24:41.669 --> 01:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
page and I'm trying to figure out where
 
01:24:45.070 --> 01:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
this popped in uh it's it's not in red
 
01:24:46.709 --> 01:24:46.719 align:start position:0%
but it says notwithstanding the
 
01:24:48.270 --> 01:24:48.280 align:start position:0%
foregoing an applicant May request the
 
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee to assume
 
01:24:53.109 --> 01:24:53.119 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction etc etc
 
01:24:54.669 --> 01:24:54.679 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing that in the existing
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
statute is that am I just looking in the
 
01:24:58.510 --> 01:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
wrong place where does this all of a
 
01:25:02.669 --> 01:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
sudden pop in because this is
 
01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
this section two RSA uh where it starts
 
01:25:10.149 --> 01:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
with RSA 162 H7 notwithstanding that's
 
01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
all new language right but on the top of
 
01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:13.669 align:start position:0%
all new language right but on the top of
page

01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
four it's it continues on from page
 
01:25:20.830 --> 01:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
three there's a section there and in
 
01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
section three which is on the bottom of
 
01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
page three it says it's just line
 
01:25:27.709 --> 01:25:27.719 align:start position:0%
through uh and then it goes over to the
 
01:25:30.109 --> 01:25:30.119 align:start position:0%
top of the P next page and it says not
 
01:25:31.709 --> 01:25:31.719 align:start position:0%
withstanding the foregoing an applicant
 
01:25:33.790 --> 01:25:33.800 align:start position:0%
May request and I'm just wondering where
 
01:25:35.709 --> 01:25:35.719 align:start position:0%
that came from because I don't see it in
 
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
that that's in current
 
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
statute okay it's in current Statute in
 
01:25:44.790 --> 01:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
what section uh section H5 item three
 
01:25:47.590 --> 01:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
H5 I don't even have an H5 item three in
 
01:25:50.350 --> 01:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
M well in in the current statute not
 
01:25:53.550 --> 01:25:53.560 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what I'm looking at H5 I see
 
01:25:55.270 --> 01:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
H I don't
 
01:25:58.590 --> 01:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
know the RSA that's online may not be up
 
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
to date okay it mustn't be okay yeah I'm
 
01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
looking at the RSA that's online right
 
01:26:04.149 --> 01:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
now yeah okay I'm looking at the one
 
01:26:06.030 --> 01:26:06.040 align:start position:0%
online now and it doesn't show any H3
 
01:26:10.030 --> 01:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
and it's H5 shows H five but no section
 
01:26:13.229 --> 01:26:13.239 align:start position:0%
two or three no section three says the
 
01:26:15.149 --> 01:26:15.159 align:start position:0%
the applications shall be governed by
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
the applicable laws rules and
 
01:26:19.149 --> 01:26:19.159 align:start position:0%
regulations of the agencies and shall be
 
01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
subject to the provisions of RSA 162
 
01:26:27.669 --> 01:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
2-f or RSA 162-h in effect on the date
 
01:26:30.109 --> 01:26:30.119 align:start position:0%
of filing notwithstanding the foregoing
 
01:26:31.950 --> 01:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
and applicant May request the site
 
01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee to assume
 
01:26:35.709 --> 01:26:35.719 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction okay and in the event that
 
01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee agrees to
 
01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
assert jurisdiction the facility shall
 
01:26:42.590 --> 01:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
be subject to the provisions of this
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
chapter five okay because I looked it up
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
online and it's not there so I what I've
 
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
observed is
 
01:26:54.189 --> 01:26:54.199 align:start position:0%
that sometimes you don't see see the
 
01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
correct information in an RSA online and
 
01:27:00.430 --> 01:27:00.440 align:start position:0%
that's because your computer if you've
 
01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
visited that RSA before your computer
 
01:27:06.270 --> 01:27:06.280 align:start position:0%
caches right the information that was
 
01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
there and it doesn't
 
01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
reload uh properly to update the online
 
01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
so I would flush my cash if I were you
 
01:27:17.830 --> 01:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
and you can show me how to flush my cash
 
01:27:19.950 --> 01:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
then later okay okay later we'll talk
 
01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
about that the only cash I know how to
 
01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
flush is what I'm getting rid of money
 
01:27:25.109 --> 01:27:25.119 align:start position:0%
for something have you experienced that
 
01:27:25.119 --> 01:27:26.669 align:start position:0%
for something have you experienced that
representative

01:27:26.669 --> 01:27:26.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
Corman uh well I've certainly
 
01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
experienced web pages being out of date
 
01:27:34.629 --> 01:27:34.639 align:start position:0%
not not specifically our our rsas
 
01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
however okay thank you right all right
 
01:27:40.629 --> 01:27:40.639 align:start position:0%
so let's move now to the changes to the
 
01:27:42.629 --> 01:27:42.639 align:start position:0%
next section which is
 
01:27:49.709 --> 01:27:49.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:52.830 --> 01:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
certificate so this section just make
 
01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:54.280 align:start position:0%
some changes
 
01:27:58.189 --> 01:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
to the fact that the chairperson will
 
01:28:01.149 --> 01:28:01.159 align:start position:0%
now be the person who determines whether
 
01:28:04.870 --> 01:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
a application is administratively
 
01:28:06.750 --> 01:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
complete and if it's not
 
01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:08.229 align:start position:0%
complete and if it's not
administratively

01:28:08.229 --> 01:28:08.239 align:start position:0%
administratively
 
01:28:13.070 --> 01:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
complete what to do next
 
01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
um just a little confused the question
 
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
the chair the committee chairperson or
 
01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
designated presiding officer is there a
 
01:28:23.229 --> 01:28:23.239 align:start position:0%
provision for something like that
 
01:28:24.870 --> 01:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
somewhere else this is the first time I
 
01:28:27.510 --> 01:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
think I've seen that term designated
 
01:28:31.149 --> 01:28:31.159 align:start position:0%
providing officer well remember when we
 
01:28:35.109 --> 01:28:35.119 align:start position:0%
discussed section five under H3 the
 
01:28:37.550 --> 01:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
senior serving attorney member of the Pu
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
Shall Serve as chairperson and some of
 
01:28:43.950 --> 01:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
the some of the uh duties underneath
 
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
that a allow him to delegate that
 
01:28:50.070 --> 01:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility if we take that out which
 
01:28:52.430 --> 01:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
we offer okay which we decided we're
 
01:28:54.990 --> 01:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
going to do then the some of these
 
01:28:59.870 --> 01:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
changes no longer probably um make sense
 
01:29:02.990 --> 01:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
off that's okay that's where that came
 
01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:12.189 align:start position:0%
off that's okay that's where that came
from

01:29:12.189 --> 01:29:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
anyway so does what I'll have uh Mr Gs
 
01:29:18.510 --> 01:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
do is go through this language
 
01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
again in light of the deletion of
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
section five in H3 to see if any of this
 
01:29:30.189 --> 01:29:30.199 align:start position:0%
language needs to stay or if it can
 
01:29:32.229 --> 01:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
disappear and if and if it
 
01:29:32.239 --> 01:29:34.310 align:start position:0%
disappear and if and if it
disappears

01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
disappears
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
then we won't have any real changes to
 
01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:43.270 --> 01:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
section go ahead representative thank
 
01:29:46.709 --> 01:29:46.719 align:start position:0%
you um so I noted uh this is the first
 
01:29:49.229 --> 01:29:49.239 align:start position:0%
of three
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
places three places
 
01:29:58.350 --> 01:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
three places where um the existing
 
01:30:03.070 --> 01:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
RSA was changed by hb281 which is
 
01:30:07.070 --> 01:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
currently in chaptered law uh the
 
01:30:11.109 --> 01:30:11.119 align:start position:0%
language here in the amendment has the
 
01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
the RSA before the changes from
 
01:30:17.870 --> 01:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
281 so it needs to actually be updated
 
01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
to be in concordance with the changes
 
01:30:22.590 --> 01:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
made to this particular paragraph and
 
01:30:27.149 --> 01:30:27.159 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at parag uh H7 paragraph 4
 
01:30:33.790 --> 01:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:36.270 --> 01:30:36.280 align:start position:0%
hb281 so is it already changed on our
 
01:30:38.669 --> 01:30:38.679 align:start position:0%
version no so the version we have here
 
01:30:42.629 --> 01:30:42.639 align:start position:0%
is is before the changes from hb281 were
 
01:30:45.109 --> 01:30:45.119 align:start position:0%
Incorporated so so this particular
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
paragraph paragraph 4 just needs to be
 
01:30:49.550 --> 01:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
brought into concordance with hb281
 
01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
changes but this is correct already
 
01:30:56.709 --> 01:30:56.719 align:start position:0%
updated on in the actual online version
 
01:30:58.470 --> 01:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
the online version I don't think the
 
01:31:00.990 --> 01:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
online version is correct let me just
 
01:31:03.470 --> 01:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
take a quick look here it probably
 
01:31:06.750 --> 01:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
hasn't been updated based on hb281 says
 
01:31:08.790 --> 01:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
effective October 7th
 
01:31:11.470 --> 01:31:11.480 align:start position:0%
2023 looks like it might be well that
 
01:31:13.189 --> 01:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
would be that that would be the
 
01:31:14.590 --> 01:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
effective date that would be the
 
01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
effective date of 281 that's 10 days ago
 
01:31:19.830 --> 01:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
so all right so maybe that is up to date
 
01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
all right so I will ask Mr gets to this
 
01:31:26.430 --> 01:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
language and to take into account the U
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
language that's in 281 yeah and and
 
01:31:31.109 --> 01:31:31.119 align:start position:0%
what's online in the current RSA has not
 
01:31:34.510 --> 01:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
been updated oh well it yeah but I'm
 
01:31:36.070 --> 01:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the language and it hasn't
 
01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
been updated okay the actual
 
01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
language I have a question uh yes
 
01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
representative you said we're going to
 
01:31:45.270 --> 01:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
eliminate 162
 
01:31:48.510 --> 01:31:48.520 align:start position:0%
h35 I thought we were talking about just
 
01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
making that to be the U chair of the Pu
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:58.870 --> 01:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
there corre including assigning someone
 
01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
as a presiding officer okay yeah that's
 
01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
what I meant by eliminate I meant
 
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
eliminate the previous directive that
 
01:32:11.310 --> 01:32:11.320 align:start position:0%
the senior serving attorney of the Pu be
 
01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:14.109 align:start position:0%
the senior serving attorney of the Pu be
the

01:32:14.109 --> 01:32:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
chairperson so that'll be actually it's
 
01:32:20.669 --> 01:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:20.679 --> 01:32:24.790 align:start position:0%
 
elimation

01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
all right so it it definitely appears
 
01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to have another
 
01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:31.760 align:start position:0%

01:32:34.350 --> 01:32:34.360 align:start position:0%

01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
changes uh from hb281 that were not
 
01:35:41.070 --> 01:35:41.080 align:start position:0%
incorporated into this particular
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
language in our
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment and then the other place was
 
01:35:59.189 --> 01:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:04.830 --> 01:36:04.840 align:start position:0%

amendment we'll know um for sure on the
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%

that day it doesn't get done because
 
01:36:54.669 --> 01:36:54.679 align:start position:0%
