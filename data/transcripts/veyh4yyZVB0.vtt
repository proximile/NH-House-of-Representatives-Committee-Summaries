repr wner please thank you thank you so
we've

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
we've
 
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
heard for the last couple of years that
 
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
um one of the biggest problems facing
 
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
child care is the issue around the child
 
00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 align:start position:0%
care Workforce and the childcare
 
00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 align:start position:0%
Workforce is looking for as many tools
 
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
as they can for recruiting
 
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 align:start position:0%
workers what this particular Bill does
 
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
is it um
 
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
provides that the child care workers
 
00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
people who work in child care and have
 
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
young children that they can um get be
 
00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
on the child care State scholarship
 
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
program so they'll get some
 
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
assistance with their cost of child care
 
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
um and people feel that that will be a
 
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
good recruitment tool so that's what
 
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
this bill does the senate sort of
 
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
stripped it down and what you have in
 
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
front of you is what passed the Senate
 
00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Service um committee
 
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
when it got over to finance it got
 
00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
so the amendment the amendment passed
 
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
the Health and Human Service Committee
 
00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
in the Senate the policy committee they
 
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 align:start position:0%
adopted it as a policy but when it got
 
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
to the finance committee it got stripped
 
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
down so um what we talked about last
 
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
week was bringing back the Health and
 
00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:38.599 align:start position:0%
Human Service senate committee Amendment
 
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
um we know that it would this will go on
 
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
to house finance when it if if it passes
 
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
the floor so we know that it will go on
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
to finance and get evaluated for the
 
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360 align:start position:0%
financial impact at the finance
 
00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:55.639 align:start position:0%
committee there's only two changes from
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
the Health and Human Service committee
 
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that came from the Senate
 
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
and one of them is we took out the word
 
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:08.360 align:start position:0%
pilot our um esteemed chair does not
 
00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
like the word pilot he doesn't believe a
 
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
pilot is really ever a pilot so um we
 
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
took that word out and um what was the
 
00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:20.199 align:start position:0%
other we did one other what was the
 
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
other the edition of the waiver oh yes
 
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
we did put in that the Department of
 
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services would uh
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
request of the federal government that
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
be we be able to use um federal funds
 
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
ask for permission to use federal funds
 
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:41.560 align:start position:0%
for this particular project so um and I
 
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
don't know if they have already done
 
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
that or um we they would be doing it if
 
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
for sure if um the bill
 
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
passes and I'm open to questions
 
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
and any other comments on the bill um
 
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative wner for
 
00:07:59.469 --> 00:07:59.479 align:start position:0%
removing the term pilot because no temp
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
temporary Pro there's nothing more
 
00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
permanent than a temporary government
 
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
program um I am uh I am excited about
 
00:08:08.909 --> 00:08:08.919 align:start position:0%
the inclusion of the request for the
 
00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
waiver because that removes any
 
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:13.240 align:start position:0%
Financial concerns um my guess is the
 
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
feds will likely Grant it um that being
 
00:08:18.189 --> 00:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
said this is something that came up in
 
00:08:18.199 --> 00:08:20.110 align:start position:0%
said this is something that came up in
our

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
um uh basically our fact finding the
 
00:08:25.469 --> 00:08:25.479 align:start position:0%
vast majority we're talking about
 
00:08:28.749 --> 00:08:28.759 align:start position:0%
childcare workers who do not qualify
 
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:30.280 align:start position:0%
already for the existing state
 
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
scholarship the overwhelming vast
 
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
majority of chalk workers are already
 
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
qualified uh so we're talking about
 
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
probably something about I my guess
 
00:08:39.469 --> 00:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
would be less than 20% of chare workers
 
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:41.240 align:start position:0%
don't qualify um and I would actually be
 
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:43.880 align:start position:0%
stunned if it was 20% so um I think this
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
is a good Workforce recruitment tool um
 
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
and I think it's uh with the going to
 
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
the feds first it kind of mitigates the
 
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
um concerns about shifting this burden
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
onto the New Hampshire taxpayers
 
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
although it does have that option if the
 
00:08:58.269 --> 00:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
FED say no just we're all transparent
 
00:08:59.310 --> 00:08:59.320 align:start position:0%
but my guess is they're not going to say
 
00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
no know so I'll be supporting uh the
 
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
amendment are there any other uh
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
questions comments concerns on the
 
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
amendment yes representative Thomas
 
00:09:09.069 --> 00:09:09.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I just want to
 
00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
make the comment that when I read the
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
original bill that came over uh 404 um
 
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
that my first comment was no guard rails
 
00:09:20.069 --> 00:09:20.079 align:start position:0%
uh so this amendment answers that and
 
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
and yes and so I'm very pleased to see
 
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:24.040 align:start position:0%

the income requirement back in or no I
 
00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959 align:start position:0%
can't I didn't I didn't look to see it
 
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
cuz they already all nobody's making a
 
00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
