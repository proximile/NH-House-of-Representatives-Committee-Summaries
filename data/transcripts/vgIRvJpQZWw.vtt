00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
with both the Secretary of State and
 
00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
with the Attorney General's office as
 
00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:25.460 align:start position:0%
was requested during the public hearing
 
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
and there was a section in here
 
00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
talking about limiting it to 60 days and
 
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
both the AG and the Secretary of State
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
said that was not necessary and frankly
 
00:20:39.409 --> 00:20:39.419 align:start position:0%
it confused things a lot so we took it
 
00:20:39.419 --> 00:20:41.090 align:start position:0%
it confused things a lot so we took it
out

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
um and then the we dropped it if you
 
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
remember it was it's at 2 2500 we've
 
00:20:48.529 --> 00:20:48.539 align:start position:0%
dropped that down to five thousand and
 
00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
that was in the original bill and then
 
00:20:52.909 --> 00:20:52.919 align:start position:0%
we added some of the language back in
 
00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
that was requested during the hearing I
 
00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
think it was for the Americans for
 
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
Prosperity who put in who asked for some
 
00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:01.799 align:start position:0%
language to be put back in so we put
 
00:21:03.289 --> 00:21:03.299 align:start position:0%
some of that back in
 
00:21:03.299 --> 00:21:04.610 align:start position:0%
some of that back in
and

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
um that's it okay further questions or
 
00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
cover the comments from the committee
 
00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:10.860 align:start position:0%

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
amendment to a vote the clerk will call

the amendment
 
00:27:27.649 --> 00:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
uh representative Brennan
 
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:29.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.649 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:30.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:37.789 --> 00:27:37.799 align:start position:0%
um I I think it just is the wording of
 
00:27:37.799 --> 00:27:38.990 align:start position:0%
um I I think it just is the wording of
it

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
um it says the clerk this is I'm looking
 
00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:44.039 align:start position:0%
at line eight and nine the clerk shall
 
00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:46.140 align:start position:0%
mail absentee ballots in response to
 
00:27:48.769 --> 00:27:48.779 align:start position:0%
verified absentee ballot requests that
 
00:27:51.649 --> 00:27:51.659 align:start position:0%
have been received by 12 pm on the day
 
00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
before the election
 
00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:56.700 align:start position:0%
that language to me may be
 
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted that someone who submits
 
00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:02.820 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot request form say
 
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
three weeks before an election may have
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
to wait until after 12 pm the day before
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
the election to receive that absentee
 
00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:14.940 align:start position:0%
ballot so I'm just the language for me
 
00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
raises a little bit of concern I think
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
it might be able to be Wordsmith a
 
00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:19.580 align:start position:0%
little bit better
 
00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:23.700 align:start position:0%
to avoid misinterpretation
 
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559 align:start position:0%
further questions uh representative
 
00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:28.740 align:start position:0%
weary just keep a comment it does say in
 
00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:31.039 align:start position:0%
line nine on the day before the election
 
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
so but I think it's I could see your
 
00:28:39.289 --> 00:28:39.299 align:start position:0%
point in that there's a question about
 
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
you know up till that time but I I think
 
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
the implication of that sentence is on
 
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
the day before the election so
 
00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
um and and similarly in the sentence
 
00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
following that that has been added to
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
um as part of the amendment uh same sort
 
00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
of phrasing so I think it's really
 
00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:01.140 align:start position:0%
focusing on the day before the election
 
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
and I think let me see I think to
 
00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:05.220 align:start position:0%
address your concerns uh representative
 
00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:06.110 align:start position:0%

personally deliver email or mail to the
 
00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:20.460 align:start position:0%

there that's just my personal opinion
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%

I'd like to speak to your we are now on
 
00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:44.700 align:start position:0%
the bill as amended I'm sorry we are now
 
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
on the amendment excuse me
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
um is there a discussion on the
 
00:33:47.279 --> 00:33:49.909 align:start position:0%
um is there a discussion on the
amendment

00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
um I I took into consideration some of
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
the comments that were made
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
by the committee and um by those who
 
00:33:59.690 --> 00:33:59.700 align:start position:0%
testified at the public hearing
 
00:34:03.289 --> 00:34:03.299 align:start position:0%
um and made it clear that there would be
 
00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:05.460 align:start position:0%
percentages in the it's going to get
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
complicated in the first tier so if you
 
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
have an LLC and you have members and you
 
00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
have three members that rather than
 
00:34:15.129 --> 00:34:15.139 align:start position:0%
attributing them
 
00:34:17.329 --> 00:34:17.339 align:start position:0%
necessarily a third or third a third
 
00:34:19.129 --> 00:34:19.139 align:start position:0%
that you would do it by the percentage
 
00:34:21.649 --> 00:34:21.659 align:start position:0%
of their ownership so that if one is 50
 
00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:24.899 align:start position:0%
then they would get 50 attribution and
 
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
the others would get whatever amount
 
00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
they had and it's the same way we're
 
00:34:31.629 --> 00:34:31.639 align:start position:0%
doing it the same way with corporations
 
00:34:35.089 --> 00:34:35.099 align:start position:0%
so as it came to my attention attention
 
00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
after the hearing corporations can also
 
00:34:42.169 --> 00:34:42.179 align:start position:0%
be members of llc's so instead of having
 
00:34:45.169 --> 00:34:45.179 align:start position:0%
this apply just to Natural persons we
 
00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
also had it applied to corporations
 
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:50.220 align:start position:0%
since they have a limit under this
 
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
statute under 664 colon four so that
 
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
they would then and be allocated in the
 
00:34:59.589 --> 00:34:59.599 align:start position:0%
same way by percentage to their
 
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
contribution limit
 
00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
and that is pretty much the only changes
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
that I made
 
00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the amendment
 
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920 align:start position:0%

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:13.260 align:start position:0%

they have a separate pack that's set up
 
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
for it and specifically in the statute
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
and there's case law on that point I
 
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
forget the name of the case but it's
 
00:37:14.569 --> 00:37:14.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:16.140 align:start position:0%

committee representative weary
 
00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh just one question when it says in
 
00:37:23.329 --> 00:37:23.339 align:start position:0%
line 24 all members would that apply to
 
00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
line 19 for a corporation even though
 
00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:28.140 align:start position:0%
it's attributed to the corporation in
 
00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
section B would that still apply for all
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
members of a corporation in that sense
 
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
is that it
 
00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
in line 24 yeah it says in uh yeah
 
00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
that's for when the contribution is
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
reported so it's all members so a member
 
00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
could be a natural person or a
 
00:37:49.849 --> 00:37:49.859 align:start position:0%

00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:38.150 align:start position:0%
there's a second excuse me is there a
second

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%

uh representative Brennan seconds that
 
00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:42.540 align:start position:0%
the motion is to retain house bill
 
00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
395 is there discussion on the retained
 
00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
motion representative Muirhead
 
00:47:49.849 --> 00:47:49.859 align:start position:0%
um what what what are we hoping to
 
00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:58.730 --> 00:47:58.740 align:start position:0%
I I I can't answer that question I just
 
00:48:01.569 --> 00:48:01.579 align:start position:0%
voted itl itself
 
00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
I'll answer that or attempt to answer
 
00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:06.050 align:start position:0%
I'll answer that or attempt to answer
that

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:06.060 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:07.849 --> 00:48:07.859 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking we might persuade some of
 
00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
the people who just voted I TL it to
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
retain it if we give a good reason to
 
00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
remember I don't think you'll have to
 
00:48:14.089 --> 00:48:14.099 align:start position:0%
give good reason my gut tells me that's
 
00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
this bill was presented because there
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
was a lot of uh for lack of a better
 
00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
word brouhaha about some of the wording
 
00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
of the Constitution Amendments that were
 
00:48:35.089 --> 00:48:35.099 align:start position:0%
on the ballot last general election and
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
the idea is that they want to have a
 
00:48:42.109 --> 00:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
like a more simple non-legalese type of
 
00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
explanation on the ballot at the public
 
00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
hearing we heard some testimony and
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
there was also a move to have it drafted
 
00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
independently by an independent
 
00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
organization we were not able to solve
 
00:48:58.849 --> 00:48:58.859 align:start position:0%
all those issues and so we'd like to be
 
00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
able to work with the secretary of state
 
00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:03.180 align:start position:0%
to come up with a solution because this
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
is a problem I just don't think this
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
bill is to use the overused phrase right
 
00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
for prime time so
 
00:49:13.849 --> 00:49:13.859 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion on the retain
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
motion yes representative boom
 
00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:18.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh Hey the problem
 
00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
I see is like for example the amendment
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
that just passed in the house
 
00:49:26.329 --> 00:49:26.339 align:start position:0%
last week or the week before was clear
 
00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
you don't need anything on it and just
 
00:49:30.829 --> 00:49:30.839 align:start position:0%
raise the age I mean that cleared the
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
last two and last election yeah there
 
00:49:36.349 --> 00:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
was somewhat of a question of what do we
 
00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:38.700 align:start position:0%
mean by this you know with the um
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
probate and all that but the problem is
 
00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
is again yeah I think it needs to be
 
00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
retained to figure out what the wording
 
00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:50.220 align:start position:0%
should be and who writes the wording on
 
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
those amendments because people coming
 
00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:54.300 align:start position:0%
to me and everybody what does this mean
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
so yeah some amendments definitely need
 
00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:00.060 align:start position:0%
somebody to say something
 
00:50:03.309 --> 00:50:03.319 align:start position:0%
um about what it means and
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
non-descript language as to not favor
 
00:50:08.809 --> 00:50:08.819 align:start position:0%
one little side or another but I mean
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's always going to be a problem so
 
00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion on the
 
00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:14.280 align:start position:0%

um as you may recall the sponsor of this
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
bill the primary sponsor asked us to
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
retain it we are getting a similar Bill
 
00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
coming over from the Senate but the idea
 
00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
was if something happened to that bill
 
00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
we would have this one to work on for
 
00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
next year so further discussion uh
 
00:53:55.849 --> 00:53:55.859 align:start position:0%
President Obama

secretary of state says they support the
 
00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill better than this one so the
 
00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
retain is a good option okay further
 
00:54:09.049 --> 00:54:09.059 align:start position:0%
discussion on the retained motion on
 
00:54:13.549 --> 00:54:13.559 align:start position:0%

little case facility accompanied by two

absentee ballot observers as we continue
 
00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:56.870 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot observers as we continue
to

00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:59:59.210 --> 00:59:59.220 align:start position:0%
look into the bill it seemed to get more
 
01:00:01.010 --> 01:00:01.020 align:start position:0%
and more complicated for people that are
 
01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:03.780 align:start position:0%
already pretty busy trying to deliver
 
01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:08.220 align:start position:0%
um election uh ballots so this is why we
 
01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
I moved it for an experience allegedly
 
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
further comments from the committee
 
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien thank you Mr

representative O'Brien thank you Mr
chairman

01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:00:17.569 --> 01:00:17.579 align:start position:0%
I respectfully disagree agree with
 
01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:20.220 align:start position:0%
representative wood I think this is a
 
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
good bill I I think it's not too much to
 
01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
ask for clerks to visit elder care
 
01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
facilities and help with this process I
 
01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:31.559 align:start position:0%
spoke to administrators at nursing homes
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
who thought that this would be a relief
 
01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
to have this kind of help and guidance
 
01:00:41.089 --> 01:00:41.099 align:start position:0%
in the voting process for some of their
 
01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:43.380 align:start position:0%
residents and I don't think it's too
 
01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:46.020 align:start position:0%
much to ask to have a Republican and a
 
01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:47.220 align:start position:0%
Democrat or members of two different
 
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
parties to attend such things I think
 
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:54.240 align:start position:0%

House Bill 496 uh the executive session
 
01:02:23.329 --> 01:02:23.339 align:start position:0%
I'm opening up the executive session I'm
 
01:02:25.490 --> 01:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
House Bill 586 which I'm going to
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
represent recognize representative Lane
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
for a motion
 
01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
yes I would like to make a motion for
 
01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
ought to pass for HP 586 is there a
 
01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:36.410 align:start position:0%
ought to pass for HP 586 is there a
second

01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
representative Ward seconds is there
 
01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:54.180 align:start position:0%
I doubt that but okay
 
01:02:55.450 --> 01:02:55.460 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:56.990 align:start position:0%
um so
uh

01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:59.630 --> 01:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
this bill would open up opportunities
 
01:03:02.030 --> 01:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
for people who um cannot get
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
transportation and who have other
 
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
difficulties uh getting to the polls it
 
01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
is a way to expand it so that um more
 
01:03:14.089 --> 01:03:14.099 align:start position:0%
people can vote and um that is a
 
01:03:16.730 --> 01:03:16.740 align:start position:0%
priority of our caucus so for that
 
01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:19.740 align:start position:0%
reason we are going to support this bill
 
01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
further comments from the committee
 
01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
I have my own
 
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
um this bill doesn't Define much uh it
 
01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
says convenient Transportation don't
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
know what that means if you don't have
 
01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:31.980 align:start position:0%
access to convenient Transportation I
 
01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody's Transportation
 
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
today was convenient furthermore I have
 
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional issues with this it may
 
01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
be in violation of the um state
 
01:03:41.089 --> 01:03:41.099 align:start position:0%
constitution about who qualifies for
 
01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:43.740 align:start position:0%
provisional ballot and the final part is
 
01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
I don't believe fear of getting sick is
 
01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
necessarily a valid reason for not going
 
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
to some place might have been in 2019
 
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
during coven but it's 20 the next
 
01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
election will be 2024.
 
01:03:57.829 --> 01:03:57.839 align:start position:0%
um so for that I'll be opposing this and
 
01:03:59.210 --> 01:03:59.220 align:start position:0%
with that I'm sure the clerk will call
 
01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:04.980 align:start position:0%

and with that the motion of ought to
 
01:05:02.569 --> 01:05:02.579 align:start position:0%

um committee reports and that one's
 
01:05:06.289 --> 01:05:06.299 align:start position:0%

01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:12.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:16.849 --> 01:05:16.859 align:start position:0%

Executive session on HP 316 Amendment
 
01:05:30.410 --> 01:05:30.420 align:start position:0%
223-0725h had been moved and seconded

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:34.140 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
okay has everybody had an opportunity
 
01:05:37.609 --> 01:05:37.619 align:start position:0%
while we were blowing through bills to
 
01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:40.380 align:start position:0%
to read the amendment
 
01:05:43.130 --> 01:05:43.140 align:start position:0%
okay so discussion is now on the
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
amendment is there discussion on the
 
01:05:45.359 --> 01:05:47.030 align:start position:0%
amendment is there discussion on the
amendment

01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
would the sponsor like to speak to the
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
changes in the amendment because I think
 
01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:50.690 align:start position:0%
changes in the amendment because I think
they

01:05:50.690 --> 01:05:50.700 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:56.750 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:05:59.630 --> 01:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
this to uh that supervisors of the
 
01:06:02.569 --> 01:06:02.579 align:start position:0%
checklist will meet every 90 days
 
01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
I think this is a good compromise
 
01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
uh I think that this will be good for
 
01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
the public confidence in elections that
 
01:06:15.170 --> 01:06:15.180 align:start position:0%
the supervisors of the checklist are
 
01:06:17.809 --> 01:06:17.819 align:start position:0%
meeting every 90 days most supervisors
 
01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:19.260 align:start position:0%
of the checklist are meeting
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
periodically at a at a good time frame
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
but some are not and that could cause
 
01:06:28.089 --> 01:06:28.099 align:start position:0%
concern for members of those communities
 
01:06:31.849 --> 01:06:31.859 align:start position:0%
and I think this has some uh some
 
01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support and I appreciate that
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
and but then that's all I have to say
 
01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
Okay further comments or questions on
 
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
the amendment we are on the amendment uh
 
01:06:43.549 --> 01:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
yes representative Hamlet hi thank you
 
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
for letting me speak so I basically want
 
01:06:49.370 --> 01:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
to support what Catherine just said uh
 
01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
um that so uh I did talk to several
 
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
City and town clerks and several
 
01:06:58.130 --> 01:06:58.140 align:start position:0%
supervisors of checklists and they all
 
01:06:59.930 --> 01:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
seem to manage their checklist
 
01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:01.910 align:start position:0%
seem to manage their checklist
differently

01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
differently
 
01:07:04.490 --> 01:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
um but they all felt the ones I spoke to
 
01:07:06.349 --> 01:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
all felt that they were you know
 
01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
diligent about uh you know doing the
 
01:07:11.089 --> 01:07:11.099 align:start position:0%
best they could to update the checklist
 
01:07:13.069 --> 01:07:13.079 align:start position:0%
they and they were meeting as needed or
 
01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
as required
 
01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
but most of them did not object to being
 
01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
required to meet every four months you
 
01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
know every every three months every 90
 
01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
days because they probably meet about
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
four times a year anyway so
 
01:07:29.569 --> 01:07:29.579 align:start position:0%
uh basically it doesn't seem like a
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
hardship to them
 
01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
further comments questions from the

committee representative Lane
 
01:07:36.119 --> 01:07:37.190 align:start position:0%
committee representative Lane
um

01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
I guess I just want to remind everybody
 
01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:41.780 align:start position:0%
that we passed a bill last year I think
 
01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
that required the Secretary of State to
 
01:07:48.049 --> 01:07:48.059 align:start position:0%
update the checklist with the U.S postal
 
01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
services she permanent mail changes and
 
01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:53.780 align:start position:0%
they are in the process of doing that
 
01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
and where we've got them doing that and
 
01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
most of the towns already do this I I
 
01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
seem I personally question whether we
 
01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
really need this bill and I'm frankly
 
01:08:08.569 --> 01:08:08.579 align:start position:0%
torn on how to vote for it because I
 
01:08:10.849 --> 01:08:10.859 align:start position:0%
just I don't see that we necessarily
 
01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
need it just to clarify it
 
01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:13.799 align:start position:0%
representative we are in discussion on
 
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:08:17.570 --> 01:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
not to get too super parliamentary you
 
01:08:18.769 --> 01:08:18.779 align:start position:0%
know I don't I don't really get into
 
01:08:20.269 --> 01:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
those weeds but we are in discussion on

Amendment

01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
2023-0724 H passes on to House Bill 316.
 
01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
we are now on to discussion of House
 
01:09:41.329 --> 01:09:41.339 align:start position:0%
Bill 316 as amended is there discussion
 
01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
on the bill as amended
 
01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:46.130 align:start position:0%
on the bill as amended
hmm

01:09:46.130 --> 01:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
I'll just say ditto to the last time
 
01:09:49.490 --> 01:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
that I spoke when I wasn't supposed to
 
01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
be speaking to the bill so that's okay
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
we all forgive you
 
01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
not not me personally but collectively
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:03.770 --> 01:10:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
um I recognize that the amendment has
 
01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
made this bill significantly better
 
01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate the work that was done
 
01:10:17.209 --> 01:10:17.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
in my view
 
01:10:22.330 --> 01:10:22.340 align:start position:0%
this is unnecessary legislation
 
01:10:25.189 --> 01:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
we do as representative Lane mentioned
 
01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
we do have legislation that is requiring
 
01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State to work with the
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
USPS records to ensure accuracy of the
 
01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
checklist Statewide
 
01:10:40.189 --> 01:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
so I believe that may address some
 
01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
concerns that members may have about the
 
01:10:45.169 --> 01:10:45.179 align:start position:0%
accuracy of the checklist and the work
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
that the supervisors of the checklist do
 
01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:49.070 align:start position:0%
that the supervisors of the checklist do
um

01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
I trust and respect and value our
 
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
supervisor the checklist and I think
 
01:10:56.330 --> 01:10:56.340 align:start position:0%
they do a really good job at managing
 
01:10:59.930 --> 01:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
um their checklist for their communities
 
01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:01.490 align:start position:0%
um their checklist for their communities
the

01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
um there may be a need for additional
 
01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
training for the handful of Supervisors
 
01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
who may be new to the position who may
 
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
be out of
 
01:11:14.330 --> 01:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
you know who may have last received
 
01:11:16.970 --> 01:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
training some time ago and the secretary
 
01:11:19.970 --> 01:11:19.980 align:start position:0%
of state is capable of administering
 
01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
that additional training as needed
 
01:11:25.390 --> 01:11:25.400 align:start position:0%
without legislation
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
my third reason for opposing this
 
01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
particular bill is
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
this creates a schedule that may allow
 
01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
for Bad actors to challenge voter roles
 
01:11:40.970 --> 01:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
this is something that is happening
 
01:11:44.209 --> 01:11:44.219 align:start position:0%
Nationwide where there are individuals
 
01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
or organizations that are challenging
 
01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:50.900 align:start position:0%
voter roles voter registrations
 
01:11:53.450 --> 01:11:53.460 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily and it is creating an
 
01:11:56.090 --> 01:11:56.100 align:start position:0%
undue burden on supervisors of the
 
01:11:58.390 --> 01:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
checklist and it may lead to
 
01:12:02.810 --> 01:12:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:05.689 --> 01:12:05.699 align:start position:0%
and finally my last concern with this
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
bill is it creates a one-size-fits all
 
01:12:13.810 --> 01:12:13.820 align:start position:0%
mandate on municipalities
 
01:12:17.630 --> 01:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
this bill does not recognize that there
 
01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
are communities that may have
 
01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
supervisors that need to meet more often
 
01:12:25.850 --> 01:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
but we have many small rural communities
 
01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
that have short checklists that don't
 
01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
require maintenance on a specific
 
01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.669 align:start position:0%
require maintenance on a specific
schedule

01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
um I oppose this bill because I don't
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
think that a one-size-fits-all mandate
 
01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
really works best for every Community
 
01:12:47.090 --> 01:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
throughout our state and I would ask
 
01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
that my colleagues oppose this bill and
 
01:12:53.330 --> 01:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
recognize that our supervisors of the
 
01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
checklist are doing excellent work for
 
01:12:58.729 --> 01:12:58.739 align:start position:0%
our communities and help is available if
 
01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
they need it to maintain and manage
 
01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
their checklists thank you further
 
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
representative Peter O'Brien
 
01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I
 
01:13:14.930 --> 01:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
support this amendment
 
01:13:18.010 --> 01:13:18.020 align:start position:0%
um I support this bill
 
01:13:20.330 --> 01:13:20.340 align:start position:0%
I just did that representative Lane so
 
01:13:21.770 --> 01:13:21.780 align:start position:0%
please please don't make me do it again
 
01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:25.310 align:start position:0%
please please don't make me do it again
it's

01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:26.810 --> 01:13:26.820 align:start position:0%
um there are different ways to think
 
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
about the same ideas one size fits all
 
01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
could also be could also be considered
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
consistency throughout the state
 
01:13:35.390 --> 01:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
consistency of services for all of our
 
01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:36.649 align:start position:0%
consistency of services for all of our
citizens

01:13:36.649 --> 01:13:36.659 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing
 
01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
the idea of Bad actors coming in and
 
01:13:44.689 --> 01:13:44.699 align:start position:0%
challenging voter rolls
 
01:13:46.970 --> 01:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
could also be I would I would say that's
 
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
more opportunities for members of the
 
01:13:51.950 --> 01:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
public to meet with their elected
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
officials and that's a good thing so I
 
01:13:57.890 --> 01:13:57.900 align:start position:0%
support this bill I support otpa
 
01:14:00.290 --> 01:14:00.300 align:start position:0%

01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:03.080 align:start position:0%

01:14:11.209 --> 01:14:11.219 align:start position:0%

um clarifies uh
 
01:14:18.110 --> 01:14:18.120 align:start position:0%

01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
um supervisors to to meet but also

public have the opportunity to
um

01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:41.030 align:start position:0%
comments from the committee
representative

01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:14:44.209 --> 01:14:44.219 align:start position:0%
um during the public hearing I I was
 
01:14:45.850 --> 01:14:45.860 align:start position:0%
curious about whether this might
 
01:14:48.530 --> 01:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
dissuade you know public spirited
 
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
volunteers from serving as supervisors
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
of the checklist and
 
01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:53.209 align:start position:0%
of the checklist and
um

01:14:53.209 --> 01:14:53.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:56.090 --> 01:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
and I do still I I do remain concerned
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
about uh kind of burdening the positions
 
01:15:00.890 --> 01:15:00.900 align:start position:0%
that people volunteer for
 
01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:02.940 align:start position:0%
um and and in a way that makes it harder
 
01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:04.140 align:start position:0%
to run elections it's one of the things
 
01:15:05.930 --> 01:15:05.940 align:start position:0%
secretary of state has mentioned
 
01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
as a concern of of his I mean that said
 
01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
I do appreciate you know the motives of
 
01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
the bill I appreciate all the work that
 
01:15:13.370 --> 01:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
representative Hamlet put into it I
 
01:15:15.770 --> 01:15:15.780 align:start position:0%
appreciate the co-sponsor representative
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
prude on O'Brien's openness to the
 
01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.590 align:start position:0%
prude on O'Brien's openness to the
amendment

01:15:18.590 --> 01:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
um and and so I will be supporting it
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
but I think we I think we need to keep
 
01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
our eyes on what whether we're unduly
 
01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
burdening the work of the volunteers
 
01:15:29.930 --> 01:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
we made it all the way to the end
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative weary uh just to address
 
01:15:34.250 --> 01:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
some comments we've heard from the
 
01:15:36.610 --> 01:15:36.620 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office that that
 
01:15:39.649 --> 01:15:39.659 align:start position:0%
attendance for training is not
 
01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
and far from 100 so and we've heard from
 
01:15:45.649 --> 01:15:45.659 align:start position:0%
representative Hamlet that there are is
 
01:15:48.590 --> 01:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of variability amongst the
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
different uh supervisors of the
 
01:15:52.669 --> 01:15:52.679 align:start position:0%
checklist so I I think
 
01:15:52.679 --> 01:15:54.709 align:start position:0%
checklist so I I think
um

01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:57.709 --> 01:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
I I think meeting once every 90 days
 
01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
does not put an undue burden on
 
01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
supervisors at the checklist if they
 
01:16:04.729 --> 01:16:04.739 align:start position:0%
meet adjourn you know if there's not no
 
01:16:07.490 --> 01:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
business to handle that is not unheard
 
01:16:10.130 --> 01:16:10.140 align:start position:0%
of in town meetings so
 
01:16:12.770 --> 01:16:12.780 align:start position:0%
um I I don't think it puts an undue
 
01:16:15.709 --> 01:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
burden on uh the people that we're
 
01:16:20.090 --> 01:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
asking to do this task so I make those
 
01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
comments in support of the bill
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
further comments on the bill is admitted
 
01:16:27.890 --> 01:16:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:31.610 --> 01:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to add to this but it
 
01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
there are a couple things about this
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
bill that the in terms of the language
 
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
on line five it really should be Board
 
01:16:39.530 --> 01:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
of registrars or Board of Supervisors
 
01:16:41.689 --> 01:16:41.699 align:start position:0%
because cities have Boards of registrars
 
01:16:45.050 --> 01:16:45.060 align:start position:0%
and one supervisor of the checklist
 
01:16:47.450 --> 01:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
and I still don't understand how in
 
01:16:50.450 --> 01:16:50.460 align:start position:0%
lines five six and seven in line five it
 
01:16:52.669 --> 01:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
says shall be first posted but it never
 
01:16:56.450 --> 01:16:56.460 align:start position:0%
says where it's posted second or third
 
01:16:58.669 --> 01:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
and I just it's
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to be pedantic but it's a
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
terrible sentence
 
01:17:05.689 --> 01:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
further and also I also like the
 
01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
business like the business in line six
 
01:17:09.890 --> 01:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
because the I know at least one city
 
01:17:11.810 --> 01:17:11.820 align:start position:0%
where the city clerk will not post
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
meetings of the board of registrars on
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
the city's website this would make it
 
01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:22.250 align:start position:0%
the city's website this would make it
mandatory

01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
sorry I was having trouble digesting
 
01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
that last one
 
01:17:30.290 --> 01:17:30.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:33.169 --> 01:17:33.179 align:start position:0%
yes representative boom and thank you Mr
 
01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
chairman I know we're not town
 
01:17:38.810 --> 01:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
the supervisor the checklist has been
 
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
there probably just as long as I've been
 
01:17:43.090 --> 01:17:43.100 align:start position:0%
there like probably at least 40 years
 
01:17:46.189 --> 01:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
the problem is is I think this is a good
 
01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
because sometimes you get new people on
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
and be nice if those people got together
 
01:17:55.729 --> 01:17:55.739 align:start position:0%
every 90 days to find out what is going
 
01:17:58.430 --> 01:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
on maybe the laws change and whatnot so
 
01:18:00.970 --> 01:18:00.980 align:start position:0%
even small towns just getting together
 
01:18:03.410 --> 01:18:03.420 align:start position:0%
every three months I think is a good
 
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
idea to find out what is happening with
 
01:18:08.810 --> 01:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
checklist so that's why I would support
 
01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:10.860 align:start position:0%
this thank you
 
01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:12.300 align:start position:0%

01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:14.270 align:start position:0%

I feel like I should add my own but
 
01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
no uh
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
with that the clerk will call the role
 
01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:25.980 align:start position:0%
