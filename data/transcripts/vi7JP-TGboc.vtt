00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
the bill on behalf of Representative
 
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.270 align:start position:0%
the bill on behalf of Representative
McGee

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
McGee
 
00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 align:start position:0%
this bill is a campaign finance bill
 
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
that seeks transparency for
 
00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
contributions made by limited liability
 
00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 align:start position:0%
companies also called llc's
 
00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 align:start position:0%
it is designed to close the so-called
 
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
LLC loophole which is used by both
 
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.090 align:start position:0%
LLC loophole which is used by both
parties

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 align:start position:0%
parties
 
00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
here's how the loophole works
 
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
I have an X dollar amount let's say ten
 
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar limit that I can give to
 
00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
any candidate
 
00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
I can then set up an LLC with just
 
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
myself or my friends and I can give a
 
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 align:start position:0%
number another ten thousand dollars then
 
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
I can set up a third fourth fifth
 
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 align:start position:0%
No Limit
 
00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 align:start position:0%
and I can give as much money as I want
 
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
to any candidate or political committee
 
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
that's not the case with individuals or
 
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.790 align:start position:0%
that's not the case with individuals or
corporations

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.690 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
um this the this bill is just designed
 
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
to cut out that loophole and so that if
 
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
an LLC decides to give money to a
 
00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 align:start position:0%
candidate or a political committee then
 
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
it has to disclose in its campaign
 
00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 align:start position:0%
Finance disclosures to the candidate
 
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
the names the persons
 
00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 align:start position:0%
who are in that LLC and that money just
 
00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
gets don't designated excuse me to their
 
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 align:start position:0%
to their um
 
00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 align:start position:0%
threshold their limit so that way they
 
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 align:start position:0%
don't get to do
 
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
that way they stick to their ten
 
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar limit and they don't get
 
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
to give a hundred thousand dollars
 
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.990 align:start position:0%
to give a hundred thousand dollars
so

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.949 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much what the bill aims to
 
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.369 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much what the bill aims to
do

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
um it is uh right now the law currently
 
00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
prevents Partnerships uh from giving
 
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
donations most llc's are Partnerships
 
00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 align:start position:0%
they are they limit the liability hence
 
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 align:start position:0%
the name limited liability they limit
 
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
the liability of the members and they
 
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
were created as a way to protect
 
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
Partners most people it's it's called a
 
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
a pass-through entity it's so that when
 
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
you have a corporation
 
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 align:start position:0%
the corporation pays taxes and then you
 
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
pay taxes with an LLC only you pay the
 
00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 align:start position:0%
tax the LLC doesn't pay the tax it
 
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 align:start position:0%
passes through so it's a great benefit
 
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
for small companies
 
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
um it's also preferred over corporations
 
00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
for that reason just to to protect or
 
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
limit taxes
 
00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
courts have withheld limits on amounts
 
00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
contributed to persons so you can limit
 
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
the amount of the contribution you just
 
00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 align:start position:0%
can't say they can't give
 
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 align:start position:0%
and that's it I was here to introduce
 
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
the bill I can try and answer some
 
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
questions but I'm sure there's people
 
00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 align:start position:0%
behind me that will do would do a better
 
00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:27.909 align:start position:0%
behind me that will do would do a better
job

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 align:start position:0%
job
 
00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 align:start position:0%
okay so anybody have any questions
 
00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
so next we have
 
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
thank you chair boom and committee for
 
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 align:start position:0%

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 align:start position:0%

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
dedicated to empowering voters and
 
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 align:start position:0%
defending democracy
 
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance reform has long long
 
00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 align:start position:0%
long been a part of the League's work
 
00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 align:start position:0%
where 103 year old organization and we
 
00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:37.139 align:start position:0%
support ways in which we can
 
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
continue to have vigorous elections but
 
00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 align:start position:0%
not with undue influence by any party I
 
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
have been testifying for bills to close
 
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 align:start position:0%
the LLC loophole
 
00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259 align:start position:0%
for at least the last five years my
 
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
testimony sites whoops sorry let me get
 
00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 align:start position:0%
the right page my testimony sites bills
 
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
in 2021
 
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.409 align:start position:0%
in 2021
and

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 align:start position:0%
2019 and they've had support of both the
 
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
House and Senate and it was the governor
 
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
who stymied it
 
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 align:start position:0%
if I knew better how to navigate The
 
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
Campaign Finance website I'd find out I
 
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
would like to find out how many of the
 
00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 align:start position:0%
governor's campaign donations came from
 
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 align:start position:0%
LLCs and how many of those llc's
 
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
donor owners of the LLCs were also
 
00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
donors in other ways
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
so what I did find in a November 15 2020
 
00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:39.419 align:start position:0%
article in the Concord Monitor gives you
 
00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
a little information on llc's at that
 
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
time and I couldn't find an update sorry
 
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
at that time there were about 65
 
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:49.629 align:start position:0%
at that time there were about 65
000

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:49.639 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
llc's in good standing and they are the
 
00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
vast majority of New Hampshire
 
00:06:58.249 --> 00:06:58.259 align:start position:0%
businesses except for these sole
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
proprietorship businesses and at least
 
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
75 percent of them had a single owner I
 
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
do know from talking with some people
 
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
that people are in business often have
 
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 align:start position:0%
multiple llc's so not only could an
 
00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
individual make a donation in his or her
 
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
own name but also in the name of
 
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
multiple llc's so the intent of this
 
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:26.220 align:start position:0%
bill is to recognize that fact and say
 
00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:29.099 align:start position:0%
that Jane Smith just because she's got
 
00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
several llc's cannot exceed the campaign
 
00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
donations to a particular candidate by
 
00:07:38.809 --> 00:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
making them from one two three llc's
 
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:41.940 align:start position:0%
plus herself and that to me seems very
 
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
very logical and I urge you to support
 
00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.249 align:start position:0%
very logical and I urge you to support
this

00:07:46.249 --> 00:07:46.259 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:07:49.309 --> 00:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
I'll take questions if there are any but
 
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert on llc's Bill do we
 
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.089 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you

oh Perry Oh that's a p I'm sorry it
 
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
looked like an a
 
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.189 align:start position:0%
looked like an a
[Laughter]

00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:25.129 --> 00:08:25.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone
 
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
multiple legislative attempts have been
 
00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:36.659 align:start position:0%
made in recent years to close what is
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
known as the LLC loophole
 
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
why is it a loophole
 
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:43.740 align:start position:0%
because it allows one person to make
 
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
maximum campaign contributions through
 
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
each one of his or her limited liability
 
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.290 align:start position:0%
each one of his or her limited liability
companies

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:51.300 align:start position:0%
companies
 
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:52.860 align:start position:0%
and why do we want to close that
 
00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.170 align:start position:0%
and why do we want to close that
loophole

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
loophole
 
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
because it empowers one person
 
00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
who would otherwise be my equal
 
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
to make multiple contributions using
 
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
ownership of one or more llc's to
 
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
overwhelm the political influence my
 
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
contribution would have simply because
 
00:09:14.329 --> 00:09:14.339 align:start position:0%
the choice was made to establish the
 
00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
businesses as an LSC LLC
 
00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
which has its own benefits as you just
 
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:23.700 align:start position:0%
heard but perhaps with a specific intent
 
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
in mind to take advantage of the
 
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.650 align:start position:0%
in mind to take advantage of the
loophole

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
loophole
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
the focus of this bill is reduced to
 
00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
single member llc's but the concept is
 
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
the same and it requires that political
 
00:09:36.829 --> 00:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
contributions made by a limited
 
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
liability company be allocated to
 
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
members for purposes of determining
 
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
whether a member has exceeded the
 
00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
contribution limits
 
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
there is no bar to making contributions
 
00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:50.660 align:start position:0%
only that those contributions not exceed
 
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:53.700 align:start position:0%
established limits in the aggregate
 
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
no tracking of those contributions is
 
00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
required by the state under this bill
 
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
tracking is done by the LLC itself
 
00:10:03.949 --> 00:10:03.959 align:start position:0%
in providing the recipient with the
 
00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
names and addresses of all members for
 
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
the purpose of reporting
 
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
reporting under current law only
 
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
requires the name of the LLC be
 
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
disclosed not the names of the people
 
00:10:20.449 --> 00:10:20.459 align:start position:0%
behind the LLC making the contribution
 
00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
I spoke with a fundraiser a year and a
 
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
half ago who said raising money for a
 
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
candidate stats by calling owners of
 
00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:30.899 align:start position:0%
LLCs because a single call can generate
 
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
multiple contributions
 
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
there is no efficiency in first calling
 
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
on small donors those people
 
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
who might even be constituents
 
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
the the default position is to approach
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
those who have a financial advantage
 
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:49.740 align:start position:0%
over the rest
 
00:10:51.889 --> 00:10:51.899 align:start position:0%
the Brennan Center for justice confirms
 
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
that over the decades quote the U.S
 
00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court as well as lower courts
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
have repeatedly and consistently upheld
 
00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:02.180 align:start position:0%
state and federal laws requiring
 
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
disclosures of who is spending money in
 
00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.050 align:start position:0%
disclosures of who is spending money in
politics

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
politics
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
end quote
 
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
and I will add that the U.S Supreme
 
00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
Court came to the same conclusion in
 
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
citizens united V FEC in 2010
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
emphasizing their conclusion by saying
 
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
transparency is key to the maintenance
 
00:11:23.329 --> 00:11:23.339 align:start position:0%
of democracy
 
00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire came close to requiring
 
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
apportionment in 2019 when on a
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
bipartisan basis the New Hampshire
 
00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:31.940 align:start position:0%
legislature passed
 
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
hb156 only to suffer the governor's veto
 
00:11:38.569 --> 00:11:38.579 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has another opportunity to
 
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
pass campaign Finance reform and it
 
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
begins Anew with HB 255.
 
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
I urge you to pass
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
or in the alternative
 
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
please retain this bill for further
 
00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
consideration or refinement
 
00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:56.519 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
going nicely thank you sir thank you and
 
00:12:06.829 --> 00:12:06.839 align:start position:0%

live in the city of Franklin and I'm
 
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:36.380 align:start position:0%
here in support of Senate bill
 
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
255. I really hope you will fix the LLC
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
loophole we need to reduce the influence
 
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
of money in politics so that average
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
voters have a voice this bill provides
 
00:12:51.769 --> 00:12:51.779 align:start position:0%
transparency and accountability
 
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
this bill has been before the committee
 
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
but in a slightly different way this
 
00:12:59.930 --> 00:12:59.940 align:start position:0%
this is more focused on Single member
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
llc's this is an important to close the
 
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.530 align:start position:0%
llc's this is an important to close the
loophole

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:05.540 align:start position:0%
loophole
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
when I first started researching the LLC
 
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
loopholes the individual limit was seven
 
00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:15.620 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars now due to House Bill
 
00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.170 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars now due to House Bill
263

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:17.180 align:start position:0%
263
 
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand dollars can be given by
 
00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.590 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand dollars can be given by
llc's

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
llc's
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to cite some examples
 
00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
under the Old Law of seven thousand
 
00:13:26.279 --> 00:13:27.710 align:start position:0%

from 30 llc's with two addresses one in
 
00:13:47.329 --> 00:13:47.339 align:start position:0%

um that I'm happy to share
 
00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
um also on August 18 2010 the day my

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
ninety nine thousand dollars came from
 
00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
55 llc's again Dunkin Donuts franchises

um with
 
00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
um Massachusetts address
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
there was also fifty five thousand

um

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
in 2012 Kevin landergan wrote a story
 
00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
um about the LLC loophole in the Nashua
 
00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.389 align:start position:0%
um about the LLC loophole in the Nashua
Telegraph

00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
Telegraph
 
00:15:02.689 --> 00:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
and he cites contributions from decking
 
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:11.329 --> 00:15:11.339 align:start position:0%
18630509 LLC and decking Atlantic one
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
two one seven two zero LLC all coming
 
00:15:19.129 --> 00:15:19.139 align:start position:0%
from the 82 Flanders Road in Westborough
 
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so it seems like that
 
00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:23.699 align:start position:0%
address has funneled a lot of money into
 
00:15:26.569 --> 00:15:26.579 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire politics over the course
 
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
of uh the last decade
 
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
I do want to say that this bill the LLC
 
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:36.660 align:start position:0%
loophole I did site two uh gubernatorial
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
candidates that were Republican I'm
 
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:41.220 align:start position:0%
going to say that Dan feltis used this
 
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
LLC loophole and his Treasurer Ben Kelly
 
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:47.220 align:start position:0%
used three different companies to funnel
 
00:15:49.129 --> 00:15:49.139 align:start position:0%
multiple money into Dan feltis's
 
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
campaign so both parties use this LLC
 
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
loophole to a circumvent campaign
 
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
Finance limits I know you have research
 
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
from your committee assistant
 
00:16:03.769 --> 00:16:03.779 align:start position:0%
I have a couple additional Bill numbers
 
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:05.940 align:start position:0%
and years that this bill has introduced
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
in my testimony that could be added to
 
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
that research voters know that donations
 
00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:13.910 align:start position:0%
that research voters know that donations
um

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:17.220 align:start position:0%
are taken to buy influence it's pure and
 
00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.050 align:start position:0%
are taken to buy influence it's pure and
simple

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
simple
 
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
and we need to know who's spending money
 
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
and instead of which donors are hiding
 
00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:25.740 align:start position:0%
behind llc's
 
00:16:29.449 --> 00:16:29.459 align:start position:0%
um this committee has an opportunity
 
00:16:31.069 --> 00:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
um to ensure that there's more
 
00:16:31.079 --> 00:16:32.650 align:start position:0%
um to ensure that there's more
transparency

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:32.660 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
00:16:35.689 --> 00:16:35.699 align:start position:0%
and to give voters more trust in the
 
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
process so I please urge ought to pass
 
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
and fix the LLC loophole before the next
 
00:16:42.889 --> 00:16:42.899 align:start position:0%
election and with that I'm happy to take
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
thank you do we have any questions
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chairman I don't know if
 
00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:57.180 align:start position:0%
you're the right person to address the
 
00:16:59.329 --> 00:16:59.339 align:start position:0%
text here but my question has to do with
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
the allocation of the contributions and
 
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
there's a sentence here that starts on
 
00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:07.799 align:start position:0%
line 12 no starts online well actually
 
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
it starts on nine but it continues on
 
00:17:12.049 --> 00:17:12.059 align:start position:0%
and it says a contribution made by a
 
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
domestic or foreign limited liability
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
company shall be attributed to its
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
members as if the contributions were
 
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:20.220 align:start position:0%
made by the members so I'm assuming
 
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
there's an assumption there that it's
 
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
distributed equally I guess I don't know
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
if you want to put you know if someone
 
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
wants to put that in there because later
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
on it has this is a little bit
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
complicated it says if a member of a
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
limited liability company is itself a
 
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:35.220 align:start position:0%
limited liability company the portion of
 
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:36.900 align:start position:0%
the contribution allocated to that
 
00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:39.539 align:start position:0%
member which I guess is the LLC that's
 
00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
in the other LLC
 
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
shall be allocated among its members on
 
00:17:45.409 --> 00:17:45.419 align:start position:0%
the basis of their percentage membership
 
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
interests so there's there's nothing
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
like that about an LLC that's not within
 
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
another LLC so I don't know if that
 
00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:55.740 align:start position:0%
could be made more clear
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
um I I think it could be made more clear
 
00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question
 
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:03.780 align:start position:0%
um we've looked at this in other states
 
00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:05.820 align:start position:0%
to try to look at what other states have
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
for laws so this is very similar to
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
language in other states but I think a
 
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
good resource is the campaign Legal
 
00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:16.919 align:start position:0%
Center that has all the different
 
00:18:18.289 --> 00:18:18.299 align:start position:0%
languages and all the different states
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
but I think this bear Bill did narrow
 
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
the scope to the single member LLC
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
um and so it's really trying to get
 
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.789 align:start position:0%
um and so it's really trying to get
after

00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
after
 
00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
I'll just use my mom for example my mom
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
has an accounting company so if the if
 
00:18:36.289 --> 00:18:36.299 align:start position:0%
she makes a campaign contribution to me
 
00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:38.220 align:start position:0%
if I'm running for office
 
00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
she can make a personal contribution of
 
00:18:42.289 --> 00:18:42.299 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand dollars and her
 
00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:43.799 align:start position:0%
business can make a fifteen thousand
 
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
dollar contribution and this bill is
 
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
basically saying no Olivia's mom can't
 
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
give her thirty thousand dollars she can
 
00:18:51.049 --> 00:18:51.059 align:start position:0%
only give her fifteen thousand dollars
 
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
because my mom is a sole proprietor in
 
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
her accounting business but there are
 
00:18:58.669 --> 00:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
some llc's
 
00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
the Dunkin Donuts franchises are are
 
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
some of them some of them are owned by
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
different people and some of them are
 
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
owned by the same people so it's really
 
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
trying to get and some llc's are
 
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
actually owned by another LLC so the
 
00:19:13.549 --> 00:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
language you pointed to was trying to
 
00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:15.539 align:start position:0%
get back to the person
 
00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
um and so I I understand that it's a
 
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
little confusing but really what it's
 
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
trying to do is say if you take money
 
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:25.799 align:start position:0%
from this entity you just have to find
 
00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:28.919 align:start position:0%
out who you're taking money from so that
 
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
they can't use this limit I mean
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
basically what people are doing is
 
00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:35.820 align:start position:0%
funneling large sums of money
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
using multiple vehicles and they can
 
00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
still do that by creating a pack doesn't
 
00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:43.140 align:start position:0%
hurt you know any of Dunkin Donuts
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
franchise could create a pack and still
 
00:19:48.049 --> 00:19:48.059 align:start position:0%
funnel lots of money into elections this
 
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:49.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't prevent them but it just doesn't
 
00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
it doesn't allow business owners to do
 
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.730 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:19:58.730 --> 00:19:58.740 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
I'll be brief um yeah it's very clear in
 
00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:04.919 align:start position:0%
terms of a single member LLC and you
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
know I understand the idea of an LLC in
 
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
an LLC but in that case there's some
 
00:20:12.529 --> 00:20:12.539 align:start position:0%
wording about percentages and that's not
 
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:14.700 align:start position:0%
the case you know above where they're
 
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
just talking about an LLC so even though
 
00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:19.559 align:start position:0%
it's focused on single members it does
 
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:22.919 align:start position:0%
discuss llc's in general so we could
 
00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
look at the language
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
um in last year's bill which was uh
 
00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:29.900 align:start position:0%
Senate bill to
 
00:20:33.049 --> 00:20:33.059 align:start position:0%
48 which had the percentages in there so
 
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to pull the language from
 
00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
last year we we tried to narrow this to
 
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:40.980 align:start position:0%
the single member llc's uh because we
 
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
knew that trying to get everybody was
 
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
was hard so we were trying to you know
 
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
scale it back a little bit but if if you
 
00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
want that language of the percentages
 
00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:51.299 align:start position:0%
um that language is is in a previous
 
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
have they oh that's the second question
 
00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.310 align:start position:0%
have they oh that's the second question
sorry

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
um so I have some research back at my
 
00:21:09.289 --> 00:21:09.299 align:start position:0%
office on which other states have LLC
 
00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
loopholes there are some states that
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
have complete and total corporate banned
 
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
um so in the states that have uh 100
 
00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:20.820 align:start position:0%
corporate banned there's no LLC loophole
 
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
legislation but there is I can email you
 
00:21:27.289 --> 00:21:27.299 align:start position:0%
which other states have similar
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
legislation who've closed the LLC
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh could you also send us if if it's
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
there have they been tested in court
 
00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
because as I recall there was some
 
00:21:42.649 --> 00:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
concern in years past that this may not
 
00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:45.559 align:start position:0%
be that this would not be constitutional
 
00:21:48.289 --> 00:21:48.299 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is it has passed
 
00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
but if you can get us those yeah I know
 
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
that they've been challenged at least
 
00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
one other state has challenged the a law
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
like this and it has
 
00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
um stood up that the transparency and
 
00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
disclosure is an important measure
 
00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
um so there has been laws in other
 
00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
states and they have been challenged by
 
00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:11.220 align:start position:0%
the courts and withhold withheld those
 
00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
challenges and I'm happy to try to pull
 
00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
that or I can go back to the campaign
 
00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:18.900 align:start position:0%
Legal Center and get them to pull those
 
00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
Court race uh Corp
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
Court um dockets for you
 
00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
thank you any any further questions
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
with that thank you and representative
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
wood could you get the blue sheet for us
 
00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.149 align:start position:0%
wood could you get the blue sheet for us
please

00:22:35.149 --> 00:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:37.799 align:start position:0%
and anybody else want to speak I think
 
00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:39.780 align:start position:0%
we've heard everybody here and I'm
 
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could
 
00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
look up online
 
00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:59.930 --> 00:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:03.649 --> 00:23:03.659 align:start position:0%
okay and let's we'll chat so with that
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
and we'll close the hearing on two five
 
00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:09.780 align:start position:0%
five and we got six minutes before our
 
00:23:15.289 --> 00:23:15.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:18.049 --> 00:23:18.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
online there are 75 people who have
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
signed in in support two who have signed
 
00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:26.100 align:start position:0%
in in opposition
 
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:27.529 --> 00:30:27.539 align:start position:0%
let's continue on with uh House Bill 402
 
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
and I recognize this prime prime sponsor
 
00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Dan Hines
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
representing the town of Alfred and this
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
bill I believe is an election Integrity
 
00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:47.220 align:start position:0%
bill so the main thing this bill is it
 
00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
would essentially put specific penalties
 
00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
um on essentially defamation against
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
um political candidates and this bill is
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
limited um in the sense that it doesn't
 
00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
apply to reporters Media or just the
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
average person it specifically is
 
00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
applying to candidates
 
00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
um political committees or political
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
parties and the reason for that is I
 
00:31:12.889 --> 00:31:12.899 align:start position:0%
think those people have more of a
 
00:31:15.769 --> 00:31:15.779 align:start position:0%
essentially Duty not to lie against
 
00:31:18.409 --> 00:31:18.419 align:start position:0%
candidates so this essentially is a
 
00:31:21.889 --> 00:31:21.899 align:start position:0%
defamation bill because candidates are
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
public officials they're um when they
 
00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:25.500 align:start position:0%
want to bring a defamation complaint
 
00:31:27.289 --> 00:31:27.299 align:start position:0%
it's a higher standard so it's not the
 
00:31:30.169 --> 00:31:30.179 align:start position:0%
typical negligence so in a regular
 
00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:32.460 align:start position:0%
defamation case if someone's not a
 
00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:34.860 align:start position:0%
public figure essentially truth is
 
00:31:36.649 --> 00:31:36.659 align:start position:0%
always a defense but other than that the
 
00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:38.220 align:start position:0%
store the Court's just going to apply a
 
00:31:39.769 --> 00:31:39.779 align:start position:0%
negligent standard so if someone just
 
00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:41.640 align:start position:0%
accidentally lies about someone they
 
00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
could be held liable for a non-public
 
00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:46.980 align:start position:0%
official but when it's public official
 
00:31:48.529 --> 00:31:48.539 align:start position:0%
um the Supreme Court has decided that
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
there's certain additional protections
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
that needed to be given to those people
 
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
um so one of the things is they can only
 
00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
recover if they show its knowing which
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
makes sense people should not knowingly
 
00:32:00.889 --> 00:32:00.899 align:start position:0%
be able to lie against
 
00:32:03.049 --> 00:32:03.059 align:start position:0%
um and to fame people and then kind of
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
in them claim a privilege and the other
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
is if they act in Reckless or act with
 
00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:10.860 align:start position:0%
actual malice which generally is a
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
reckless disregard for the truth so it's
 
00:32:15.289 --> 00:32:15.299 align:start position:0%
higher than a negligent standard but
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
less than a knowing standard and I think
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
the reason this bill is needed is
 
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
particularly last election cycle there
 
00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
were numerous pacts that were on both
 
00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
sides that we're making and just
 
00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
blatantly wrong Incorrect
 
00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:29.700 align:start position:0%
characterizations and lying about either
 
00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
candidates records or their position on
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
bills and I think that's wrong I think
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
that misleads people and I think it's
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
particularly air when it's a huge pack
 
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:40.980 align:start position:0%
spends all this money and that the
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
candidate often cannot properly respond
 
00:32:45.889 --> 00:32:45.899 align:start position:0%
so one of those things I want the bill
 
00:32:48.409 --> 00:32:48.419 align:start position:0%
does is it's essentially a notice
 
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:49.860 align:start position:0%
requirement and I do have a typo in the
 
00:32:51.889 --> 00:32:51.899 align:start position:0%
bill so it would need an amendment uh
 
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
the type was on line six
 
00:32:57.049 --> 00:32:57.059 align:start position:0%
um the last word
 
00:32:58.850 --> 00:32:58.860 align:start position:0%
um so it reads false statements issued
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
on the home page of a candidate
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
political committee or political parts
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
website is evidence of their position on
 
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:05.940 align:start position:0%
an issue and Prima flash evidence of
 
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:07.860 align:start position:0%
Reckless disregard the truth so the word
 
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
false isn't supposed to be there and so
 
00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
what that meant was
 
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
um I think pretty much most candidates
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
can have a website or very easily can
 
00:33:18.049 --> 00:33:18.059 align:start position:0%
cheaply have a website so on the website
 
00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
if a candidate's listing his specific
 
00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:22.140 align:start position:0%
position that I don't think a pack
 
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
should be able to come in and just claim
 
00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:25.980 align:start position:0%
the complete opposite this wouldn't go
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
to opinion so obviously people are
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
entitled to their opinion assigned
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
issues it's specifically
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
um is when people are just lying about
 
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:37.140 align:start position:0%
mechanics position on an issue or
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise is harming the reasonably
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
harming the candidate's reputation which
 
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
is a defamation standard as well
 
00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:46.380 align:start position:0%
um and then the final thing the bill
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
does is just codifies different
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
um penalties for various types of
 
00:33:54.789 --> 00:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
deformation and
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative Kennedy
 
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chairman uh thanks for taking
 
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
my question I'm just wondering who would
 
00:34:08.329 --> 00:34:08.339 align:start position:0%
adjudicate whether something is a lie or
 
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:16.500 align:start position:0%
any other question remember Jim Howard
 
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh how is current uh
 
00:34:22.369 --> 00:34:22.379 align:start position:0%
defamation law not currently addressing
 
00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:27.780 align:start position:0%
uh two ways um so our present defamation
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
law doesn't have any specific penalties
 
00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
with it uh certain day the jury yes
 
00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
could reasonably import a point award
 
00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:37.020 align:start position:0%
someone the damages that they incurred
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
um but this bill specifically made
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
specific damages so a jury doesn't have
 
00:34:43.849 --> 00:34:43.859 align:start position:0%
to guess at the sorry guess at the harm
 
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
um someone caused and I think that would
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully deter people from acting in
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
that manner and the other way is
 
00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
um with the assuming the typo is fixed
 
00:34:56.450 --> 00:34:56.460 align:start position:0%
um that it allows someone to respond on
 
00:34:59.450 --> 00:34:59.460 align:start position:0%
their website and I believe legislature
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
can properly say well we're gonna find
 
00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
that that in itself is reckless
 
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
disregard if you if a candidate has on
 
00:35:07.849 --> 00:35:07.859 align:start position:0%
their website so presently a candidate
 
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
can put their position on a website but
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
I could see in a point saying well I
 
00:35:13.609 --> 00:35:13.619 align:start position:0%
didn't check that so I didn't know it
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
was wrong so I think this sort of just
 
00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
puts an extra Duty on someone if they're
 
00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:21.660 align:start position:0%
going to make representations about a
 
00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:22.730 align:start position:0%
going to make representations about a
candidate

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:24.530 align:start position:0%
candidate
okay

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:24.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
any other representative program thank
 
00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:29.700 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any other uh
 
00:35:36.349 --> 00:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction that does this political uh
 
00:35:38.329 --> 00:35:38.339 align:start position:0%
subdivision that does this at this point
 
00:35:41.329 --> 00:35:41.339 align:start position:0%
in other states I am not um so I tried
 
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
to follow or just build on our
 
00:35:44.569 --> 00:35:44.579 align:start position:0%
defamation law
 
00:35:46.849 --> 00:35:46.859 align:start position:0%
um and then just incorporate various
 
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
protections that Supreme Court has
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
awarded to defamation um so I I am not
 
00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:36:00.609 --> 00:36:00.619 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
anybody else want to testify on this
 
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
with that uh representative wood could
 
00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.750 align:start position:0%
with that uh representative wood could

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:29.180 align:start position:0%
and another blank

01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:39.180 align:start position:0%
good morning committee good morning Mr
 
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for allowing me the
 
01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to introduce HB 463
 
01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:46.150 align:start position:0%
opportunity to introduce HB 463
um

01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:48.289 --> 01:00:48.299 align:start position:0%
this is a pretty straightforward Bill
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
the concept's been in front of the this
 
01:00:53.210 --> 01:00:53.220 align:start position:0%
committee uh before
 
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm not gonna
 
01:00:57.049 --> 01:00:57.059 align:start position:0%
sort of go into great detail other than
 
01:00:59.150 --> 01:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
to note that it's creating
 
01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:01.160 align:start position:0%
um an election portal
 
01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
for folks to do a couple of things
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
related to registering to vote and
 
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
basically it creates a hub for
 
01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:10.250 align:start position:0%
basically it creates a hub for
um

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
potential voters and registrants to
 
01:01:15.549 --> 01:01:15.559 align:start position:0%
access and provide information
 
01:01:18.289 --> 01:01:18.299 align:start position:0%
I don't want to bury the lead here but
 
01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:19.980 align:start position:0%
I'm going to respectfully suggest that
 
01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
maybe the committee retain the bill I'll
 
01:01:24.770 --> 01:01:24.780 align:start position:0%
talk about the merits of the bill only
 
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
for the purpose because there's another
 
01:01:32.089 --> 01:01:32.099 align:start position:0%
bill that Senator gray has championed
 
01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
and will come before this committee that
 
01:01:37.549 --> 01:01:37.559 align:start position:0%
is is probably a better bill in my in my
 
01:01:37.559 --> 01:01:38.210 align:start position:0%
is is probably a better bill in my in my
view

01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:38.220 align:start position:0%
view
 
01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:39.069 align:start position:0%
view
um

01:01:39.069 --> 01:01:39.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:41.569 --> 01:01:41.579 align:start position:0%
and so I think it might
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
in the interest of efficiency which
 
01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
we're not typically accused of here in
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
the legislature it might make sense to
 
01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
to retain this bill and and
 
01:01:54.289 --> 01:01:54.299 align:start position:0%
um and manage a Senator Senator Grace
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
sb70 which is coming before the
 
01:01:58.609 --> 01:01:58.619 align:start position:0%
committe's gone through the Senate
 
01:01:58.619 --> 01:01:59.569 align:start position:0%
committe's gone through the Senate
um

01:01:59.569 --> 01:01:59.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
and Senate Senate Bill 70 yeah
 
01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:02.990 align:start position:0%
and Senate Senate Bill 70 yeah
um

01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
you know I I will sort of speak briefly
 
01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
to the merits again in the interest of
 
01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
efficiency but um this is a concept of
 
01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
modernizing the Secretary of State's
 
01:02:13.849 --> 01:02:13.859 align:start position:0%
office where I think there are a great
 
01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
majority of states have something
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
similar to this uh including Maine I
 
01:02:20.890 --> 01:02:20.900 align:start position:0%
believe in terms of being
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
allowing folks to have the ability to
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
entertain to input information relevant
 
01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:27.549 align:start position:0%
entertain to input information relevant
information

01:02:27.549 --> 01:02:27.559 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:31.740 align:start position:0%
for registering to vote this bill 463
 
01:02:34.730 --> 01:02:34.740 align:start position:0%
relates to two groups in particular uh
 
01:02:37.069 --> 01:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
people who who have particular barriers
 
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
to registering to vote people in active
 
01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
military service and people with
 
01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:44.089 align:start position:0%
military service and people with
disabilities

01:02:44.089 --> 01:02:44.099 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
01:02:44.099 --> 01:02:45.170 align:start position:0%
disabilities
um

01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:47.450 --> 01:02:47.460 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons I think that this
 
01:02:49.789 --> 01:02:49.799 align:start position:0%
Senator Grace bill is is probably better
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
is that it does it's a bit more
 
01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:54.780 align:start position:0%
expansive at the same same cost as this
 
01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:56.220 align:start position:0%
one um
 
01:02:59.589 --> 01:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
I think from the perspective of uh uh
 
01:03:02.030 --> 01:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
administratively at the local level this
 
01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
is something that will ultimately
 
01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
relieve burdens for local clerks and
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist there are
 
01:03:12.049 --> 01:03:12.059 align:start position:0%
some numbers out there that um
 
01:03:15.370 --> 01:03:15.380 align:start position:0%
quantify how much money it costs for a
 
01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
clerk to register a vote this is Pennies
 
01:03:21.410 --> 01:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
on the dollar in terms of that to save
 
01:03:24.109 --> 01:03:24.119 align:start position:0%
and allows are already strapped local
 
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
government agencies to focus on other
 
01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.190 align:start position:0%
government agencies to focus on other
things

01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:30.230 align:start position:0%
things
um

01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
one issue this bill as I mentioned this
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
concept has come before this committee
 
01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:36.660 align:start position:0%
and other
 
01:03:40.849 --> 01:03:40.859 align:start position:0%
forms one particular issue had been
 
01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
caused the the number that had been
 
01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
associated with prior construction of an
 
01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
information portal is significantly
 
01:03:50.890 --> 01:03:50.900 align:start position:0%
lower this time around
 
01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:53.720 align:start position:0%
than it has been in the past
 
01:03:56.450 --> 01:03:56.460 align:start position:0%
I don't need to probably elaborate but I
 
01:03:58.450 --> 01:03:58.460 align:start position:0%
certainly can in terms of
 
01:04:00.530 --> 01:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
the groups that are mentioned in this
 
01:04:02.569 --> 01:04:02.579 align:start position:0%
bill that would
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
benefit from having a reduction in the
 
01:04:06.349 --> 01:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
barriers and the transactions cost
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
transaction transaction costs and being
 
01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
able to register to vote but as I said
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
you know I don't want to bury the lead
 
01:04:15.289 --> 01:04:15.299 align:start position:0%
here I think it might be in the interest
 
01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
of the committee and to to retain the
 
01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
bill it's awkward for me to say that but
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
um I think the other bill that's coming
 
01:04:24.289 --> 01:04:24.299 align:start position:0%
through might be the one that deserves
 
01:04:25.370 --> 01:04:25.380 align:start position:0%
the committee's
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
more more attention so but I'm happy to
 
01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
take questions
 
01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
um from folks thank you are there any
 
01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:33.710 align:start position:0%
um from folks thank you are there any
questions

01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:35.569 --> 01:04:35.579 align:start position:0%
with that thank you thank you for
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony no I now call
 
01:04:41.089 --> 01:04:41.099 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary of state Aaron Herron
 
01:04:41.099 --> 01:04:46.609 align:start position:0%

Hennessey

01:04:46.609 --> 01:04:46.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:48.289 --> 01:04:48.299 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
committee I am Aaron Hennessey deputy
 
01:04:52.490 --> 01:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
secretary of state good morning I wanted
 
01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:54.180 align:start position:0%
to let you all know that we do support
 
01:04:56.930 --> 01:04:56.940 align:start position:0%
this bill with one slight Amendment and
 
01:04:59.210 --> 01:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
that Amendment would be to remove the
 
01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:00.589 align:start position:0%
that Amendment would be to remove the
Restriction

01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
Restriction
 
01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:01.980 align:start position:0%
um to two types of New Hampshire
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
citizens to open it up to all New
 
01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens and that is in line
 
01:05:08.809 --> 01:05:08.819 align:start position:0%
with what the Senate has already passed
 
01:05:11.710 --> 01:05:11.720 align:start position:0%
and that would be as the sponsor said SB
 
01:05:14.809 --> 01:05:14.819 align:start position:0%
70. the important information in this
 
01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:17.220 align:start position:0%
portal is it the important thing about
 
01:05:19.609 --> 01:05:19.619 align:start position:0%
it is that it makes it easy for New
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents to change their
 
01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:25.140 align:start position:0%
registration to um to actually register
 
01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
but also keeps in line with our our laws
 
01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and to make sure that
 
01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:32.339 align:start position:0%
the information goes to the appropriate
 
01:05:35.089 --> 01:05:35.099 align:start position:0%
elected official for example if you're
 
01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:36.900 align:start position:0%
requesting an absentee ballot that would
 
01:05:38.809 --> 01:05:38.819 align:start position:0%
go to the clerk if you're requesting
 
01:05:41.450 --> 01:05:41.460 align:start position:0%
updates or to register
 
01:05:43.549 --> 01:05:43.559 align:start position:0%
um that would go to the supervisors of a
 
01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
checklist I'm happy to take questions
 
01:05:48.349 --> 01:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
but I do know know that the sponsor has
 
01:05:51.049 --> 01:05:51.059 align:start position:0%
asked you to retain this and that sb70
 
01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
would be coming before you when
 
01:05:56.329 --> 01:05:56.339 align:start position:0%
crossover happens
 
01:05:59.150 --> 01:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank you yes represent wood thank you
 
01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:02.089 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
question

01:06:02.089 --> 01:06:02.099 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
um on authenticating the person behind
 
01:06:06.890 --> 01:06:06.900 align:start position:0%
the portal what are your thoughts about
 
01:06:09.890 --> 01:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
problems or Solutions on that
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
the um the portal will be designed to
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
collect all the information that needs
 
01:06:18.109 --> 01:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
to be collected when you register to
 
01:06:20.329 --> 01:06:20.339 align:start position:0%
vote in the first place so anything that
 
01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
you would require to present you would
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
have to present in digital format so a
 
01:06:29.450 --> 01:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
copy of or a scanned picture of whatever
 
01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:31.980 align:start position:0%
identity that you would have or proof of
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
residence or proof of citizenship
 
01:06:37.789 --> 01:06:37.799 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
okay it does
 
01:06:44.029 --> 01:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes so we we hear uh quite
 
01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
often that this information is hard to
 
01:06:49.309 --> 01:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
come by for the people who are walking
 
01:06:49.319 --> 01:06:50.690 align:start position:0%
come by for the people who are walking
in

01:06:50.690 --> 01:06:50.700 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
um how do you think that's going to fly
 
01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
with a portal
 
01:06:55.020 --> 01:07:00.109 align:start position:0%
with a portal
the

01:07:00.109 --> 01:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
I don't know that this restricts applic
 
01:07:06.049 --> 01:07:06.059 align:start position:0%
people registering to vote to the portal
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
I'd have to look into that but I think
 
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
there would still be the walk-in option
 
01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
for people is that what you were is that
 
01:07:16.809 --> 01:07:16.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:19.069 --> 01:07:19.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:07:25.069 --> 01:07:25.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:27.349 --> 01:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't show a cost how much you think
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
this will cost Secretary of State
 
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
so our estimation is that
 
01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
um the cost would be approximately
 
01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
477 dollars in the first year and that
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
is all of the design work
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
um most most of that would be it work to
 
01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
implement the portal any training that
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
needs to be done
 
01:07:52.130 --> 01:07:52.140 align:start position:0%
um individuals that we would need to
 
01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
hire a lot of the the work that would be
 
01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
done locally would now be shifted to
 
01:07:59.450 --> 01:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
phone calls and questions and answers at
 
01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office so we've
 
01:08:03.410 --> 01:08:03.420 align:start position:0%
had a lot of discussions with the
 
01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the Senate bill that there
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
would possibly need somebody additional
 
01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
staffing needs and Secretary of State's
 
01:08:12.349 --> 01:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
office so you repeat that cost again oh
 
01:08:12.359 --> 01:08:13.270 align:start position:0%
office so you repeat that cost again oh
sorry

01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:08:17.209 --> 01:08:17.219 align:start position:0%
477 dollars in in 2024 and you should
 
01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
have a fiscal note on this does yours
 
01:08:20.689 --> 01:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
not have a fiscal note yeah but it's
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
empty oh I think what happened perhaps
 
01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:25.380 align:start position:0%
what happened was it was added after
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
your bills were printed if you go to the
 
01:08:30.650 --> 01:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
online version it's on there so okay 47
 
01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:33.900 align:start position:0%
77 in the first year and then and then
 
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
at least I'm trying to look at each
 
01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:43.799 align:start position:0%
individual cost
 
01:08:43.799 --> 01:08:46.370 align:start position:0%
individual cost
um

01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
at least 77 000 but up to 274
 
01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
000. if you have to hire somebody yeah
 
01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
okay so thank you any other questions
 
01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
thank you I just want to clarify it is
 
01:09:05.689 --> 01:09:05.699 align:start position:0%
on sb70 so if you oh look up sb70 all
 
01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
the financial stuff is there okay okay
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
it's it should Mr chair it should be on
 
01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
your the HB 463 as well okay or at least
 
01:09:18.769 --> 01:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
it is on my version okay
 
01:09:21.410 --> 01:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you
 
01:09:26.570 --> 01:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:49.849 --> 01:09:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:49.859 --> 01:09:51.169 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:09:51.169 --> 01:09:51.179 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:53.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for this opportunity
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
to speak on HB 463 I do have written
 
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
testimony that's being passed around my
 
01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
name is Liz tentarelli I'm speaking
 
01:10:04.669 --> 01:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
today as president of the League of
 
01:10:07.010 --> 01:10:07.020 align:start position:0%
Women Voters of New Hampshire
 
01:10:10.750 --> 01:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
where empowering voters by creating
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
opportunities to register that are not
 
01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
rooted in the 17th century by going to
 
01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
the town clerk's office makes sense
 
01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
uh so my my testimony refers to the fact
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
that there are at as far as I could find
 
01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
only eight states that do not allow any
 
01:10:33.669 --> 01:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
part of the registration process online
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
and so we would be coming into the 21st
 
01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
century and that's kind of a nice place
 
01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:40.140 align:start position:0%
to live
 
01:10:43.669 --> 01:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
so I do support this bill I support SB
 
01:10:47.450 --> 01:10:47.460 align:start position:0%
70 even stronger because it it applies
 
01:10:48.970 --> 01:10:48.980 align:start position:0%
to everyone
 
01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
and I was very happy to hear that the
 
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor suggests this bill be retained
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
in favor of sb70 when it comes along
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
but even just this bill does allow for
 
01:11:06.770 --> 01:11:06.780 align:start position:0%
two groups that have particularly tough
 
01:11:09.550 --> 01:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
times getting to the town clerk's office
 
01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
to be able to make changes to
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
registration and to do their
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
registration process online
 
01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
so for active military it's a no-brainer
 
01:11:22.010 --> 01:11:22.020 align:start position:0%
they may not be around for months and
 
01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
months at a time
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
and for people with disabilities getting
 
01:11:29.890 --> 01:11:29.900 align:start position:0%
to the town clerk's office may be a
 
01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
serious problem
 
01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:34.500 align:start position:0%
so I certainly support this bill I've
 
01:11:37.010 --> 01:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
been testifying in favor of this for at
 
01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
least three years and I urge the
 
01:11:42.290 --> 01:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
committee to First retain it and then
 
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
look very favorably on its cousin SB 70
 
01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
when that comes along I'd be glad to
 
01:11:51.649 --> 01:11:51.659 align:start position:0%
take questions if there are any
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
01:11:57.470 --> 01:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
good thank you for the opportunity
 
01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:59.390 align:start position:0%
good thank you for the opportunity
I'm

um

01:12:13.250 --> 01:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee my
 
01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
name is Mackenzie St Germain I'm the
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
campaign director for the New Hampshire
 
01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
campaign for voting rights and I'm
 
01:12:22.010 --> 01:12:22.020 align:start position:0%
representing New Hampshire campaign for
 
01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
voting rights and America votes New
 
01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:24.530 align:start position:0%

Hampshire

01:12:24.530 --> 01:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:12:27.290 --> 01:12:27.300 align:start position:0%
um we as a coalition support any
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
um bill or that creates an election
 
01:12:31.729 --> 01:12:31.739 align:start position:0%
information portal um as other mentioned
 
01:12:35.689 --> 01:12:35.699 align:start position:0%
a robust portal like sb70 these bills
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
would uh both benefit our election
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
officials and voters by allowing voters
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
to complete a new voter application
 
01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:44.090 align:start position:0%
to complete a new voter application
register

01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
register
 
01:12:46.010 --> 01:12:46.020 align:start position:0%
um to over the first time request an
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot make updates to their
 
01:12:49.970 --> 01:12:49.980 align:start position:0%
voter registration quickly and easily
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
online many people these days are very
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
comfortable registering their car online
 
01:12:56.689 --> 01:12:56.699 align:start position:0%
paying their bills and it just makes
 
01:12:58.729 --> 01:12:58.739 align:start position:0%
sense at this point in time for us to
 
01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
also give voters that option to manage
 
01:13:03.410 --> 01:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
their voter registration information
 
01:13:07.130 --> 01:13:07.140 align:start position:0%
online as well and with the ease of
 
01:13:09.290 --> 01:13:09.300 align:start position:0%
being able to have voters complete an
 
01:13:11.570 --> 01:13:11.580 align:start position:0%
application ahead of time ahead of going
 
01:13:13.610 --> 01:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
to the polls we can also reduce the
 
01:13:15.530 --> 01:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
number of Voters who are registering for
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
the first time on Election Day reducing
 
01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
the number of Voters who maybe forget a
 
01:13:21.169 --> 01:13:21.179 align:start position:0%
document and have to register with an
 
01:13:23.630 --> 01:13:23.640 align:start position:0%
affidavit or people you know waiting in
 
01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
long lines to register on Election Day
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
because they weren't able to get to
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
their clerk's office ahead of time but
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
would be able to register online you
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
know after work from home and this also
 
01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
would help voters update their
 
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
information more quickly than currently
 
01:13:40.729 --> 01:13:40.739 align:start position:0%
happens with addresses keeping our voter
 
01:13:43.010 --> 01:13:43.020 align:start position:0%
rolls more updated and clean which is
 
01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
something that we know can increase
 
01:13:46.490 --> 01:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
voter confidence when those are more up
 
01:13:47.450 --> 01:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
to date
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
this would also support our supervisors
 
01:13:51.290 --> 01:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
with a checklist cutting back on the
 
01:13:53.450 --> 01:13:53.460 align:start position:0%
amount of data entry they have also the
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
difficulty in Reading handwriting or
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
reading people's names but I know my
 
01:13:59.689 --> 01:13:59.699 align:start position:0%
handwriting is not always the cleanest
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
or clearest and can reduce some of those
 
01:14:04.850 --> 01:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
potential errors in data entry and
 
01:14:07.370 --> 01:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
copying over names and addresses that
 
01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
can cause issues or confusion in our
 
01:14:12.050 --> 01:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
voter roles so as you move forward with
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
this process looking at this bill in
 
01:14:16.370 --> 01:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
sb70 I really want to just emphasize the
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
importance and the support from the New
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire campaign for voting rights for
 
01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
establishing a portal
 
01:14:24.530 --> 01:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
no I'm happy to take any questions thank
 
01:14:27.770 --> 01:14:27.780 align:start position:0%
you anybody have any questions
 
01:14:29.630 --> 01:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
I now call
 
01:14:34.729 --> 01:14:34.739 align:start position:0%
Sarah lovedell
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:55.370 --> 01:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
all right good morning uh my name is
 
01:14:57.530 --> 01:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
Sarah Lobdell I'm a voter in Keene and
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
program coordinator of open democracy
 
01:15:02.090 --> 01:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
we're a nonpartisan non-profit Pro voter
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
organization with over 36 000 members
 
01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
and I am speaking this morning in
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
support of HB 463
 
01:15:14.209 --> 01:15:14.219 align:start position:0%
so on this day March 7th today in 1965
 
01:15:16.610 --> 01:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
hundreds of black and brown voters uh
 
01:15:18.410 --> 01:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
Marchers walked across the Pettus bridge
 
01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
in Selma Alabama peacefully demanding
 
01:15:22.729 --> 01:15:22.739 align:start position:0%
and equal right to vote these Marchers
 
01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:24.780 align:start position:0%
were met with violence walking to make
 
01:15:26.570 --> 01:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
the ballot equally accessible for all
 
01:15:31.310 --> 01:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
and HB 463 and its cousin HP 70 are an
 
01:15:33.290 --> 01:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
extension of this Legacy that take a
 
01:15:34.610 --> 01:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
step towards making the ballot equally
 
01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
accessible for all
 
01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:38.460 align:start position:0%
much of what I had in my written
 
01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
testimony has already been said so I
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
would just add that
 
01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:43.790 align:start position:0%
would just add that
um

01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:46.669 --> 01:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
uh reductions in the cost of Staff time
 
01:15:49.310 --> 01:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
was brought up in terms of
 
01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
um what it cost to process a paper
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
registration form and in my testimony
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
there's analysis of that and an average
 
01:15:59.050 --> 01:15:59.060 align:start position:0%
cost would be
 
01:16:02.149 --> 01:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
4.72 cents in staff time for every paper
 
01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:04.980 align:start position:0%
registration process so that is a
 
01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
potential cost saving to towns and
 
01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:07.970 align:start position:0%
potential cost saving to towns and
cities

01:16:07.970 --> 01:16:07.980 align:start position:0%
cities
 
01:16:11.090 --> 01:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
um and yeah I would Echo what has
 
01:16:12.530 --> 01:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
already been said and would encourage
 
01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
you to look favorably on sb70 when it
 
01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:19.320 align:start position:0%

Rockingham District 25 comprising the
 
01:30:48.169 --> 01:30:48.179 align:start position:0%
town of Salem uh how proud to introduce
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
House Bill 476 today enabling the
 
01:30:52.729 --> 01:30:52.739 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State to conduct a second
 
01:30:55.490 --> 01:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
recount after an election uh election
 
01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
laws Vice chair representative Berry is
 
01:31:00.649 --> 01:31:00.659 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor cannot be here today
 
01:31:02.689 --> 01:31:02.699 align:start position:0%
um essentially what this bill uh seeks
 
01:31:04.189 --> 01:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
to do in the intent of the bill when it
 
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
was filed is we had a rather notorious
 
01:31:10.729 --> 01:31:10.739 align:start position:0%
case of a recount back in November in
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
which the recount resulted initially in
 
01:31:16.669 --> 01:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
a change in the election results but it
 
01:31:18.770 --> 01:31:18.780 align:start position:0%
was it was clear from calculations that
 
01:31:21.010 --> 01:31:21.020 align:start position:0%
the number of ballots did not match up
 
01:31:23.450 --> 01:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
from that first recount to the election
 
01:31:26.450 --> 01:31:26.460 align:start position:0%
night and then a subsequent audit of
 
01:31:29.330 --> 01:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
that Ward race uh further confirmed
 
01:31:30.890 --> 01:31:30.900 align:start position:0%
there was a difference in the number of
 
01:31:33.709 --> 01:31:33.719 align:start position:0%
ballots counted it or counted in that
 
01:31:37.129 --> 01:31:37.139 align:start position:0%
race then of course cast which led to a
 
01:31:39.890 --> 01:31:39.900 align:start position:0%
a really unprecedented but necessary
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
second recount of Ward 6 which then
 
01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
later confirmed the initial election
 
01:31:47.830 --> 01:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
Night results
 
01:31:50.629 --> 01:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
and got rid of the disparity between the
 
01:31:54.410 --> 01:31:54.420 align:start position:0%
counts of the ballots as written and
 
01:31:55.970 --> 01:31:55.980 align:start position:0%
I've talked to the sponsor about this
 
01:31:58.070 --> 01:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
and I know the sponsor has has talked to
 
01:32:00.770 --> 01:32:00.780 align:start position:0%
members of on both sides of the election
 
01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
law committee prior to this hearing
 
01:32:06.410 --> 01:32:06.420 align:start position:0%
about fixing this bill as we're in this
 
01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
bill simply gives the Secretary of State
 
01:32:11.209 --> 01:32:11.219 align:start position:0%
the discretion to order a second recount
 
01:32:12.729 --> 01:32:12.739 align:start position:0%
if necessary
 
01:32:17.290 --> 01:32:17.300 align:start position:0%
we feel that that is uh an unnecessary
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
power to any state employee any any
 
01:32:22.490 --> 01:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
state officer and even the Secretary of
 
01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
State and I know that the sponsor is
 
01:32:26.570 --> 01:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
working with members of this committee
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh one who's not here today as well on
 
01:32:32.090 --> 01:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
figuring out the mechanism for how to
 
01:32:35.090 --> 01:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
make this a clear and transparent system
 
01:32:37.729 --> 01:32:37.739 align:start position:0%
where if there is an issue found after
 
01:32:40.250 --> 01:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
the first recount that a second recount
 
01:32:41.629 --> 01:32:41.639 align:start position:0%
would be ordered automatically
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
regardless of the discretion of the
 
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State being used I'm not
 
01:32:48.410 --> 01:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
privy to what those conversations are
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
but I do know that they are happening
 
01:32:53.930 --> 01:32:53.940 align:start position:0%
between members on this committee I'm
 
01:32:55.490 --> 01:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions but I'm
 
01:32:57.770 --> 01:32:57.780 align:start position:0%
not sure what the uh the end result will
 
01:32:58.970 --> 01:32:58.980 align:start position:0%
be but I believe it would be something
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
similar to if a audit of the race shows
 
01:33:04.370 --> 01:33:04.380 align:start position:0%
a different number of ballots cast than
 
01:33:07.490 --> 01:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
what the recount showed then there would
 
01:33:10.010 --> 01:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
be uh grounds for a second recount
 
01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
automatically and not at the discretion
 
01:33:14.030 --> 01:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
but am happy to take any questions the
 
01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
community members may have thank you do
 
01:33:18.890 --> 01:33:18.900 align:start position:0%
we have any questions
 
01:33:21.169 --> 01:33:21.179 align:start position:0%
with that thank you oh yes
 
01:33:21.179 --> 01:33:23.510 align:start position:0%
with that thank you oh yes
representative

01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
um what if an audit showed in the second
 
01:33:29.209 --> 01:33:29.219 align:start position:0%
recount a discrepancy would that justify
 
01:33:31.129 --> 01:33:31.139 align:start position:0%
a third recount
 
01:33:33.290 --> 01:33:33.300 align:start position:0%
that is a phenomenal question and I do
 
01:33:35.090 --> 01:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
know that the sponsors we do not want to
 
01:33:37.970 --> 01:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
see Recon after recount after recount
 
01:33:40.610 --> 01:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
um so that would have to be buttoned up
 
01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of the policies that what is
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
the what is the you know acceptable what
 
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
have what happens if there keeps being a
 
01:33:49.250 --> 01:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
variance if there's a variance from
 
01:33:51.050 --> 01:33:51.060 align:start position:0%
election night to the second recount to
 
01:33:53.450 --> 01:33:53.460 align:start position:0%
the audit to the third recount or sorry
 
01:33:55.189 --> 01:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
first recount to the audit to the second
 
01:33:58.129 --> 01:33:58.139 align:start position:0%
recount uh I'm not sure what we would do
 
01:33:59.750 --> 01:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure what we would need to
 
01:34:01.490 --> 01:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
put in the safeguards in the policy in
 
01:34:03.890 --> 01:34:03.900 align:start position:0%
the legislation to prevent that
 
01:34:06.410 --> 01:34:06.420 align:start position:0%
okay I have a follow-up Please Mr chair
 
01:34:08.090 --> 01:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:34:10.250 --> 01:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
um I'm thinking you know with respect to
 
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
buttoning up this bill
 
01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:15.050 align:start position:0%
buttoning up this bill
um

01:34:15.050 --> 01:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:18.530 --> 01:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
that there may be two broad Avenues one
 
01:34:20.930 --> 01:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
is to specify the kinds of reasons that
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
would justify a second recount that's
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
what I think we're just talking about
 
01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
and the other is to design a process
 
01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:29.340 align:start position:0%
that gives the public confidence that
 
01:34:30.830 --> 01:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state had good reason
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
whatever the reason might have been and
 
01:34:36.110 --> 01:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
I can imagine that the legislation might
 
01:34:39.709 --> 01:34:39.719 align:start position:0%
require well let me rephrase please
 
01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
possibly support legislation that
 
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
required the Secretary of State to do
 
01:34:52.430 --> 01:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
something like make the reasons explicit
 
01:34:55.689 --> 01:34:55.699 align:start position:0%
to maybe the state supreme court
 
01:34:59.390 --> 01:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
before a second recount could proceed
 
01:35:01.850 --> 01:35:01.860 align:start position:0%
so so thank you for the question I would
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
not be opposed to making sure there are
 
01:35:05.570 --> 01:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
strong safeguards in here to make sure
 
01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
that the policy isn't uh open to abuse
 
01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
or to discretion
 
01:35:12.970 --> 01:35:12.980 align:start position:0%
um and I know that the the lack of dis
 
01:35:15.410 --> 01:35:15.420 align:start position:0%
limiting the amount of discretion in the
 
01:35:18.169 --> 01:35:18.179 align:start position:0%
process is the goal of fixing this this
 
01:35:20.410 --> 01:35:20.420 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation as it is introduced
 
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
I won't speak for the prime sponsor
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
because you know eight times out of ten
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
who knows
 
01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:28.679 align:start position:0%
um but I think he's based on the
 
01:35:29.930 --> 01:35:29.940 align:start position:0%
conversation I had with him yesterday I
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
think he's of the same vein of thought
 
01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:35.159 align:start position:0%
representative wood
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:35:40.189 --> 01:35:40.199 align:start position:0%
my question uh the bill currently says
 
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
specifically that the Secretary of State
 
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
makes this call so in your testimony you
 
01:35:46.729 --> 01:35:46.739 align:start position:0%
said it's something slightly different
 
01:35:46.739 --> 01:35:48.350 align:start position:0%
said it's something slightly different
uh

01:35:48.350 --> 01:35:48.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:49.860 align:start position:0%
can you clear that clarify please
 
01:35:52.490 --> 01:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
absolutely the the bill as introduced
 
01:35:54.649 --> 01:35:54.659 align:start position:0%
just gives the Secretary of State the
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
con the discretion to conduct a second
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
recount if for for whatever reason
 
01:36:00.649 --> 01:36:00.659 align:start position:0%
there's a discrepancy found
 
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
while that's the way the bill has been
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
introduced there is an effort to button
 
01:36:08.270 --> 01:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
up that policy and that procedure to
 
01:36:10.370 --> 01:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
make it based on clear metrics that are
 
01:36:13.129 --> 01:36:13.139 align:start position:0%
transparent to so it's it doesn't matter
 
01:36:15.169 --> 01:36:15.179 align:start position:0%
on which case it's just if it hits the
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
threshold for discrepancy or whatnot and
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
I and again I'm not privy to those
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
conversations that representative
 
01:36:23.930 --> 01:36:23.940 align:start position:0%
Barry's having but I do know that they
 
01:36:25.490 --> 01:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
are working on building together the
 
01:36:28.129 --> 01:36:28.139 align:start position:0%
sort of framework for what would what
 
01:36:31.790 --> 01:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
would necessitate a second recount
 
01:36:34.669 --> 01:36:34.679 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions okay thank
 
01:36:37.189 --> 01:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
you sweetie thank you very much
 
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:54.169 --> 01:36:54.179 align:start position:0%
good morning all
 
01:36:56.570 --> 01:36:56.580 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman for the record my name is
 
01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
Larry gagne I'm a state representative
 
01:37:01.729 --> 01:37:01.739 align:start position:0%
from Hillsborough District 16 which is
 
01:37:05.330 --> 01:37:05.340 align:start position:0%
Ward 6 in Manchester
 
01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
I'm The Man Behind the reason why
 
01:37:13.250 --> 01:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
uh this bill is before us
 
01:37:15.530 --> 01:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
um this first I hear about them wanting
 
01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
to tweak it and and change different
 
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
things I'm not blaming any anyone for
 
01:37:23.570 --> 01:37:23.580 align:start position:0%
anything here my my thoughts is that
 
01:37:24.770 --> 01:37:24.780 align:start position:0%
there was
 
01:37:27.410 --> 01:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
you know how the recounts go this the
 
01:37:30.050 --> 01:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
stacks of ballots there was chaos in
 
01:37:31.490 --> 01:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
there there were three or four different
 
01:37:35.689 --> 01:37:35.699 align:start position:0%
recounts going on and people were 25 50
 
01:37:35.699 --> 01:37:37.669 align:start position:0%
recounts going on and people were 25 50
75

01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
75
 
01:37:40.010 --> 01:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
like I said I'm not blaming anyone I'm
 
01:37:41.930 --> 01:37:41.940 align:start position:0%
thinking that what happened was there
 
01:37:45.229 --> 01:37:45.239 align:start position:0%
was a stack of ballots that were
 
01:37:45.239 --> 01:37:46.970 align:start position:0%
was a stack of ballots that were
miscounted

01:37:46.970 --> 01:37:46.980 align:start position:0%
miscounted
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
what they did
 
01:37:53.330 --> 01:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
is when we won the case in Merrimack
 
01:37:54.770 --> 01:37:54.780 align:start position:0%
Superior Court
 
01:37:57.229 --> 01:37:57.239 align:start position:0%
that the recount before they counted
 
01:38:00.770 --> 01:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
names they counted the totality of the
 
01:38:03.530 --> 01:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
ballots on hand compared it to the
 
01:38:05.450 --> 01:38:05.460 align:start position:0%
totality of the pallet ballots on
 
01:38:07.729 --> 01:38:07.739 align:start position:0%
Election night and they had found out
 
01:38:09.649 --> 01:38:09.659 align:start position:0%
that there was a discrepancy
 
01:38:13.070 --> 01:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
on a recount we had fewer ballots
 
01:38:15.290 --> 01:38:15.300 align:start position:0%
so now they started the recount after
 
01:38:17.810 --> 01:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
the count was correct and I ended up
 
01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:18.770 align:start position:0%
the count was correct and I ended up
winning

01:38:18.770 --> 01:38:18.780 align:start position:0%
winning
 
01:38:20.590 --> 01:38:20.600 align:start position:0%
thank God
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
but I'm here specifically
 
01:38:26.990 --> 01:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
um my wife and I held hands the first
 
01:38:29.209 --> 01:38:29.219 align:start position:0%
time for six and a half hours the next
 
01:38:30.770 --> 01:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
time for about six seven and a half
 
01:38:34.370 --> 01:38:34.380 align:start position:0%
seven hours and I'm an old man
 
01:38:36.410 --> 01:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
and I don't want anyone else to go
 
01:38:40.189 --> 01:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
through this that we went through uh I
 
01:38:41.629 --> 01:38:41.639 align:start position:0%
hadn't been in Superior Court since I
 
01:38:46.010 --> 01:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
was a cop way back in the 70s so I
 
01:38:48.350 --> 01:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
didn't like that so that's why I'm here
 
01:38:50.570 --> 01:38:50.580 align:start position:0%
and I'm hoping that this committee can
 
01:38:52.490 --> 01:38:52.500 align:start position:0%
tweak it it's first I hear this morning
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney that they were
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
working you were working on tweaking
 
01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
this some so this does not happen again
 
01:39:04.970 --> 01:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:08.209 --> 01:39:08.219 align:start position:0%
thank you we have any questions
 
01:39:09.470 --> 01:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:39:10.910 --> 01:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:39:13.669 --> 01:39:13.679 align:start position:0%
and uh represent what could you check
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet please
 
01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
and doesn't look like we have any more
 
01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
pink sheets
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
and nobody else wants to talk
 
01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:24.169 align:start position:0%
and nobody else wants to talk
so

01:39:24.169 --> 01:39:24.179 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:36.129 --> 01:39:36.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:38.110 --> 01:39:38.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:39:42.410 --> 01:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
and another blank boost sheet
 
01:39:44.990 --> 01:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
so with that and close the hearing of
 
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.390 align:start position:0%
so with that and close the hearing of
476

01:39:47.390 --> 01:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
476
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
and we have at one o'clock is uh 478 so
 
01:39:53.930 --> 01:39:53.940 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:39:55.850 --> 01:39:55.860 align:start position:0%
breaking for lunch
 
03:04:46.610 --> 03:04:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:51.650 --> 03:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:55.309 --> 03:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
okay welcome back we're a little late uh
 
03:04:56.809 --> 03:04:56.819 align:start position:0%
but anyway
 
03:04:59.230 --> 03:04:59.240 align:start position:0%
our next bill
 
03:05:04.370 --> 03:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
is HB 478 relative to ballot order in
 
03:05:06.889 --> 03:05:06.899 align:start position:0%
the general election and representative
 
03:05:08.690 --> 03:05:08.700 align:start position:0%
wood is going to introduce it because
 
03:05:11.210 --> 03:05:11.220 align:start position:0%

03:05:13.630 --> 03:05:13.640 align:start position:0%
he's not here so
 
03:05:16.550 --> 03:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'd like to introduce
 
03:05:19.910 --> 03:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
Bill HB 478 to the house floor for
 
03:05:22.670 --> 03:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
public session uh this bill makes
 
03:05:24.590 --> 03:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
changes to the creation of the ballot
 
03:05:30.530 --> 03:05:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:33.710 --> 03:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
so is there anybody that wants to speak
 
03:05:37.550 --> 03:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:42.710 --> 03:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:45.469 --> 03:05:45.479 align:start position:0%
right I mean if somebody wants to
 
03:05:45.479 --> 03:05:46.490 align:start position:0%
right I mean if somebody wants to
yeah

03:05:46.490 --> 03:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:05:46.500 --> 03:05:47.990 align:start position:0%
yeah
oops

03:05:47.990 --> 03:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
oops
 
03:05:50.150 --> 03:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
I mean you can
 
03:05:53.210 --> 03:05:53.220 align:start position:0%
sorry uh thank you Mr chairman one thing
 
03:05:57.050 --> 03:05:57.060 align:start position:0%
I did notice was like on line 25 I guess
 
03:05:58.550 --> 03:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
it's only one page
 
03:06:00.050 --> 03:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
candidates for the office of state
 
03:06:01.670 --> 03:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative who did not run in a
 
03:06:03.410 --> 03:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
primary but are eligible to peer of the
 
03:06:05.090 --> 03:06:05.100 align:start position:0%
general ballot shall be listed similarly
 
03:06:06.469 --> 03:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
with the person receiving the most
 
03:06:08.030 --> 03:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
signatures to appear on the ballot
 
03:06:10.730 --> 03:06:10.740 align:start position:0%
receiving the first position I mean in
 
03:06:11.870 --> 03:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
my case
 
03:06:13.490 --> 03:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
um I didn't run in a primary and I
 
03:06:16.130 --> 03:06:16.140 align:start position:0%
didn't get any signatures either so I'm
 
03:06:26.210 --> 03:06:26.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:29.110 --> 03:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
really give me a good answer
 
03:06:32.090 --> 03:06:32.100 align:start position:0%
discussing 478 there's nobody to speak
 
03:06:35.450 --> 03:06:35.460 align:start position:0%
on it and representative wood broad you
 
03:06:37.510 --> 03:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
know introduced it but
 
03:06:40.670 --> 03:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
basically we can just take comments if
 
03:06:43.309 --> 03:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
anybody's got one and then
 
03:06:45.590 --> 03:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
yes it doesn't happen Okay well to
 
03:06:47.870 --> 03:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
answer representative Kennedy's question
 
03:06:47.880 --> 03:06:49.010 align:start position:0%
answer representative Kennedy's question
might

03:06:49.010 --> 03:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
might
 
03:06:52.070 --> 03:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
only thought is that I had an
 
03:06:54.349 --> 03:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
independent opposing me so he didn't run
 
03:06:56.389 --> 03:06:56.399 align:start position:0%
in the primary
 
03:06:59.690 --> 03:06:59.700 align:start position:0%
and this would say I don't know what the
 
03:07:02.030 --> 03:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
rule is now but it would just say his
 
03:07:03.349 --> 03:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
name would be
 
03:07:05.690 --> 03:07:05.700 align:start position:0%
uh appear on the general ballot she'll
 
03:07:07.610 --> 03:07:07.620 align:start position:0%
be listed similarly with the
 
03:07:10.250 --> 03:07:10.260 align:start position:0%
you know the other people that
 
03:07:14.870 --> 03:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
that won first place in their primary
 
03:07:16.910 --> 03:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
is he was an independent independent so
 
03:07:19.690 --> 03:07:19.700 align:start position:0%
we didn't have to run in a primary
 
03:07:21.710 --> 03:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
03:07:21.720 --> 03:07:28.690 align:start position:0%
I don't know
foreign

03:07:28.690 --> 03:07:28.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:30.710 --> 03:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand the logic but
 
03:07:32.510 --> 03:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
my understanding of this bill is that
 
03:07:35.630 --> 03:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
right now there's a random order that a
 
03:07:37.370 --> 03:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
random selection that governs the you
 
03:07:38.570 --> 03:07:38.580 align:start position:0%
know order of names and the general
 
03:07:40.190 --> 03:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
election ballot and on the primary
 
03:07:42.889 --> 03:07:42.899 align:start position:0%
ballot instead of that we'll do a random
 
03:07:44.570 --> 03:07:44.580 align:start position:0%
order for the primary but we'll take the
 
03:07:46.010 --> 03:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
number of votes in the primary to
 
03:07:47.090 --> 03:07:47.100 align:start position:0%
determine the order in the general
 
03:07:49.730 --> 03:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
election ballot and what I noticed is
 
03:07:49.740 --> 03:07:50.870 align:start position:0%
election ballot and what I noticed is
that

03:07:50.870 --> 03:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:07:50.880 --> 03:07:51.530 align:start position:0%
that
um

03:07:51.530 --> 03:07:51.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:54.590 --> 03:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
in multi-candidate primaries
 
03:07:54.600 --> 03:07:55.250 align:start position:0%
in multi-candidate primaries
um

03:07:55.250 --> 03:07:55.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:59.469 --> 03:07:59.479 align:start position:0%
the primary ballot name order often
 
03:08:01.790 --> 03:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
decides who gets the most votes I just
 
03:08:03.230 --> 03:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
see a lot of people voting for the first
 
03:08:04.610 --> 03:08:04.620 align:start position:0%
candidate and then a number of votes
 
03:08:07.070 --> 03:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
tapering off as you go down the list so
 
03:08:09.230 --> 03:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
it seems to just reward the random
 
03:08:12.230 --> 03:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
chance that you got listed first in the
 
03:08:14.269 --> 03:08:14.279 align:start position:0%
primary ballot by giving you the first
 
03:08:16.070 --> 03:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
position on the general election ballot
 
03:08:17.389 --> 03:08:17.399 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what I you know what the
 
03:08:20.570 --> 03:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:22.130 --> 03:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean
 
03:08:24.710 --> 03:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
can considering that there could be a
 
03:08:26.809 --> 03:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
presidential primary for instance on one
 
03:08:28.730 --> 03:08:28.740 align:start position:0%
side of the ballot uh that could
 
03:08:30.590 --> 03:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
drastically influence how many people
 
03:08:33.590 --> 03:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
actually show up and vote so there could
 
03:08:36.530 --> 03:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
be one side that ends up getting a huge
 
03:08:39.590 --> 03:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
turnout rate that otherwise would be in
 
03:08:41.630 --> 03:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
the minority potentially in any given
 
03:08:41.640 --> 03:08:43.370 align:start position:0%
the minority potentially in any given
District

03:08:43.370 --> 03:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
District
 
03:08:45.650 --> 03:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
yeah some notice when
 
03:08:47.570 --> 03:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
over the years when they first came I
 
03:08:50.570 --> 03:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
think of 2005 2006 when they change it
 
03:08:53.330 --> 03:08:53.340 align:start position:0%
to be random order the candidate used to
 
03:08:54.830 --> 03:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
be alphabetical
 
03:08:57.950 --> 03:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
and the argument then was a a B's and
 
03:09:00.349 --> 03:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
C's and would always win which wasn't
 
03:09:04.370 --> 03:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
and when I first got here I was in the
 
03:09:07.969 --> 03:09:07.979 align:start position:0%
middle of the first page
 
03:09:11.330 --> 03:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
now I'm the bottom of the second page so
 
03:09:14.769 --> 03:09:14.779 align:start position:0%
that the alphabetical order didn't work
 
03:09:17.990 --> 03:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know so I don't know I think it's
 
03:09:20.630 --> 03:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
the way it is now I think it works fine
 
03:09:22.610 --> 03:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
but the only problem I didn't really
 
03:09:24.769 --> 03:09:24.779 align:start position:0%
like was last year when they changed for
 
03:09:24.779 --> 03:09:25.790 align:start position:0%
like was last year when they changed for
the

03:09:25.790 --> 03:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:09:29.750 --> 03:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
column rotations it's back back way up
 
03:09:31.610 --> 03:09:31.620 align:start position:0%
to the Senate District and they picked
 
03:09:34.010 --> 03:09:34.020 align:start position:0%
the Senate District and then that goes
 
03:09:37.250 --> 03:09:37.260 align:start position:0%
for the whole Senate District which in
 
03:09:40.130 --> 03:09:40.140 align:start position:0%
like in Litchfield it's five Wards in
 
03:09:42.410 --> 03:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
Manchester and let that six six places
 
03:09:44.929 --> 03:09:44.939 align:start position:0%
where the order's the same and used to
 
03:09:46.910 --> 03:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
being different but anyway I don't know
 
03:09:48.349 --> 03:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
but anyway
 
03:09:50.269 --> 03:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
03:09:52.610 --> 03:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to comment that uh I
 
03:09:55.429 --> 03:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
believe the order of uh the candidates
 
03:09:57.170 --> 03:09:57.180 align:start position:0%
in the ballot does not necessarily
 
03:10:00.530 --> 03:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
decide who wins however if they're close
 
03:10:02.630 --> 03:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
like I was in a primary with four
 
03:10:06.170 --> 03:10:06.180 align:start position:0%
candidates for for three positions but
 
03:10:09.290 --> 03:10:09.300 align:start position:0%
whoever is the first will have about two
 
03:10:11.150 --> 03:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
percent that's just a statistical
 
03:10:13.730 --> 03:10:13.740 align:start position:0%
observation that's that's a well-known
 
03:10:16.429 --> 03:10:16.439 align:start position:0%
um in well-known studies and uh that
 
03:10:19.250 --> 03:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
could certainly uh change like for uh if
 
03:10:20.809 --> 03:10:20.819 align:start position:0%
you're selecting three out of four it
 
03:10:23.690 --> 03:10:23.700 align:start position:0%
can change the the two depending on
 
03:10:26.150 --> 03:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
Whose uh who's first yeah I think the
 
03:10:28.190 --> 03:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
more people running it's more or less
 
03:10:31.130 --> 03:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
you further down the list you get
 
03:10:33.170 --> 03:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
ignored but I mean but if there's only a
 
03:10:35.030 --> 03:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
couple people do three I mean I don't
 
03:10:37.550 --> 03:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
think it really mattered that much but
 
03:10:40.490 --> 03:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
anyway so we have 20 minutes before our
 
03:10:42.650 --> 03:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
next bill and maybe we'll have somebody
 
03:10:44.570 --> 03:10:44.580 align:start position:0%
else come
 
03:10:44.580 --> 03:10:46.630 align:start position:0%
else come
here

03:10:46.630 --> 03:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:10:49.550 --> 03:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
what oh yeah there's probably nothing on
 
03:10:50.580 --> 03:10:50.590 align:start position:0%
it but
 
03:10:50.590 --> 03:10:59.450 align:start position:0%
it but
[Music]

03:10:59.450 --> 03:10:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:01.130 --> 03:11:01.140 align:start position:0%
what's the document
 
03:11:01.140 --> 03:11:09.190 align:start position:0%
what's the document
Ary

03:11:09.190 --> 03:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:19.309 --> 03:11:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:23.269 --> 03:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:24.950 --> 03:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment oh yeah that was one of the
 
03:11:26.769 --> 03:11:26.779 align:start position:0%
problems is
 
03:11:30.349 --> 03:11:30.359 align:start position:0%
and we'll have a blank blue sheet so
 
03:11:32.990 --> 03:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
then I'll close the hearing on
 
03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:36.710 align:start position:0%
then I'll close the hearing on
or

03:11:36.710 --> 03:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:39.110 --> 03:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
yeah he'd have to take his kid to the
 
03:11:39.120 --> 03:11:40.150 align:start position:0%
yeah he'd have to take his kid to the
hospital

03:11:40.150 --> 03:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
03:11:43.070 --> 03:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
what bill was this
 
03:11:43.080 --> 03:11:45.469 align:start position:0%
what bill was this
478.

03:11:45.469 --> 03:11:45.479 align:start position:0%
478.
 
03:30:20.450 --> 03:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:22.790 --> 03:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
now I turn the light on
 
03:30:27.769 --> 03:30:27.779 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you uh Mr chairman
 
03:30:30.410 --> 03:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
um and uh members of the election law
 
03:30:33.769 --> 03:30:33.779 align:start position:0%
committee uh I apologize for the way I'm
 
03:30:35.870 --> 03:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
dressed I thought I would have time to
 
03:30:39.710 --> 03:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
change after my EKG uh the good news is
 
03:30:42.650 --> 03:30:42.660 align:start position:0%
my heart is fine I'm and more
 
03:30:44.330 --> 03:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
importantly I don't think I'm contagious
 
03:30:47.030 --> 03:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
with anything so
 
03:30:48.550 --> 03:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:30:53.330 --> 03:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
496 uh it was born out of a conversation
 
03:30:56.630 --> 03:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
I I had in Auburn uh door knocking a few
 
03:30:58.210 --> 03:30:58.220 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
03:31:02.570 --> 03:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
and the uh the Jacobs are here today but
 
03:31:05.030 --> 03:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
while I was door knocking they shared
 
03:31:06.710 --> 03:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
with me
 
03:31:11.510 --> 03:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
um a story that uh really generated a
 
03:31:14.349 --> 03:31:14.359 align:start position:0%
lot of angst during the conversation
 
03:31:19.670 --> 03:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
about how their mother had been
 
03:31:22.610 --> 03:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
was a resident in a nursing home and
 
03:31:24.590 --> 03:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
they that they stumbled upon the
 
03:31:27.170 --> 03:31:27.180 align:start position:0%
children stumbled upon the fact that she
 
03:31:30.229 --> 03:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
had registered to get receive an
 
03:31:32.630 --> 03:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot and she cast it
 
03:31:36.349 --> 03:31:36.359 align:start position:0%
and the her mom their mom was not in any
 
03:31:39.349 --> 03:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
position mentally she had Dementia or
 
03:31:41.030 --> 03:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
something I don't know how much they
 
03:31:43.130 --> 03:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
want to talk about that but
 
03:31:45.710 --> 03:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
um and so I think their perception was
 
03:31:48.290 --> 03:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
that this was a form of elder abuse to
 
03:31:51.229 --> 03:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
be able to go in and register people to
 
03:31:54.229 --> 03:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
vote and cast an absentee ballot for
 
03:31:56.410 --> 03:31:56.420 align:start position:0%
them when
 
03:31:59.349 --> 03:31:59.359 align:start position:0%
there's very little
 
03:32:03.290 --> 03:32:03.300 align:start position:0%
cognizance about what is going on and if
 
03:32:05.990 --> 03:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
you go through our nursing homes in this
 
03:32:08.630 --> 03:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
state you'll find an extremely high
 
03:32:11.630 --> 03:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
percentage of people with dementia even
 
03:32:14.210 --> 03:32:14.220 align:start position:0%
up like in the veterans home they have
 
03:32:16.790 --> 03:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
half of the beds basically set aside for
 
03:32:18.889 --> 03:32:18.899 align:start position:0%
dementia patients and the other half are
 
03:32:20.750 --> 03:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to be non-dementia patients and
 
03:32:23.870 --> 03:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
even in the non-devention award
 
03:32:26.690 --> 03:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
um 60 70 percent of those are have
 
03:32:28.490 --> 03:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
dementia so
 
03:32:33.290 --> 03:32:33.300 align:start position:0%
so I think this this bill attempts to
 
03:32:36.950 --> 03:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
say that it's absolutely vital that we
 
03:32:40.250 --> 03:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
protect a person's right to vote and
 
03:32:43.389 --> 03:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
their dignity to cast their vote and
 
03:32:46.330 --> 03:32:46.340 align:start position:0%
while at the same time acknowledging
 
03:32:52.190 --> 03:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
that the way in which we manage their
 
03:32:52.200 --> 03:32:53.170 align:start position:0%
that the way in which we manage their
ballots

03:32:53.170 --> 03:32:53.180 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
03:32:58.330 --> 03:32:58.340 align:start position:0%
may be appropriate for us to ensure that
 
03:33:02.750 --> 03:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
they have some capacity to request and
 
03:33:06.370 --> 03:33:06.380 align:start position:0%
cast a ballot and and so
 
03:33:09.650 --> 03:33:09.660 align:start position:0%
even though they told me this their
 
03:33:12.290 --> 03:33:12.300 align:start position:0%
their story about three years ago I
 
03:33:14.269 --> 03:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
missed last election cycle because
 
03:33:16.729 --> 03:33:16.739 align:start position:0%
working with the representative Griffin
 
03:33:18.590 --> 03:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
we couldn't figure out how to approach
 
03:33:21.889 --> 03:33:21.899 align:start position:0%
the bill so this time around I just went
 
03:33:21.899 --> 03:33:23.210 align:start position:0%
the bill so this time around I just went
to

03:33:23.210 --> 03:33:23.220 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:33:23.220 --> 03:33:25.370 align:start position:0%
to
um

03:33:25.370 --> 03:33:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:28.330 --> 03:33:28.340 align:start position:0%
um Dave Scanlon when when he was the uh
 
03:33:31.849 --> 03:33:31.859 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary of state and this is
 
03:33:34.070 --> 03:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
essentially his language this is what he
 
03:33:36.050 --> 03:33:36.060 align:start position:0%
came up with after about eight months of
 
03:33:39.290 --> 03:33:39.300 align:start position:0%
thinking about it how we might do it
 
03:33:43.309 --> 03:33:43.319 align:start position:0%
um and I I think that uh it's a it's a
 
03:33:47.630 --> 03:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
really great first attempt to to have
 
03:33:51.229 --> 03:33:51.239 align:start position:0%
the conversation about what could be or
 
03:33:54.830 --> 03:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
should be and what should not be done in
 
03:33:56.530 --> 03:33:56.540 align:start position:0%
this area
 
03:34:00.349 --> 03:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
and and uh and if there's a a way for us
 
03:34:02.870 --> 03:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
to to to say yes to each other and to
 
03:34:06.290 --> 03:34:06.300 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to pass some
 
03:34:10.309 --> 03:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
protections while fully preserving the
 
03:34:12.830 --> 03:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
right to vote I I think that would be a
 
03:34:14.929 --> 03:34:14.939 align:start position:0%
great outcome I don't think it's an easy
 
03:34:18.050 --> 03:34:18.060 align:start position:0%
balance but but I think we owe it to
 
03:34:20.450 --> 03:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
ourselves to have that conversation uh
 
03:34:22.429 --> 03:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office is
 
03:34:24.590 --> 03:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
represented here certainly the Jacob
 
03:34:27.830 --> 03:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
ribs are here they're in favor I believe
 
03:34:31.610 --> 03:34:31.620 align:start position:0%
the the town clerks are not in favor
 
03:34:34.190 --> 03:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
um and and I can kind of understand that
 
03:34:36.170 --> 03:34:36.180 align:start position:0%
there's more work here than what we've
 
03:34:38.090 --> 03:34:38.100 align:start position:0%
done in the past and I don't know what
 
03:34:40.250 --> 03:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
the other objections are I would hope
 
03:34:43.550 --> 03:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
that they would share the the goal of
 
03:34:46.190 --> 03:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
trying to prevent elder abuse and voter
 
03:34:47.990 --> 03:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
theft but
 
03:34:49.969 --> 03:34:49.979 align:start position:0%
um I'll I'll take questions if there are
 
03:34:49.979 --> 03:34:51.110 align:start position:0%
um I'll I'll take questions if there are
any

03:34:51.110 --> 03:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:34:54.050 --> 03:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
thank you do any questions
 
03:34:54.060 --> 03:34:55.610 align:start position:0%
thank you do any questions
representative

03:34:55.610 --> 03:34:55.620 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:34:58.130 --> 03:34:58.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:34:58.140 --> 03:34:59.150 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

03:34:59.150 --> 03:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:00.950 --> 03:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
my understanding of this bill from line
 
03:35:03.710 --> 03:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
7 to 10 is that
 
03:35:06.530 --> 03:35:06.540 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballot observers who are
 
03:35:08.450 --> 03:35:08.460 align:start position:0%
representatives of the two parties that
 
03:35:09.710 --> 03:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
receive the highest number of votes in
 
03:35:11.530 --> 03:35:11.540 align:start position:0%
the last election
 
03:35:13.429 --> 03:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
ensure that
 
03:35:14.990 --> 03:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
the process of receiving marketing
 
03:35:17.269 --> 03:35:17.279 align:start position:0%
returning apps debalance is fair private
 
03:35:19.130 --> 03:35:19.140 align:start position:0%
and properly handled what would happen
 
03:35:19.140 --> 03:35:20.650 align:start position:0%
and properly handled what would happen
if

03:35:20.650 --> 03:35:20.660 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:35:24.170 --> 03:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
uh the two ballot observers disagreed
 
03:35:26.030 --> 03:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
with each other about whether the
 
03:35:28.429 --> 03:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
process was Fair private and properly
 
03:35:31.550 --> 03:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
handled I I think I I think that's a
 
03:35:35.389 --> 03:35:35.399 align:start position:0%
good question to expand on details
 
03:35:37.790 --> 03:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
within the bill and maybe the deputy
 
03:35:39.830 --> 03:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
secretary of state may have some ideas
 
03:35:43.190 --> 03:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
on that I'm not steeped in election law
 
03:35:46.190 --> 03:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
but what I I think might be able to
 
03:35:48.830 --> 03:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
happen is is that the the you know there
 
03:35:50.870 --> 03:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
there could be a contested ballot and
 
03:35:53.510 --> 03:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
there we do have some procedures I
 
03:35:56.510 --> 03:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
understand for uh contesting ballots and
 
03:35:56.520 --> 03:35:58.150 align:start position:0%
understand for uh contesting ballots and
and

03:35:58.150 --> 03:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:36:01.910 --> 03:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
reconciling perspectives before their
 
03:36:01.920 --> 03:36:03.050 align:start position:0%
reconciling perspectives before their
cast

03:36:03.050 --> 03:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
cast
 
03:36:07.849 --> 03:36:07.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:10.490 --> 03:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you
 
03:36:13.670 --> 03:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
um does this bill mean that no one in a
 
03:36:15.290 --> 03:36:15.300 align:start position:0%
nursing home may fill out an absentee
 
03:36:17.150 --> 03:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
ballot unless the two absentee ballot
 
03:36:20.630 --> 03:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
observers are present in the facility
 
03:36:22.790 --> 03:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
I I don't know that that would be a good
 
03:36:24.469 --> 03:36:24.479 align:start position:0%
outcome I don't think that would be a
 
03:36:26.269 --> 03:36:26.279 align:start position:0%
good outcome and if you think the
 
03:36:29.450 --> 03:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
legislation says that then I'd be happy
 
03:36:33.429 --> 03:36:33.439 align:start position:0%
to see alternative language certainly
 
03:36:35.750 --> 03:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
just because you're in a nursing home
 
03:36:40.370 --> 03:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean you're incapacitated uh the
 
03:36:43.429 --> 03:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
odds of it go up dramatically based on
 
03:36:46.910 --> 03:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
the statistics but but uh I you know my
 
03:36:50.150 --> 03:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
my first principle is that we must first
 
03:36:52.330 --> 03:36:52.340 align:start position:0%
protect the right to vote
 
03:36:55.910 --> 03:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
and then beyond that the issue gets to
 
03:36:58.309 --> 03:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
be is are there reasonable things we can
 
03:37:02.330 --> 03:37:02.340 align:start position:0%
do to mitigate the potential for
 
03:37:02.340 --> 03:37:03.670 align:start position:0%
do to mitigate the potential for
somebody

03:37:03.670 --> 03:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
03:37:07.250 --> 03:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
falsifying the absentee ballot process
 
03:37:10.849 --> 03:37:10.859 align:start position:0%
and casting a ballot without the
 
03:37:14.630 --> 03:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
awareness of the actual voter and you'll
 
03:37:16.490 --> 03:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
listen to the Jacobs and they have an
 
03:37:19.790 --> 03:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
extremely well documented case of one
 
03:37:23.030 --> 03:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
such example of what I I think it's
 
03:37:25.790 --> 03:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
elder abuse but
 
03:37:25.800 --> 03:37:32.809 align:start position:0%
elder abuse but
foreign

03:37:32.809 --> 03:37:32.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:34.190 --> 03:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:37:34.200 --> 03:37:35.330 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:37:35.330 --> 03:37:35.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:37.309 --> 03:37:37.319 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate your explanation
 
03:37:37.319 --> 03:37:38.410 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate your explanation
so

03:37:38.410 --> 03:37:38.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:37:41.330 --> 03:37:41.340 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the two ballot
 
03:37:44.630 --> 03:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
observers would accompany the town clerk
 
03:37:47.030 --> 03:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
as the absentee ballots are delivered to
 
03:37:48.710 --> 03:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
the facility but would not be in the
 
03:37:51.530 --> 03:37:51.540 align:start position:0%
facility then when the ballots are being
 
03:37:51.540 --> 03:37:55.130 align:start position:0%
facility then when the ballots are being
marked

03:37:55.130 --> 03:37:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:55.140 --> 03:37:55.969 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:37:55.969 --> 03:37:55.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:58.190 --> 03:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
or returned and collected
 
03:38:00.229 --> 03:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
and so my question is how could those
 
03:38:02.510 --> 03:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
observers then attest that the process
 
03:38:02.520 --> 03:38:04.070 align:start position:0%
observers then attest that the process
is

03:38:04.070 --> 03:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:38:06.530 --> 03:38:06.540 align:start position:0%
fair if they're not in the building when
 
03:38:07.969 --> 03:38:07.979 align:start position:0%
the ballots are being marked and when
 
03:38:09.530 --> 03:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
the ballots are being collected but are
 
03:38:11.510 --> 03:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
only present when the ballots are being
 
03:38:14.150 --> 03:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
delivered by the hand by the town clerk
 
03:38:17.150 --> 03:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
I I I I can see where you would make
 
03:38:19.490 --> 03:38:19.500 align:start position:0%
that assumption I I don't know if I join
 
03:38:21.710 --> 03:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
you in that assumption I'm reading line
 
03:38:25.309 --> 03:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
seven eight nine uh the absentee ballot
 
03:38:27.830 --> 03:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
observers shall ensure the process of
 
03:38:30.290 --> 03:38:30.300 align:start position:0%
receiving marking and returning the
 
03:38:32.630 --> 03:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots is fair private and
 
03:38:35.630 --> 03:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
properly handled and so
 
03:38:39.790 --> 03:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
um you know it I I think there may be
 
03:38:42.769 --> 03:38:42.779 align:start position:0%
some Unwritten words here on how they
 
03:38:45.410 --> 03:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
would ensure that but the scope of this
 
03:38:48.590 --> 03:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
is meant to include the entire workflow
 
03:38:52.250 --> 03:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
of Distributing and and collecting the
 
03:38:52.260 --> 03:38:57.590 align:start position:0%
of Distributing and and collecting the
ballots

03:38:57.590 --> 03:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:00.830 --> 03:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
represent Kennedy yeah this this is kind
 
03:39:02.570 --> 03:39:02.580 align:start position:0%
of a follow-up to representative Muir
 
03:39:04.790 --> 03:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
has question because if you deliver the
 
03:39:07.010 --> 03:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
ballot uh the person has to think about
 
03:39:09.410 --> 03:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
what they're doing right I mean unless
 
03:39:10.849 --> 03:39:10.859 align:start position:0%
there's some procedure to make sure
 
03:39:12.410 --> 03:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
they've looked at a sample ballot or
 
03:39:14.510 --> 03:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
whatever so would The Observers simply
 
03:39:17.090 --> 03:39:17.100 align:start position:0%
have to stay there on site until the
 
03:39:20.090 --> 03:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
ballots are marked and collected
 
03:39:22.490 --> 03:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
I I don't I don't know what that
 
03:39:24.769 --> 03:39:24.779 align:start position:0%
procedure would look like uh this this
 
03:39:28.070 --> 03:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
is uh the first year that this bill has
 
03:39:30.889 --> 03:39:30.899 align:start position:0%
been proposed and it was written in
 
03:39:33.590 --> 03:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
isolation by uh
 
03:39:37.429 --> 03:39:37.439 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State Scanlon and you know
 
03:39:40.250 --> 03:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
I trust I trust the legislative process
 
03:39:43.010 --> 03:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
I trust this committee to basically
 
03:39:45.170 --> 03:39:45.180 align:start position:0%
think through some of these details that
 
03:39:47.990 --> 03:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
maybe were not thought of you know late
 
03:39:50.150 --> 03:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
night at his desk when he was typing
 
03:39:52.010 --> 03:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
this up so
 
03:39:52.020 --> 03:39:53.870 align:start position:0%
this up so
um

03:39:53.870 --> 03:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:53.880 --> 03:39:56.330 align:start position:0%
um
okay

03:39:56.330 --> 03:39:56.340 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:39:57.889 --> 03:39:57.899 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:39:57.899 --> 03:40:00.229 align:start position:0%
any other questions
representative

03:40:00.229 --> 03:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:40:02.269 --> 03:40:02.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:40:03.469 --> 03:40:03.479 align:start position:0%
my question
 
03:40:07.550 --> 03:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
so um if uh so in a nursing home in a
 
03:40:10.070 --> 03:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
big nursing home when um is this
 
03:40:12.349 --> 03:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
something that will be like an event
 
03:40:15.410 --> 03:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
like okay all of the requests have to be
 
03:40:17.630 --> 03:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
done at the same time for residents of
 
03:40:20.570 --> 03:40:20.580 align:start position:0%
the nursing home such that when uh
 
03:40:22.490 --> 03:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
they're delivered they're delivered at
 
03:40:24.769 --> 03:40:24.779 align:start position:0%
the same time so that the people who are
 
03:40:26.630 --> 03:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
accompanying the ballots and the
 
03:40:29.750 --> 03:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
markings and all of that will be done as
 
03:40:31.550 --> 03:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
kind of like an event in that nursing
 
03:40:33.650 --> 03:40:33.660 align:start position:0%
home or is this something that's done
 
03:40:37.670 --> 03:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
upon request such that each resident May
 
03:40:40.370 --> 03:40:40.380 align:start position:0%
request it at a different time so they
 
03:40:42.410 --> 03:40:42.420 align:start position:0%
get delivered marked submitted and then
 
03:40:44.389 --> 03:40:44.399 align:start position:0%
another Resident may do it at another
 
03:40:47.090 --> 03:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
time I'm just trying to picture how how
 
03:40:49.969 --> 03:40:49.979 align:start position:0%
this unfolds I I don't I don't know what
 
03:40:52.250 --> 03:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
that would look like I I know having
 
03:40:53.990 --> 03:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
visited nursing homes when my
 
03:40:56.750 --> 03:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
mother-in-law was in them the nursing
 
03:41:01.729 --> 03:41:01.739 align:start position:0%
director was desperate to find events so
 
03:41:04.969 --> 03:41:04.979 align:start position:0%
if there was a can at night if there was
 
03:41:09.830 --> 03:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
a you know ballot night uh I I I don't I
 
03:41:11.030 --> 03:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
don't think there's anything in here
 
03:41:15.050 --> 03:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
that would preclude that or require it
 
03:41:16.849 --> 03:41:16.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:41:19.250 --> 03:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
any more questions
 
03:41:21.950 --> 03:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan thank you and
 
03:41:23.269 --> 03:41:23.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question this
 
03:41:24.530 --> 03:41:24.540 align:start position:0%
kind of follows up to what
 
03:41:27.050 --> 03:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
representative Bay was talking about so
 
03:41:28.670 --> 03:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that when someone
 
03:41:31.429 --> 03:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
wants to fill out an absentee ballot
 
03:41:33.229 --> 03:41:33.239 align:start position:0%
they first have to go through the
 
03:41:36.170 --> 03:41:36.180 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot request form
 
03:41:38.330 --> 03:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
um I don't see anything in this bill
 
03:41:41.330 --> 03:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
here and I'm wondering if it is your
 
03:41:43.010 --> 03:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
intent that
 
03:41:45.889 --> 03:41:45.899 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballot observers that there
 
03:41:49.370 --> 03:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
would be observers during the request
 
03:41:52.729 --> 03:41:52.739 align:start position:0%
process as well
 
03:41:54.710 --> 03:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
because if we're talk I'm trying to
 
03:41:59.510 --> 03:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
understand if the concern is that an
 
03:42:03.050 --> 03:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
individual does not have the capacity to
 
03:42:07.190 --> 03:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
fill out an absentee ballot
 
03:42:09.469 --> 03:42:09.479 align:start position:0%
would they not also
 
03:42:12.229 --> 03:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
would there also be a concern about them
 
03:42:15.650 --> 03:42:15.660 align:start position:0%
being able to properly or adequately
 
03:42:20.170 --> 03:42:20.180 align:start position:0%
fill out an absentee ballot request form
 
03:42:23.269 --> 03:42:23.279 align:start position:0%
in my experience with dementia patients
 
03:42:25.670 --> 03:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
in nursing homes
 
03:42:28.309 --> 03:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
yeah somebody with dementia is going to
 
03:42:30.650 --> 03:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
have a really hard time even making a
 
03:42:32.570 --> 03:42:32.580 align:start position:0%
proper respect or request for an
 
03:42:35.870 --> 03:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot and uh and what we end
 
03:42:38.929 --> 03:42:38.939 align:start position:0%
up doing to basically assist that
 
03:42:43.190 --> 03:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
without uh replacing their independent
 
03:42:45.710 --> 03:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
judgment I I don't know this I think
 
03:42:49.010 --> 03:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
this is a very difficult issue and I
 
03:42:51.950 --> 03:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
hope whatever we do we come down on the
 
03:42:55.010 --> 03:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
side of protecting the right to vote but
 
03:42:57.969 --> 03:42:57.979 align:start position:0%
I I really would just like to see us
 
03:43:01.130 --> 03:43:01.140 align:start position:0%
think through how we might be able to
 
03:43:05.150 --> 03:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
also protect our seniors that really are
 
03:43:08.210 --> 03:43:08.220 align:start position:0%
no longer able to participate in the
 
03:43:09.830 --> 03:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
electoral process
 
03:43:14.630 --> 03:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
and not have their ballots abused
 
03:43:16.429 --> 03:43:16.439 align:start position:0%
follow please
 
03:43:21.469 --> 03:43:21.479 align:start position:0%
are you aware of this being a
 
03:43:24.229 --> 03:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
sizable significant
 
03:43:30.290 --> 03:43:30.300 align:start position:0%
issue or is this a one-time couple of
 
03:43:32.750 --> 03:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
time occurrences that there has been an
 
03:43:34.910 --> 03:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
issue that has raised concerns for the
 
03:43:36.889 --> 03:43:36.899 align:start position:0%
family of the
 
03:43:41.210 --> 03:43:41.220 align:start position:0%
uh elderly Nursing Home Patient
 
03:43:43.370 --> 03:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
so there are no statistics that I know
 
03:43:46.370 --> 03:43:46.380 align:start position:0%
of on that and and uh and talking uh
 
03:43:49.010 --> 03:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
with uh Miss Hennessy from the Secretary
 
03:43:51.650 --> 03:43:51.660 align:start position:0%
of State's office before the hearing
 
03:43:54.170 --> 03:43:54.180 align:start position:0%
um we don't have any data even to say
 
03:43:57.229 --> 03:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
what number of absentee ballots are
 
03:44:00.229 --> 03:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
requested by residents in nursing homes
 
03:44:02.450 --> 03:44:02.460 align:start position:0%
there's a lack of data here they just
 
03:44:04.550 --> 03:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
they they know how many absentee ballots
 
03:44:06.469 --> 03:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
we have but they don't keep track of
 
03:44:09.229 --> 03:44:09.239 align:start position:0%
where the request was originated so we
 
03:44:12.170 --> 03:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
don't really have that data we have one
 
03:44:15.290 --> 03:44:15.300 align:start position:0%
very clear example in one nursing home
 
03:44:18.370 --> 03:44:18.380 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire where I think it's
 
03:44:22.130 --> 03:44:22.140 align:start position:0%
inarguable that there was abuse and is
 
03:44:25.269 --> 03:44:25.279 align:start position:0%
one enough well I think
 
03:44:25.279 --> 03:44:27.190 align:start position:0%
one enough well I think
one

03:44:27.190 --> 03:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:44:30.889 --> 03:44:30.899 align:start position:0%
causes us to step back and say did this
 
03:44:34.309 --> 03:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
one expose something that we should be
 
03:44:37.309 --> 03:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
concerned about systemically if if if
 
03:44:41.210 --> 03:44:41.220 align:start position:0%
the one happened in one nursing home a
 
03:44:45.229 --> 03:44:45.239 align:start position:0%
that suggests that a person was working
 
03:44:49.370 --> 03:44:49.380 align:start position:0%
the system to go get other
 
03:44:49.380 --> 03:44:50.410 align:start position:0%
the system to go get other
um

03:44:50.410 --> 03:44:50.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:53.510 --> 03:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
patients ballots from that same nursing
 
03:44:55.670 --> 03:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
home so so even though we just have we
 
03:44:59.090 --> 03:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
know one it kind of suggests you know
 
03:45:00.710 --> 03:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
maybe it would have been worth an
 
03:45:03.170 --> 03:45:03.180 align:start position:0%
investigation to go see if this happened
 
03:45:06.769 --> 03:45:06.779 align:start position:0%
on that election at that nursing home
 
03:45:10.130 --> 03:45:10.140 align:start position:0%
other times but but no such request was
 
03:45:11.870 --> 03:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
made that I know of
 
03:45:14.990 --> 03:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up okay um last because
 
03:45:17.690 --> 03:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
we need to move on yes thank you
 
03:45:19.190 --> 03:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
03:45:19.200 --> 03:45:20.030 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
um

03:45:20.030 --> 03:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:23.030 --> 03:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
is because you seem to have a knowledge
 
03:45:26.269 --> 03:45:26.279 align:start position:0%
of um nursing homes I just is there a
 
03:45:28.670 --> 03:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
process by which a family member of a
 
03:45:30.410 --> 03:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
resident of a nursing home would be able
 
03:45:33.229 --> 03:45:33.239 align:start position:0%
to make a request of that nursing home
 
03:45:36.830 --> 03:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
that they do not provide that nursing
 
03:45:39.469 --> 03:45:39.479 align:start position:0%
home resident with an absentee ballot
 
03:45:42.050 --> 03:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
request form I I think that's a really
 
03:45:44.510 --> 03:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
great question to ask the the children
 
03:45:48.190 --> 03:45:48.200 align:start position:0%
of the mom that that went through this
 
03:45:52.729 --> 03:45:52.739 align:start position:0%
they they held a a power of attorney for
 
03:45:55.490 --> 03:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
them the mom and and generally what the
 
03:45:58.070 --> 03:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
power of attorney does is it basically
 
03:46:01.190 --> 03:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
delegates to somebody to make major
 
03:46:03.950 --> 03:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
decisions for them and
 
03:46:06.830 --> 03:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
um and and that power of attorney was
 
03:46:09.590 --> 03:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
well known to the nursing home but no
 
03:46:12.229 --> 03:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
one from the nursing home consulted with
 
03:46:15.110 --> 03:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
them to determine if the request for the
 
03:46:17.570 --> 03:46:17.580 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot was something that they
 
03:46:19.790 --> 03:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
should check with them or not and and
 
03:46:23.090 --> 03:46:23.100 align:start position:0%
certain not when the ballot was cast so
 
03:46:23.100 --> 03:46:24.410 align:start position:0%
certain not when the ballot was cast so
so

03:46:24.410 --> 03:46:24.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:46:24.420 --> 03:46:25.389 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:46:25.389 --> 03:46:25.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:28.670 --> 03:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
it may be an area that that our laws are
 
03:46:31.490 --> 03:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
silent and and maybe that's what comes
 
03:46:34.130 --> 03:46:34.140 align:start position:0%
of this and uh another term or two that
 
03:46:36.110 --> 03:46:36.120 align:start position:0%
we really work through this
 
03:46:37.450 --> 03:46:37.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:46:41.210 --> 03:46:41.220 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and uh now
 
03:46:51.889 --> 03:46:51.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:53.570 --> 03:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:46:56.570 --> 03:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
my mother-in-law was a really smart
 
03:46:59.349 --> 03:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
woman and she lived with me for 17 years
 
03:47:02.929 --> 03:47:02.939 align:start position:0%
and I brought her to vote
 
03:47:04.670 --> 03:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
every election
 
03:47:08.450 --> 03:47:08.460 align:start position:0%
until she started to be unable to pay
 
03:47:10.010 --> 03:47:10.020 align:start position:0%
attention to the news
 
03:47:12.650 --> 03:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
she just knew that she didn't want to
 
03:47:15.769 --> 03:47:15.779 align:start position:0%
vote anymore after that and so I didn't
 
03:47:17.929 --> 03:47:17.939 align:start position:0%
push it but if I did want to push it I
 
03:47:19.490 --> 03:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
could have easily done so I could have
 
03:47:20.929 --> 03:47:20.939 align:start position:0%
put papers in front of her and said you
 
03:47:22.070 --> 03:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
have to sign this you have to do this
 
03:47:23.750 --> 03:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
because sometimes I did have to put
 
03:47:25.130 --> 03:47:25.140 align:start position:0%
papers in front of her and ask her a
 
03:47:25.140 --> 03:47:25.969 align:start position:0%
papers in front of her and ask her a
person

03:47:25.969 --> 03:47:25.979 align:start position:0%
person
 
03:47:28.130 --> 03:47:28.140 align:start position:0%
signatures and she had a lot of trouble
 
03:47:30.290 --> 03:47:30.300 align:start position:0%
understanding what I was I was doing but
 
03:47:32.269 --> 03:47:32.279 align:start position:0%
it was really necessary whenever I did
 
03:47:34.370 --> 03:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
that it was very necessary and I tried
 
03:47:36.050 --> 03:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
to do it in front of my sister-in-law so
 
03:47:38.389 --> 03:47:38.399 align:start position:0%
the whole family knew that
 
03:47:40.790 --> 03:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
we're all on the same page with
 
03:47:42.530 --> 03:47:42.540 align:start position:0%
everything that we're doing so that we
 
03:47:44.690 --> 03:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
were all confident about that
 
03:47:48.410 --> 03:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:51.410 --> 03:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
I don't think we have all the answers to
 
03:47:52.910 --> 03:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
some of the excellent questions that
 
03:47:55.670 --> 03:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
were asked right now but I think we're
 
03:47:58.309 --> 03:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
this is a work in progress because these
 
03:48:01.190 --> 03:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
are issues that aren't addressed
 
03:48:01.200 --> 03:48:03.110 align:start position:0%
are issues that aren't addressed
currently

03:48:03.110 --> 03:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
currently
 
03:48:05.389 --> 03:48:05.399 align:start position:0%
but if we get started on this I think
 
03:48:09.469 --> 03:48:09.479 align:start position:0%
that is the only way to to find out some
 
03:48:11.030 --> 03:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
of the answers to those questions and to
 
03:48:12.830 --> 03:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
move forward further legislation is
 
03:48:17.030 --> 03:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
needed I I know when we when um ballots
 
03:48:19.190 --> 03:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
are transferred from a polling location
 
03:48:21.590 --> 03:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
to a different area
 
03:48:26.210 --> 03:48:26.220 align:start position:0%
there has to be a members of two members
 
03:48:28.969 --> 03:48:28.979 align:start position:0%
of different parties in the vehicle when
 
03:48:31.070 --> 03:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
that's done and that makes people feel
 
03:48:32.630 --> 03:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
much more confident and this is the same
 
03:48:32.640 --> 03:48:33.469 align:start position:0%
much more confident and this is the same
thing

03:48:33.469 --> 03:48:33.479 align:start position:0%
thing
 
03:48:35.210 --> 03:48:35.220 align:start position:0%
my mother-in-law didn't spend much time
 
03:48:37.130 --> 03:48:37.140 align:start position:0%
in a nursing home in fact when she got
 
03:48:38.870 --> 03:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
there she passed away soon after just
 
03:48:40.550 --> 03:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
within hours
 
03:48:42.769 --> 03:48:42.779 align:start position:0%
but I spent a long time just prior to
 
03:48:44.809 --> 03:48:44.819 align:start position:0%
that looking for a nursing home for her
 
03:48:46.790 --> 03:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
to be to be placed in because she needed
 
03:48:48.729 --> 03:48:48.739 align:start position:0%
that covet hit
 
03:48:51.290 --> 03:48:51.300 align:start position:0%
complicating everything but when I went
 
03:48:53.510 --> 03:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
to the different nursing homes I had a
 
03:48:55.610 --> 03:48:55.620 align:start position:0%
similar bill that year and it was also
 
03:48:57.469 --> 03:48:57.479 align:start position:0%
near election and the people that I
 
03:48:58.670 --> 03:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
spoke to at the nursing homes were
 
03:49:01.849 --> 03:49:01.859 align:start position:0%
relieved the the general sense was oh
 
03:49:05.410 --> 03:49:05.420 align:start position:0%
good there'll be a time when we can go
 
03:49:09.950 --> 03:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
to the activities room and have this
 
03:49:11.690 --> 03:49:11.700 align:start position:0%
taken care of with some people that can
 
03:49:13.309 --> 03:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
answer some questions and the same thing
 
03:49:15.229 --> 03:49:15.239 align:start position:0%
that I felt when I had to have my
 
03:49:16.729 --> 03:49:16.739 align:start position:0%
mother-in-law sign some important
 
03:49:18.530 --> 03:49:18.540 align:start position:0%
paperwork when I wanted to have as many
 
03:49:19.910 --> 03:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
family members in the room when that
 
03:49:21.950 --> 03:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
happened so everybody was aware of what
 
03:49:24.050 --> 03:49:24.060 align:start position:0%
was going on that's how the people that
 
03:49:25.729 --> 03:49:25.739 align:start position:0%
work at nursing homes would feel they
 
03:49:27.950 --> 03:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
would feel like okay we had the
 
03:49:31.010 --> 03:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
Republican rep we had the Democrat we
 
03:49:33.469 --> 03:49:33.479 align:start position:0%
had lots of people in the room observing
 
03:49:34.910 --> 03:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
and watching what was going on they felt
 
03:49:36.349 --> 03:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
more confident that everybody would know
 
03:49:37.670 --> 03:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
that that everything was on the up and
 
03:49:39.710 --> 03:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
up and they'd feel good about it so I
 
03:49:41.450 --> 03:49:41.460 align:start position:0%
think this is positive and it goes in a
 
03:49:42.950 --> 03:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
good direction not just for the people
 
03:49:44.510 --> 03:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
in the nursing home but
 
03:49:47.510 --> 03:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
family members of of people in nursing
 
03:49:47.520 --> 03:49:48.650 align:start position:0%
family members of of people in nursing
homes

03:49:48.650 --> 03:49:48.660 align:start position:0%
homes
 
03:49:52.309 --> 03:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any quick questions
 
03:49:54.110 --> 03:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:49:55.969 --> 03:49:55.979 align:start position:0%
now maybe to answer some of these
 
03:49:59.269 --> 03:49:59.279 align:start position:0%
questions is call up deputy secretary of
 
03:50:05.690 --> 03:50:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:07.490 --> 03:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Aaron Hennessey
 
03:50:09.889 --> 03:50:09.899 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary of state I wanted to
 
03:50:12.410 --> 03:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
let everyone know okay what did I say
 
03:50:14.030 --> 03:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
that oh no but I'm supposed to say it
 
03:50:18.550 --> 03:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:20.870 --> 03:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh I wanted to let everyone know that
 
03:50:23.150 --> 03:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
our office is in support of this
 
03:50:25.969 --> 03:50:25.979 align:start position:0%
legislation as this of the Prime sponsor
 
03:50:29.630 --> 03:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned my boss secretary Scanlon did
 
03:50:31.550 --> 03:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
help him write the verbiage for this
 
03:50:31.560 --> 03:50:32.990 align:start position:0%
help him write the verbiage for this
bill

03:50:32.990 --> 03:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:50:34.910 --> 03:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
um during every election season our
 
03:50:37.370 --> 03:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
office does get many many phone calls
 
03:50:40.969 --> 03:50:40.979 align:start position:0%
related to nursing home and voting in
 
03:50:44.030 --> 03:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
nursing home most of its complaints that
 
03:50:47.750 --> 03:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
we get we see this as a good step in the
 
03:50:51.469 --> 03:50:51.479 align:start position:0%
right direction and a fair process some
 
03:50:53.990 --> 03:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
of the issues that come up with voting
 
03:50:55.790 --> 03:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
in nursing homes is that you probably
 
03:50:58.250 --> 03:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
are aware that if you hopefully it
 
03:51:00.469 --> 03:51:00.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen but when you go into a
 
03:51:03.170 --> 03:51:03.180 align:start position:0%
nursing home at some point and it's in a
 
03:51:05.330 --> 03:51:05.340 align:start position:0%
different town that you do not have to
 
03:51:07.610 --> 03:51:07.620 align:start position:0%
register to vote in that new town that
 
03:51:09.889 --> 03:51:09.899 align:start position:0%
you can keep your old registration and
 
03:51:12.290 --> 03:51:12.300 align:start position:0%
vote in in your in the town that you
 
03:51:14.690 --> 03:51:14.700 align:start position:0%
were previously residing in but a lot of
 
03:51:17.090 --> 03:51:17.100 align:start position:0%
nursing home residents don't know that
 
03:51:18.830 --> 03:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
information and sometimes that
 
03:51:21.110 --> 03:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
information is not provided to them when
 
03:51:22.729 --> 03:51:22.739 align:start position:0%
someone comes and gets them to register
 
03:51:24.650 --> 03:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
to vote in the new location
 
03:51:27.410 --> 03:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
to answer some of Representative
 
03:51:29.889 --> 03:51:29.899 align:start position:0%
Brennan's questions which are very good
 
03:51:32.630 --> 03:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge a lot of times the
 
03:51:34.490 --> 03:51:34.500 align:start position:0%
registration process
 
03:51:36.950 --> 03:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
the application for an absentee ballot
 
03:51:38.929 --> 03:51:38.939 align:start position:0%
process and the voting process is all
 
03:51:41.990 --> 03:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
done at the same time in in the nursing
 
03:51:43.309 --> 03:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
home so there doesn't have to be a lot
 
03:51:45.110 --> 03:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
of back and forth
 
03:51:47.090 --> 03:51:47.100 align:start position:0%
um so so
 
03:51:49.130 --> 03:51:49.140 align:start position:0%
um a town clerk could come in with all
 
03:51:51.469 --> 03:51:51.479 align:start position:0%
of the forms necessary and those would
 
03:51:54.229 --> 03:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
be compiled just as if you were absentee
 
03:51:56.889 --> 03:51:56.899 align:start position:0%
voting from from your home
 
03:52:01.130 --> 03:52:01.140 align:start position:0%
to representative Bay's question about
 
03:52:01.140 --> 03:52:01.849 align:start position:0%
to representative Bay's question about
um

03:52:01.849 --> 03:52:01.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:03.950 --> 03:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
and I believe it was your question about
 
03:52:05.990 --> 03:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
if this would happen
 
03:52:07.250 --> 03:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
um how it would happen if somebody
 
03:52:08.990 --> 03:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
requested an absentee ballot
 
03:52:11.389 --> 03:52:11.399 align:start position:0%
individually this would just apply to
 
03:52:11.399 --> 03:52:12.650 align:start position:0%
individually this would just apply to
multiple

03:52:12.650 --> 03:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
03:52:14.990 --> 03:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
um absentee ballots and not if you were
 
03:52:17.929 --> 03:52:17.939 align:start position:0%
if you chose to request an absent seed
 
03:52:21.229 --> 03:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
ballot not with the group process
 
03:52:21.239 --> 03:52:26.269 align:start position:0%
ballot not with the group process
um

03:52:26.269 --> 03:52:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:28.309 --> 03:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
um I just want to make make a point that
 
03:52:30.290 --> 03:52:30.300 align:start position:0%
this this process the way it's written
 
03:52:31.729 --> 03:52:31.739 align:start position:0%
here would make sure that everything is
 
03:52:34.790 --> 03:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
transparent and would cut down I believe
 
03:52:37.550 --> 03:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
on issues that people have with the the
 
03:52:40.190 --> 03:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
current process and that if there were
 
03:52:42.469 --> 03:52:42.479 align:start position:0%
issues the bill says that they would
 
03:52:44.090 --> 03:52:44.100 align:start position:0%
contact the Secretary of State's office
 
03:52:45.769 --> 03:52:45.779 align:start position:0%
but any
 
03:52:48.590 --> 03:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
um enforcement would also be contacting
 
03:52:51.530 --> 03:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:53.630 --> 03:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions
 
03:52:56.929 --> 03:52:56.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:56.939 --> 03:52:59.210 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:52:59.210 --> 03:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:53:01.729 --> 03:53:01.739 align:start position:0%
oh representing day and
 
03:53:03.590 --> 03:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:53:04.790 --> 03:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
my question
 
03:53:09.110 --> 03:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
would something like this uh be also
 
03:53:11.870 --> 03:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
pertinent to
 
03:53:11.880 --> 03:53:12.650 align:start position:0%
pertinent to
um

03:53:12.650 --> 03:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:16.130 --> 03:53:16.140 align:start position:0%
poems with a mentally disabled adults or
 
03:53:20.630 --> 03:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:28.190 --> 03:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:30.110 --> 03:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
the language just relates to nursing
 
03:53:32.990 --> 03:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
home and Elder Care Facilities
 
03:53:34.370 --> 03:53:34.380 align:start position:0%
so I would have to look up the
 
03:53:38.990 --> 03:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:40.429 --> 03:53:40.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:53:43.370 --> 03:53:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:45.650 --> 03:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
oh representative
 
03:53:47.450 --> 03:53:47.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:53:49.190 --> 03:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
my question
 
03:53:51.769 --> 03:53:51.779 align:start position:0%
um I'm just curious that
 
03:53:53.650 --> 03:53:53.660 align:start position:0%
um see the
 
03:53:57.290 --> 03:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
resident in the nursing home is
 
03:54:00.410 --> 03:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
incapable but yet is in this group
 
03:54:05.090 --> 03:54:05.100 align:start position:0%
setting to vote is unaware of the
 
03:54:08.330 --> 03:54:08.340 align:start position:0%
process or who like do these advisors
 
03:54:10.550 --> 03:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
will will they like recommend for them
 
03:54:14.570 --> 03:54:14.580 align:start position:0%
not to vote do they have that ability
 
03:54:17.150 --> 03:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
um or we just kind of helping them along
 
03:54:19.309 --> 03:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
with something they're not really sure
 
03:54:21.290 --> 03:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
what they're doing
 
03:54:23.210 --> 03:54:23.220 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question I see the
 
03:54:24.889 --> 03:54:24.899 align:start position:0%
way it's written I see it more as an
 
03:54:27.050 --> 03:54:27.060 align:start position:0%
observer like in someone who observes an
 
03:54:29.750 --> 03:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
election and they would not interfere
 
03:54:32.389 --> 03:54:32.399 align:start position:0%
with the voter in their process but
 
03:54:34.610 --> 03:54:34.620 align:start position:0%
would identify
 
03:54:34.620 --> 03:54:35.269 align:start position:0%
would identify
um

03:54:35.269 --> 03:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:37.910 --> 03:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
an issue with then it when it comes up
 
03:54:40.189 --> 03:54:40.199 align:start position:0%
and then would Elevate that issue to our
 
03:54:44.929 --> 03:54:44.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:47.510 --> 03:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
and um my apologies I do want to note
 
03:54:49.250 --> 03:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
that one of the issues that has happened
 
03:54:51.769 --> 03:54:51.779 align:start position:0%
in the past is multiple voting where
 
03:54:54.590 --> 03:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
someone um has requested pre an absentee
 
03:54:56.510 --> 03:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
ballot from where they came from but
 
03:54:58.070 --> 03:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
then somebody came in and registered in
 
03:55:00.530 --> 03:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
the new location and then they
 
03:55:02.210 --> 03:55:02.220 align:start position:0%
didn't remember that they had voted
 
03:55:04.610 --> 03:55:04.620 align:start position:0%
previously and voted again in in that in
 
03:55:07.370 --> 03:55:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:09.590 --> 03:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan thank you and
 
03:55:11.570 --> 03:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
03:55:13.550 --> 03:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
um you talk about this bill being
 
03:55:16.189 --> 03:55:16.199 align:start position:0%
basically a group effort type of thing
 
03:55:16.199 --> 03:55:17.450 align:start position:0%
basically a group effort type of thing
where

03:55:17.450 --> 03:55:17.460 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:55:20.450 --> 03:55:20.460 align:start position:0%
as was discussed the idea of having an
 
03:55:22.849 --> 03:55:22.859 align:start position:0%
event at a nursing home where there are
 
03:55:25.130 --> 03:55:25.140 align:start position:0%
multiple residents
 
03:55:27.229 --> 03:55:27.239 align:start position:0%
um filling out these request forms an
 
03:55:30.410 --> 03:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot forms but
 
03:55:33.290 --> 03:55:33.300 align:start position:0%
if an individual fills out their own
 
03:55:36.050 --> 03:55:36.060 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot request form
 
03:55:36.060 --> 03:55:38.809 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot request form
and

03:55:38.809 --> 03:55:38.819 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:55:41.990 --> 03:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
is it the case now and would it still be
 
03:55:44.389 --> 03:55:44.399 align:start position:0%
the case that a town clerk could would
 
03:55:48.290 --> 03:55:48.300 align:start position:0%
deliver multiple ballots to a resident
 
03:55:48.300 --> 03:55:50.229 align:start position:0%
deliver multiple ballots to a resident
for

03:55:50.229 --> 03:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:55:53.990 --> 03:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
multiple residents
 
03:55:58.370 --> 03:55:58.380 align:start position:0%
does that make sense so is your question
 
03:56:00.469 --> 03:56:00.479 align:start position:0%
um so would it are you asking whether a
 
03:56:02.330 --> 03:56:02.340 align:start position:0%
resident would receive multiple ballots
 
03:56:04.729 --> 03:56:04.739 align:start position:0%
one resident let me rephrase
 
03:56:08.689 --> 03:56:08.699 align:start position:0%
if 10 residents of a nursing home
 
03:56:08.699 --> 03:56:11.269 align:start position:0%
if 10 residents of a nursing home
residence

03:56:11.269 --> 03:56:11.279 align:start position:0%
residence
 
03:56:15.170 --> 03:56:15.180 align:start position:0%
were to individually request absentee
 
03:56:15.180 --> 03:56:17.090 align:start position:0%
were to individually request absentee
ballots

03:56:17.090 --> 03:56:17.100 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
03:56:21.769 --> 03:56:21.779 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the town clerk deliver that
 
03:56:24.769 --> 03:56:24.779 align:start position:0%
package of 10 individual
 
03:56:27.769 --> 03:56:27.779 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots at the same time and
 
03:56:30.170 --> 03:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that constitute delivering
 
03:56:32.929 --> 03:56:32.939 align:start position:0%
multiple absentee ballots to residents
 
03:56:34.910 --> 03:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
of nursing homes
 
03:56:38.330 --> 03:56:38.340 align:start position:0%
and would that then require
 
03:56:42.050 --> 03:56:42.060 align:start position:0%
two absentee ballot Observers
 
03:56:44.750 --> 03:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
so that's a good question so my reading
 
03:56:47.450 --> 03:56:47.460 align:start position:0%
of this is that this would only be
 
03:56:51.650 --> 03:56:51.660 align:start position:0%
triggered when a clerk or assistant or
 
03:56:54.530 --> 03:56:54.540 align:start position:0%
their deputized clerk physically goes to
 
03:56:57.530 --> 03:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
the residence and not does a mailing so
 
03:57:00.050 --> 03:57:00.060 align:start position:0%
if if you were a resident and you mailed
 
03:57:03.410 --> 03:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
in a request that request gets sent to
 
03:57:05.809 --> 03:57:05.819 align:start position:0%
you and then your neighbor requests
 
03:57:07.670 --> 03:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
another day that request would get sent
 
03:57:12.530 --> 03:57:12.540 align:start position:0%
to you so this would just occur when
 
03:57:14.990 --> 03:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
when the group process happens when they
 
03:57:18.830 --> 03:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
go with multiple applications and
 
03:57:18.840 --> 03:57:19.910 align:start position:0%
go with multiple applications and
um

03:57:19.910 --> 03:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:23.450 --> 03:57:23.460 align:start position:0%
and ballots to be filled out at one at
 
03:57:27.290 --> 03:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:30.889 --> 03:57:30.899 align:start position:0%
Paula please is it not the law now that
 
03:57:34.729 --> 03:57:34.739 align:start position:0%
a town clerk is able a town clerk or a
 
03:57:37.070 --> 03:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
deputized representative of the town
 
03:57:41.990 --> 03:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
clerk to deliver an absentee ballot
 
03:57:44.929 --> 03:57:44.939 align:start position:0%
to a nursing home facility and and if
 
03:57:46.429 --> 03:57:46.439 align:start position:0%
that is currently
 
03:57:49.729 --> 03:57:49.739 align:start position:0%
the law as I think it is
 
03:57:52.490 --> 03:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't that town clerk potentially
 
03:57:55.189 --> 03:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
be delivering multiple ballots on any
 
03:57:58.189 --> 03:57:58.199 align:start position:0%
given day if we're talking about a
 
03:58:00.950 --> 03:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
nursing home facility with you know 150
 
03:58:02.510 --> 03:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
residents and there have been 10
 
03:58:05.150 --> 03:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
individual requests in the span of two
 
03:58:07.250 --> 03:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
days then a town clerk could potentially
 
03:58:10.070 --> 03:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
be delivering multiple ballots
 
03:58:13.610 --> 03:58:13.620 align:start position:0%
at the same time and would that trigger
 
03:58:15.830 --> 03:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
so are you talking about mail delivery
 
03:58:19.189 --> 03:58:19.199 align:start position:0%
or hand delivery hand delivery so I've
 
03:58:21.650 --> 03:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
not heard and it doesn't mean that it
 
03:58:24.769 --> 03:58:24.779 align:start position:0%
happens that a clerk would choose to
 
03:58:26.950 --> 03:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
hand deliver the ballots rather than
 
03:58:31.849 --> 03:58:31.859 align:start position:0%
process them and mail them I think it's
 
03:58:33.290 --> 03:58:33.300 align:start position:0%
I think we would have to hear from a
 
03:58:35.689 --> 03:58:35.699 align:start position:0%
town clerk if if there was 100 or
 
03:58:37.550 --> 03:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
something it would be easier perhaps
 
03:58:39.469 --> 03:58:39.479 align:start position:0%
time wise and money-wise but otherwise I
 
03:58:42.170 --> 03:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
don't know that a town clerk would
 
03:58:44.210 --> 03:58:44.220 align:start position:0%
choose to hand deliver over mail
 
03:58:44.220 --> 03:58:46.010 align:start position:0%
choose to hand deliver over mail
processing

03:58:46.010 --> 03:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
processing
 
03:58:48.110 --> 03:58:48.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:58:50.389 --> 03:58:50.399 align:start position:0%
perhaps we do need to clarify this is
 
03:58:54.530 --> 03:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:56.929 --> 03:58:56.939 align:start position:0%
good thank you thank you that's any
 
03:58:56.939 --> 03:58:58.189 align:start position:0%
good thank you thank you that's any
question

03:58:58.189 --> 03:58:58.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:58:58.199 --> 03:58:58.969 align:start position:0%
question
um

03:58:58.969 --> 03:58:58.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:13.269 --> 03:59:13.279 align:start position:0%

and I do have
 
04:00:56.389 --> 04:00:56.399 align:start position:0%
um some information that we had gotten
 
04:00:58.450 --> 04:00:58.460 align:start position:0%
from Bill Gardner
 
04:01:03.650 --> 04:01:03.660 align:start position:0%

after discovering this the head nurse of
 
04:01:27.110 --> 04:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
unit 4C which was our mom's unit she
 
04:01:29.030 --> 04:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
expressed her extreme discomfort with
 
04:01:31.610 --> 04:01:31.620 align:start position:0%

the activities director of Hillsborough
 
04:01:38.689 --> 04:01:38.699 align:start position:0%
County Nursing Home explained that staff
 
04:01:43.070 --> 04:01:43.080 align:start position:0%
members distributed the absentee ballots
 
04:01:47.809 --> 04:01:47.819 align:start position:0%
on the 27th of January in 2017 we spoke
 
04:01:50.689 --> 04:01:50.699 align:start position:0%
with the Goffstown Town Clerk she told
 
04:01:53.330 --> 04:01:53.340 align:start position:0%
us that absentee ballots are distributed
 
04:01:55.370 --> 04:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
at the Hillsborough County Nursing Home
 
04:01:59.450 --> 04:01:59.460 align:start position:0%
by staff members and that she appoints
 
04:02:02.269 --> 04:02:02.279 align:start position:0%
as official polling assistants
 
04:02:04.910 --> 04:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
she explained that the town's Clerk
 
04:02:07.550 --> 04:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
Office does this to make it easier for
 
04:02:12.050 --> 04:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
for nursing home residents to vote
 
04:02:15.110 --> 04:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
mom did not request an absentee ballot
 
04:02:18.349 --> 04:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
in addition she did not have any form of
 
04:02:20.389 --> 04:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
identification that would have made it
 
04:02:23.030 --> 04:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
possible for her to even obtain an
 
04:02:25.790 --> 04:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot
 
04:02:28.550 --> 04:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
as her durable power of attorney for
 
04:02:30.950 --> 04:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
medical as well as finance my husband
 
04:02:33.110 --> 04:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
was the only one who could have made
 
04:02:34.790 --> 04:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
that request
 
04:02:38.150 --> 04:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
mom didn't know she had voted nor that
 
04:02:42.530 --> 04:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:44.630 --> 04:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
nor would she even have been able to
 
04:02:48.290 --> 04:02:48.300 align:start position:0%
fill out any of that information
 
04:02:52.189 --> 04:02:52.199 align:start position:0%
in November of 2016 she didn't have that
 
04:02:52.199 --> 04:02:53.689 align:start position:0%
in November of 2016 she didn't have that
ability

04:02:53.689 --> 04:02:53.699 align:start position:0%
ability
 
04:02:55.849 --> 04:02:55.859 align:start position:0%
a huge question for us that has never
 
04:02:58.130 --> 04:02:58.140 align:start position:0%
been answered is who helped her fill out
 
04:03:01.490 --> 04:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
the ballot and was he or she authorized
 
04:03:03.769 --> 04:03:03.779 align:start position:0%
or trained to do so
 
04:03:06.950 --> 04:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
and we spent countless of hours phoning
 
04:03:09.050 --> 04:03:09.060 align:start position:0%
people writing letters to discover who
 
04:03:11.150 --> 04:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
and why and how this was allowed to
 
04:03:13.729 --> 04:03:13.739 align:start position:0%
occur we were never able to get answers
 
04:03:16.610 --> 04:03:16.620 align:start position:0%
we spoke with Goffstown state
 
04:03:18.710 --> 04:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
representative Barbara Griffin we spoke
 
04:03:21.429 --> 04:03:21.439 align:start position:0%
with Bill Gardner we spoke with Al
 
04:03:24.530 --> 04:03:24.540 align:start position:0%
baldosaro we spoke with Kathy ball we
 
04:03:26.929 --> 04:03:26.939 align:start position:0%
spoke with secretary Bill Gardner
 
04:03:29.450 --> 04:03:29.460 align:start position:0%
and it it really and truly is so
 
04:03:32.510 --> 04:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that this happened to her
 
04:03:35.570 --> 04:03:35.580 align:start position:0%
and it just wasn't fair yeah if you went
 
04:03:37.670 --> 04:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
into her room and you said Gee Claire do
 
04:03:39.290 --> 04:03:39.300 align:start position:0%
you want to vote in the presidential
 
04:03:41.570 --> 04:03:41.580 align:start position:0%
election well of course she would say
 
04:03:43.550 --> 04:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
yes if you asked her if she wanted to
 
04:03:45.349 --> 04:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
make a spaghetti supper for the Knights
 
04:03:48.290 --> 04:03:48.300 align:start position:0%
of Columbus this week of course I will
 
04:03:52.490 --> 04:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
so yes while she could say yes she
 
04:03:54.830 --> 04:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
didn't have the mental capacity to do
 
04:03:58.309 --> 04:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
any of that and they never had the right
 
04:04:01.610 --> 04:04:01.620 align:start position:0%
to go into her room period she had no
 
04:04:03.650 --> 04:04:03.660 align:start position:0%
identification on the outside of her
 
04:04:06.530 --> 04:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
room except for her name and there were
 
04:04:09.650 --> 04:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
times when she would come into her room
 
04:04:11.689 --> 04:04:11.699 align:start position:0%
there would be somebody else sitting in
 
04:04:15.170 --> 04:04:15.180 align:start position:0%
her chair or laying in her bed oh how
 
04:04:17.510 --> 04:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
did how does a representative from the
 
04:04:19.610 --> 04:04:19.620 align:start position:0%
nursing home or anybody else how could
 
04:04:22.309 --> 04:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
they identify who this person is there's
 
04:04:25.309 --> 04:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
no identification we go to vote we have
 
04:04:28.070 --> 04:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
to take out our you know all our license
 
04:04:30.590 --> 04:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
some identification which is the way it
 
04:04:33.950 --> 04:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
should be it this this just really is so
 
04:04:33.960 --> 04:04:34.729 align:start position:0%
should be it this this just really is so
wrong

04:04:34.729 --> 04:04:34.739 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
04:04:37.370 --> 04:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
and we pray that it doesn't happen to
 
04:04:39.889 --> 04:04:39.899 align:start position:0%
other people's other family members you
 
04:04:39.899 --> 04:04:45.590 align:start position:0%
other people's other family members you
know

04:04:45.590 --> 04:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:46.849 --> 04:04:46.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:04:49.910 --> 04:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
um just for everybody knows uh the
 
04:04:51.590 --> 04:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County Nursing hospital is
 
04:04:53.750 --> 04:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
in Goffstown just wanted to clear that
 
04:04:56.030 --> 04:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
yes yes I know I mean and so the whole
 
04:04:58.610 --> 04:04:58.620 align:start position:0%
nursing home got these ballots
 
04:05:01.790 --> 04:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
regardless of who they were
 
04:05:04.189 --> 04:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
so someone mentioned how many people got
 
04:05:06.710 --> 04:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
them the town clerk said they delivered
 
04:05:06.720 --> 04:05:08.929 align:start position:0%
them the town clerk said they delivered
them

04:05:08.929 --> 04:05:08.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:10.429 --> 04:05:10.439 align:start position:0%
and I'm on the Hillsborough County
 
04:05:12.469 --> 04:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
executive committee and I think that's a
 
04:05:14.689 --> 04:05:14.699 align:start position:0%
question I'm going to ask next time so
 
04:05:18.170 --> 04:05:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:25.130 --> 04:05:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:46.990 --> 04:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:54.530 --> 04:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:56.269 --> 04:05:56.279 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman and members of
 
04:05:57.769 --> 04:05:57.779 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you for allowing me
 
04:06:00.590 --> 04:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
to testify today my name is Susan Buxton
 
04:06:02.830 --> 04:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
I'm the state long-term care ombudsman
 
04:06:06.769 --> 04:06:06.779 align:start position:0%
the long-term care Ombudsman is a
 
04:06:09.349 --> 04:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
required program of states that receive
 
04:06:12.110 --> 04:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
any older Americans act funds which
 
04:06:15.170 --> 04:06:15.180 align:start position:0%
obviously New Hampshire does our office
 
04:06:17.630 --> 04:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
Works to resolve problems related to
 
04:06:19.729 --> 04:06:19.739 align:start position:0%
health safety welfare and rights of
 
04:06:22.130 --> 04:06:22.140 align:start position:0%
individuals who live in nursing homes
 
04:06:24.530 --> 04:06:24.540 align:start position:0%
assisted livings and other Residential
 
04:06:26.570 --> 04:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
Care Facilities
 
04:06:28.189 --> 04:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
we do this through education
 
04:06:33.229 --> 04:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
investigation mediation and advocacy
 
04:06:35.750 --> 04:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
the Ombudsman programs promote policies
 
04:06:37.849 --> 04:06:37.859 align:start position:0%
and consumer protections that support
 
04:06:40.010 --> 04:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
well-being of individuals that live in
 
04:06:41.450 --> 04:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
long-term care
 
04:06:44.809 --> 04:06:44.819 align:start position:0%
so I came today with my position being
 
04:06:47.269 --> 04:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
neutral because I I really had some
 
04:06:49.429 --> 04:06:49.439 align:start position:0%
questions after reviewing the bill about
 
04:06:52.910 --> 04:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
what the purpose and of the bill was and
 
04:06:55.550 --> 04:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
what it was seeking to address I do feel
 
04:06:56.630 --> 04:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
like I have a little better
 
04:06:59.090 --> 04:06:59.100 align:start position:0%
understanding after listening to the
 
04:07:02.389 --> 04:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
testimony before me but some of the
 
04:07:04.010 --> 04:07:04.020 align:start position:0%
points that I make in my written
 
04:07:06.309 --> 04:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'd like to share today
 
04:07:08.990 --> 04:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
remain and that is
 
04:07:12.170 --> 04:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
if the goal is to increase access to
 
04:07:14.389 --> 04:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
absentee voting for people living in
 
04:07:16.189 --> 04:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
long-term care I think that is a good
 
04:07:19.309 --> 04:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
thing it is challenging for people that
 
04:07:22.070 --> 04:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
are living in long-term care to vote and
 
04:07:24.050 --> 04:07:24.060 align:start position:0%
there are there are you know many
 
04:07:26.689 --> 04:07:26.699 align:start position:0%
reasons that that people want to vote by
 
04:07:29.870 --> 04:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
absentee but the main reasons being
 
04:07:31.969 --> 04:07:31.979 align:start position:0%
they're receiving short-term
 
04:07:34.309 --> 04:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation care and they're unable
 
04:07:38.030 --> 04:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
to to go to their polling place
 
04:07:40.670 --> 04:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
um they lack Transportation or because
 
04:07:43.729 --> 04:07:43.739 align:start position:0%
ambulatory ambulation or care needs make
 
04:07:45.889 --> 04:07:45.899 align:start position:0%
it difficult for them to go to a polling
 
04:07:45.899 --> 04:07:47.450 align:start position:0%
it difficult for them to go to a polling
place

04:07:47.450 --> 04:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
place
 
04:07:49.849 --> 04:07:49.859 align:start position:0%
but if this bill is written to make this
 
04:07:52.969 --> 04:07:52.979 align:start position:0%
a required process for all individuals
 
04:07:55.969 --> 04:07:55.979 align:start position:0%
who live in a nursing home or Assisted
 
04:07:55.979 --> 04:07:56.990 align:start position:0%
who live in a nursing home or Assisted
Living

04:07:56.990 --> 04:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
Living
 
04:08:00.830 --> 04:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
seeking to execute their right to vote I
 
04:08:03.229 --> 04:08:03.239 align:start position:0%
think that it's creating an unnecessary
 
04:08:06.729 --> 04:08:06.739 align:start position:0%
and unfair burden and I would oppose it
 
04:08:10.309 --> 04:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
anyone in this room can can request a
 
04:08:12.469 --> 04:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
ballot and fill it out in the privacy of
 
04:08:14.510 --> 04:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
their home and mail it in and
 
04:08:16.910 --> 04:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
individuals that are living in in
 
04:08:18.710 --> 04:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
long-term care settings that's their
 
04:08:18.720 --> 04:08:20.330 align:start position:0%
long-term care settings that's their
home

04:08:20.330 --> 04:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
home
 
04:08:20.340 --> 04:08:21.110 align:start position:0%
home
um

04:08:21.110 --> 04:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:24.110 --> 04:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
they should be able to to follow the
 
04:08:26.990 --> 04:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
same procedures that anyone any other
 
04:08:29.090 --> 04:08:29.100 align:start position:0%
citizen of the state is allowed to
 
04:08:29.100 --> 04:08:31.309 align:start position:0%
citizen of the state is allowed to
follow

04:08:31.309 --> 04:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
follow
 
04:08:33.889 --> 04:08:33.899 align:start position:0%
so I would support the bill if it's
 
04:08:36.349 --> 04:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
clearly stating that it's expanding the
 
04:08:39.050 --> 04:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
options for exercising the right to vote
 
04:08:41.809 --> 04:08:41.819 align:start position:0%
that are that are residing in long-term
 
04:08:43.969 --> 04:08:43.979 align:start position:0%
care but as I said I would I would
 
04:08:46.490 --> 04:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
oppose it if it's if it's further
 
04:08:49.429 --> 04:08:49.439 align:start position:0%
restricting their abilities
 
04:08:51.170 --> 04:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
um I'll talk a little bit about my
 
04:08:53.030 --> 04:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
experience I've worked in long-term care
 
04:08:56.809 --> 04:08:56.819 align:start position:0%
for my whole career so I'll say it's
 
04:08:59.870 --> 04:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
it's over 25 years without giving up my
 
04:09:03.410 --> 04:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
age and I have been involved with
 
04:09:05.870 --> 04:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
assisting residents that want to vote
 
04:09:08.750 --> 04:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
and you heard before me people talk
 
04:09:10.849 --> 04:09:10.859 align:start position:0%
about there are a number of individuals
 
04:09:13.309 --> 04:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
who have dementia that live in our
 
04:09:15.950 --> 04:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities
 
04:09:17.510 --> 04:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
and while
 
04:09:22.010 --> 04:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
the entire process may seem overwhelming
 
04:09:24.769 --> 04:09:24.779 align:start position:0%
it's it's very often that they have a
 
04:09:27.229 --> 04:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
very clear belief that they want to vote
 
04:09:29.570 --> 04:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
and they understand it
 
04:09:32.929 --> 04:09:32.939 align:start position:0%
and you know I think we need to be very
 
04:09:35.809 --> 04:09:35.819 align:start position:0%
thoughtful and careful
 
04:09:39.349 --> 04:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
about determining whether somebody has
 
04:09:42.790 --> 04:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
capacity or not to vote because that's
 
04:09:47.510 --> 04:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge not a requirement
 
04:09:47.520 --> 04:09:49.130 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge not a requirement
so

04:09:49.130 --> 04:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:09:49.140 --> 04:09:51.170 align:start position:0%
so
you

04:09:51.170 --> 04:09:51.180 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:09:54.590 --> 04:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
you may have to assist somebody who has
 
04:09:57.650 --> 04:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
dementia by reading the ballot to them
 
04:10:00.290 --> 04:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
because they may not be able to look at
 
04:10:04.269 --> 04:10:04.279 align:start position:0%
it and read it and understand it
 
04:10:07.010 --> 04:10:07.020 align:start position:0%
but they may still have a very clear
 
04:10:07.020 --> 04:10:09.050 align:start position:0%
but they may still have a very clear
opinion

04:10:09.050 --> 04:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
04:10:15.170 --> 04:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
and I I I recognize the challenges of
 
04:10:18.250 --> 04:10:18.260 align:start position:0%
somebody having the skills and abilities
 
04:10:24.889 --> 04:10:24.899 align:start position:0%
to assist somebody with dementia and not
 
04:10:28.250 --> 04:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
impart their opinion and so I would I
 
04:10:31.429 --> 04:10:31.439 align:start position:0%
would applaud the efforts to to make
 
04:10:34.189 --> 04:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
sure that the rights of the individuals
 
04:10:38.510 --> 04:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:38.520 --> 04:10:41.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:10:41.229 --> 04:10:41.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:44.150 --> 04:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
for instance I have known individuals
 
04:10:47.030 --> 04:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
who felt very very strongly about their
 
04:10:49.490 --> 04:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
political party and so they might not
 
04:10:52.910 --> 04:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
have any idea who the candidates are
 
04:10:55.189 --> 04:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
but they know that they want to vote for
 
04:10:57.650 --> 04:10:57.660 align:start position:0%
whoever is that member of that party
 
04:10:59.870 --> 04:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
that they have always supported have
 
04:11:03.590 --> 04:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
supported and so they may say that I I I
 
04:11:05.750 --> 04:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
don't know who any of them are but make
 
04:11:08.150 --> 04:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
sure I want to make sure that I vote
 
04:11:12.229 --> 04:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
Republican or I vote Democrat so
 
04:11:14.210 --> 04:11:14.220 align:start position:0%
you know I think we need to be really
 
04:11:16.849 --> 04:11:16.859 align:start position:0%
thoughtful when we when we design this
 
04:11:16.859 --> 04:11:18.349 align:start position:0%
thoughtful when we when we design this
because

04:11:18.349 --> 04:11:18.359 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:11:21.410 --> 04:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure the way that it's written I
 
04:11:24.410 --> 04:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
don't think that you would be putting
 
04:11:28.189 --> 04:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
that person that's an observer is not
 
04:11:30.530 --> 04:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
qualified to determine whether somebody
 
04:11:33.469 --> 04:11:33.479 align:start position:0%
knows what they're doing or not
 
04:11:33.479 --> 04:11:34.849 align:start position:0%
knows what they're doing or not
so

04:11:34.849 --> 04:11:34.859 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:11:34.859 --> 04:11:35.809 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:11:35.809 --> 04:11:35.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:37.910 --> 04:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
the the only other thing that I really
 
04:11:39.950 --> 04:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
want to point out to you and I think it
 
04:11:42.469 --> 04:11:42.479 align:start position:0%
probably speaks to the fact that the
 
04:11:45.710 --> 04:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
town clerks may be opposing that is
 
04:11:49.729 --> 04:11:49.739 align:start position:0%
there are 78 nursing homes and 139
 
04:11:52.189 --> 04:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
assisted living facilities in New
 
04:11:55.550 --> 04:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and there are 14 000 residents
 
04:11:58.370 --> 04:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
and those are not spaced evenly across
 
04:12:01.969 --> 04:12:01.979 align:start position:0%
the state so you know I selected one
 
04:12:04.729 --> 04:12:04.739 align:start position:0%
Community which is Bedford which has
 
04:12:06.830 --> 04:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
five assisted living homes and three
 
04:12:10.010 --> 04:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and 900 residents
 
04:12:13.370 --> 04:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
so you know we need to think about what
 
04:12:16.490 --> 04:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
that means for for each individual town
 
04:12:18.889 --> 04:12:18.899 align:start position:0%
and I I would be thrilled if every
 
04:12:21.769 --> 04:12:21.779 align:start position:0%
facility created a polling place so that
 
04:12:24.290 --> 04:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
individuals could vote but I think we
 
04:12:25.550 --> 04:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
04:12:27.469 --> 04:12:27.479 align:start position:0%
careful about that I'm happy to answer
 
04:12:29.030 --> 04:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:12:32.950 --> 04:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:35.210 --> 04:12:35.220 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:12:38.630 --> 04:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:40.790 --> 04:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
now everybody looked that one I
 
04:12:42.170 --> 04:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
appreciate it's okay I appreciate that
 
04:12:44.450 --> 04:12:44.460 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate the information
 
04:12:46.969 --> 04:12:46.979 align:start position:0%
about how many facilities there are and
 
04:12:49.210 --> 04:12:49.220 align:start position:0%
it raises the question I guess whether
 
04:12:52.370 --> 04:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
if if this bill written by the Secretary
 
04:12:53.929 --> 04:12:53.939 align:start position:0%
of State I guess
 
04:12:53.939 --> 04:12:54.889 align:start position:0%
of State I guess
um

04:12:54.889 --> 04:12:54.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:56.510 --> 04:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
were to pass
 
04:12:58.250 --> 04:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
you know it raises the question about
 
04:12:59.750 --> 04:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
whether Town clerks would be able to
 
04:13:02.510 --> 04:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
find a sufficient number of observers to
 
04:13:04.389 --> 04:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
accompany them
 
04:13:06.769 --> 04:13:06.779 align:start position:0%
and when they deliver the ballots and
 
04:13:08.030 --> 04:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
also when the ballots are being
 
04:13:11.269 --> 04:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
distributed marked and collected and and
 
04:13:12.830 --> 04:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
I presume that if you couldn't find The
 
04:13:15.290 --> 04:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
Observers then then you couldn't do the
 
04:13:16.610 --> 04:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
delivery and you couldn't distribute the
 
04:13:19.010 --> 04:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
ballots and that could disenfranchise a
 
04:13:20.630 --> 04:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
relatively large number of the Fourteen
 
04:13:22.130 --> 04:13:22.140 align:start position:0%
thousand people in these homes is that
 
04:13:24.469 --> 04:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
is that one of your that's my point yep
 
04:13:26.750 --> 04:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
is that it's going to be an undue burden
 
04:13:28.910 --> 04:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
for some towns that have a high
 
04:13:28.920 --> 04:13:33.830 align:start position:0%
for some towns that have a high
concentration

04:13:33.830 --> 04:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:36.290 --> 04:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan
 
04:13:38.570 --> 04:13:38.580 align:start position:0%
I'll make it quick thank you
 
04:13:40.729 --> 04:13:40.739 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question is
 
04:13:43.370 --> 04:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
there ever a scenario where and this is
 
04:13:44.809 --> 04:13:44.819 align:start position:0%
similar to the question I asked earlier
 
04:13:46.370 --> 04:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
is there ever a scenario where the
 
04:13:50.570 --> 04:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
family of a person in a nursing home has
 
04:13:53.150 --> 04:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
the ability to
 
04:13:57.290 --> 04:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
remove that person's right to vote or
 
04:14:00.410 --> 04:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
no nobody has the authority to determine
 
04:14:02.689 --> 04:14:02.699 align:start position:0%
whether somebody can vote even in a
 
04:14:05.090 --> 04:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
guardianship which is the most
 
04:14:05.100 --> 04:14:06.670 align:start position:0%
guardianship which is the most
restrictive

04:14:06.670 --> 04:14:06.680 align:start position:0%
restrictive
 
04:14:06.680 --> 04:14:08.349 align:start position:0%
restrictive
appointment

04:14:08.349 --> 04:14:08.359 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
04:14:13.490 --> 04:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
most most Wards those individuals that
 
04:14:15.830 --> 04:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
have been appointed a guardian retain
 
04:14:18.050 --> 04:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
the right to vote so a power of attorney
 
04:14:20.389 --> 04:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
absolutely does not have the authority
 
04:14:22.070 --> 04:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
to determine whether or not somebody
 
04:14:26.030 --> 04:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
should be allowed to vote thank you
 
04:14:30.110 --> 04:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
okay anymore okay good thank you
 
04:14:33.349 --> 04:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
now with that I remember what can you
 
04:14:35.630 --> 04:14:35.640 align:start position:0%
give me the blue sheet and I believe
 
04:14:39.530 --> 04:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:42.110 --> 04:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
so in a minute we'll move on to our next
 
04:14:42.120 --> 04:14:43.309 align:start position:0%
so in a minute we'll move on to our next
bill

04:14:43.309 --> 04:14:43.319 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:14:56.809 --> 04:14:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:58.790 --> 04:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
196 yeah
 
04:15:00.590 --> 04:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
so we have
 
04:15:03.530 --> 04:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
one person four and
 
04:15:06.530 --> 04:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
five people against
 
04:15:10.210 --> 04:15:10.220 align:start position:0%
okay now a next bill
 
04:15:10.220 --> 04:15:11.990 align:start position:0%
okay now a next bill
586

04:15:11.990 --> 04:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
586
 
04:15:16.070 --> 04:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
is representative Faulkner here
 
04:15:17.870 --> 04:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
I got my pink card I throw those out
 
04:15:33.410 --> 04:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:39.969 --> 04:15:39.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:39.979 --> 04:15:42.910 align:start position:0%
 
right

04:15:42.910 --> 04:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:15:46.250 --> 04:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
I made a serious mistake I emailed
 
04:15:49.130 --> 04:15:49.140 align:start position:0%
everyone an amendment and I didn't I
 
04:15:51.590 --> 04:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
failed to match it so Joel should have
 
04:15:53.929 --> 04:15:53.939 align:start position:0%
an amendment that could go with okay
 
04:15:57.650 --> 04:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
with this with 586
 
04:16:00.769 --> 04:16:00.779 align:start position:0%
you the previous Bill okay okay thank
 
04:16:00.779 --> 04:16:07.010 align:start position:0%
you the previous Bill okay okay thank
you

04:16:07.010 --> 04:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:07.020 --> 04:16:08.570 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:16:08.570 --> 04:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:16:12.170 --> 04:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
now on to 586.
 
04:16:14.269 --> 04:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
sure thank you I'm Barry Faulkner I
 
04:16:16.250 --> 04:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
represent the Swansea in Richmond
 
04:16:19.189 --> 04:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
Chester 10 and I'm the prime sponsor of
 
04:16:21.889 --> 04:16:21.899 align:start position:0%
this bill it's relatively simple Bill
 
04:16:24.050 --> 04:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
compared to the last one anyway I I hope
 
04:16:25.670 --> 04:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
that you might agree
 
04:16:28.189 --> 04:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
uh the inspiration for this bill came
 
04:16:31.429 --> 04:16:31.439 align:start position:0%
around election time when somebody
 
04:16:33.830 --> 04:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
published a poll or opinion statement
 
04:16:33.840 --> 04:16:35.330 align:start position:0%
published a poll or opinion statement
that

04:16:35.330 --> 04:16:35.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:16:36.950 --> 04:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
placed New Hampshire at the bottom of
 
04:16:39.410 --> 04:16:39.420 align:start position:0%
the list of 50 states in terms of the
 
04:16:41.150 --> 04:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
most difficult state to vote in I said
 
04:16:41.160 --> 04:16:42.410 align:start position:0%
most difficult state to vote in I said
geez

04:16:42.410 --> 04:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
geez
 
04:16:45.469 --> 04:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
proud New Hampshire native I resent that
 
04:16:47.750 --> 04:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
remark and you know I know for a fact
 
04:16:49.670 --> 04:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
it's not true
 
04:16:51.290 --> 04:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
you know well you have a lot of things
 
04:16:52.849 --> 04:16:52.859 align:start position:0%
going for us I think we have one of the
 
04:16:54.530 --> 04:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
better voting systems in the country
 
04:16:58.010 --> 04:16:58.020 align:start position:0%
I've observed elections all over the
 
04:16:59.630 --> 04:16:59.640 align:start position:0%
country four different states I've run
 
04:17:02.450 --> 04:17:02.460 align:start position:0%
elections I've participated as a party
 
04:17:05.870 --> 04:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:08.990 --> 04:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
account all our ballots on Election Day
 
04:17:10.910 --> 04:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
we have an easy
 
04:17:13.010 --> 04:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
straightforward registration process you
 
04:17:15.530 --> 04:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
can register on the day of election
 
04:17:19.309 --> 04:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
uh we don't have lines
 
04:17:21.530 --> 04:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
by enlarging at least not the way other
 
04:17:24.590 --> 04:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
states do things work pretty well here
 
04:17:27.110 --> 04:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
but I did look kind of over things to
 
04:17:28.670 --> 04:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
see what you know
 
04:17:30.469 --> 04:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
what can be done to make things a little
 
04:17:32.150 --> 04:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
bit easier for people to vote in the
 
04:17:33.290 --> 04:17:33.300 align:start position:0%
state so
 
04:17:36.229 --> 04:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
looking at the absentee ballot
 
04:17:38.870 --> 04:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
statute which in fact provides an outlet
 
04:17:41.330 --> 04:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
for people who can't be there
 
04:17:43.130 --> 04:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
on Election Day
 
04:17:45.530 --> 04:17:45.540 align:start position:0%
for a variety of reasons
 
04:17:46.969 --> 04:17:46.979 align:start position:0%
and realize there are a couple of
 
04:17:48.830 --> 04:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
reasons that people have expressed to me
 
04:17:51.170 --> 04:17:51.180 align:start position:0%
for why they didn't show up the boat or
 
04:17:52.550 --> 04:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
why they
 
04:17:55.729 --> 04:17:55.739 align:start position:0%
were considering not voting so I'm
 
04:17:58.370 --> 04:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
posing two additional reasons that would
 
04:18:00.769 --> 04:18:00.779 align:start position:0%
be placed on the absentee ballot
 
04:18:00.779 --> 04:18:02.750 align:start position:0%
be placed on the absentee ballot
application

04:18:02.750 --> 04:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
application
 
04:18:05.269 --> 04:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
one reason is I can't get a ride I don't
 
04:18:06.530 --> 04:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
have a car
 
04:18:09.590 --> 04:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
transportation is a problem
 
04:18:13.969 --> 04:18:13.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:16.130 --> 04:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
have concerns about going out in public
 
04:18:18.170 --> 04:18:18.180 align:start position:0%
either for my own safety or my own
 
04:18:21.170 --> 04:18:21.180 align:start position:0%
health or for the health of others
 
04:18:23.330 --> 04:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
don't have a disability but I have a
 
04:18:25.990 --> 04:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
deep concern about
 
04:18:29.030 --> 04:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
about my health if I go out into a crowd
 
04:18:29.040 --> 04:18:30.769 align:start position:0%
about my health if I go out into a crowd
so

04:18:30.769 --> 04:18:30.779 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:18:32.809 --> 04:18:32.819 align:start position:0%
two simple reasons that would be placed
 
04:18:34.910 --> 04:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
on the on the uh on the application that
 
04:18:37.070 --> 04:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
would allow people to uh
 
04:18:39.650 --> 04:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
participate by absentee ballot when they
 
04:18:42.050 --> 04:18:42.060 align:start position:0%
can't or have serious reservations about
 
04:18:44.229 --> 04:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
showing up an election day
 
04:18:46.670 --> 04:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
the only other change that's made is
 
04:18:48.349 --> 04:18:48.359 align:start position:0%
that the
 
04:18:51.290 --> 04:18:51.300 align:start position:0%
violations of the absentee ballot
 
04:18:51.300 --> 04:18:52.969 align:start position:0%
violations of the absentee ballot
statute

04:18:52.969 --> 04:18:52.979 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:18:55.309 --> 04:18:55.319 align:start position:0%
are treated the same as other violations
 
04:18:57.429 --> 04:18:57.439 align:start position:0%
of of
 
04:19:00.670 --> 04:19:00.680 align:start position:0%
voting statutes in terms of um
 
04:19:04.370 --> 04:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
of the required level of men's Raya to
 
04:19:06.710 --> 04:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh to prosecute
 
04:19:09.170 --> 04:19:09.180 align:start position:0%
so it's it's pretty simple the bill is
 
04:19:11.870 --> 04:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
long just because the statute reproduces
 
04:19:11.880 --> 04:19:12.950 align:start position:0%
long just because the statute reproduces
the

04:19:12.950 --> 04:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:19:15.830 --> 04:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
the application in full and so
 
04:19:17.809 --> 04:19:17.819 align:start position:0%
we've reprinted the entire application
 
04:19:19.990 --> 04:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
with those two additional
 
04:19:23.929 --> 04:19:23.939 align:start position:0%
additional reasons on there and um
 
04:19:26.389 --> 04:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
hope that that might be a simple
 
04:19:29.389 --> 04:19:29.399 align:start position:0%
perhaps not earth-shaking addition to
 
04:19:29.399 --> 04:19:30.610 align:start position:0%
perhaps not earth-shaking addition to
our

04:19:30.610 --> 04:19:30.620 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:19:33.349 --> 04:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
our system and we're following the
 
04:19:35.929 --> 04:19:35.939 align:start position:0%
existing absentee ballot system there's
 
04:19:37.490 --> 04:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
no additional work
 
04:19:38.929 --> 04:19:38.939 align:start position:0%
let's get counted along with other
 
04:19:41.150 --> 04:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots
 
04:19:41.160 --> 04:19:43.790 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots
it's

04:19:43.790 --> 04:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:19:45.969 --> 04:19:45.979 align:start position:0%
you know still observing that the the
 
04:19:49.010 --> 04:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
principle that people
 
04:19:51.050 --> 04:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
cast absentee ballots because they can't
 
04:19:53.150 --> 04:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
or have difficulty being at the election
 
04:19:56.750 --> 04:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
place on Election Day it's not a radical
 
04:19:58.250 --> 04:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
change from any of that so I hope that
 
04:19:59.870 --> 04:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
this might be seen as being one small
 
04:20:01.610 --> 04:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
step we can make to make things easier
 
04:20:03.290 --> 04:20:03.300 align:start position:0%
to vote in this state
 
04:20:05.090 --> 04:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:20:10.070 --> 04:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:12.290 --> 04:20:12.300 align:start position:0%
okay with that thank you all right thank
 
04:20:15.050 --> 04:20:15.060 align:start position:0%
you and then I'll call
 
04:20:17.809 --> 04:20:17.819 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary of state and here in
 
04:20:17.819 --> 04:20:26.750 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary of state and here in
Tennessee

04:20:26.750 --> 04:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:29.030 --> 04:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone Aaron Hennessey
 
04:20:31.189 --> 04:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary of state
 
04:20:33.710 --> 04:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
um good to see you again
 
04:20:36.769 --> 04:20:36.779 align:start position:0%
um our office is opposed to this bill
 
04:20:38.689 --> 04:20:38.699 align:start position:0%
we see this as a bill that's trying to
 
04:20:41.210 --> 04:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
micromanage micromanage the number of
 
04:20:41.220 --> 04:20:42.650 align:start position:0%
micromanage micromanage the number of
instances

04:20:42.650 --> 04:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
instances
 
04:20:44.870 --> 04:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
um for requesting an absentee ballot
 
04:20:47.450 --> 04:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
some of which may not be
 
04:20:50.210 --> 04:20:50.220 align:start position:0%
um in line with what our constitution
 
04:20:50.220 --> 04:20:52.969 align:start position:0%
um in line with what our constitution
allows

04:20:52.969 --> 04:20:52.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:54.889 --> 04:20:54.899 align:start position:0%
I think that you could all sit around
 
04:20:56.870 --> 04:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
all day long and come up with a number
 
04:20:58.490 --> 04:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
of scenarios where somebody might come
 
04:21:00.349 --> 04:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
up with an instance where they can't
 
04:21:02.210 --> 04:21:02.220 align:start position:0%
come to the polls
 
04:21:04.670 --> 04:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
um unlike the last bill
 
04:21:06.769 --> 04:21:06.779 align:start position:0%
um in regards to nursing homes our
 
04:21:09.530 --> 04:21:09.540 align:start position:0%
office does not get a lot of calls from
 
04:21:12.050 --> 04:21:12.060 align:start position:0%
people who cannot get to the polls we do
 
04:21:13.670 --> 04:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
get a lot of calls about nursing homes
 
04:21:15.830 --> 04:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
and not getting ballots or issues with
 
04:21:17.990 --> 04:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
voting at nursing homes and complaints
 
04:21:21.710 --> 04:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
but um I was able to ask someone who was
 
04:21:23.929 --> 04:21:23.939 align:start position:0%
in our office for 49 and a half years
 
04:21:26.570 --> 04:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
how many calls she received over those
 
04:21:29.570 --> 04:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
that time period related to not being
 
04:21:32.210 --> 04:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
able to get to the polls and she thinks
 
04:21:34.130 --> 04:21:34.140 align:start position:0%
that there was probably six
 
04:21:36.410 --> 04:21:36.420 align:start position:0%
for which she referred to that person's
 
04:21:38.630 --> 04:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
political party to request a ride for
 
04:21:41.510 --> 04:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
them so I didn't I don't see that as an
 
04:21:44.750 --> 04:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
issue with adding this to the
 
04:21:47.150 --> 04:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
um the affidavit envelope or the
 
04:21:49.910 --> 04:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot request form I think you
 
04:21:51.830 --> 04:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
all are aware that this committee is
 
04:21:54.530 --> 04:21:54.540 align:start position:0%
trying to re reduce the size of the
 
04:21:56.630 --> 04:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
alphabet affidavit envelope and make it
 
04:21:59.750 --> 04:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
easier or reduce the information on the
 
04:22:02.090 --> 04:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
absentee application and make it easier
 
04:22:04.070 --> 04:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
for somebody to understand and this
 
04:22:06.170 --> 04:22:06.180 align:start position:0%
would just add more information and make
 
04:22:08.870 --> 04:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
it more confusing versus less
 
04:22:11.929 --> 04:22:11.939 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions
 
04:22:16.010 --> 04:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:19.670 --> 04:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you good off easy today
 
04:22:44.110 --> 04:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:47.050 --> 04:22:47.060 align:start position:0%
to turn your mic there you go
 
04:22:50.689 --> 04:22:50.699 align:start position:0%
should know I should know the the drill
 
04:22:52.550 --> 04:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Olivia Zink
 
04:22:54.650 --> 04:22:54.660 align:start position:0%
executive director of open democracy and
 
04:22:57.410 --> 04:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan non-profit Pro voter
 
04:23:00.650 --> 04:23:00.660 align:start position:0%
organization with 36 000 members
 
04:23:03.410 --> 04:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
um and I live in the city of Franklin
 
04:23:05.570 --> 04:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
um absentee voting is nonpartisan
 
04:23:08.870 --> 04:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
according to the Institute of responsive
 
04:23:10.670 --> 04:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
Government research has shown that
 
04:23:14.210 --> 04:23:14.220 align:start position:0%
neither party gains an advantage when
 
04:23:16.250 --> 04:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
they're voting by absentee and when
 
04:23:18.849 --> 04:23:18.859 align:start position:0%
voting by absentee is expanded
 
04:23:21.710 --> 04:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
democracy thrives when many of us can
 
04:23:25.429 --> 04:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
participate so removing barriers to
 
04:23:27.590 --> 04:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
participation encourages a healthy
 
04:23:27.600 --> 04:23:28.790 align:start position:0%
participation encourages a healthy
democracy

04:23:28.790 --> 04:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
04:23:31.130 --> 04:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
and expanding the deaf definition of
 
04:23:34.309 --> 04:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
absentee benefits everyone including
 
04:23:36.610 --> 04:23:36.620 align:start position:0%
seniors who might not be driving anymore
 
04:23:40.309 --> 04:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
rule rule voters
 
04:23:43.429 --> 04:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
single parents families whose kids get
 
04:23:46.689 --> 04:23:46.699 align:start position:0%
sick or somebody or dicey weather
 
04:23:50.050 --> 04:23:50.060 align:start position:0%
according to the ncsl
 
04:23:53.689 --> 04:23:53.699 align:start position:0%
35 states have no excuse absentee voting
 
04:23:56.269 --> 04:23:56.279 align:start position:0%
so you don't need an excuse to vote by
 
04:23:56.279 --> 04:23:57.830 align:start position:0%
so you don't need an excuse to vote by
absentee

04:23:57.830 --> 04:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
absentee
 
04:24:01.189 --> 04:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic many exposed some
 
04:24:03.769 --> 04:24:03.779 align:start position:0%
fundamental weak weaknesses to our
 
04:24:06.290 --> 04:24:06.300 align:start position:0%
absentee voting and voter registration
 
04:24:09.410 --> 04:24:09.420 align:start position:0%
when town clerk's office is closed
 
04:24:13.250 --> 04:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
in 2020 and 2022 those voters who were
 
04:24:16.370 --> 04:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
fearful were able to claim physical
 
04:24:19.010 --> 04:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
disability to vote by absentee
 
04:24:21.710 --> 04:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
and it all there was also in 2020 an
 
04:24:23.809 --> 04:24:23.819 align:start position:0%
allowance for pre-processing absentee
 
04:24:27.370 --> 04:24:27.380 align:start position:0%
which we knew election workers really
 
04:24:29.750 --> 04:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
enjoyed that opportunity and I think
 
04:24:32.150 --> 04:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
it's really important for us
 
04:24:34.670 --> 04:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
to think about this as
 
04:24:34.680 --> 04:24:36.550 align:start position:0%
to think about this as
we

04:24:36.550 --> 04:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:24:40.130 --> 04:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
we're all adults everyone who's a voter
 
04:24:42.650 --> 04:24:42.660 align:start position:0%
is over 18 and is adult and they should
 
04:24:44.450 --> 04:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
manage whether they go in person or
 
04:24:46.010 --> 04:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
whether they can request an absentee
 
04:24:48.590 --> 04:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
ballot and it's really important for
 
04:24:50.990 --> 04:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
voters to have a choice on how they want
 
04:24:54.050 --> 04:24:54.060 align:start position:0%
their vote to be counted and
 
04:24:57.650 --> 04:24:57.660 align:start position:0%
um that their ability to participate
 
04:24:59.870 --> 04:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
I did have an opportunity to serve on
 
04:25:01.130 --> 04:25:01.140 align:start position:0%
the special committee for voter
 
04:25:01.140 --> 04:25:02.870 align:start position:0%
the special committee for voter
competence

04:25:02.870 --> 04:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
competence
 
04:25:05.809 --> 04:25:05.819 align:start position:0%
um and they're in our final report we
 
04:25:07.849 --> 04:25:07.859 align:start position:0%
said consideration should be given for
 
04:25:11.150 --> 04:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
pre-processing absentee ballots so I do
 
04:25:14.389 --> 04:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
think that if we are expanding absentee
 
04:25:17.090 --> 04:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
balloting that we should allow for Town
 
04:25:20.689 --> 04:25:20.699 align:start position:0%
clerks to expand pre-processing please
 
04:25:23.389 --> 04:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
side with voters by voting House Bill
 
04:25:27.469 --> 04:25:27.479 align:start position:0%
586 ought to pass and allowing voters to
 
04:25:31.010 --> 04:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
vote securely by an absentee ballot
 
04:25:34.309 --> 04:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
um it's really important for our for New
 
04:25:36.170 --> 04:25:36.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's future I'm happy to take any
 
04:25:40.250 --> 04:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:43.070 --> 04:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
04:25:54.590 --> 04:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:56.929 --> 04:25:56.939 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman members of the
 
04:25:58.429 --> 04:25:58.439 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Mackenzie St
 
04:25:59.689 --> 04:25:59.699 align:start position:0%
Germain I'm with the New Hampshire
 
04:26:01.550 --> 04:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
campaign for voting rights I'm an
 
04:26:03.469 --> 04:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
America votes New Hampshire and I'm here
 
04:26:06.530 --> 04:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
today in support of HB 586 as a
 
04:26:08.269 --> 04:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
coalition the New Hampshire campaign for
 
04:26:10.790 --> 04:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
voting rights is committed to supporting
 
04:26:13.130 --> 04:26:13.140 align:start position:0%
legislation that expands and supports
 
04:26:15.410 --> 04:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
voter access which is exactly what this
 
04:26:18.050 --> 04:26:18.060 align:start position:0%
bill does by expanding absentee voting
 
04:26:19.550 --> 04:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
to those who have concerns about their
 
04:26:22.250 --> 04:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
safe safety or health traveling to or
 
04:26:24.530 --> 04:26:24.540 align:start position:0%
being at the polls and those who don't
 
04:26:26.030 --> 04:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
have affordable or reliable
 
04:26:28.910 --> 04:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
transportation we would ensure that more
 
04:26:30.950 --> 04:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
eligible voters are able to cast their
 
04:26:33.830 --> 04:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
ballots no voter should be prevented
 
04:26:35.809 --> 04:26:35.819 align:start position:0%
from participating because of concerns
 
04:26:37.729 --> 04:26:37.739 align:start position:0%
about their health being at the polls
 
04:26:39.530 --> 04:26:39.540 align:start position:0%
about their safety traveling to the
 
04:26:42.950 --> 04:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
polls or finding an affordable ride and
 
04:26:44.929 --> 04:26:44.939 align:start position:0%
being able to get there I know myself
 
04:26:47.389 --> 04:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
I've talked to voters on election day
 
04:26:50.090 --> 04:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
going door to door who said I wasn't my
 
04:26:52.189 --> 04:26:52.199 align:start position:0%
ride fell through I wasn't able to get
 
04:26:54.050 --> 04:26:54.060 align:start position:0%
there this would allow those voters who
 
04:26:55.370 --> 04:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
don't have that that reliable
 
04:26:57.410 --> 04:26:57.420 align:start position:0%
transportation to ensure their vote
 
04:26:59.750 --> 04:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
counts was recently told and I got my
 
04:27:02.330 --> 04:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
car inspected that although I passed I
 
04:27:03.710 --> 04:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
probably should not drive in winter
 
04:27:06.130 --> 04:27:06.140 align:start position:0%
weather because of the state of my tires
 
04:27:08.570 --> 04:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
there are many many cases we could go
 
04:27:11.090 --> 04:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
through those voters still deserve to be
 
04:27:13.370 --> 04:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
able to cast their ballot and to not
 
04:27:15.170 --> 04:27:15.180 align:start position:0%
have the additional burden of only being
 
04:27:16.849 --> 04:27:16.859 align:start position:0%
able to go on Election Day when they're
 
04:27:19.070 --> 04:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
not able to get there safely or they're
 
04:27:21.110 --> 04:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
not able to travel there because of
 
04:27:23.450 --> 04:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
Transportation issues it's also
 
04:27:25.849 --> 04:27:25.859 align:start position:0%
important to know as the previous person
 
04:27:28.969 --> 04:27:28.979 align:start position:0%
testified that this is a nonpartisan
 
04:27:30.769 --> 04:27:30.779 align:start position:0%
absentee voting does not benefit one
 
04:27:32.990 --> 04:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
party or another and I'll encourage you
 
04:27:34.849 --> 04:27:34.859 align:start position:0%
all to remember as you work through any
 
04:27:37.010 --> 04:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
absentee voting bills that in New
 
04:27:38.929 --> 04:27:38.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the local election officials
 
04:27:40.370 --> 04:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
are still at the heart of this process
 
04:27:42.110 --> 04:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
they're the ones who send out and
 
04:27:44.510 --> 04:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
process the ballots and voters do need
 
04:27:47.090 --> 04:27:47.100 align:start position:0%
to sign their envelopes attestings their
 
04:27:50.030 --> 04:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
identity domicile age and citizenship so
 
04:27:52.130 --> 04:27:52.140 align:start position:0%
there are in absentee voting really
 
04:27:54.590 --> 04:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
important levels of security and local
 
04:27:56.570 --> 04:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
role in the process and this bill would
 
04:27:59.809 --> 04:27:59.819 align:start position:0%
only expand that access to voters to be
 
04:28:01.849 --> 04:28:01.859 align:start position:0%
able to participate so thank you and I
 
04:28:03.649 --> 04:28:03.659 align:start position:0%
am happy to take any questions
 
04:28:06.769 --> 04:28:06.779 align:start position:0%

motion

05:20:04.430 --> 05:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:06.350 --> 05:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
I was used to it over there
 
05:20:07.628 --> 05:20:07.638 align:start position:0%
but anyway
 
05:20:10.310 --> 05:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
I think yeah this has been hassled out
 
05:20:12.948 --> 05:20:12.958 align:start position:0%
before so I think that currently let's
 
05:20:14.868 --> 05:20:14.878 align:start position:0%
sort of leave it like again
 
05:20:21.230 --> 05:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:23.690 --> 05:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
yeah the way I understood this was you
 
05:20:25.788 --> 05:20:25.798 align:start position:0%
know wearing paraphernalia
 
05:20:27.530 --> 05:20:27.540 align:start position:0%
um is allowed now I wouldn't even be
 
05:20:29.150 --> 05:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that but I think this
 
05:20:32.150 --> 05:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
bill adds that poll workers can also
 
05:20:35.390 --> 05:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
wear political advertising so that's why
 
05:20:39.110 --> 05:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:42.770 --> 05:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:48.230 --> 05:20:48.240 align:start position:0%

would you like to speak to emotion
 
05:23:30.170 --> 05:23:30.180 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think my colleague has some
 
05:23:32.208 --> 05:23:32.218 align:start position:0%
more specific objections to this bill
 
05:23:32.218 --> 05:23:33.170 align:start position:0%
more specific objections to this bill
but

05:23:33.170 --> 05:23:33.180 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:23:35.690 --> 05:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
you know for myself this is just another
 
05:23:38.930 --> 05:23:38.940 align:start position:0%
step down the path where we effectively
 
05:23:41.690 --> 05:23:41.700 align:start position:0%
end in-person voting somewhere down the
 
05:23:47.030 --> 05:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:49.970 --> 05:23:49.980 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the bill
 
05:23:52.670 --> 05:23:52.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman representative queli yes as
 
05:23:55.310 --> 05:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
my as our colleague mentioned my uh
 
05:23:58.310 --> 05:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
concerns are a bit more specific
 
05:24:01.788 --> 05:24:01.798 align:start position:0%
as I see this bill it it it's attempting
 
05:24:05.770 --> 05:24:05.780 align:start position:0%
to modify the absentee ballot
 
05:24:10.490 --> 05:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
application uh it it's implementing
 
05:24:13.850 --> 05:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
uh qualifications for absentee voting
 
05:24:15.890 --> 05:24:15.900 align:start position:0%
that are defined elsewhere in the
 
05:24:15.900 --> 05:24:17.270 align:start position:0%
that are defined elsewhere in the
statutes

05:24:17.270 --> 05:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
05:24:21.230 --> 05:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
and these I believe that an application
 
05:24:23.448 --> 05:24:23.458 align:start position:0%
implementing a set of qualifications in
 
05:24:26.150 --> 05:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
the statute should be consistent with
 
05:24:29.830 --> 05:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
those qualific qualifications as defined
 
05:24:33.050 --> 05:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
this bill has introduced
 
05:24:35.750 --> 05:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
makes the application less consistent
 
05:24:39.230 --> 05:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
with the defined qualifications rather
 
05:24:42.128 --> 05:24:42.138 align:start position:0%
than more consistent specifically
 
05:24:45.788 --> 05:24:45.798 align:start position:0%
the qualifications currently defined in
 
05:24:50.570 --> 05:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
RSA 657 colon 1 include a provision
 
05:24:52.610 --> 05:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
05:24:54.590 --> 05:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
qualifying for
 
05:24:58.128 --> 05:24:58.138 align:start position:0%
absentee voting if there is a National
 
05:25:00.890 --> 05:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
Weather Service winter storm or Blizzard
 
05:25:02.930 --> 05:25:02.940 align:start position:0%
or ice storm warning for the day of the
 
05:25:02.940 --> 05:25:04.868 align:start position:0%
or ice storm warning for the day of the
election

05:25:04.868 --> 05:25:04.878 align:start position:0%
election
 
05:25:08.030 --> 05:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
the application form is specified as
 
05:25:09.530 --> 05:25:09.540 align:start position:0%
proposed in this bill does not include
 
05:25:09.540 --> 05:25:10.368 align:start position:0%
proposed in this bill does not include
that

05:25:10.368 --> 05:25:10.378 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:25:13.850 --> 05:25:13.860 align:start position:0%
qualification so it is explicitly
 
05:25:15.890 --> 05:25:15.900 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with the qualifications
 
05:25:17.750 --> 05:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
listed in the statutes I think that's
 
05:25:19.310 --> 05:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
not a good thing because it could lead
 
05:25:22.368 --> 05:25:22.378 align:start position:0%
to confusion on the part of Voters
 
05:25:24.890 --> 05:25:24.900 align:start position:0%
a second inconsistency is that it
 
05:25:27.070 --> 05:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
changes the term
 
05:25:30.850 --> 05:25:30.860 align:start position:0%
qualifications physical disability
 
05:25:35.270 --> 05:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
as mentioned in 657 colon 1 to Simply
 
05:25:37.090 --> 05:25:37.100 align:start position:0%
disability which is a more General
 
05:25:39.288 --> 05:25:39.298 align:start position:0%
qualification than what is specified in
 
05:25:43.390 --> 05:25:43.400 align:start position:0%
the other statute I think that's also
 
05:25:45.770 --> 05:25:45.780 align:start position:0%
unwise introduce such inconsistencies
 
05:25:49.190 --> 05:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
and if there is a belief that the
 
05:25:52.368 --> 05:25:52.378 align:start position:0%
qualifications to vote absentee should
 
05:25:54.948 --> 05:25:54.958 align:start position:0%
be changed those changes should be made
 
05:25:57.470 --> 05:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
in these statutes which Define them to
 
05:25:58.430 --> 05:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
begin with
 
05:26:01.010 --> 05:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:26:10.430 --> 05:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:12.610 --> 05:26:12.620 align:start position:0%
in my blind spot sorry
 
05:26:16.368 --> 05:26:16.378 align:start position:0%
I had an amendment for this bill
 
05:26:18.410 --> 05:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
but we're not on amendments we're on the
 
05:26:18.420 --> 05:26:20.150 align:start position:0%
but we're not on amendments we're on the
motion

05:26:20.150 --> 05:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
motion
 
05:26:22.670 --> 05:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
so we can't amend it or we're just gonna
 
05:26:30.948 --> 05:26:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:30.958 --> 05:26:32.270 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:26:32.270 --> 05:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:26:35.650 --> 05:26:35.660 align:start position:0%
I guess can we discuss
 
05:26:39.170 --> 05:26:39.180 align:start position:0%
Among Us during the before we vote
 
05:26:41.510 --> 05:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
there's no Amendment before the no I
 
05:26:42.948 --> 05:26:42.958 align:start position:0%
understand that I guess I have a
 
05:26:45.708 --> 05:26:45.718 align:start position:0%
question for representative quailey
 
05:26:47.510 --> 05:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
oh yeah there's further discussion on
 
05:26:51.470 --> 05:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
the bill so if if you knew that there
 
05:26:53.270 --> 05:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
was an amendment that would address
 
05:26:56.628 --> 05:26:56.638 align:start position:0%
these issues would that
 
05:26:58.970 --> 05:26:58.980 align:start position:0%
assist would that improve the bill in
 
05:27:01.190 --> 05:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
your opinion that's possible but I
 
05:27:03.530 --> 05:27:03.540 align:start position:0%
haven't I haven't done the members do
 
05:27:06.288 --> 05:27:06.298 align:start position:0%
not cross-question each other right and
 
05:27:08.750 --> 05:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
again also there is no Amendment before
 
05:27:10.430 --> 05:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
us right now
 
05:27:10.440 --> 05:27:13.250 align:start position:0%
us right now
okay

05:27:13.250 --> 05:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:20.090 --> 05:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:24.590 --> 05:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:26.448 --> 05:27:26.458 align:start position:0%
let me try to help a little
 
05:27:28.970 --> 05:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
if you want to discuss an issue in the
 
05:27:31.730 --> 05:27:31.740 align:start position:0%
underlying bill that could be fixed
 
05:27:34.670 --> 05:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
without saying the a word since there is
 
05:27:37.010 --> 05:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
no amendments before the committee
 
05:27:39.708 --> 05:27:39.718 align:start position:0%
and you can't amend on an itl if you can
 
05:27:41.570 --> 05:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
work that without me wearing out my
 
05:27:43.788 --> 05:27:43.798 align:start position:0%
hammer you might get away with it but
 
05:27:46.430 --> 05:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
you cannot say Amendment or discuss
 
05:27:49.310 --> 05:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
anything in the amendment that does not
 
05:27:56.090 --> 05:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:56.100 --> 05:27:57.288 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:27:57.288 --> 05:27:57.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:58.730 --> 05:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
yeah that's fine
 
05:28:00.830 --> 05:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
ah representative Brennan you want to
 
05:28:04.070 --> 05:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:06.730 --> 05:28:06.740 align:start position:0%
um my colleague across the way mentioned
 
05:28:10.970 --> 05:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
that the bill is written does not or
 
05:28:14.510 --> 05:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
that the bill as written simplifies the
 
05:28:17.390 --> 05:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
disability qualification for requesting
 
05:28:19.610 --> 05:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot
 
05:28:22.190 --> 05:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
um and makes it so that it simply says
 
05:28:24.170 --> 05:28:24.180 align:start position:0%
disability instead of physical
 
05:28:26.990 --> 05:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
disability but I'm not seeing that
 
05:28:29.750 --> 05:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
physical disability is in the statute
 
05:28:32.628 --> 05:28:32.638 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if someone can point
 
05:28:36.288 --> 05:28:36.298 align:start position:0%
out where a physical disability is the
 
05:28:40.730 --> 05:28:40.740 align:start position:0%
only disability qualification for
 
05:28:44.690 --> 05:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:46.190 --> 05:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
representative quality do you have that
 
05:28:46.200 --> 05:28:47.930 align:start position:0%
representative quality do you have that
information

05:28:47.930 --> 05:28:47.940 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:28:49.910 --> 05:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
I believe I do give me a moment to find
 
05:28:54.890 --> 05:28:54.900 align:start position:0%
it in the relevant statute sure thing
 
05:28:54.900 --> 05:28:56.990 align:start position:0%
it in the relevant statute sure thing
the

05:28:56.990 --> 05:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:29:01.550 --> 05:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
it's a fifth 657 colon one
 
05:29:01.560 --> 05:29:03.890 align:start position:0%
it's a fifth 657 colon one
uh

05:29:03.890 --> 05:29:03.900 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:29:08.510 --> 05:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:11.750 --> 05:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh hang on a second
 
05:29:14.208 --> 05:29:14.218 align:start position:0%
uh who is or who is unable to vote there
 
05:29:16.128 --> 05:29:16.138 align:start position:0%
in person by reason of physical
 
05:29:16.138 --> 05:29:17.750 align:start position:0%
in person by reason of physical
disability

05:29:17.750 --> 05:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
disability
 
05:29:20.270 --> 05:29:20.280 align:start position:0%
and as an aside that's also the language
 
05:29:23.270 --> 05:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
used in our state constitution
 
05:29:25.070 --> 05:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question thank you for
 
05:29:29.810 --> 05:29:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:32.270 --> 05:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
because we're discussing a form I'm
 
05:29:33.948 --> 05:29:33.958 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
05:29:37.430 --> 05:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
um 657 colon 4 which says application
 
05:29:40.368 --> 05:29:40.378 align:start position:0%
forms and the application form as it
 
05:29:42.170 --> 05:29:42.180 align:start position:0%
currently stands
 
05:29:45.830 --> 05:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
simply says disability and not physical
 
05:29:48.530 --> 05:29:48.540 align:start position:0%
disability so I would just like to point
 
05:29:51.650 --> 05:29:51.660 align:start position:0%
out that the bill currently as written
 
05:29:56.448 --> 05:29:56.458 align:start position:0%
does not make a change to the form
 
05:29:59.330 --> 05:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
as it currently stands in regards to
 
05:30:06.650 --> 05:30:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:08.150 --> 05:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
and thank you because the next time
 
05:30:10.070 --> 05:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
somebody says it's impossible I can't do
 
05:30:14.510 --> 05:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:16.788 --> 05:30:16.798 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the bill Mr
 
05:30:16.798 --> 05:30:18.050 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the bill Mr
chairman

05:30:18.050 --> 05:30:18.060 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:30:21.250 --> 05:30:21.260 align:start position:0%
representative I'm aware of other
 
05:30:24.050 --> 05:30:24.060 align:start position:0%
existing inconsistencies with the form
 
05:30:27.050 --> 05:30:27.060 align:start position:0%
defined in 657 for
 
05:30:27.060 --> 05:30:28.430 align:start position:0%
defined in 657 for
that

05:30:28.430 --> 05:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:30:31.310 --> 05:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
I believe should also be made consistent
 
05:30:33.530 --> 05:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
with the with the statutes that Define
 
05:30:38.090 --> 05:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:39.948 --> 05:30:39.958 align:start position:0%
and that's all I have to say on that I
 
05:30:42.350 --> 05:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
think the whole I think the form should
 
05:30:45.650 --> 05:30:45.660 align:start position:0%
be made consistent with the statute that
 
05:30:47.690 --> 05:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
defines the qualifications for absentee
 
05:30:50.390 --> 05:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
voting that includes all
 
05:30:52.490 --> 05:30:52.500 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies and including those
 
05:30:54.470 --> 05:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
which currently exist
 
05:30:55.910 --> 05:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:30:58.070 --> 05:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
it would be awesome if
 
05:31:00.530 --> 05:31:00.540 align:start position:0%
members of the committee over the summer
 
05:31:03.230 --> 05:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
before the fall
 
05:31:05.628 --> 05:31:05.638 align:start position:0%
went through that because I hate that
 
05:31:08.090 --> 05:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
and figure out where the inconsistencies
 
05:31:10.730 --> 05:31:10.740 align:start position:0%
are and make a match that would be a
 
05:31:13.730 --> 05:31:13.740 align:start position:0%
really good useful can be proud of
 
05:31:15.470 --> 05:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
projects for the committee to file in
 
05:31:17.930 --> 05:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:20.390 --> 05:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
represent Brennan
 
05:31:22.190 --> 05:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
um would my colleague like to point out
 
05:31:26.510 --> 05:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
the inconsistencies that he sees
 
05:31:29.330 --> 05:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
um as the bill currently stands in
 
05:31:32.628 --> 05:31:32.638 align:start position:0%
relation to the statute regarding the
 
05:31:35.990 --> 05:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
form so that perhaps we may be able to
 
05:31:39.550 --> 05:31:39.560 align:start position:0%
address those inconsistencies
 
05:31:43.730 --> 05:31:43.740 align:start position:0%
you want to I would like to
 
05:31:45.890 --> 05:31:45.900 align:start position:0%
make a further comment on this subject
 
05:31:48.948 --> 05:31:48.958 align:start position:0%
which is that no I don't see it would be
 
05:31:52.368 --> 05:31:52.378 align:start position:0%
a useful uh productive use of our time
 
05:31:55.368 --> 05:31:55.378 align:start position:0%
at this point the the inconsistencies
 
05:31:57.830 --> 05:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
are there to be cleanly clearly seen in
 
05:32:00.110 --> 05:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
my opinion by anyone who compares the
 
05:32:02.990 --> 05:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
two statutes I would like to point out
 
05:32:03.000 --> 05:32:04.670 align:start position:0%
two statutes I would like to point out
that

05:32:04.670 --> 05:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:32:08.030 --> 05:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
starting about two years ago it was a
 
05:32:10.490 --> 05:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
bill by former representative Bergeron I
 
05:32:12.948 --> 05:32:12.958 align:start position:0%
believe was HP 44.
 
05:32:15.590 --> 05:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
in which we we did that representative
 
05:32:17.750 --> 05:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
Muirhead I think would remember
 
05:32:21.368 --> 05:32:21.378 align:start position:0%
participating in that so I think HP 44
 
05:32:23.990 --> 05:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
if you want to pursue it would be a good
 
05:32:26.390 --> 05:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
place to start it was a bill that
 
05:32:28.430 --> 05:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
05:32:30.948 --> 05:32:30.958 align:start position:0%
cleared the committee 20-0 when we were
 
05:32:35.270 --> 05:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
done and I recall that it passed uh in a
 
05:32:36.410 --> 05:32:36.420 align:start position:0%
house session
 
05:32:36.420 --> 05:32:37.850 align:start position:0%
house session
but

05:32:37.850 --> 05:32:37.860 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:32:41.150 --> 05:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
then went astray in the other chamber of
 
05:32:44.030 --> 05:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:46.190 --> 05:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you again
 
05:32:50.208 --> 05:32:50.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:53.448 --> 05:32:53.458 align:start position:0%
for the discussion on the bill
 
05:32:56.150 --> 05:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
all right I have a parliamentary
 
05:32:58.368 --> 05:32:58.378 align:start position:0%
question so sure
 
05:33:00.110 --> 05:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
if we
 
05:33:00.120 --> 05:33:01.788 align:start position:0%
if we
Ito

05:33:01.788 --> 05:33:01.798 align:start position:0%
Ito
 
05:33:06.230 --> 05:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
TL does that mean can we bring a new one
 
05:33:08.990 --> 05:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
next session that addresses the
 
05:33:12.010 --> 05:33:12.020 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies or does it mean we are
 
05:33:16.250 --> 05:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
off the table so to speak
 
05:33:19.788 --> 05:33:19.798 align:start position:0%
um until the next session not next year
 
05:33:21.650 --> 05:33:21.660 align:start position:0%
but next session
 
05:33:24.770 --> 05:33:24.780 align:start position:0%
as long as the bill is substantively
 
05:33:24.780 --> 05:33:27.890 align:start position:0%
as long as the bill is substantively
different

05:33:27.890 --> 05:33:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:30.830 --> 05:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
and I can explain that to the speaker it
 
05:33:35.930 --> 05:33:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:37.310 --> 05:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm willing to go with my
 
05:33:40.310 --> 05:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
answer so
 
05:33:42.708 --> 05:33:42.718 align:start position:0%
it's that substantively word there is no
 
05:33:44.868 --> 05:33:44.878 align:start position:0%
definition written down
 
05:33:47.750 --> 05:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
and the intent of the rule is to keep
 
05:33:49.910 --> 05:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
sore losers from just filing the same
 
05:33:54.190 --> 05:33:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:58.850 --> 05:33:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:00.948 --> 05:34:00.958 align:start position:0%
is it in
 
05:34:04.128 --> 05:34:04.138 align:start position:0%
a sure is it uh could we have five
 
05:34:06.708 --> 05:34:06.718 align:start position:0%
minutes two uh
 
05:34:06.718 --> 05:34:08.208 align:start position:0%
minutes two uh
caucus

05:34:08.208 --> 05:34:08.218 align:start position:0%
caucus
 
05:34:11.030 --> 05:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
sure thing why not thank you we are in
 
05:34:11.040 --> 05:34:12.170 align:start position:0%
sure thing why not thank you we are in
recess

05:34:12.170 --> 05:34:12.180 align:start position:0%
recess
 
05:34:15.830 --> 05:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
so do you mean five
 
05:34:15.840 --> 05:34:17.628 align:start position:0%
so do you mean five
Maybe

05:34:17.628 --> 05:34:17.638 align:start position:0%
Maybe
 
05:34:21.170 --> 05:34:21.180 align:start position:0%
do you mean five minutes okay so we're
 
05:40:02.170 --> 05:40:02.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:05.390 --> 05:40:05.400 align:start position:0%

05:43:18.948 --> 05:43:18.958 align:start position:0%
so even in
 
05:43:22.070 --> 05:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
like in like there's only two people I
 
05:43:36.730 --> 05:43:36.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:38.810 --> 05:43:38.820 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
05:43:42.288 --> 05:43:42.298 align:start position:0%
hey Mr chairman uh I I think that this
 
05:43:46.190 --> 05:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
bill uh it solves an issue that many of
 
05:43:48.770 --> 05:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
many of us including myself uh have
 
05:43:50.868 --> 05:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
experienced in serving in a multi-member
 
05:43:50.878 --> 05:43:52.010 align:start position:0%
experienced in serving in a multi-member
district

05:43:52.010 --> 05:43:52.020 align:start position:0%
district
 
05:43:54.590 --> 05:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
I had gone through a recount this past
 
05:43:57.650 --> 05:43:57.660 align:start position:0%
cycle and I had seen a number of ballots
 
05:44:00.048 --> 05:44:00.058 align:start position:0%
where there were a number of undervotes
 
05:44:02.030 --> 05:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
I think that the language that currently
 
05:44:04.970 --> 05:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
exists can be confusing to individuals
 
05:44:07.070 --> 05:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
because they are afraid that their vote
 
05:44:08.990 --> 05:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
will not be counted if they vote for too
 
05:44:10.490 --> 05:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
many candidates
 
05:44:14.208 --> 05:44:14.218 align:start position:0%
this changes the language so that it
 
05:44:16.430 --> 05:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
encourages them to vote for additional
 
05:44:20.090 --> 05:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
candidates up until the maximum rather
 
05:44:22.730 --> 05:44:22.740 align:start position:0%
than encouraging them to be more
 
05:44:24.650 --> 05:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
conservative with their vote
 
05:44:26.990 --> 05:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
I encourage you all to support this bill
 
05:44:27.000 --> 05:44:29.628 align:start position:0%
I encourage you all to support this bill
thanks

05:44:29.628 --> 05:44:29.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:32.510 --> 05:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
for the discussion on the bill
 
05:44:34.190 --> 05:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
representative Hamlet
 
05:44:36.410 --> 05:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:44:39.048 --> 05:44:39.058 align:start position:0%
um I passed out an amendment that I was
 
05:44:41.510 --> 05:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
hoping to introduce
 
05:44:44.690 --> 05:44:44.700 align:start position:0%
for this Bill yes the a word
 
05:44:48.530 --> 05:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
um because there is some confusion among
 
05:44:51.190 --> 05:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
some voters about how how many
 
05:44:53.330 --> 05:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
candidates are they actually allowed to
 
05:44:56.270 --> 05:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
vote for and this bill
 
05:44:59.150 --> 05:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
helps to clarify that for voters and the
 
05:45:00.830 --> 05:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
amendment would have clarified it even
 
05:45:00.840 --> 05:45:02.208 align:start position:0%
amendment would have clarified it even
further

05:45:02.208 --> 05:45:02.218 align:start position:0%
further
 
05:45:05.090 --> 05:45:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:09.170 --> 05:45:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:13.250 --> 05:45:13.260 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan thank you
 
05:45:16.970 --> 05:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
the bill has written clarifies and
 
05:45:20.030 --> 05:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
changes the language so that on the
 
05:45:24.170 --> 05:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
ballot there is more positive language
 
05:45:26.628 --> 05:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
there is something to be said for the
 
05:45:29.650 --> 05:45:29.660 align:start position:0%
way that the ballot is currently written
 
05:45:33.708 --> 05:45:33.718 align:start position:0%
using the language not more than there
 
05:45:36.410 --> 05:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
is a negative connotation there and that
 
05:45:39.310 --> 05:45:39.320 align:start position:0%
contributes to the confusion with voters
 
05:45:41.990 --> 05:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
this bill as written contains a lot of
 
05:45:44.150 --> 05:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
words but perhaps there might be a
 
05:45:47.090 --> 05:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
simplified version for this committee to
 
05:45:47.100 --> 05:45:48.548 align:start position:0%
simplified version for this committee to
consider

05:45:48.548 --> 05:45:48.558 align:start position:0%
consider
 
05:45:54.530 --> 05:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:58.788 --> 05:45:58.798 align:start position:0%
possibly consider a second motion
 
05:46:04.490 --> 05:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:07.850 --> 05:46:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:11.690 --> 05:46:11.700 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion is inexperienced to
 
05:46:14.330 --> 05:46:14.340 align:start position:0%
legislate on
 
05:46:16.070 --> 05:46:16.080 align:start position:0%

05:48:39.610 --> 05:48:39.620 align:start position:0%
representative Hamlet moves
 
05:48:45.128 --> 05:48:45.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:50.150 --> 05:48:50.160 align:start position:0%

motion yes thank you Mr chair
 
05:48:56.868 --> 05:48:56.878 align:start position:0%
so the amendment
 
05:48:59.810 --> 05:48:59.820 align:start position:0%
makes the language even more clear to
 
05:49:03.230 --> 05:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
instruct voters as to how to vote when
 
05:49:06.770 --> 05:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
there are you know one or more uh
 
05:49:09.650 --> 05:49:09.660 align:start position:0%
offices to vote for on on the ballot
 
05:49:09.660 --> 05:49:11.150 align:start position:0%
offices to vote for on on the ballot
so

05:49:11.150 --> 05:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:49:14.750 --> 05:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
um in line seven
 
05:49:14.760 --> 05:49:16.670 align:start position:0%
um in line seven
um

05:49:16.670 --> 05:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:19.310 --> 05:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
it changes the word from from the
 
05:49:22.128 --> 05:49:22.138 align:start position:0%
original bill it changes the word from
 
05:49:26.090 --> 05:49:26.100 align:start position:0%
each such to appropriate So Below the
 
05:49:28.548 --> 05:49:28.558 align:start position:0%
appropriate phase a phrase shall be
 
05:49:30.350 --> 05:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
printed in small but easily legible
 
05:49:32.510 --> 05:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
letters and then it gives two Clear
 
05:49:32.520 --> 05:49:34.490 align:start position:0%
letters and then it gives two Clear
Choices

05:49:34.490 --> 05:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
Choices
 
05:49:37.310 --> 05:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
um number one is to
 
05:49:37.320 --> 05:49:37.970 align:start position:0%
um number one is to
um

05:49:37.970 --> 05:49:37.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:40.610 --> 05:49:40.620 align:start position:0%
vote for one if there's only one office
 
05:49:42.830 --> 05:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
to be filled such as the governor or
 
05:49:44.150 --> 05:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
state senator
 
05:49:46.910 --> 05:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
or vote for up to
 
05:49:48.548 --> 05:49:48.558 align:start position:0%
X number
 
05:49:51.948 --> 05:49:51.958 align:start position:0%
uh where you would insert the number of
 
05:49:55.128 --> 05:49:55.138 align:start position:0%
offices to be filled X will be elected
 
05:49:57.170 --> 05:49:57.180 align:start position:0%
so insert the number of offices to be
 
05:50:00.410 --> 05:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
filled so it instructs the voter that
 
05:50:02.750 --> 05:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
they are allowed to vote for
 
05:50:05.330 --> 05:50:05.340 align:start position:0%
um the number of offices
 
05:50:08.390 --> 05:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh that are allowed to be filled
 
05:50:12.230 --> 05:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
on the ballot for that position
 
05:50:14.868 --> 05:50:14.878 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the amendment
 
05:50:17.208 --> 05:50:17.218 align:start position:0%
isn't this nice to turn around we can't
 
05:50:18.590 --> 05:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
talk about the bill just the amendment
 
05:50:20.150 --> 05:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of like the opposite of
 
05:50:20.160 --> 05:50:21.410 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of like the opposite of
before

05:50:21.410 --> 05:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
before
 
05:50:25.128 --> 05:50:25.138 align:start position:0%
representative yeah thank you uh
 
05:50:27.288 --> 05:50:27.298 align:start position:0%
to me this makes it
 
05:50:29.690 --> 05:50:29.700 align:start position:0%
get wrong information
 
05:50:33.110 --> 05:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
because it says vote for up to X
 
05:50:38.390 --> 05:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:40.730 --> 05:50:40.740 align:start position:0%
which is the current language that not
 
05:50:42.530 --> 05:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
more than which makes I don't have to
 
05:50:44.090 --> 05:50:44.100 align:start position:0%
vote up to X
 
05:50:46.670 --> 05:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
so this says according to this the
 
05:50:50.208 --> 05:50:50.218 align:start position:0%
instructions vote for up to X in other
 
05:50:52.610 --> 05:50:52.620 align:start position:0%
words up to 10 up to five or whatever
 
05:50:55.970 --> 05:50:55.980 align:start position:0%
the number is that are running I might
 
05:50:58.128 --> 05:50:58.138 align:start position:0%
not want to and this is giving me wrong
 
05:50:58.138 --> 05:50:59.930 align:start position:0%
not want to and this is giving me wrong
information

05:50:59.930 --> 05:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:51:06.350 --> 05:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:08.150 --> 05:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the bill
 
05:51:10.610 --> 05:51:10.620 align:start position:0%
representative Ankerberg my response to
 
05:51:12.470 --> 05:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
that would be that it's also telling you
 
05:51:14.690 --> 05:51:14.700 align:start position:0%
how many how many seats or candidates
 
05:51:16.250 --> 05:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
are being elected that you're voting for
 
05:51:18.830 --> 05:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
so in my view I see it exactly the
 
05:51:20.810 --> 05:51:20.820 align:start position:0%
opposite it's actually providing
 
05:51:24.530 --> 05:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:26.868 --> 05:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the amendment
 
05:51:29.030 --> 05:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
sure representative Brennan thank you
 
05:51:31.250 --> 05:51:31.260 align:start position:0%
this amendment remember don't talk about
 
05:51:34.510 --> 05:51:34.520 align:start position:0%
the bill I will not this amendment
 
05:51:38.110 --> 05:51:38.120 align:start position:0%
offers Clarity to voters it makes it
 
05:51:42.048 --> 05:51:42.058 align:start position:0%
exceedingly clear how many seats there
 
05:51:45.530 --> 05:51:45.540 align:start position:0%
are how many seats how many individuals
 
05:51:48.650 --> 05:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
will be elected to those seats it makes
 
05:51:50.690 --> 05:51:50.700 align:start position:0%
it easier
 
05:51:50.700 --> 05:51:53.810 align:start position:0%
it easier
and

05:51:53.810 --> 05:51:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:55.548 --> 05:51:55.558 align:start position:0%
more clear
 
05:51:59.270 --> 05:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
for the voter which I think all of my
 
05:52:01.910 --> 05:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
colleagues would like to see when it
 
05:52:04.128 --> 05:52:04.138 align:start position:0%
comes to the ballot we want people to
 
05:52:06.170 --> 05:52:06.180 align:start position:0%
understand how to fill out their ballot
 
05:52:08.810 --> 05:52:08.820 align:start position:0%
this makes it easier
 
05:52:11.810 --> 05:52:11.820 align:start position:0%
I encourage my colleagues to vote
 
05:52:11.820 --> 05:52:13.850 align:start position:0%
I encourage my colleagues to vote
otpa

05:52:13.850 --> 05:52:13.860 align:start position:0%
otpa
 
05:52:19.610 --> 05:52:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:21.230 --> 05:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
representative Burnham
 
05:52:23.448 --> 05:52:23.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:52:26.708 --> 05:52:26.718 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I agree that this
 
05:52:31.730 --> 05:52:31.740 align:start position:0%
amendment has a lot more clarity I have
 
05:52:34.970 --> 05:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
found working at elections for the last
 
05:52:36.890 --> 05:52:36.900 align:start position:0%
10 or so years
 
05:52:39.230 --> 05:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
many voters are confused when they see
 
05:52:42.048 --> 05:52:42.058 align:start position:0%
the word not I get confused when I see
 
05:52:44.510 --> 05:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
not because it's telling me not to do
 
05:52:44.520 --> 05:52:45.590 align:start position:0%
not because it's telling me not to do
something

05:52:45.590 --> 05:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:52:47.510 --> 05:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
but that's not what it meant it's meant
 
05:52:49.670 --> 05:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
to do but it's confusing and you still
 
05:52:53.208 --> 05:52:53.218 align:start position:0%
have a choice to not vote for that many
 
05:52:56.090 --> 05:52:56.100 align:start position:0%
people so I think that this taking the
 
05:52:57.890 --> 05:52:57.900 align:start position:0%
knot out
 
05:53:01.510 --> 05:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't confuse the individual
 
05:53:04.788 --> 05:53:04.798 align:start position:0%
and just provides a clear statement
 
05:53:07.730 --> 05:53:07.740 align:start position:0%
this money is available to vote
 
05:53:10.250 --> 05:53:10.260 align:start position:0%
and choose how you vote
 
05:53:15.230 --> 05:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:17.390 --> 05:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative Muirhead I'd just like to
 
05:53:19.670 --> 05:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
briefly address the argument made by my
 
05:53:21.770 --> 05:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
colleague with the excellent tie
 
05:53:25.490 --> 05:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
that this might cause people not to
 
05:53:27.890 --> 05:53:27.900 align:start position:0%
Bullet vote and I think if it said let's
 
05:53:29.810 --> 05:53:29.820 align:start position:0%
say in a 4C District but said vote for
 
05:53:31.670 --> 05:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
four candidates then that might cause it
 
05:53:33.650 --> 05:53:33.660 align:start position:0%
says vote for up to four I think that
 
05:53:35.690 --> 05:53:35.700 align:start position:0%
does tell the voter that they don't have
 
05:53:38.090 --> 05:53:38.100 align:start position:0%
to do all four they could just vote for
 
05:53:40.190 --> 05:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
one representative burn them if that's
 
05:53:42.350 --> 05:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
the person I know and want a bullet for
 
05:53:44.150 --> 05:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
05:53:46.190 --> 05:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
um I don't I think it preserves that
 
05:53:51.230 --> 05:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:54.010 --> 05:53:54.020 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
05:53:56.448 --> 05:53:56.458 align:start position:0%
representative Hammer thank you I just
 
05:53:58.970 --> 05:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
wanted to just wanted to say that vote
 
05:54:02.930 --> 05:54:02.940 align:start position:0%
for up to up to it sounds more inviting
 
05:54:17.330 --> 05:54:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:19.850 --> 05:54:19.860 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the bill
 
05:54:19.860 --> 05:54:21.890 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the bill
representative

05:54:21.890 --> 05:54:21.900 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:54:25.490 --> 05:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
I used to teach survey classes and
 
05:54:28.010 --> 05:54:28.020 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that we teach is to
 
05:54:30.770 --> 05:54:30.780 align:start position:0%
not ask the question with negative just
 
05:54:36.230 --> 05:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:39.170 --> 05:54:39.180 align:start position:0%
all right further discussion before we
 
05:54:42.708 --> 05:54:42.718 align:start position:0%
get too carried away I can count so
 
05:54:44.990 --> 05:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative wood
 
05:54:46.970 --> 05:54:46.980 align:start position:0%
it's interesting that we keep the
 
05:54:49.548 --> 05:54:49.558 align:start position:0%
negative for the vote for not more than
 
05:54:52.070 --> 05:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
one we keep that negative and the other
 
05:54:55.670 --> 05:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
one seems to be more positive so I just
 
05:55:52.430 --> 05:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:48.788 --> 05:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:50.570 --> 05:56:50.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:56:52.128 --> 05:56:52.138 align:start position:0%
and we haven't voted on the amendment
 
05:56:54.590 --> 05:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
yet right okay further discussion on the
 
05:56:54.600 --> 05:56:57.970 align:start position:0%
yet right okay further discussion on the
amendment

05:56:57.970 --> 05:56:57.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:01.490 --> 05:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
representative yeah I I told him yeah
 
05:57:04.548 --> 05:57:04.558 align:start position:0%
the amended language
 
05:57:07.250 --> 05:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
does make it clearer than the original
 
05:57:07.260 --> 05:57:09.170 align:start position:0%
does make it clearer than the original
language

05:57:09.170 --> 05:57:09.180 align:start position:0%
language
 
05:57:12.770 --> 05:57:12.780 align:start position:0%
so I'm just one you know so that I think
 
05:57:16.868 --> 05:57:16.878 align:start position:0%
clarifies it vote for up to the number
 
05:57:19.430 --> 05:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
not more than I don't think it makes
 
05:57:24.230 --> 05:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:25.850 --> 05:57:25.860 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan I'll keep it
 
05:57:27.890 --> 05:57:27.900 align:start position:0%
brief thank you Mr chair
 
05:57:29.030 --> 05:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
um just to address my colleague
 
05:57:31.310 --> 05:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
representative Woods comment about vote
 
05:57:34.610 --> 05:57:34.620 align:start position:0%
for not more than one in the case of say
 
05:57:34.620 --> 05:57:36.230 align:start position:0%
for not more than one in the case of say
Governor

05:57:36.230 --> 05:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
Governor
 
05:57:38.330 --> 05:57:38.340 align:start position:0%
um that language
 
05:57:41.990 --> 05:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
helps a voter understand when you have
 
05:57:42.000 --> 05:57:42.948 align:start position:0%
helps a voter understand when you have
um

05:57:42.948 --> 05:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:46.670 --> 05:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
one candidate for the Democratic side
 
05:57:48.530 --> 05:57:48.540 align:start position:0%
one candidate for the Republican side
 
05:57:51.230 --> 05:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
you're not creating a situation where
 
05:57:52.970 --> 05:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
that person
 
05:57:52.980 --> 05:57:53.690 align:start position:0%
that person
um

05:57:53.690 --> 05:57:53.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:57.230 --> 05:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
would choose more than one on that line
 
05:58:00.410 --> 05:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
whereas in a state representative race
 
05:58:03.708 --> 05:58:03.718 align:start position:0%
where someone may choose to vote for
 
05:58:06.890 --> 05:58:06.900 align:start position:0%
some Democrats some Republicans some
 
05:58:09.948 --> 05:58:09.958 align:start position:0%
third party the language is clear for
 
05:58:13.368 --> 05:58:13.378 align:start position:0%
vote for up to but it's important for
 
05:58:15.830 --> 05:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
the single seat of a governor's race to
 
05:58:18.470 --> 05:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
have the negative language of vote for
 
05:58:21.410 --> 05:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
not more than so that the voter gets the
 
05:58:23.628 --> 05:58:23.638 align:start position:0%
signal that they cannot vote for more
 
05:58:25.910 --> 05:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
than one or they risk their vote not
 
05:58:27.530 --> 05:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
being counted
 
05:58:29.150 --> 05:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
so that would be the argument for
 
05:58:31.190 --> 05:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
maintaining the language that's in this
 
05:58:31.200 --> 05:58:33.410 align:start position:0%
maintaining the language that's in this
amendment

05:58:33.410 --> 05:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:58:37.368 --> 05:58:37.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:39.890 --> 05:58:39.900 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:58:42.830 --> 05:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
okay and go ahead and I think it's time
 
05:58:44.690 --> 05:58:44.700 align:start position:0%
we got to the vote
 
05:58:47.270 --> 05:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
05:58:48.530 --> 05:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
think that
 
05:58:51.110 --> 05:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
for consistency throughout the entire
 
05:58:53.930 --> 05:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
ballot I'm going to vote against the
 
05:58:53.940 --> 05:58:54.890 align:start position:0%
ballot I'm going to vote against the
amendment

05:58:54.890 --> 05:58:54.900 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:59:00.470 --> 05:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
and I am going that's my plan because
 
05:59:02.750 --> 05:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
if you are saying one thing for a race
 
05:59:05.628 --> 05:59:05.638 align:start position:0%
with one person in it that you can vote
 
05:59:05.638 --> 05:59:07.070 align:start position:0%
with one person in it that you can vote
for

05:59:07.070 --> 05:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:59:09.170 --> 05:59:09.180 align:start position:0%
you're saying you'd be phrasing it the
 
05:59:11.150 --> 05:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
exact same way in every other race and I
 
05:59:16.310 --> 05:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:17.868 --> 05:59:17.878 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:59:19.610 --> 05:59:19.620 align:start position:0%
let's take a flyer and see how this
 
05:59:22.730 --> 05:59:22.740 align:start position:0%

the question now is on
 
06:00:56.868 --> 06:00:56.878 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended
 
06:01:04.010 --> 06:01:04.020 align:start position:0%

06:01:45.830 --> 06:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
okie dokie I just wanted to make sure I
 
06:01:48.470 --> 06:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
was right so
 
06:01:52.070 --> 06:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment replaces section one not
 
06:01:54.590 --> 06:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral one regular number one I
 
06:01:56.750 --> 06:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
wish we didn't do that but we do
 
06:01:59.030 --> 06:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
the only thing remaining of the original
 
06:02:02.570 --> 06:02:02.580 align:start position:0%
bill is section two regular number two
 
06:02:04.670 --> 06:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
which was the effective date
 
06:02:07.390 --> 06:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
so what you're looking at
 
06:02:11.090 --> 06:02:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:13.010 --> 06:02:13.020 align:start position:0%

actually the first vote
 
06:05:03.048 --> 06:05:03.058 align:start position:0%
so the folks need to be able to look at

do I need to do anything for minority
 
06:05:29.868 --> 06:05:29.878 align:start position:0%
like that should be if there was a
 
06:05:36.288 --> 06:05:36.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:42.770 --> 06:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:45.410 --> 06:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
did I close that
 
06:05:48.288 --> 06:05:48.298 align:start position:0%
I can't remember if I closed it
 
06:05:50.270 --> 06:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
well I'll hit it again so that closes
 
06:05:50.280 --> 06:05:51.890 align:start position:0%
well I'll hit it again so that closes

my colleague who is missing today uh
 
06:08:47.090 --> 06:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
representative Barry often points out
 
06:08:51.530 --> 06:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
that two classifications of Voters and
 
06:08:54.128 --> 06:08:54.138 align:start position:0%
this bill creates two classifications
 
06:08:58.490 --> 06:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
for candidates and for that reason I
 
06:09:00.830 --> 06:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
would encourage my colleagues to support
 
06:09:03.948 --> 06:09:03.958 align:start position:0%
the itl motion so that candidates are
 
06:09:06.830 --> 06:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
treated equally much like we
 
06:09:09.110 --> 06:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
or a friend who is not here today would
 
06:09:12.948 --> 06:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
like voters to be treated equally and so
 
06:09:15.288 --> 06:09:15.298 align:start position:0%
please support the itl motion so the
 
06:09:20.750 --> 06:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
candidates are treated equally thank you
 
06:09:23.270 --> 06:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
for the discussion
 
06:09:23.280 --> 06:09:24.890 align:start position:0%
for the discussion
okay

06:09:24.890 --> 06:09:24.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:09:26.570 --> 06:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
so the motion is an expedient to
 
06:09:30.708 --> 06:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
legislate on house bill 363.
 
06:09:34.610 --> 06:09:34.620 align:start position:0%

06:10:32.868 --> 06:10:32.878 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:10:38.448 --> 06:10:38.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:41.030 --> 06:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
and that motion fails that means that
 
06:10:43.310 --> 06:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
this will go to the house calendar with
 
06:10:45.650 --> 06:10:45.660 align:start position:0%
no recommendation and I will need
 
06:10:48.470 --> 06:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
reports from what representative Lynn
 
06:11:50.690 --> 06:11:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:52.430 --> 06:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
all right we'll open the executive
 
06:11:54.948 --> 06:11:54.958 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 460.
 
06:11:56.750 --> 06:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
representative perdoma Brian is
 
06:11:58.368 --> 06:11:58.378 align:start position:0%

pass
 
06:12:01.620 --> 06:12:06.830 align:start position:0%
pass
second

06:12:06.830 --> 06:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:08.990 --> 06:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
okay uh would you like to speak to your
 
06:12:13.610 --> 06:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:15.288 --> 06:12:15.298 align:start position:0%
I think we need
 
06:12:18.530 --> 06:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
an accuracy accurate assessment of all
 
06:12:20.990 --> 06:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
people who vote
 
06:12:21.000 --> 06:12:22.430 align:start position:0%
people who vote
um

06:12:22.430 --> 06:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:24.048 --> 06:12:24.058 align:start position:0%
that all people who vote should be
 
06:12:26.270 --> 06:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
qualified voters
 
06:12:29.270 --> 06:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
and all all people who vote should bring
 
06:12:33.948 --> 06:12:33.958 align:start position:0%
ID and have ID it's not too much to ask
 
06:12:35.930 --> 06:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's too cumbersome and I
 
06:12:37.788 --> 06:12:37.798 align:start position:0%
don't think it's
 
06:12:39.530 --> 06:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
06:12:43.190 --> 06:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
it would lead to voter suppression
 
06:12:47.868 --> 06:12:47.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:52.010 --> 06:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:55.250 --> 06:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
represent Brennan thank you
 
06:12:55.260 --> 06:12:57.288 align:start position:0%
represent Brennan thank you
um

06:12:57.288 --> 06:12:57.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:59.690 --> 06:12:59.700 align:start position:0%
as we remember from the public hearing
 
06:13:01.310 --> 06:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
there were there was a lot of discussion
 
06:13:03.410 --> 06:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
about this bill one thing that I'd like
 
06:13:04.970 --> 06:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
to point out to my colleagues who are
 
06:13:07.128 --> 06:13:07.138 align:start position:0%
considering supporting the ought to pass
 
06:13:09.708 --> 06:13:09.718 align:start position:0%
motion is that this bill
 
06:13:13.510 --> 06:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
well it seeks to remove
 
06:13:13.520 --> 06:13:15.170 align:start position:0%
well it seeks to remove
affidavits

06:13:15.170 --> 06:13:15.180 align:start position:0%
affidavits
 
06:13:20.330 --> 06:13:20.340 align:start position:0%
from the voter registration process
 
06:13:22.548 --> 06:13:22.558 align:start position:0%
there are
 
06:13:26.750 --> 06:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
a in this bill there are places where it
 
06:13:29.948 --> 06:13:29.958 align:start position:0%
mentions that affidavits are acceptable
 
06:13:34.548 --> 06:13:34.558 align:start position:0%
for proving certain things so while this
 
06:13:38.090 --> 06:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
bill seeks to remove affidavits from the
 
06:13:41.030 --> 06:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
registration process you are still able
 
06:13:43.970 --> 06:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
to use an affidavit so if the issue is
 
06:13:46.368 --> 06:13:46.378 align:start position:0%
with affidavits
 
06:13:50.810 --> 06:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:53.570 --> 06:13:53.580 align:start position:0%
why would it still be acceptable to use
 
06:13:58.610 --> 06:13:58.620 align:start position:0%
affidavits to prove other portions that
 
06:14:00.350 --> 06:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
are included in this bill I hope that's
 
06:14:02.930 --> 06:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
making sense
 
06:14:05.090 --> 06:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
it's been a long day
 
06:14:05.100 --> 06:14:06.110 align:start position:0%
it's been a long day
um

06:14:06.110 --> 06:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:10.430 --> 06:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
so what I'm trying to say is affidavits
 
06:14:13.510 --> 06:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
are not a problem we have we use them
 
06:14:15.948 --> 06:14:15.958 align:start position:0%
all the time for all sorts of different
 
06:14:18.708 --> 06:14:18.718 align:start position:0%
things including in this bill
 
06:14:21.230 --> 06:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
that is trying to declare the affidavits
 
06:14:22.670 --> 06:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
are a problem
 
06:14:25.490 --> 06:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
I would encourage my colleagues not to
 
06:14:28.490 --> 06:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
support the ought to pass motion so that
 
06:14:33.288 --> 06:14:33.298 align:start position:0%
another motion may be made thank you
 
06:14:36.590 --> 06:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the bill
 
06:14:36.600 --> 06:14:38.810 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the bill
okay

06:14:38.810 --> 06:14:38.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:14:42.410 --> 06:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
so the motion is ought to pass on House
 
06:14:45.170 --> 06:14:45.180 align:start position:0%

my colleagues have supported the ought
 
06:16:30.230 --> 06:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
to pass motion but I would encourage you
 
06:16:33.170 --> 06:16:33.180 align:start position:0%
to consider changing your mind and
 
06:16:37.250 --> 06:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
voting Ito on this we heard during
 
06:16:41.090 --> 06:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
testimony that there is no widespread
 
06:16:42.708 --> 06:16:42.718 align:start position:0%
voter fraud
 
06:16:47.270 --> 06:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
there is no falsifying of documents
 
06:16:50.330 --> 06:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
there are no
 
06:16:50.340 --> 06:16:51.948 align:start position:0%
there are no
issues

06:16:51.948 --> 06:16:51.958 align:start position:0%
issues
 
06:16:56.150 --> 06:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
that have not been handled appropriately
 
06:16:59.390 --> 06:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
by the ages office there was no
 
06:17:03.190 --> 06:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
testimony to say that the AG's office is
 
06:17:06.170 --> 06:17:06.180 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed with following up on
 
06:17:06.180 --> 06:17:08.448 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed with following up on
affidavit

06:17:08.448 --> 06:17:08.458 align:start position:0%
affidavit
 
06:17:08.458 --> 06:17:09.650 align:start position:0%
affidavit
um

06:17:09.650 --> 06:17:09.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:11.930 --> 06:17:11.940 align:start position:0%
for voter registration or voting
 
06:17:11.940 --> 06:17:13.788 align:start position:0%
for voter registration or voting
purposes

06:17:13.788 --> 06:17:13.798 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
06:17:13.798 --> 06:17:15.250 align:start position:0%
purposes
um

06:17:15.250 --> 06:17:15.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:19.430 --> 06:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
there is in with this bill a chilling
 
06:17:19.440 --> 06:17:20.690 align:start position:0%
there is in with this bill a chilling
effect

06:17:20.690 --> 06:17:20.700 align:start position:0%
effect
 
06:17:24.410 --> 06:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
that would affect voters who are seeking
 
06:17:27.770 --> 06:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
to vote which is what I believe we all
 
06:17:30.410 --> 06:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
would like to see an increase in voter
 
06:17:33.770 --> 06:17:33.780 align:start position:0%
participation and we do not want to have
 
06:17:35.930 --> 06:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
someone discouraged
 
06:17:39.110 --> 06:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
from voting because
 
06:17:42.410 --> 06:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
of some new
 
06:17:42.420 --> 06:17:44.690 align:start position:0%
of some new
legislation

06:17:44.690 --> 06:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
06:17:48.530 --> 06:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
that would turn them away I'd also like
 
06:17:51.470 --> 06:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
to point out that this bill does not
 
06:17:55.250 --> 06:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
recognize the rights of people who are
 
06:17:55.260 --> 06:17:56.750 align:start position:0%
recognize the rights of people who are
currently

06:17:56.750 --> 06:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
currently
 
06:18:00.910 --> 06:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
houseless or homeless
 
06:18:04.910 --> 06:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
those citizens do have a right to vote
 
06:18:08.350 --> 06:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
and they may not have the documentation
 
06:18:10.910 --> 06:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
but they would still be allowed to vote
 
06:18:12.770 --> 06:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
under our current system with the
 
06:18:16.490 --> 06:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
affidavit this bill removes that option
 
06:18:19.070 --> 06:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
from a segment of our population during
 
06:18:21.650 --> 06:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
a time where we are experiencing a
 
06:18:23.510 --> 06:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
housing crisis
 
06:18:26.390 --> 06:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
those folks those homeless individuals
 
06:18:30.350 --> 06:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
deserve the opportunity to vote
 
06:18:33.650 --> 06:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
and this bill takes that away from them
 
06:18:35.810 --> 06:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
and it is a fundamental right that is
 
06:18:37.730 --> 06:18:37.740 align:start position:0%
being stripped from them with this bill
 
06:18:40.850 --> 06:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
please consider that especially during
 
06:18:42.830 --> 06:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
this time
 
06:18:45.530 --> 06:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
of a housing crisis
 
06:18:47.390 --> 06:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
too many people
 
06:18:49.490 --> 06:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
currently without a home but still
 
06:18:54.170 --> 06:18:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:56.810 --> 06:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
represent Kendrick yeah I just wanted to
 
06:18:59.868 --> 06:18:59.878 align:start position:0%
point out that the the idea that there
 
06:19:02.208 --> 06:19:02.218 align:start position:0%
are no problems with our elections is an
 
06:19:08.650 --> 06:19:08.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:10.970 --> 06:19:10.980 align:start position:0%
well it's not going to go back and forth
 
06:19:14.030 --> 06:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
the most Fair statement to say is there
 
06:19:18.708 --> 06:19:18.718 align:start position:0%
is no evidence of widespread voter fraud
 
06:19:21.590 --> 06:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
the one side believes there is not any
 
06:19:23.570 --> 06:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
and the other side believes that if you
 
06:19:25.010 --> 06:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
don't look for it properly you don't
 
06:19:28.250 --> 06:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
find it and neither side will convince
 
06:19:30.170 --> 06:19:30.180 align:start position:0%
each other that they have the correct
 
06:19:32.030 --> 06:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
answer and there's no evidence to
 
06:19:38.030 --> 06:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:38.040 --> 06:19:38.948 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:19:38.948 --> 06:19:38.958 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:19:40.730 --> 06:19:40.740 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:19:43.910 --> 06:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:47.750 --> 06:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
let's get to it then I I do have some
 
06:19:49.970 --> 06:19:49.980 align:start position:0%
private discussion representative Brian
 
06:19:53.270 --> 06:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you I just want to mention that I
 
06:19:57.410 --> 06:19:57.420 align:start position:0%
will be voting no on the itl but that
 
06:20:00.590 --> 06:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
does not mean I'm not concerned about
 
06:20:04.010 --> 06:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
homeless people voting because they can
 
06:20:06.708 --> 06:20:06.718 align:start position:0%
use the shelter addresses and that is
 
06:20:08.708 --> 06:20:08.718 align:start position:0%
something that has been addressed in law
 
06:20:11.628 --> 06:20:11.638 align:start position:0%
and what does have a chilling effect and
 
06:20:14.750 --> 06:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
what I hear from my constituents is when
 
06:20:17.570 --> 06:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
an affidavit Vote or a vote that someone
 
06:20:19.910 --> 06:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
fills out an affidavit that's
 
06:20:22.128 --> 06:20:22.138 align:start position:0%
abandon is a dead end and you can't find
 
06:20:23.930 --> 06:20:23.940 align:start position:0%
the person that has a chilling effect on
 
06:20:25.430 --> 06:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
voter confidence and that's why I'll be
 
06:20:27.708 --> 06:20:27.718 align:start position:0%
voting itl but it's not out of lack of
 
06:20:29.750 --> 06:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
concern for the same people that
 
06:20:37.250 --> 06:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:39.890 --> 06:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
06:20:42.010 --> 06:20:42.020 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:20:46.010 --> 06:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
let's call the role the motion is an
 
06:20:49.510 --> 06:20:49.520 align:start position:0%

10 to 10
 
06:21:54.120 --> 06:21:56.270 align:start position:0%
10 to 10
.

06:21:56.270 --> 06:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:00.170 --> 06:22:00.180 align:start position:0%
and the motion fails so this will be no
 
06:22:00.180 --> 06:22:02.628 align:start position:0%
and the motion fails so this will be no
recommendation

06:22:02.628 --> 06:22:02.638 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
06:22:06.770 --> 06:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:08.930 --> 06:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
representative Howard and representative
 
06:22:11.990 --> 06:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:13.730 --> 06:22:13.740 align:start position:0%
so and before I gavel the executive
 
06:22:15.110 --> 06:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
session I just want to point out
 
06:22:18.590 --> 06:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
something maybe not all of you know when
 
06:22:20.990 --> 06:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
I chaired transportation we created a
 
06:22:23.390 --> 06:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
program so that unhoused people could
 
06:22:26.930 --> 06:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
get ideas and licenses even with the
 
06:22:30.048 --> 06:22:30.058 align:start position:0%
address on it of an accredited shelter
 
06:22:31.730 --> 06:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
so if you've got people coming to you
 
06:22:34.010 --> 06:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
because they need help getting an ID and
 
06:22:36.830 --> 06:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
they're unhoused it's a good
 
06:22:39.350 --> 06:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to hook them up with support
 
06:22:41.150 --> 06:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
people that can maybe help them with
 
06:22:43.970 --> 06:22:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:46.250 --> 06:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
there's also a lot of other things that
 
06:22:49.310 --> 06:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
you can do to help them as was a
 
06:22:52.310 --> 06:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
legislator legislature's representative
 
06:22:56.708 --> 06:22:56.718 align:start position:0%
for four years on the governor's
 
06:22:59.208 --> 06:22:59.218 align:start position:0%
interagency Council on homelessness that
 
06:23:00.830 --> 06:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
was appointed by both Hassan and then
 
06:23:03.830 --> 06:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
sununu so there's a lot available in
 
06:23:05.330 --> 06:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
their biggest challenges that people
 
06:23:08.390 --> 06:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
don't send them to these agencies so
 
06:23:10.850 --> 06:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
maybe try to do that and they can
 
06:23:13.128 --> 06:23:13.138 align:start position:0%
absolutely get a license if they can
 
06:23:14.990 --> 06:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
drive or an ID and that's important to
 
06:23:16.910 --> 06:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
get a job and that's important to get
 
06:23:18.890 --> 06:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
housing and you know it just kind of
 
06:23:20.750 --> 06:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
Cascades from there
 
06:23:23.030 --> 06:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
and that's my sermon for the day and
 
06:23:24.770 --> 06:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
that closes the executive session on
 
06:23:34.910 --> 06:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:37.670 --> 06:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
good to go we'll open the executive
 
06:23:40.310 --> 06:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 484
 
06:23:42.288 --> 06:23:42.298 align:start position:0%
representative Quail is recognized for a
 
06:23:42.298 --> 06:23:43.128 align:start position:0%
representative Quail is recognized for a
motion

06:23:43.128 --> 06:23:43.138 align:start position:0%
motion
 
06:23:45.470 --> 06:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I move that the
 
06:23:49.490 --> 06:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
committee fined HB 484 in expedient to
 
06:23:57.470 --> 06:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:59.990 --> 06:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
family moves ICL and the Committee
 
06:24:01.910 --> 06:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
Member with the most letters in her name
 
06:24:04.190 --> 06:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
is the
 
06:24:04.200 --> 06:24:05.690 align:start position:0%
is the
subscribe

06:24:05.690 --> 06:24:05.700 align:start position:0%
subscribe
 
06:24:06.890 --> 06:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
for her all right would you like to
 
06:24:08.628 --> 06:24:08.638 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes I would thank
 
06:24:11.150 --> 06:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
06:24:12.948 --> 06:24:12.958 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony
 
06:24:15.530 --> 06:24:15.540 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing that the
 
06:24:17.150 --> 06:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
number of
 
06:24:18.948 --> 06:24:18.958 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots which have been
 
06:24:21.110 --> 06:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
employed the most recent general
 
06:24:23.990 --> 06:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
election was considerable considerably
 
06:24:28.490 --> 06:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
reduced from uh the height in 2020.
 
06:24:30.170 --> 06:24:30.180 align:start position:0%
which suggests to me that the workload
 
06:24:31.970 --> 06:24:31.980 align:start position:0%
involved in processing absentee ballots
 
06:24:35.628 --> 06:24:35.638 align:start position:0%
was also reduced and powering hopefully
 
06:24:38.390 --> 06:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
another pandemic type situation we can
 
06:24:40.730 --> 06:24:40.740 align:start position:0%
expect that to continue in the future
 
06:24:44.150 --> 06:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
so I see little benefit in opening the
 
06:24:46.610 --> 06:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
ballots the outer envelopes the absentee
 
06:24:48.590 --> 06:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
ballots earlier than is currently the
 
06:24:50.628 --> 06:24:50.638 align:start position:0%
practice on on Election Day
 
06:24:52.548 --> 06:24:52.558 align:start position:0%
I do however see
 
06:24:55.670 --> 06:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
an increased risk of ballots being
 
06:24:57.410 --> 06:24:57.420 align:start position:0%
mishandled absentee ballots being
 
06:25:00.890 --> 06:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
mishandled utter envelopes are opened
 
06:25:00.900 --> 06:25:02.650 align:start position:0%
mishandled utter envelopes are opened
sooner

06:25:02.650 --> 06:25:02.660 align:start position:0%
sooner
 
06:25:05.150 --> 06:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
the more we handle the ballots the more
 
06:25:07.670 --> 06:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
likelihood there is of mishandling and
 
06:25:10.670 --> 06:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
the subsequent confusion and chaos and
 
06:25:10.680 --> 06:25:11.930 align:start position:0%
the subsequent confusion and chaos and
drama

06:25:11.930 --> 06:25:11.940 align:start position:0%
drama
 
06:25:14.390 --> 06:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:25:18.048 --> 06:25:18.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:18.058 --> 06:25:19.850 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:25:19.850 --> 06:25:19.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:25:22.610 --> 06:25:22.620 align:start position:0%

06:27:17.030 --> 06:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
all right let's open the executive
 
06:27:19.070 --> 06:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 495.
 
06:27:21.350 --> 06:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
representative Brian's recognized for
 
06:27:26.590 --> 06:27:26.600 align:start position:0%

06:27:30.660 --> 06:27:37.190 align:start position:0%
 
Billy

06:27:37.190 --> 06:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:38.690 --> 06:27:38.700 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
06:27:41.628 --> 06:27:41.638 align:start position:0%
yes I I would like to speak to this I
 
06:27:46.430 --> 06:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:46.440 --> 06:27:47.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:27:47.030 --> 06:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:51.470 --> 06:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire voters are very
 
06:27:51.480 --> 06:27:53.890 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire voters are very
um

06:27:53.890 --> 06:27:53.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:58.310 --> 06:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
conscientious and careful and fill in
 
06:28:00.410 --> 06:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
their ballots very well
 
06:28:02.510 --> 06:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
there are also instructions on filling
 
06:28:06.110 --> 06:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
in your ballot at the polling place
 
06:28:10.548 --> 06:28:10.558 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to complicate things in
 
06:28:13.250 --> 06:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
a way that I don't feel is necessary
 
06:28:15.470 --> 06:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
some of the marks that were that are
 
06:28:15.480 --> 06:28:17.030 align:start position:0%
some of the marks that were that are
suggested

06:28:17.030 --> 06:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
suggested
 
06:28:17.040 --> 06:28:18.288 align:start position:0%
suggested
um

06:28:18.288 --> 06:28:18.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:28:21.948 --> 06:28:21.958 align:start position:0%
could that that the the bill the author
 
06:28:24.410 --> 06:28:24.420 align:start position:0%
says would be interpreted as a no Vote
 
06:28:27.110 --> 06:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
or a yes vote rather could be a no vote
 
06:28:30.890 --> 06:28:30.900 align:start position:0%
actually in my opinion such as a voting
 
06:28:32.390 --> 06:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
Target being filled in all the way and
 
06:28:34.670 --> 06:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
then x's on it
 
06:28:37.850 --> 06:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
those are cases where the voter really
 
06:28:39.830 --> 06:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
ought to get a new ballot and that kind
 
06:28:43.368 --> 06:28:43.378 align:start position:0%
of education should be increased to
 
06:28:45.650 --> 06:28:45.660 align:start position:0%
solve this issue if it's truly a problem
 
06:28:47.390 --> 06:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
but not
 
06:28:49.970 --> 06:28:49.980 align:start position:0%
this bill as it's written
 
06:28:51.530 --> 06:28:51.540 align:start position:0%
that's I don't feel that's the best way
 
06:28:53.270 --> 06:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
to solve
 
06:28:55.368 --> 06:28:55.378 align:start position:0%
a problem that's I find to be quite
 
06:29:01.490 --> 06:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:03.590 --> 06:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
06:29:03.600 --> 06:29:05.270 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
Kennedy

06:29:05.270 --> 06:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
Kennedy
 
06:29:08.270 --> 06:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think this bill uh
 
06:29:10.730 --> 06:29:10.740 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire was
 
06:29:13.490 --> 06:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
um he's only talking about recounts and
 
06:29:15.048 --> 06:29:15.058 align:start position:0%
I think he's only talking about ballots
 
06:29:16.670 --> 06:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
that are challenged
 
06:29:18.590 --> 06:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
and I think all he was trying to do was
 
06:29:21.230 --> 06:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
take some of the variability out of the
 
06:29:23.030 --> 06:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
individual judgments of the people
 
06:29:25.610 --> 06:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
looking at the ballot and narrow that
 
06:29:27.590 --> 06:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
down a little bit by giving guidelines
 
06:29:30.770 --> 06:29:30.780 align:start position:0%
these are not rules or you know
 
06:29:32.690 --> 06:29:32.700 align:start position:0%
the hard and fast
 
06:29:34.850 --> 06:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
so I you know maybe it's not that
 
06:29:37.190 --> 06:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
valuable but you know I didn't think it
 
06:29:40.670 --> 06:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:44.208 --> 06:29:44.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:46.490 --> 06:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
representative Handler thank you Mr
 
06:29:50.208 --> 06:29:50.218 align:start position:0%
chair uh uh yes so I agree this bill is
 
06:29:52.250 --> 06:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
not really needed
 
06:29:55.788 --> 06:29:55.798 align:start position:0%
um at the hearing this uh deputy
 
06:29:58.548 --> 06:29:58.558 align:start position:0%
secretary of state testified that the
 
06:30:00.890 --> 06:30:00.900 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State already has the
 
06:30:03.470 --> 06:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
authority to give guidance that we don't
 
06:30:05.628 --> 06:30:05.638 align:start position:0%
really need a law
 
06:30:05.638 --> 06:30:08.208 align:start position:0%
really need a law
um

06:30:08.208 --> 06:30:08.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:11.510 --> 06:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
as far as how to interpret the markings
 
06:30:13.310 --> 06:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
on the ballots
 
06:30:13.320 --> 06:30:14.690 align:start position:0%
on the ballots
so

06:30:14.690 --> 06:30:14.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:30:18.948 --> 06:30:18.958 align:start position:0%

well news action session on House Bill
 
06:32:11.390 --> 06:32:11.400 align:start position:0%

06:32:31.190 --> 06:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:34.010 --> 06:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
would like to speak to your motion
 
06:32:35.868 --> 06:32:35.878 align:start position:0%
well we know a lot of
 
06:32:38.030 --> 06:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
dirty tricks going on
 
06:32:38.040 --> 06:32:39.490 align:start position:0%
dirty tricks going on
um

06:32:39.490 --> 06:32:39.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:32:42.170 --> 06:32:42.180 align:start position:0%
I already tricked on down with signs
 
06:32:43.670 --> 06:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
we've seen them in the last election
 
06:32:49.310 --> 06:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
seen them in a lot of past elections uh
 
06:32:52.250 --> 06:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
this however may be a
 
06:32:54.590 --> 06:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
a problem with with the Court's First
 
06:32:55.970 --> 06:32:55.980 align:start position:0%
Amendment and so
 
06:32:57.410 --> 06:32:57.420 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
06:32:57.420 --> 06:32:58.670 align:start position:0%
I don't know
um

06:32:58.670 --> 06:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:33:02.030 --> 06:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
but we've seen you know like KKK Airline
 
06:33:05.570 --> 06:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
uh the candidate is against this when
 
06:33:08.170 --> 06:33:08.180 align:start position:0%
actually they're for it and and all that
 
06:33:10.610 --> 06:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
including a state senate race some years
 
06:33:13.190 --> 06:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
ago where the sign was up for
 
06:33:16.788 --> 06:33:16.798 align:start position:0%
so and so was Ford higher taxes and when
 
06:33:18.708 --> 06:33:18.718 align:start position:0%
actually wasn't and the sign's been left
 
06:33:22.310 --> 06:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
up for months so that's why I you know I
 
06:33:24.890 --> 06:33:24.900 align:start position:0%
put in the bill because of all the you
 
06:33:24.900 --> 06:33:25.910 align:start position:0%
put in the bill because of all the you
know

06:33:25.910 --> 06:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:33:28.310 --> 06:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
trying to keep things fair but anyway
 
06:33:33.470 --> 06:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:35.390 --> 06:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
06:33:37.190 --> 06:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I think
 
06:33:39.770 --> 06:33:39.780 align:start position:0%
representative boehm uh alluded to what
 
06:33:42.170 --> 06:33:42.180 align:start position:0%
my concern with this bill and that's the
 
06:33:44.330 --> 06:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
first amendment concerns I think that
 
06:33:47.810 --> 06:33:47.820 align:start position:0%
there could be the case where uh the
 
06:33:49.850 --> 06:33:49.860 align:start position:0%
signs could be used in a satirical uh
 
06:33:53.330 --> 06:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
Manner and in that instance if they're
 
06:33:56.208 --> 06:33:56.218 align:start position:0%
trying to provide uh information in a
 
06:33:58.250 --> 06:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
satirical format they should not be
 
06:34:03.288 --> 06:34:03.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:06.288 --> 06:34:06.298 align:start position:0%
representative Brian thank you I also
 
06:34:09.650 --> 06:34:09.660 align:start position:0%
have First Amendment concerns but what
 
06:34:11.570 --> 06:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
changes it for me with this bill is
 
06:34:14.208 --> 06:34:14.218 align:start position:0%
where it says it appears to be the
 
06:34:16.610 --> 06:34:16.620 align:start position:0%
candidates advertising that may be
 
06:34:19.610 --> 06:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
removed by the candidates so it's not
 
06:34:21.708 --> 06:34:21.718 align:start position:0%
just someone's opinion it's a hidden
 
06:34:25.190 --> 06:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
opinion it's an opinion that is meant to
 
06:34:27.708 --> 06:34:27.718 align:start position:0%
confuse voters I I don't I don't I don't
 
06:34:29.690 --> 06:34:29.700 align:start position:0%
like that that doesn't fit for me so I'm
 
06:34:30.708 --> 06:34:30.718 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
06:34:37.970 --> 06:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:40.430 --> 06:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
representative girl
 
06:34:43.128 --> 06:34:43.138 align:start position:0%
yeah to speak to the um appearance to be
 
06:34:44.868 --> 06:34:44.878 align:start position:0%
the candidates advertising
 
06:34:47.110 --> 06:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
um you know I mean we currently have
 
06:34:49.430 --> 06:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
parity in in the political world of all
 
06:34:51.708 --> 06:34:51.718 align:start position:0%
forms people dress up as their favorite
 
06:34:53.270 --> 06:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
or their least favorite candidate and
 
06:34:56.090 --> 06:34:56.100 align:start position:0%
make fun of them on late night TV
 
06:34:57.948 --> 06:34:57.958 align:start position:0%
um you know people write satirical
 
06:34:59.628 --> 06:34:59.638 align:start position:0%
letters to the editor there's many
 
06:35:01.430 --> 06:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
examples I could name
 
06:35:03.110 --> 06:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
um I do agree with
 
06:35:03.120 --> 06:35:04.010 align:start position:0%
um I do agree with
um

06:35:04.010 --> 06:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:35:06.048 --> 06:35:06.058 align:start position:0%
my colleagues who introduced and support
 
06:35:07.610 --> 06:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
this bill I don't think it's a good
 
06:35:09.170 --> 06:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
practice I don't think it's you know
 
06:35:12.170 --> 06:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
good campaigning um kind behavior
 
06:35:13.850 --> 06:35:13.860 align:start position:0%
um certainly not you know how I chose to
 
06:35:16.610 --> 06:35:16.620 align:start position:0%
run my campaign but unfortunately or you
 
06:35:17.990 --> 06:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
know fortunately we live in a country
 
06:35:20.510 --> 06:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
where the First Amendment does give us a
 
06:35:22.070 --> 06:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
lot of latitude when it comes to the
 
06:35:24.170 --> 06:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
type of speech we put out there and I
 
06:35:26.448 --> 06:35:26.458 align:start position:0%
think while it's not good practice and
 
06:35:28.250 --> 06:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
you know we should
 
06:35:30.470 --> 06:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
you know try and move away from those
 
06:35:32.090 --> 06:35:32.100 align:start position:0%
kinds of behaviors I think it's more
 
06:35:34.490 --> 06:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
important to avoid
 
06:35:34.500 --> 06:35:35.150 align:start position:0%
important to avoid
um

06:35:35.150 --> 06:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:35:37.010 --> 06:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
you know restrictions on freedom of
 
06:35:37.020 --> 06:35:39.770 align:start position:0%
you know restrictions on freedom of
speech

06:35:39.770 --> 06:35:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:41.930 --> 06:35:41.940 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
06:35:41.940 --> 06:35:43.368 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
Muirhead

06:35:43.368 --> 06:35:43.378 align:start position:0%
Muirhead
 
06:35:45.890 --> 06:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
thank you I think this there's a common
 
06:35:47.690 --> 06:35:47.700 align:start position:0%
sense to this bill but I'm concerned
 
06:35:50.030 --> 06:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
about the difficulty here of legislating
 
06:35:52.788 --> 06:35:52.798 align:start position:0%
common sense in this this qualification
 
06:35:54.530 --> 06:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
that you can remove advertising with
 
06:35:57.250 --> 06:35:57.260 align:start position:0%
your name on it if it appears to be your
 
06:35:57.260 --> 06:35:58.868 align:start position:0%
your name on it if it appears to be your
advertising

06:35:58.868 --> 06:35:58.878 align:start position:0%
advertising
 
06:36:01.070 --> 06:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
raises the question who gets a judge
 
06:36:02.150 --> 06:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
whether it appears to be your
 
06:36:03.830 --> 06:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
advertising so if there's a sign out
 
06:36:06.770 --> 06:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
saying your head hates kittens
 
06:36:08.810 --> 06:36:08.820 align:start position:0%
and I want I go and I pull all those
 
06:36:10.788 --> 06:36:10.798 align:start position:0%
signs it could be arguable that's
 
06:36:12.530 --> 06:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
obviously not your advertising it
 
06:36:13.430 --> 06:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't even appear to be your
 
06:36:14.750 --> 06:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
advertising because you would never put
 
06:36:17.628 --> 06:36:17.638 align:start position:0%
up signs that said that so so there's a
 
06:36:20.930 --> 06:36:20.940 align:start position:0%
I think a just a hard to write the rule
 
06:36:25.730 --> 06:36:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:25.740 --> 06:36:27.708 align:start position:0%
 
representative

06:36:27.708 --> 06:36:27.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:36:30.470 --> 06:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I sympathize
 
06:36:32.690 --> 06:36:32.700 align:start position:0%
deeply with the aggravation and
 
06:36:34.970 --> 06:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
frustration that can be caused by the
 
06:36:36.650 --> 06:36:36.660 align:start position:0%
type of advertising we're discussing
 
06:36:36.660 --> 06:36:38.030 align:start position:0%
type of advertising we're discussing
here

06:36:38.030 --> 06:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:36:41.090 --> 06:36:41.100 align:start position:0%
however I believe that in a time when it
 
06:36:44.208 --> 06:36:44.218 align:start position:0%
seems people are frequently
 
06:36:47.690 --> 06:36:47.700 align:start position:0%
quote canceled unquote from participal
 
06:36:51.170 --> 06:36:51.180 align:start position:0%
participation in Civil Society
 
06:36:53.930 --> 06:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
that we just because of speech that some
 
06:36:56.628 --> 06:36:56.638 align:start position:0%
found offensive that we need to draw a
 
06:36:58.868 --> 06:36:58.878 align:start position:0%
bright line here
 
06:37:02.208 --> 06:37:02.218 align:start position:0%
of no compromise with our Free Speech
 
06:37:04.970 --> 06:37:04.980 align:start position:0%
rights that are guaranteed by the First
 
06:37:08.690 --> 06:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:12.170 --> 06:37:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:36.770 --> 06:37:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:38.690 --> 06:37:38.700 align:start position:0%
I love it when we write rules for things
 
06:37:42.230 --> 06:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
that all of us do that are illegal but
 
06:37:45.948 --> 06:37:45.958 align:start position:0%
so this bill only applies to
 
06:37:48.650 --> 06:37:48.660 align:start position:0%
political advertising on public property
 
06:37:51.288 --> 06:37:51.298 align:start position:0%
like when we all pepper the size of
 
06:37:54.170 --> 06:37:54.180 align:start position:0%
State highways I'll snap without getting
 
06:37:56.030 --> 06:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
the abutting property owner's permission
 
06:37:59.448 --> 06:37:59.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:01.010 --> 06:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
and then we have the nerve to complain
 
06:38:02.628 --> 06:38:02.638 align:start position:0%
when somebody takes those signs that
 
06:38:04.310 --> 06:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
were placed illegally and we've even
 
06:38:06.048 --> 06:38:06.058 align:start position:0%
written in protections that other people
 
06:38:08.030 --> 06:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
can take the signs only the municipality
 
06:38:16.128 --> 06:38:16.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:18.470 --> 06:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay so the way this is written the idea
 
06:38:20.690 --> 06:38:20.700 align:start position:0%
is it's fake advertising I mean
 
06:38:22.610 --> 06:38:22.620 align:start position:0%
political advertising on public property
 
06:38:24.890 --> 06:38:24.900 align:start position:0%
bearing the candidate's name and that
 
06:38:26.930 --> 06:38:26.940 align:start position:0%
appears to be the candidates advertising
 
06:38:26.940 --> 06:38:28.430 align:start position:0%
appears to be the candidates advertising
so

06:38:28.430 --> 06:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:38:30.048 --> 06:38:30.058 align:start position:0%
however you feel about kittens you
 
06:38:31.490 --> 06:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
wouldn't admit it publicly so that
 
06:38:35.350 --> 06:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:39.288 --> 06:38:39.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:40.190 --> 06:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know why we're worried about
 
06:38:42.070 --> 06:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
science so much because the best example
 
06:38:45.350 --> 06:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
was uh
 
06:38:48.230 --> 06:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
three or four presidential Cycles ago
 
06:38:48.240 --> 06:38:49.368 align:start position:0%
three or four presidential Cycles ago
when

06:38:49.368 --> 06:38:49.378 align:start position:0%
when
 
06:38:52.368 --> 06:38:52.378 align:start position:0%
Republicans put out ads
 
06:38:53.990 --> 06:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
that looks like they were coming from
 
06:38:56.990 --> 06:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
democratic candidates to
 
06:38:59.270 --> 06:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
skew the output out
 
06:39:02.448 --> 06:39:02.458 align:start position:0%
put of the primary and then they said
 
06:39:04.010 --> 06:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
huh that was a good idea and I think did
 
06:39:06.048 --> 06:39:06.058 align:start position:0%
it with a lot of other offices and the
 
06:39:07.910 --> 06:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
last one but Democrats that it's
 
06:39:10.128 --> 06:39:10.138 align:start position:0%
Republicans were all guilty every
 
06:39:13.250 --> 06:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
anybody get up on a pedestal
 
06:39:17.750 --> 06:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:19.128 --> 06:39:19.138 align:start position:0%
I don't know it's probably a lawyer
 
06:39:21.708 --> 06:39:21.718 align:start position:0%
Reform Act but I think I understand what
 
06:39:23.448 --> 06:39:23.458 align:start position:0%
he's trying to do and I've seen examples
 
06:39:27.410 --> 06:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
of it if you're a Republican
 
06:39:29.628 --> 06:39:29.638 align:start position:0%
representative Stephen Smith voted for
 
06:39:32.448 --> 06:39:32.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:34.910 --> 06:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
we've seen door hangers that do that and
 
06:39:36.708 --> 06:39:36.718 align:start position:0%
that's not public property so it
 
06:39:38.208 --> 06:39:38.218 align:start position:0%
wouldn't matter
 
06:39:38.218 --> 06:39:39.048 align:start position:0%
wouldn't matter
um

06:39:39.048 --> 06:39:39.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:39:40.490 --> 06:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
I don't know what we've done to the
 
06:39:41.930 --> 06:39:41.940 align:start position:0%
other side but I'm sure somebody did
 
06:39:41.940 --> 06:39:43.430 align:start position:0%
other side but I'm sure somebody did
something

06:39:43.430 --> 06:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
something
 
06:39:45.230 --> 06:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
I don't know I like the idea of trying
 
06:39:47.570 --> 06:39:47.580 align:start position:0%
to stop it so
 
06:39:50.868 --> 06:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem ambiguous to me
 
06:39:55.490 --> 06:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:57.230 --> 06:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan
 
06:39:58.970 --> 06:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:40:01.330 --> 06:40:01.340 align:start position:0%
um the part for me that appears
 
06:40:05.570 --> 06:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
ambiguous is actually the word appears
 
06:40:07.548 --> 06:40:07.558 align:start position:0%
um that appears to be the candidates
 
06:40:07.558 --> 06:40:09.230 align:start position:0%
um that appears to be the candidates
advertising

06:40:09.230 --> 06:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
advertising
 
06:40:13.430 --> 06:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
who decides what appears to be the
 
06:40:16.690 --> 06:40:16.700 align:start position:0%
candidates advertising and how do you
 
06:40:19.548 --> 06:40:19.558 align:start position:0%
determine if the candidate
 
06:40:24.048 --> 06:40:24.058 align:start position:0%
is accurately interpreting the sign to
 
06:40:28.250 --> 06:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
be in their own likeness
 
06:40:31.788 --> 06:40:31.798 align:start position:0%
in their own advertising likeness
 
06:40:35.090 --> 06:40:35.100 align:start position:0%
it is a little bit ambiguous and you may
 
06:40:37.490 --> 06:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
run into a situation where a candidate
 
06:40:37.500 --> 06:40:38.448 align:start position:0%
run into a situation where a candidate
is

06:40:38.448 --> 06:40:38.458 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:40:41.810 --> 06:40:41.820 align:start position:0%
simply just does not like a sign that
 
06:40:44.810 --> 06:40:44.820 align:start position:0%
has their name on it and removes it even
 
06:40:49.670 --> 06:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:54.490 --> 06:40:54.500 align:start position:0%
look like their own personal advertising
 
06:40:57.650 --> 06:40:57.660 align:start position:0%
so that ambiguity
 
06:40:59.990 --> 06:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
is problematic while I understand the
 
06:41:02.448 --> 06:41:02.458 align:start position:0%
intention behind this bill
 
06:41:02.458 --> 06:41:03.048 align:start position:0%
intention behind this bill
um

06:41:03.048 --> 06:41:03.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:41:05.150 --> 06:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
the language here
 
06:41:07.570 --> 06:41:07.580 align:start position:0%
I think is enough of a problem
 
06:41:11.690 --> 06:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
and the First Amendment free speech
 
06:41:14.208 --> 06:41:14.218 align:start position:0%
part of it is a little bit of a problem
 
06:41:17.930 --> 06:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
too so I would urge my colleagues to
 
06:41:19.730 --> 06:41:19.740 align:start position:0%
vote against the ought to pass motion
 
06:41:22.010 --> 06:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:41:22.020 --> 06:41:23.208 align:start position:0%
thank you
president

06:41:23.208 --> 06:41:23.218 align:start position:0%
president
 
06:41:25.250 --> 06:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
aye representative
 
06:41:27.350 --> 06:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so here we're talking
 
06:41:30.470 --> 06:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
about political advertising which is
 
06:41:31.670 --> 06:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
very clear
 
06:41:33.910 --> 06:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
um about like how that will be
 
06:41:36.110 --> 06:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
conveyed to the public and there is a
 
06:41:39.170 --> 06:41:39.180 align:start position:0%
paid for uh byline at the very bottom of
 
06:41:40.190 --> 06:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
the sign I mean you could put it
 
06:41:41.570 --> 06:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
anywhere you want but it has to be on
 
06:41:43.368 --> 06:41:43.378 align:start position:0%
there so if you really have a doubt
 
06:41:45.530 --> 06:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
we're talking about public property you
 
06:41:47.448 --> 06:41:47.458 align:start position:0%
could walk up to it see who it's paid
 
06:41:50.510 --> 06:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
for by and go that route I don't see why
 
06:41:52.490 --> 06:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
we would carve out an exception this
 
06:41:54.048 --> 06:41:54.058 align:start position:0%
would be the only case that I'm aware of
 
06:41:56.650 --> 06:41:56.660 align:start position:0%
where you could go and legally take
 
06:41:59.208 --> 06:41:59.218 align:start position:0%
political advertising I I just don't
 
06:42:01.990 --> 06:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
think it's appropriate
 
06:42:05.030 --> 06:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
06:42:07.368 --> 06:42:07.378 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh if you all
 
06:42:09.350 --> 06:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
entertain me in this scenario let's say
 
06:42:11.930 --> 06:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
hypothetically I decided to run for
 
06:42:15.530 --> 06:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
state senate in a few years and one in
 
06:42:18.230 --> 06:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
an opponent of mine decides to put out
 
06:42:20.690 --> 06:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
in a sign before I've created any
 
06:42:22.628 --> 06:42:22.638 align:start position:0%
campaign literature that says
 
06:42:25.910 --> 06:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative Howard you know let's use
 
06:42:27.948 --> 06:42:27.958 align:start position:0%
the income tax for example voted against
 
06:42:31.730 --> 06:42:31.740 align:start position:0%
income tax if I decided to
 
06:42:34.970 --> 06:42:34.980 align:start position:0%
emulate that political advertising would
 
06:42:36.770 --> 06:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
then I be given the right to remove
 
06:42:39.830 --> 06:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
their uh false advertising if I did not
 
06:42:43.730 --> 06:42:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:45.650 --> 06:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
the specifics of your question would be
 
06:42:47.150 --> 06:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
why would you think it was your
 
06:42:49.190 --> 06:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
political advertising it referred to you
 
06:42:51.350 --> 06:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
in the third person
 
06:42:52.788 --> 06:42:52.798 align:start position:0%
again I mean I was throwing a
 
06:42:54.948 --> 06:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
hypothetical out there as the you know
 
06:43:01.788 --> 06:43:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:06.288 --> 06:43:06.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:06.298 --> 06:43:09.048 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:43:09.048 --> 06:43:09.058 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:43:10.430 --> 06:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
well I don't know what you're gonna do
 
06:43:11.810 --> 06:43:11.820 align:start position:0%
if you pass this though just think how
 
06:43:13.670 --> 06:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
busy the Court's gonna be and I want to
 
06:43:15.530 --> 06:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
watch that
 
06:43:18.530 --> 06:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
so the motion is ought to pass
 
06:43:22.128 --> 06:43:22.138 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 590 call it representative
 
06:43:25.850 --> 06:43:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:28.548 --> 06:43:28.558 align:start position:0%
representative boom yes
 
06:43:31.430 --> 06:43:31.440 align:start position:0%

representative wood no
 
06:43:54.048 --> 06:43:54.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:57.948 --> 06:43:57.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:01.490 --> 06:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
representative Ward no
 
06:44:04.788 --> 06:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
representative Hamer no
 
06:44:06.650 --> 06:44:06.660 align:start position:0%

representative Hamlet
no

06:44:08.810 --> 06:44:08.820 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:44:12.230 --> 06:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:15.650 --> 06:44:15.660 align:start position:0%
representative Bay no
 
06:44:18.410 --> 06:44:18.420 align:start position:0%

representative Howard no
 
06:44:26.390 --> 06:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer no

representative Smith
 
06:44:28.080 --> 06:44:31.310 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
yes

06:44:31.310 --> 06:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:35.150 --> 06:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
that is one two three four five years
 
06:44:37.788 --> 06:44:37.798 align:start position:0%
and 15 Nays
 
06:44:40.368 --> 06:44:40.378 align:start position:0%
and the motion fails
 
06:44:42.350 --> 06:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
looking forward to the political ad I'm
 
06:44:44.030 --> 06:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
representative Stephen Smith and I'm
 
06:44:49.490 --> 06:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:49.500 --> 06:44:52.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:44:52.910 --> 06:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:54.890 --> 06:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
somebody's got to do it representative
 
06:44:54.900 --> 06:44:56.330 align:start position:0%
somebody's got to do it representative
lame

06:44:56.330 --> 06:44:56.340 align:start position:0%
lame
 
06:44:59.288 --> 06:44:59.298 align:start position:0%
foreign I would like to remind
 
06:45:01.670 --> 06:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative Muirhead
 
06:45:03.170 --> 06:45:03.180 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry what
 
06:45:05.030 --> 06:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
I would like to remind representative
 
06:45:06.410 --> 06:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
Muirhead because I don't want to write
 
06:45:07.730 --> 06:45:07.740 align:start position:0%
another report
 
06:45:07.740 --> 06:45:14.708 align:start position:0%
another report
[Laughter]

06:45:14.708 --> 06:45:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:17.030 --> 06:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
what does that make a motion please to
 
06:45:20.448 --> 06:45:20.458 align:start position:0%
itl because I'm your head moves ICL we
 
06:45:26.990 --> 06:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:29.868 --> 06:45:29.878 align:start position:0%
you want to talk about it
 
06:45:32.270 --> 06:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
I I really appreciate the debate to this
 
06:45:33.470 --> 06:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
point no need to add to it thank you
 
06:45:39.470 --> 06:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:44.030 --> 06:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
the motion is an expedience to legislate
 
06:45:46.128 --> 06:45:46.138 align:start position:0%
on house
 
06:45:46.138 --> 06:45:49.930 align:start position:0%
on house
bill

06:45:49.930 --> 06:45:49.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:52.910 --> 06:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
590s no I was letting her finish filling
 
06:45:54.708 --> 06:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
out the form it's like speaking really
 
06:45:54.718 --> 06:45:55.910 align:start position:0%
out the form it's like speaking really
slowly

06:45:55.910 --> 06:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
slowly
