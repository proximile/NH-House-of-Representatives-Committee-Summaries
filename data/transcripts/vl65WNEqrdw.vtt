22968 uh thank you chair um yes so um
 
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
you know we're a little bit of History
 
00:11:41.949 --> 00:11:41.959 align:start position:0%
here um there were two bills that were
 
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
um that were that had a lot in common
 
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
last uh last year 205 and 398 205 had a
 
00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
section on well testing for new wells um
 
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
as well as notification in um in
 
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
purchase and sales agreements 398 had um
 
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
a similar notification in purchase and
 
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
sales agreements as well as a disclosure
 
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
on the um in the the um real estate
 
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
disclosure forms um and uh what the
 
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
committee decided to do at the time was
 
00:12:19.069 --> 00:12:19.079 align:start position:0%
take 205 to the floor with I recall a
 
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
slight Amendment um and uh hold back 398
 
00:12:28.189 --> 00:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
um uh 205 was tabled and uh died on the
 
00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:33.519 align:start position:0%
table um and 398 was um as I mentioned
 
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
it had the um it had an a a notification
 
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:41.240 align:start position:0%
in the purchase and sale as well as the
 
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
disclosure talking to the prime sponsor
 
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
um the disclosure uh uh which was the
 
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
most problematic portion of 398 because
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
it talked about um a notice that goes to
 
00:12:59.389 --> 00:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
um by Dees to um to people with property
 
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
within 500 feet I think it's 500 feet um
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
of um of a well that's been that has
 
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
tested with pasas um there my
 
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
recollection um is the dees was a bit
 
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with that language and um
 
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
and my understanding to speaking with
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsors that wasn't really
 
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
the intent that wasn't the focus of the
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
bill um there's also been some
 
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
discussions with um the Realtors as well
 
00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
as the um Dees on determining what
 
00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:33.150 align:start position:0%
as the um Dees on determining what
language

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:33.160 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
um is meets the intent of 398 this past
 
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
notification intent um at while not um
 
00:13:46.509 --> 00:13:46.519 align:start position:0%
while retaining the portions of the
 
00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
existing notifications that are
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
important to many people across the
 
00:13:54.749 --> 00:13:54.759 align:start position:0%
state as an example um one of the things
 
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
that the the notification in 205 tried
 
00:13:59.870 --> 00:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
to change was really dramatically change
 
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
the the notification to talk about
 
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
testing in general of wellwater and some
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
members of this um of the broader uh
 
00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:11.839 align:start position:0%
resources uh committee um were concerned
 
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
about the removal of the specific
 
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
arsonic Clause from that taking this
 
00:14:20.949 --> 00:14:20.959 align:start position:0%
input having discussed with um Dees the
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor um the Realtors through
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
their representative um we uh that
 
00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:30.279 align:start position:0%
that's that was the so of the derivation
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
of this amendment which as you see is um
 
00:14:35.949 --> 00:14:35.959 align:start position:0%
very similar to the existing
 
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
notifications with a past Clause the
 
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
past Clause um is I honestly can't
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
remember the exact um uh pedigree of it
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
you know what the exact source of this
 
00:14:51.069 --> 00:14:51.079 align:start position:0%
was but it takes into account portion um
 
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
language from 205 language from 398 it
 
00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
was um vetted um feel free we can ask
 
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
you but I did run it by Dees and uh got
 
00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
some some some wording changes on it
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
which is what you see here and I also
 
00:15:10.189 --> 00:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
sent this previously um twice with two
 
00:15:12.749 --> 00:15:12.759 align:start position:0%
different versions to the Realtors as
 
00:15:15.389 --> 00:15:15.399 align:start position:0%
far as I know um the the parties
 
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
involved so that's the dees the Realtors
 
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
um and the prime sponsor are comfortable
 
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
with the language that we have here and
 
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's where this uh Amendment
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you representative Darby it
 
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
sounds like a a lot of work has gone
 
00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
into the amendment um I'd like to
 
00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Healey to
 
00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:39.160 align:start position:0%
present some information that he brought
 
00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
in before the
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
hearing yeah um the only thing that I
 
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
would want to add on this is at the end
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
of that statement provide is or provide
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
test results for the well testing within
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
the last three years because if they've
 
00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
already tested their Wells and they're
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
giving that information they already
 
00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.069 align:start position:0%
giving that information they already
have

00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:16:04.749 --> 00:16:04.759 align:start position:0%
it Go representative
 
00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:07.720 align:start position:0%
Darby um so this um just to be clear
 
00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
this is not the disclosure this is just
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
the notification that says we suggest
 
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
that you test through well there there's
 
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
no requirement for this there's no
 
00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:17.319 align:start position:0%
there's no action required this is
 
00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:19.519 align:start position:0%
basically the the goal if I understand
 
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:21.560 align:start position:0%
from the prime sponsor perspective and
 
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
definitely my personal goal is um pasas
 
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
awareness um P or uh past has been
 
00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
detected in I'll use the word unhealthy
 
00:16:34.309 --> 00:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
levels thees has slightly different
 
00:16:35.949 --> 00:16:35.959 align:start position:0%
language um throughout the state
 
00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839 align:start position:0%
particularly in Southern New Hampshire
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
um a lot of people don't know that it's
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
in their well water today um they do
 
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
know because of disclosures and other um
 
00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
uh I'd say other um advertising me that
 
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
um Wells can contain radon and Arsenic
 
00:16:55.309 --> 00:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
and lead and things that can be tested
 
00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
and are fre commonly tested for the
 
00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:00.680 align:start position:0%
purpose of this is to to say um past
 
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
does exist in a lot of places and to be
 
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
safe you should test but there is no
 
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
mandate at all and there's no
 
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:09.640 align:start position:0%
requirement and so that's why um I
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
definitely you know I I'd like to hear
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
what the other stakeholders say about
 
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
that but I I'm not sure about the the
 
00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
need for an action in in terms of the
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
notification I'm not talking about the
 
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
action if they I'm just saying if they
 
00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
have the test that they should come
 
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
forward with that test the is testing
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
all over the southern part of the state
 
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
if they've tested my well when they're
 
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
so in the house if you want you should
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
G yes I'm having my water tested for the
 
00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
second time by St gain but anyway uh so
 
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
far I've been okay but if I were to buy
 
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
a house you know sometimes you say I'm I
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
want to have the house what is that
 
00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:03.320 align:start position:0%
thing inspected by the inspectors and
 
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes you make a deal with the
 
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
people who are selling the house to have
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
that done who pays for it Etc I I would
 
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
think that with your concern couldn't
 
00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
you make a deal with the realtor to say
 
00:18:18.669 --> 00:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
test for pfas or all these things and do
 
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
that as part of your you know mandate he
 
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to make it a mandate and I
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
agree with no mandate I mean but this no
 
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't be a mandate because you
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
don't have to have your house inspected
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
either but you're buying as you know
 
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
it's the same idea it's just gee maybe
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
I'll make that part of the
 
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
negotiations you know so it's up to the
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
person to figure out all these things I
 
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
guess because some people might not want
 
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
to pay for it but that's not mandatory
 
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
and it's just letting them know that
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
they might want to get it done somehow
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
that's just my
 
00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
thought thank you for that um input I'm
 
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:56.200 align:start position:0%
going to recognize representative
 
00:18:58.909 --> 00:18:58.919 align:start position:0%
mchu thank you madam chair represent
 
00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
Derby thanks for the work on this this
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
is this is great after collaborating on
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
205 oh by the way I I don't think it's
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
actually dead on the table I think it's
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
still on the table so we it's laate on
 
00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
the table so I think technically we
 
00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
could bring it off the table as a as a
 
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
full body couldn't we uh it wouldn't be
 
00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:19.480 align:start position:0%
I mean it' be difficult but I think it's
 
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
possible is it maybe it takes it twoth
 
00:19:25.149 --> 00:19:25.159 align:start position:0%
thirs so it's on so it's not dead yet
 
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
just I
 
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
mean you're right it's good but it will
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
be in a minute no I'm just kidding sorry
 
00:19:33.149 --> 00:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
if you're Monty Python fan you might get
 
00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
that a very obscure reference um
 
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:38.440 align:start position:0%
represent of Healey the
 
00:19:43.149 --> 00:19:43.159 align:start position:0%
um the and we ghou also the a disclosure
 
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
of test results I fundamentally agree
 
00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
with but they can do it already so I
 
00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
don't know if we need to put it in here
 
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
and they can you can also have your
 
00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
water tested as part of an inspection
 
00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
like you could have your septic tested
 
00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:57.640 align:start position:0%
or anything else so my preference
 
00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:00.919 align:start position:0%
probably would be go with this amendment
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
and and just leave it off mainly so we
 
00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
don't have to redraft another amendment
 
00:20:06.909 --> 00:20:06.919 align:start position:0%
and it's already possible and we don't
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
want it to get construed as something
 
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
more than it is um this just adds a nice
 
00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:17.559 align:start position:0%
clear um passage which is similar to
 
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
what I think is on DS website if not
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
identical um I'd be curious to hear from
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
DS2 just to confirm but I think it's
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
identical so the Realtors are probably
 
00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
okay with it it's just like the list of
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
things that that we add yeah so ad them
 
00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
yeah okay um so just adds to the list
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
and it's good good public policy
 
00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
especially for those of us down where
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
all the red dots
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
are so um can we hear from the prime
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
sponsor to whoever believe is here
 
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely what I from gallery or what I
 
00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
thought I would do is go around the room
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
and everyone on the subcommittee if they
 
00:20:57.549 --> 00:20:57.559 align:start position:0%
want or not or who's just present as far
 
00:20:59.470 --> 00:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
as represent resentatives go and then
 
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
we'll call people people up to um answer
 
00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.230 align:start position:0%
we'll call people people up to um answer
our

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:08.559 align:start position:0%
questions representative Rulo did you
 
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
in thank you I know I'm over here uh the
 
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
only thing I want to I want to wait
 
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
until I hear from everyone else that I
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
want to find out what exactly is the
 
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
ramifications of this what are what's
 
00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
what exists now what changes might have
 
00:21:34.149 --> 00:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:37.240 align:start position:0%
made and how it
 
00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
affects the realtor and the uh uh and
 
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.230 align:start position:0%
affects the realtor and the uh uh and
the

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
administration I think I think you did
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
but I want to hear from them too
 
00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative Rulo
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
representative wolf do you have comments
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.039 --> 00:22:03.789 align:start position:0%
 
we

00:22:03.789 --> 00:22:03.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
I don't have pink card so I think I want
 
00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
to do is call up the prime sponsor
 
00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:11.720 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas representative
 
00:22:15.549 --> 00:22:15.559 align:start position:0%
Thomas um if you want to have a seat and
 
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
we'll thank you have some questions
 
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
answered thank you madam chair um I have
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
worked with representative Derby on this
 
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
and in I agree with it I would have
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
liked to have seen T in be mandatory but
 
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
I will settle for this which is just
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
um awareness of pasas which I think is
 
00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:38.360 align:start position:0%
the is really important and is a good
 
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
step you know I I agree with this three
 
00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:44.559 align:start position:0%
minor minor things about the amendment I
 
00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
don't even think it's enough to hold it
 
00:22:52.029 --> 00:22:52.039 align:start position:0%
back on line nine um the addition and
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
past um I would just put chemicals after
 
00:22:58.909 --> 00:22:58.919 align:start position:0%
that to um to drive home the point that
 
00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:00.559 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about substance well
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about um products like
 
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
gortex or anything like that we're
 
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
talking about pfast
 
00:23:10.029 --> 00:23:10.039 align:start position:0%
chemicals um in line 32 just to be
 
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
consistent instead of substances I would
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
also put
 
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
chemicals because again we're talking
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
about the chemicals and not necessarily
 
00:23:23.149 --> 00:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
um substances in on page two on line
 
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
five just I used to be a tech writer for
 
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
digital Equipment Corporation passive
 
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
versus active the Laboratories measure
 
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
past levels it's not that they can
 
00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
measure again that's a that's a really
 
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
minor editorial thing um and with regard
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
to the the previous testing point that
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative Healey made um I will use
 
00:23:48.269 --> 00:23:48.279 align:start position:0%
our well as an example we tested our
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
well in
 
00:23:52.269 --> 00:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
2016 the levels were high enough that we
 
00:23:54.029 --> 00:23:54.039 align:start position:0%
had to shut our well down we could no
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
longer use the water for drinking we had
 
00:23:59.669 --> 00:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
it retested in 2021 and the results were
 
00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
incredibly higher so had we stopped at
 
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
2016 and used those testing results for
 
00:24:10.029 --> 00:24:10.039 align:start position:0%
the sale of our house it would have
 
00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
indicated a far lower level than what
 
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
was actually there so um that's just
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
something to be aware
 
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
representative other members have
 
00:24:28.269 --> 00:24:28.279 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Thomas
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
representative M thank you madam chair
 
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
good morning representative Thomas um so
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
fundamentally you're okay with this with
 
00:24:38.909 --> 00:24:38.919 align:start position:0%
possibly fixing
 
00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
the I'm I'm actually not sure about line
 
00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
five uh on page two because I think it
 
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
implies that the the possibility of
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
measuring that they might not always be
 
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
able to measure I think that's why it's
 
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
the can we could change it to could also
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
a writer so I get it's not a hill I'm
 
00:24:57.549 --> 00:24:57.559 align:start position:0%
going to die on it's a net well do you
 
00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
think it makes is it impactful enough to
 
00:25:01.389 --> 00:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
change it I'm fussy about this language
 
00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:04.360 align:start position:0%
too no it's it's it's passive versus
 
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
active and it still gets the point
 
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
across so yeah I would not hold up
 
00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
anything for that at all and as far as
 
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
the general further question thank you
 
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
please go ahead thanks for just having a
 
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
dialogue um the uh as far as the the
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
generally accepted usage of these terms
 
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
using chemicals versus substances that
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
actually does sound fairly important
 
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
what do you what's your opinion on
 
00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:37.559 align:start position:0%
this well and again because um as you
 
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
know from March um uh past substances
 
00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
could include clothing carpet it yeah
 
00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
right so this would just we're focusing
 
00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
on the actual chemicals um and right now
 
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we only measure for
 
00:25:55.149 --> 00:25:55.159 align:start position:0%
pest chemicals so um is that important
 
00:25:56.909 --> 00:25:56.919 align:start position:0%
to put in here I know I've had blood
 
00:25:59.310 --> 00:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
work where I've had had 40 past
 
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
chemicals measured in my blood so are we
 
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
are we going to state that only the four
 
00:26:09.389 --> 00:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
that we measure in New Hampshire are are
 
00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:12.039 align:start position:0%
enough for this or are we going to just
 
00:26:14.029 --> 00:26:14.039 align:start position:0%
leave it as a pfast
 
00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
panel mean since it's since it's
 
00:26:18.269 --> 00:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
fundamentally a notification which we're
 
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
trying as good public policy trying to
 
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
encourage people go figure out if you
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
have contaminants or
 
00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
not maybe substances is
 
00:26:30.389 --> 00:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
it's not so bad
 
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
um I know I would ask the questions like
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
what about the carpet or the awning or I
 
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
don't know you know pick pick something
 
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
else um representative mchu my
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
understanding is that those things get
 
00:26:47.789 --> 00:26:47.799 align:start position:0%
detected um one of the things that we're
 
00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:50.039 align:start position:0%
discovering now is that the pumps and
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
Wells contain past themselves and those
 
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
break down over time so we really want
 
00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
to just name those substances and I
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
think there a really you know I am
 
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely on board with having um a
 
00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.190 align:start position:0%
absolutely on board with having um a
statement

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.830 align:start position:0%
statement
that

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:11.149 --> 00:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
includes exactly what you were talking
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
about and so that we have all of the
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
past chemicals I don't think we need to
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
delineate them here but I think that's a
 
00:27:19.149 --> 00:27:19.159 align:start position:0%
good question for people that are
 
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
well representative
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
Darby thank you madam chair um I I'm
 
00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:33.320 align:start position:0%
very um I'm not comfortable with
 
00:27:36.029 --> 00:27:36.039 align:start position:0%
changing the word substances if we look
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
at the EPA past site it says per it says
 
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:43.240 align:start position:0%
exactly what's after the colon poly and
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
per it says per and poly FL flu alkaline
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
substances P if you look at the dees
 
00:27:54.669 --> 00:27:54.679 align:start position:0%
site for pasas um welcome to the uh Dees
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
past response website it says per and
 
00:28:00.029 --> 00:28:00.039 align:start position:0%
poly floral alkaline substances pasas
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
like this is this is the language
 
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
exactly on the dees I'm not sure we want
 
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
to come up with a different term person
 
00:28:06.509 --> 00:28:06.519 align:start position:0%
that that's what we were hoping to find
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
out I think that's
 
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
great that's a very good argument and if
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
that's if that's the case then I would
 
00:28:15.909 --> 00:28:15.919 align:start position:0%
simply suggest on line nine you have
 
00:28:15.919 --> 00:28:17.870 align:start position:0%
simply suggest on line nine you have
past

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:20.519 align:start position:0%
substances just to identify again it's
 
00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
not a killer you know it's it's just
 
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
it's the tech writer in me that's trying
 
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
so what you're saying representative um
 
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
is that on line nine we would put
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
chemicals no I'm saying now on line 32
 
00:28:45.389 --> 00:28:45.399 align:start position:0%
keep substances if that's the way it's
 
00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
used at the EPA and Dees I'm fine with
 
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
that however to make it um match on line
 
00:28:53.509 --> 00:28:53.519 align:start position:0%
nine I would use past
 
00:28:59.549 --> 00:28:59.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to acknowledge that
 
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
representative rang is here and I want
 
00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
to ask if you know when we came in
 
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative rung what we did was went
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
around the room and people started
 
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
talking about where we're starting in
 
00:29:13.389 --> 00:29:13.399 align:start position:0%
terms of legislators with working on
 
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
this bill um and representative Thomas
 
00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
has just come up and we've just started
 
00:29:22.149 --> 00:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
questions any comments or contributions
 
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
about the amendment or I just I just
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
have one one
 
00:29:34.029 --> 00:29:34.039 align:start position:0%
concern I don't want to get
 
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
beyond the what we do now as far as
 
00:29:40.269 --> 00:29:40.279 align:start position:0%
testing I mean every now and then every
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
now and then all the time we're having
 
00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:46.360 align:start position:0%
bills come in here about testing uh for
 
00:29:51.029 --> 00:29:51.039 align:start position:0%
PES that are not part of the list that
 
00:29:53.509 --> 00:29:53.519 align:start position:0%
know the the big four that we that we
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
actually are in statute or that are in
 
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
that we we test for and I don't want
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
this to be construed at all as requiring
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
that we start testing for stuff that out
 
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
without having gone through the proper
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh proper uh channels I don't I don't
 
00:30:16.509 --> 00:30:16.519 align:start position:0%
want to go big beyond what we do now
 
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to put inadvertently put that
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
statute um so for coming from my
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
clarification um what you're saying is
 
00:30:30.269 --> 00:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
that you don't want a testing
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
mandate well yeah well that's that's
 
00:30:36.669 --> 00:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
something else yes this is not a mandate
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
this is just a notification of people
 
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
people that hey folks it's out there and
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
we consider yourself
 
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:48.559 align:start position:0%
warned and that's it exactly is that
 
00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
what that that's the intent of this uh
 
00:30:54.909 --> 00:30:54.919 align:start position:0%
of this uh Amendment uh yeah yes it that
 
00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
is the intent of the amendment and um
 
00:30:59.710 --> 00:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
when we think about this bill came into
 
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
to us with as this came in as a
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
notification bill but when we were
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
working on 205 we we tabled that bill um
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
and we did that because we wanted to
 
00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
just pull it back to a notification and
 
00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039 align:start position:0%
wait for some of the language that's
 
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
going to be coming forward from the
 
00:31:19.389 --> 00:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
federal and from Dees to to make sure
 
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
that we're syncing up and doing the
 
00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
right thing at the right time right also
 
00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
I don't want to uh want to interfere
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
with the people's right of
 
00:31:32.509 --> 00:31:32.519 align:start position:0%
contract that uh if if you are as a
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
seller say I'm selling this as
 
00:31:41.789 --> 00:31:41.799 align:start position:0%
is it is now and you as the purchaser to
 
00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
understand that we put your big boy
 
00:31:47.789 --> 00:31:47.799 align:start position:0%
pants on and get your job get it done uh
 
00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
you know we all this we're not going to
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
be I don't want to don't want to change
 
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
that contractual uh uh uh
 
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
now so I just want to comment to that to
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
say that yes we want that notification
 
00:32:09.389 --> 00:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
to be out there we want that person
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
who's purchasing the home to feel that
 
00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:14.360 align:start position:0%
they're being warned and that is really
 
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
the only intent that we're working on
 
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
bill representative M um I'll defer to
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative dar but happy to move
 
00:32:31.629 --> 00:32:31.639 align:start position:0%
move this amendment and well is that is
 
00:32:31.639 --> 00:32:34.750 align:start position:0%
move this amendment and well is that is
anybody

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:41.350 align:start position:0%
 
else

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
sureair I was just going to say that um
 
00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
and this is in response to
 
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
representative Renzo's um comment about
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
measuring just the big four um because I
 
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
had blood work done and 40 chemicals
 
00:32:59.230 --> 00:32:59.240 align:start position:0%
were were isolated 12 are over the the
 
00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
toxic limit that's allowed for humans my
 
00:33:03.549 --> 00:33:03.559 align:start position:0%
doctors took that information and
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
because of it I had medical treatment
 
00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
based on that so this this doesn't have
 
00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:13.720 align:start position:0%
to do with a house but what I'm I'm just
 
00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
saying be careful to of limiting and
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
it's not in this bill but in the future
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
limiting to just those four because
 
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
there's more out there there's a lot
 
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
more out there and they're doing damage
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
so that's all that's it was just a
 
00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:29.919 align:start position:0%
statement not a
 
00:33:32.509 --> 00:33:32.519 align:start position:0%
question and it's an important statement
 
00:33:34.509 --> 00:33:34.519 align:start position:0%
because as we go forward you know this
 
00:33:36.909 --> 00:33:36.919 align:start position:0%
is why this is taking time and that we
 
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
have to go through this and make sure
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
that we're doing incremental steps that
 
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
bring us all we can't afford to not all
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
go in the same direction right now with
 
00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
pasas um there are more than four
 
00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:53.720 align:start position:0%
chemicals and that is relevant
 
00:33:57.789 --> 00:33:57.799 align:start position:0%
information to people um we don't want
 
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
to think that certain past chemicals are
 
00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
there is no good
 
00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:05.720 align:start position:0%
P there is no good amount of it and it
 
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
is just a nightmare to try to manage
 
00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
what's going on here so thank you so
 
00:34:14.349 --> 00:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
much and for indulging our questions do
 
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
representative have any more questions
 
00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
for representative
 
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
Thomas we can call you back up if we
 
00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
need to thank
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
00:34:25.879 --> 00:34:28.950 align:start position:0%
you thank
you

00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
forward good
 
00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:44.919 align:start position:0%
morning your mic sorry right good
 
00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
morning I'm Brandon kernin I'm the
 
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
administrator of the drinking water and
 
00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:49.399 align:start position:0%
groundwater Bureau at
 
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
Dees and yes I've worked with
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative derby um on on this bill
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
and I think it's very important um p is
 
00:34:59.630 --> 00:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
a big issue Statewide in Southern New
 
00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's just unfathomable the the
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
issues that we're dealing with in
 
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire so you know short
 
00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:08.440 align:start position:0%
of having money and resources which
 
00:35:10.109 --> 00:35:10.119 align:start position:0%
we're pursuing from responsible parties
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
to test every well and let people know
 
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
what they have and help to mitigate
 
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
exposure this is one more positive step
 
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
we can take until we get there to let
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
people know about past and educate them
 
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
and help them know it's important to
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
test their well U I think the language
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
as it is is pretty good
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
we have well it is good we have mcls or
 
00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
maximum containment levels for Four Past
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
compounds in New Hampshire um but this
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
December EPA is going to finalize its
 
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
Federal mcls which will apply at least
 
00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
to our water systems but we will use
 
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
them and Outreach to private o owners
 
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
for at least six it'll include the four
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
we currently have standards for although
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
their standards will be lower from
 
00:35:52.829 --> 00:35:52.839 align:start position:0%
everything I hear but it also have pfbs
 
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:55.480 align:start position:0%
and Gen X so I think what's important to
 
00:35:57.309 --> 00:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
do to complement this build bills at
 
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
Dees update um a brochure a fact sheet
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
for the general public that can
 
00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
complement this bill that we can give to
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
Laboratories can be readily found on our
 
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
website to let them know about the
 
00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
testing options you can test what we
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
regulate for you can test what Dees
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
usually tests for the 29 compounds um we
 
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
can list things Beyond just our
 
00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
standards new federal standards but also
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
the federal advisories there's another
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
level of guidance that's out there and
 
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
try to put that in a really simplistic
 
00:36:27.309 --> 00:36:27.319 align:start position:0%
way so homeowner can understand their
 
00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:29.960 align:start position:0%
testing options and uh you know this was
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
a cost difference as you increase with
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
more compounds but they know what
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
they'll get for that cost and they'll
 
00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
have numbers to compare it to based on
 
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
federal advisories and standards and
 
00:36:42.109 --> 00:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
state standards and advisories so I
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
think this is very helpful and I thank
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
you for your work on
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
this thank you so much representative
 
00:36:53.829 --> 00:36:53.839 align:start position:0%
Darby can you comment on um the
 
00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
suggestion of um changing the um the
 
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
title of the chapter um
 
00:37:06.069 --> 00:37:06.079 align:start position:0%
44 uh 4774 a from an past to and past
 
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
substances do you have a comment on that
 
00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps just spelling it out as we have
 
00:37:14.069 --> 00:37:14.079 align:start position:0%
in line 32 because the S and pest is
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
substances so maybe if you just spell it
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
out you kind of kill two words with one
 
00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
stone you say what it is and you have
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:28.309 align:start position:0%
 
there

00:37:28.309 --> 00:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
representative mchu sorry I'm thick so
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
no need to change it then in 30 in in
 
00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
nine because it's spelled out 32 in one
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
other place I think maybe just 32 so do
 
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
we need do we need to redraft an
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
amendment in the middle of os busy
 
00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
season to add that one word or is it
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
sufficient where it is in 32 I'm
 
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
indifferent on it I'm just thinking for
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
efficiency so we can get get this
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
approved by the
 
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I have no doubt that past
 
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
will get a lay person to where they need
 
00:37:57.390 --> 00:37:57.400 align:start position:0%
to be to understand what it is if you
 
00:38:00.589 --> 00:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
Google p and drinking water you'll have
 
00:38:03.309 --> 00:38:03.319 align:start position:0%
a gold mind of information
 
00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
anyone representative rang yeah thank
 
00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:12.280 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and I'm I apologize for
 
00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.150 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and I'm I apologize for
being

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
late and I don't know how much of this
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
was discussed before I came but I want
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
to make a couple points one is earlier
 
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
this year the EPA issued new health
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
advisories for p and I think it was just
 
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
for pfoa and Mr ker maybe you can
 
00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but it
 
00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
essentially said there is no safe levels
 
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
that even in the parts per quadrillion
 
00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
level poses a health issue so I know
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
that in the um the bill that we have um
 
00:38:42.589 --> 00:38:42.599 align:start position:0%
I don't have the line numbers but when
 
00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:46.280 align:start position:0%
it says that PS occurs in is common
 
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
groundwater contamination in New
 
00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that occurs at unhealthy
 
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
levels I think we need to strike that
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
because any level is unhealthy and um
 
00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
also um you know we tend to focus on
 
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
those areas of the state that have been
 
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
Hotspots for uh past contamination but
 
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
earlier this year um oh thank you very
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
much changed a little
 
00:39:12.309 --> 00:39:12.319 align:start position:0%
bit levels that exceed oh okay no that
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
sounds good thank you um but the other
 
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
thing I'm not sure this committee is
 
00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
aware but there was a soil study that
 
00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
was done jointly with the US Geological
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
Survey and I believe Dees was involved
 
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
in that where they took the state of New
 
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they divided it into a
 
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
grid of a 100 so essentially I mean
 
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
there were some spots I couldn't cover
 
00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
but essentially it was just a grid of a
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
hundred and they found pasas in every
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
single soil sample so we know from our
 
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
experience not just in miramac but in
 
00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
other parts of the country that when
 
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
pasas is in soil it ends up being in
 
00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:49.640 align:start position:0%
groundwater or it's likely in
 
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
groundwater because it leeches through
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
the soil and so I think we it is safe to
 
00:39:59.069 --> 00:39:59.079 align:start position:0%
assume that in all areas of the state
 
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
there's going to be p in the
 
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
groundwater um and if it's not there
 
00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:06.280 align:start position:0%
already it's coming and so many people
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
particularly those people in the North
 
00:40:10.349 --> 00:40:10.359 align:start position:0%
Country rely on Wells for their drinking
 
00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
water that um I think it's really really
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
important to make sure that notification
 
00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
is in place to alert them that you could
 
00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
have you may not have an industrial area
 
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
in your in your community but it's
 
00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
likely you've gotten pasts that have
 
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
come from somewhere else landed on the
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
soil and got into the well water and
 
00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:32.200 align:start position:0%
that there is no safe level of pasas so
 
00:40:34.349 --> 00:40:34.359 align:start position:0%
if they have that notification then they
 
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
would have they would be better informed
 
00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
to make the choice of water uh treatment
 
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
to to remove the pasas so many people in
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire and I know our
 
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
our chairman Rulo has a treatment but
 
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
you know it gives people the information
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to make an informed decision
 
00:40:56.109 --> 00:40:56.119 align:start position:0%
about how what type of treatment they
 
00:40:58.109 --> 00:40:58.119 align:start position:0%
would need to do for their well water
 
00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
because many treatments that people have
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
now for well water maybe it's to REM
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
remove iron or manganese um AR snic
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
those are things the treatment for those
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
um um atoms don't treat don't remove
 
00:41:16.589 --> 00:41:16.599 align:start position:0%
pasas there's specific ways to remove
 
00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:19.720 align:start position:0%
pasas that won't work um if you're
 
00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:20.870 align:start position:0%
pasas that won't work um if you're
removing

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
removing
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
minerals so I just wanted to make that
 
00:41:24.589 --> 00:41:24.599 align:start position:0%

representative Rulo just
 
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
one one uh one qu one concern uh what
 
00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here is just putting
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
together a a a notification to be handed
 
00:41:49.109 --> 00:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
people uh not to dig down into all of
 
00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
the the the issues of
 
00:41:59.109 --> 00:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
how you treat and things like that that
 
00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
Tak can that but this is just a trigger
 
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
mechanism and we is we all agree on that
 
00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:11.240 align:start position:0%
uh and also who does what uh all I read
 
00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
here it says prior to execution of any
 
00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
contract uh there this you have to have
 
00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:21.160 align:start position:0%
a a uh a
 
00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
notification uh okay I think are you
 
00:42:26.549 --> 00:42:26.559 align:start position:0%
going to answer that okay that's I'll
 
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
up thank you madam chair so I have the
 
00:42:36.589 --> 00:42:36.599 align:start position:0%
um pns statement that the uh realtor
 
00:42:39.309 --> 00:42:39.319 align:start position:0%
sent us when we talked about 398 and you
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
can see I mean I don't didn't print it
 
00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
out unfortunately but you can see that
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
the three paragraphs that pre that
 
00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:48.280 align:start position:0%
already exist radon arsenic lead those
 
00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
are verbatim in that five-page pns
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
statement and so this is going to be and
 
00:42:58.750 --> 00:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
the pns statement is what the um Mr
 
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
Schmidt can correct me but what goes to
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
you know the the potential buyer y
 
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
basically when at least in my cases in
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
the past when you when you put your
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
deposit down like here or actually when
 
00:43:11.829 --> 00:43:11.839 align:start position:0%
I think the realtor even gives it to you
 
00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:13.240 align:start position:0%
when you're looking like here's the
 
00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:15.880 align:start position:0%
here's the notifications and so this
 
00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
basically says like hey these are the
 
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
things you ought to be thinking about
 
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
when you're going to buy this house it's
 
00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
it's just the notification it's not the
 
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
disclosures when you're when you're um
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
at the when you're signing on the dotted
 
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
line at the at the um during the
 
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
transaction and in fact other portions
 
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
of this of the existing language of the
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
bill right um of the law I just read it
 
00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
to you paragraph two because we're only
 
00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:43.880 align:start position:0%
modifying paragraph one paragraph two
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
states nothing in this section shall be
 
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
construed to have any impact on the
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
legal validity of title transferred
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the purchase and sale
 
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
contract so this is just like hey you
 
00:43:57.630 --> 00:43:57.640 align:start position:0%
you got to be aware of this thing and
 
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
it's and it's an it's adding a new
 
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph um to the purchase and sale
 
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
that already has those other three
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
that is that what uh the the
 
00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
Realtors uh so you're it means a change
 
00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
in the uh in the document in the pns
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
docu purchase and sale agreement
 
00:44:28.109 --> 00:44:28.119 align:start position:0%
document or is it
 
00:44:30.829 --> 00:44:30.839 align:start position:0%
just uh or is it something that's coming
 
00:44:34.589 --> 00:44:34.599 align:start position:0%
from thees that you just hand the people
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
what I don't know I'm confused so you
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
want to know how the um information is
 
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.710 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:53.150 align:start position:0%
right
right

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
go we will take any answers you may have
 
00:44:58.589 --> 00:44:58.599 align:start position:0%
sure so uh first I'll start with a thank
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
you and then I'll follow quickly with an
 
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
apology the thank you will be
 
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
representative Darby's been great
 
00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
sharing the the draft language with us
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
over time my name is Adam Schmidt I do
 
00:45:08.589 --> 00:45:08.599 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire Association
 
00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
of Realtors to date I've heard no
 
00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:12.200 align:start position:0%
concerns about the language that he
 
00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
shared with us so they're comfortable
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
with it I think representative renz and
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
this is where I'm going to tie into the
 
00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:19.960 align:start position:0%
apology while I represent them I'm not a
 
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
practitioner okay so I can't get into
 
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
the the nitty-gritty of of how this
 
00:45:26.109 --> 00:45:26.119 align:start position:0%
would work but it's my understanding
 
00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
that anytime the language under this
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
particular section of law is changed the
 
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
form that representative Darby
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
referenced is changed to reflect any
 
00:45:38.829 --> 00:45:38.839 align:start position:0%
amendments to this statute and I think
 
00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things he included which I
 
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
believe we may have asked for is an
 
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:44.839 align:start position:0%
effective date of January 1st
 
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
2025 so that way it's not 60 days after
 
00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
passage or something that's unclear so
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
we won't know when those forms need to
 
00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
be changed it'll be very clear that
 
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
starting on that date moving for forward
 
00:45:58.630 --> 00:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
the language which appears in the bill
 
00:46:00.589 --> 00:46:00.599 align:start position:0%
would then have to appear on the forms
 
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
that representative Darby just
 
00:46:04.549 --> 00:46:04.559 align:start position:0%
referenced I hope that's
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
helpful and and that's and that's you're
 
00:46:08.589 --> 00:46:08.599 align:start position:0%
age you're in agreement with that I've
 
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
heard no concerns about the language
 
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
that's that um he has work to put
 
00:46:14.549 --> 00:46:14.559 align:start position:0%
together on this amendment okay that's
 
00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:20.549 --> 00:46:20.559 align:start position:0%
much further
 
00:46:23.069 --> 00:46:23.079 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:46:23.079 --> 00:46:24.470 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
subcommittee

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
please go ahead representative thank you
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
madam chair unless representative Darby
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
like to move his own Amendment I'm happy
 
00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
to move this move the subcommittee
 
00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
accept this amendment as written uh and
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
it's uh 2296 2023 2296
 
00:46:54.800 --> 00:47:00.710 align:start position:0%
it's uh 2296 2023 2296
h

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
role would you like to speak to your
 
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
motion representative M sure U 30
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
seconds great work everybody I think
 
00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:29.480 align:start position:0%
this is super good public policy was
 
00:47:31.309 --> 00:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
very important at the time that we
 
00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:33.640 align:start position:0%
recognized Arsenic and Lead was a very
 
00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:35.480 align:start position:0%
important to notify consumers to get
 
00:47:37.549 --> 00:47:37.559 align:start position:0%
tested and be knowledgeable this is
 
00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:39.160 align:start position:0%
equally if not more important because
 
00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:41.960 align:start position:0%
there's so many unknowns so like the
 
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
department said this will get people
 
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
where they need to go we'll
 
00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
probably uh open you know shed a whole
 
00:47:50.829 --> 00:47:50.839 align:start position:0%
new light on things and get a lot more
 
00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
people educated which is great public
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
policy at least uh in the majority of
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
the state so
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
thanks representative McHugh um I want
 
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
to Echo that um support for the bill I
 
00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
think this is really important it's a
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
notification that couldn't be more
 
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:11.720 align:start position:0%
timely and um we're waiting we're always
 
00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
hurrying up and trying to do what we can
 
00:48:16.349 --> 00:48:16.359 align:start position:0%
and then we wait for the EPA or wait for
 
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
things to line up so I'm glad we could
 
00:48:20.589 --> 00:48:20.599 align:start position:0%
move forward I think this is Mak some
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
good impact and it also you know it
 
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
really it ask it tells people that we we
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
would like you to consult with Dees and
 
00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
find out exactly what you're facing um
 
00:48:34.829 --> 00:48:34.839 align:start position:0%
representative Ren Zulo those are very
 
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
good questions and I think that we want
 
00:48:38.829 --> 00:48:38.839 align:start position:0%
to just always reassure people that they
 
00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:41.720 align:start position:0%
don't have to do anything but here they
 
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
are with a problem and it's reality time
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:54.599 --> 00:48:56.549 align:start position:0%
 
mitigate

00:48:56.549 --> 00:48:56.559 align:start position:0%
mitigate
 
00:48:59.309 --> 00:48:59.319 align:start position:0%
the original uh subcommittee work
 
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
session form has everybody the entire
 
00:49:03.549 --> 00:49:03.559 align:start position:0%
committee's name on it so I'm going to
 
00:49:08.789 --> 00:49:08.799 align:start position:0%
