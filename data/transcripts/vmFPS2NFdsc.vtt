00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
so um just just to get everybody where
 
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
where we are at um obviously we have
 
00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 align:start position:0%
right now two bills two bills in
 
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 align:start position:0%
committee we have uh Senate Bill 98
 
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
and we have Senate Bill uh 85.
 
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
85 has been sent to us as a second
 
00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 align:start position:0%
committee normally bills did we we're
 
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
not really a second committee but
 
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
um over the years it has um
 
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 align:start position:0%
has occurred
 
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
um and that and in this case in in
 
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 85 there's a little section
 
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
in there
 
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
um that uh is is a
 
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 align:start position:0%
health insurance mandate and so
 
00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 align:start position:0%
therefore um it it did cause it to come
 
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
to this committee uh so now we'll take
 
00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 align:start position:0%
up the next issue is Senate bill 98.
 
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.810 align:start position:0%
 
really

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
okay all right sounds like it's coming
 
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.810 align:start position:0%
okay all right sounds like it's coming
from

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 align:start position:0%
okay so what I like to do is first just
 
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
um open the disc have the the motion and
 
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 align:start position:0%
then we'll have discussion so uh
 
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative patusek
 
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
uh second by representative that we
 
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
reconsider our action on Senate bill 98.
 
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman okay um in as much
 
00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 align:start position:0%
as I was the co-sponsor of the original
 
00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 align:start position:0%
SB 98 with Senator Murphy uh and I voted
 
00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:38.390 align:start position:0%
SB 98 with Senator Murphy uh and I voted
OTP

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
OTP
 
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
to move it forward I figured I might as
 
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 align:start position:0%
well be the one to move to reconsider
 
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
and so we can work on it move the
 
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
can you hear me can everybody hear me
 
00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
because normally I speak louder I don't
 
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
know if I don't need the microphone
 
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
in as much as I was the co-sponsor with
 
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
Senator Murphy on the original SB 98
 
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 align:start position:0%
I figured it I might as well move it
 
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 align:start position:0%
forward for reconsideration and because
 
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 align:start position:0%
I the blurb was already written
 
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
so I hereby move to reconsider the
 
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 98.
 
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
okay so we're now open discussion
 
00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
um so I want to First give a little
 
00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
Prelude and then I am excited to hear
 
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
what everybody has to say all right
 
00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 align:start position:0%
um that was saying that some people were
 
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
not supportive any marijuana legislation
 
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
no matter no matter what
 
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
um what occurs here is that yes we did
 
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 align:start position:0%
uh have um out of the blue
 
00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
a second thought about uh the marijuana
 
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
legislation and even from the Senate
 
00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 align:start position:0%
they did uh introduce a study committee
 
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 align:start position:0%
I don't know if all of you are aware of
 
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
this but they have introduced a study
 
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.949 align:start position:0%
this but they have introduced a study
committee

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
um that uh would review the issues of
 
00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 align:start position:0%
creating a uh marijuana cannabis
 
00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 align:start position:0%
statutes which would be operated by
 
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 align:start position:0%
um I would say myself personally
 
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
um I was obviously aware of this issue
 
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
because we we did it last year senator
 
00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 align:start position:0%
abbison now Senator I was where
 
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 align:start position:0%
representative was had uh had presented
 
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 align:start position:0%
the legislation and uh we had a fairly
 
00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 align:start position:0%
Lively discussion on the house floor
 
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 align:start position:0%
um it did pass
 
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
um but then it failed in the Senate
 
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.450 align:start position:0%
um but then it failed in the Senate
um

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
I guess what I what I would say to you
 
00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
is that the issue is is whether this is
 
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
something we want to get done
 
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 align:start position:0%
or whether we just wait
 
00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
because I would also say that we have in
 
00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 align:start position:0%
our possession now
 
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 align:start position:0%
as a retained Bill we have uh
 
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 align:start position:0%
representative Eaton's bill
 
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 align:start position:0%
and representative Eaton's bill is the
 
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
same bill it is operating by the state
 
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 align:start position:0%
so theoretically if we don't do this
 
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 align:start position:0%
reconsideration now
 
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
we would certainly uh come September we
 
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 align:start position:0%
will then dive in down deep into that
 
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation let alone the
 
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
Senate study committee doing whatever
 
00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
they're going to do so we would have
 
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
something on you know theoretically we
 
00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 align:start position:0%
could potentially have that issue on the
 
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 align:start position:0%
house floor
 
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 align:start position:0%
come next January
 
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
having said that
 
00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:44.699 align:start position:0%
um what the key elements of this bill
 
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
and Eaton's Bill versus what we had
 
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 align:start position:0%
passed uh before is the idea of how many
 
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
locations we're going to have in the
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
having said that it is that
 
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 align:start position:0%
I'm using that as the focus because
 
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
it is not in New Hampshire's way to
 
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 align:start position:0%
other states have done that and we we uh
 
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 align:start position:0%
we usually just we call it the taxi
 
00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.090 align:start position:0%
we usually just we call it the taxi
medallion

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 align:start position:0%
medallion
 
00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 align:start position:0%
that a city would only have so many taxi
 
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
medallions in its community and it would
 
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
restrict it what that does it creates
 
00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 align:start position:0%
winners and losers because all of a
 
00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 align:start position:0%
sudden now that taxi Medallion in and of
 
00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:36.199 align:start position:0%
itself has value
 
00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
and uh and we see in other states a a
 
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
liquor license is worth a quarter of a
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
just in itself
 
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire has never gone down
 
00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:50.699 align:start position:0%
that path
 
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
and we've always taken the path that if
 
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to uh do something if we're
 
00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
going to legalize it we're going to have
 
00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
have stores whatever
 
00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
um we're not going to limit how many
 
00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:02.819 align:start position:0%
restaurants you can have I mean it's
 
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
amazing to me that some states will
 
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780 align:start position:0%
literally limit how many restaurants
 
00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:08.759 align:start position:0%
they have in a state
 
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to limit that we're
 
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
not going to we're we're you know or
 
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:14.100 align:start position:0%
we'll issue if we're going to issue a
 
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
license for it's come one come all as
 
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:19.380 align:start position:0%
long as you uh are have or find
 
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
outstanding citizens and don't have a of
 
00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:24.419 align:start position:0%
a legal background that might bar you
 
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
from having a license
 
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.510 align:start position:0%
from having a license
so

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
if if we could turn ourselves back to
 
00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
when uh the prohibition ended and the
 
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire made a decision
 
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
to say okay we're going to have that
 
00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
free-for-all with licenses when it comes
 
00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:43.139 align:start position:0%
to beverages
 
00:07:46.249 --> 00:07:46.259 align:start position:0%
and they set it at six percent but that
 
00:07:49.249 --> 00:07:49.259 align:start position:0%
when it came to distilled including wine
 
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
that means over six percent
 
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:53.580 align:start position:0%
um the state made the decision to that
 
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
we they were going to limit access to
 
00:07:59.870 --> 00:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
that those products and having to buy
 
00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:04.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
in my mind after doing this being on
 
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
this committee so long what I think is
 
00:08:11.089 --> 00:08:11.099 align:start position:0%
most interesting about that decision
 
00:08:13.249 --> 00:08:13.259 align:start position:0%
what it is is that
 
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
when you go down that path you actually
 
00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
don't have to set a tax rate
 
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
because the state is operating and
 
00:08:24.529 --> 00:08:24.539 align:start position:0%
selling the product it has its margins
 
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
uh and then delivers that the margins to
 
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
the state so you're not you don't get
 
00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
into the battles of tax rates which as
 
00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:36.419 align:start position:0%
as anybody probably knows that once you
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
create a tax rate it can that's some
 
00:08:41.209 --> 00:08:41.219 align:start position:0%
it's it can be fought over it can be
 
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
challenged it can legislature
 
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
can be annually questioning that tax
 
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:49.980 align:start position:0%
rate I would say in my time on this
 
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
committee the 30 cents a gallon on beer
 
00:08:55.009 --> 00:08:55.019 align:start position:0%
has I've seen that bill at least to half
 
00:08:56.449 --> 00:08:56.459 align:start position:0%
a dozen times
 
00:08:56.459 --> 00:08:58.550 align:start position:0%
a dozen times
so

00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
this model uh the appeal one of the
 
00:09:03.769 --> 00:09:03.779 align:start position:0%
appeals of this models is that we don't
 
00:09:06.889 --> 00:09:06.899 align:start position:0%
have to set a tax rate today if at some
 
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
point in time in the future we decide
 
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:10.860 align:start position:0%
that we do want to offered licenses that
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
the state New Hampshire might decide to
 
00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
get out of the business and say that
 
00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:17.700 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to do this anymore uh then
 
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
you know obviously
 
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
um at that point in time it fell off the
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
stores and and then set a tax rate but
 
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
if you do it this way then we're you
 
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
know you could say we're kicking the can
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
down but at this point we're saying is
 
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh that uh there was a other goal a
 
00:09:40.009 --> 00:09:40.019 align:start position:0%
greater goal and that was that what we
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
have seen occurring in other states
 
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.810 align:start position:0%
have seen occurring in other states
is

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
uh I would call the the marijuana mile
 
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:50.940 align:start position:0%
in which you would have multiple stores
 
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
all in the same street up and down the
 
00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
street and
 
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.650 align:start position:0%
street and
um

00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
I think that that is uh
 
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
the Senators is that is the most
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
offensive of the marijuana legislation
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
theoretically they're not all going to
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
stay open because the free market would
 
00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:14.180 align:start position:0%
be at some point in time would
 
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
theoretically could uh fix that and if
 
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
they don't sell enough product and
 
00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:21.380 align:start position:0%
they're going to go out of business
 
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
but that it it
 
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
is you know in terms of that possibility
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
or not where we are with that that if we
 
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:32.220 align:start position:0%
go with this model uh with that we just
 
00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:34.100 align:start position:0%
go a limited amount of stores
 
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:36.660 align:start position:0%
we have the commission enforcement
 
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
division you know it has had obviously
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
this is the most way we can ensure that
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
young people are are not getting access
 
00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:49.140 align:start position:0%
to marijuana through through the state
 
00:10:51.889 --> 00:10:51.899 align:start position:0%
store State system
 
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
so having said that
 
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:56.220 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'll now be interested in in
 
00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
questions that people might have on
 
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
whether we should reconsider yes
 
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh way back when
 
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
at the uh
 
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
outset of your remarks I believe you
 
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned a house bill sponsored by
 
00:11:12.889 --> 00:11:12.899 align:start position:0%
representative Eden correct that you
 
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:15.180 align:start position:0%
said was essentially the same as this
 
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:17.700 align:start position:0%
bill correct so are we are we then
 
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:19.940 align:start position:0%
really talking about a matter of timing
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
because the house bill which is re
 
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:25.740 align:start position:0%
retained yes
 
00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
if it were to be approved
 
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
by this committee right it would hit the
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
event it would hit the floor in January
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
whereas this bill if would if we vote to
 
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:38.700 align:start position:0%
reconsider and then we vote to recommend
 
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
to the Full House and if the house were
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
to approve concur with the Senate
 
00:11:44.569 --> 00:11:44.579 align:start position:0%
assuming there are no changes
 
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
the the effect would be more immediate
 
00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:49.079 align:start position:0%
in terms of implementation yeah well
 
00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
with respect to passage for passage yeah
 
00:11:55.009 --> 00:11:55.019 align:start position:0%
exactly because to get this actually in
 
00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:56.519 align:start position:0%
place so it's going to take a couple
 
00:11:58.910 --> 00:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
years anyways okay thank you and one
 
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:01.700 align:start position:0%
follow-up question if I may for you so
 
00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:04.860 align:start position:0%
would you uh just speak once again to
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
the the the the matter of a study
 
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
committee with respect to this
 
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:10.740 align:start position:0%
particular legislation and how the two
 
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.170 align:start position:0%
particular legislation and how the two
relate

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:12.180 align:start position:0%
relate
 
00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
so the study committee's report would be
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
at the end of good so it too
 
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
theoretically could have legislation
 
00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:28.009 --> 00:12:28.019 align:start position:0%
because what the study committees the
 
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
study committee is is uh the report of
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
the study committee is supposed to be in
 
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
the end of November and in which then uh
 
00:12:38.449 --> 00:12:38.459 align:start position:0%
that it would be in time for legislation
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
to be introduced in January
 
00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:43.139 align:start position:0%
of everyone in me but we're really doing
 
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
it being asked to go along the creation
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
of the supplement request from the
 
00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:50.220 align:start position:0%
Senate study and make recommendations of
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
implementation and and move the clock up
 
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.110 align:start position:0%
implementation and and move the clock up
yes

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:59.150 --> 00:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
representative Burrows
 
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
um has it been established who would be
 
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
on this committee would it be bipartisan
 
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
so the senate committee yeah uh it's it
 
00:13:10.129 --> 00:13:10.139 align:start position:0%
has a fair amount of people on it
 
00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
it's it's a commission so it's got a lot
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
of a lot of people but I think there's
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
four reps if I remember correctly is it
 
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.129 align:start position:0%
four reps if I remember correctly is it
bipartisan

00:13:19.129 --> 00:13:19.139 align:start position:0%
bipartisan
 
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
uh well
 
00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:24.660 align:start position:0%
I'm not hearing an answer so the answer
 
00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:27.660 align:start position:0%
is all committees are always bipartisan
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
so yes the four would be there would be
 
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:33.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:36.889 --> 00:13:36.899 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh chairman hunt I wonder if you
 
00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:42.380 align:start position:0%
saw this uh letter from uh marijuana
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
policy project that came in after seven
 
00:13:49.069 --> 00:13:49.079 align:start position:0%
o'clock last night from Karen O'Keefe
 
00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
um she makes some very interesting
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
points here that uh could throw sort of
 
00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
a monkey wrench into this so basically
 
00:13:59.690 --> 00:13:59.700 align:start position:0%
what she says is that
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
um a a state could have private
 
00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:06.180 align:start position:0%
employees uh do something that might be
 
00:14:08.449 --> 00:14:08.459 align:start position:0%
against federal law but they couldn't
 
00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
have public employees doing that so it
 
00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:14.220 align:start position:0%
throws up a roadblock if in fact The
 
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission decided to
 
00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
to uh sell it it's just a possibility
 
00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:22.139 align:start position:0%
that somebody could file a lawsuit
 
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
against that and she recommends a couple
 
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
of safety valves to uh to overcome that
 
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
in case that's the case so I have to
 
00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:31.980 align:start position:0%
admit I have not seen it so what were
 
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
the safety valves I'm sorry well we're
 
00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:37.019 align:start position:0%
the safety valves the safety valve was
 
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
to offer an out to the state that they
 
00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:43.980 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to uh sell it themselves
 
00:14:47.569 --> 00:14:47.579 align:start position:0%
and look can I get Carrie to make copies
 
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
of this and hand it out sure
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
I I thought you said we all got an email
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
to us
 
00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:57.300 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I I have not seen it
 
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
if I understand correctly
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
we are going to maybe vote on our on
 
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
this bill so uh the modification to 98.
 
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
and that would take precedence over what
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
the Senate is doing or it would it could
 
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:19.980 align:start position:0%
move things along faster the Senate the
 
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
Senate uh on another bill so we would
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
theoretically I I have to admit I'm not
 
00:15:26.569 --> 00:15:26.579 align:start position:0%
sure whether the other bill was a
 
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
Commerce Bill does anybody know whether
 
00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
what was the number what what committee
 
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.269 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:39.180 align:start position:0%
help so theoretically we we uh we would
 
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
have to have the health committee we
 
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
would talk to the chair and ask him uh
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
you know to whether to uh
 
00:15:50.689 --> 00:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
to whether we support the idea of that
 
00:15:53.449 --> 00:15:53.459 align:start position:0%
study committee and then and then we
 
00:15:55.009 --> 00:15:55.019 align:start position:0%
usually normally if it does go to
 
00:15:57.949 --> 00:15:57.959 align:start position:0%
committee conference we get one seat uh
 
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
at the table for that and but in that
 
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
yes that would be done through Community
 
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
Conference Then I then I have this
 
00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:04.930 align:start position:0%
Conference Then I then I have this
question

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:04.940 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
this bill or 639 the original bill which
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
this is a very small modification of
 
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.949 align:start position:0%
this is a very small modification of
right

00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:16:15.769 --> 00:16:15.779 align:start position:0%
was studied extensively by both parties
 
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
a huge amount of effort was put into
 
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
creating that bill correct it was
 
00:16:23.329 --> 00:16:23.339 align:start position:0%
bipartisan in nature both teams agreed
 
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
to it right and it was
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
told by a lot of a number of people that
 
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
came here in the hearing said it was
 
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
pretty good
 
00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
so my question is how much more studying
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
are we going to do on this you can study
 
00:16:41.889 --> 00:16:41.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
which is getting very close I mean what
 
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
are they going to find that's different
 
00:16:48.769 --> 00:16:48.779 align:start position:0%
that we don't already know right
 
00:16:52.749 --> 00:16:52.759 align:start position:0%
right uh I would yeah um
 
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
obviously there are
 
00:16:58.610 --> 00:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
um certain Senators who are reluctant to
 
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
pass it and they were able to convince
 
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
other Senators to go with the study
 
00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:06.049 align:start position:0%
other Senators to go with the study
committee

00:17:06.049 --> 00:17:06.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:09.959 align:start position:0%
uh we we do not presume other people's
 
00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:13.789 align:start position:0%
uh we we do not presume other people's
motives

00:17:13.789 --> 00:17:13.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:15.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
so yes if we don't reconsider this uh
 
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:29.220 align:start position:0%
98 if we just say no then 98 we'll just
 
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:31.799 align:start position:0%
go on with the uh
 
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:33.660 align:start position:0%
um the motion that we already have
 
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
passed in passing 98 and at that point
 
00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:39.539 align:start position:0%
the only thing we would have left is we
 
00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:42.419 align:start position:0%
have uh representative Eaton's bill that
 
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
we would be able to work on
 
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:47.100 align:start position:0%
um this year and then introduce on the
 
00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.890 align:start position:0%
would you believe
yeah

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:56.900 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
make sure your microphone is on and and
 
00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
you speak closely so we all so everybody
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
at home can hear you
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh would you believe it's my in my
 
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
opinion that it's we're at a place that
 
00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
we can pass this legislation as is
 
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
uh and that I think the State Liquor
 
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
Commission is the right place to do so
 
00:18:23.529 --> 00:18:23.539 align:start position:0%
when we as we did with liquor
 
00:18:27.049 --> 00:18:27.059 align:start position:0%
and uh from my point of view would you
 
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
believe I don't want to do anything more
 
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
than what we've already done I just want
 
00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
to pass the legislation this amendment
 
00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:37.220 align:start position:0%
yes no no this is to reconsider no no
 
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
we're reconsidering Senate Bill 98 was
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
all it was uh was that we were changing
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount of when a someone has
 
00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
not paid the bill to their beer
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
distributor from a hundred dollars to
 
00:18:54.409 --> 00:18:54.419 align:start position:0%
250. so once we reconsider that then
 
00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
it'll be open for a new Amendment and
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
that's what we hope to take up at 10 30
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
if we have a prevailing motion now on
 
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
no no I'm even more confused
 
00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
we need to open this up so we can add
 
00:19:18.049 --> 00:19:18.059 align:start position:0%
this amendment to it and the amendment
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
is this is an amendment this is a
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
non-germaine Amendment
 
00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:26.039 align:start position:0%
this is a non-germaine Amendment and it
 
00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
can't be introduced to regas we right
 
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
now we have no more liquor bills left in
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
okay so this bill we still have because
 
00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:38.039 align:start position:0%
we did pass it it just didn't get sent
 
00:19:38.039 --> 00:19:38.950 align:start position:0%
we did pass it it just didn't get sent
over

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
fortuitously and so we have it available
 
00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
so if we vote if you vote now for yes to
 
00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:45.890 align:start position:0%
so if we vote if you vote now for yes to
reconsider

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
reconsider
 
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
vote now yes then we can take up 98
 
00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
we're not going to vote on the 98 today
 
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
okay because we want to go through
 
00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:55.799 align:start position:0%
normal Commerce process which is a
 
00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and make sure that that
 
00:19:59.930 --> 00:19:59.940 align:start position:0%
we've got all our eyes dotted and T's
 
00:20:03.529 --> 00:20:03.539 align:start position:0%
crossed and then next week we can then
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
vote Senate Bill 98 that will have the
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
underlying language that was already in
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
the bill it'll have this new Amendment
 
00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
and we would be sending that to the
 
00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
house floor with this new amendment that
 
00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:18.780 align:start position:0%
has the Liquor Commission operating in
 
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
the stores
 
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
so the Liquor Commission was not in this
 
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.730 align:start position:0%
so the Liquor Commission was not in this
original

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
again this amendment is uh mirrored off
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
of a
 
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
uh we we passed 639 but 639 was
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
different so this is a new Amendment
 
00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
this is totally a new Amendment to the
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
extent that we the concept of having the
 
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission run the stores rather
 
00:20:48.049 --> 00:20:48.059 align:start position:0%
than free enterprise you know having
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
private businesses run it okay I must
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
have been I must have misunderstood the
 
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
previous conversations because I all
 
00:20:59.150 --> 00:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
along have
 
00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
wanted and agreed to and I thought it
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
was already here that the Liquor
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
Commission was going to be as they do
 
00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:08.820 align:start position:0%
with liquor would be the uh operators
 
00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
that was that was that was
 
00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:13.380 align:start position:0%
representative Eaton's bill and yes now
 
00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
that is back it has risen from the dead
 
00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
it's right here in front of us but you
 
00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:20.700 align:start position:0%
have to first vote Yes on the
 
00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
reconsideration of Senate Bill 98 so
 
00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
that we can take that up
 
00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.610 align:start position:0%
 
Representatives

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:33.780 align:start position:0%
you knew that I was gonna well I didn't
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
think you would let this go
 
00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:38.220 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to mention how much I
 
00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:41.220 align:start position:0%
vehemently disagree with some of my
 
00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:43.799 align:start position:0%
colleagues here that there will never be
 
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:46.919 align:start position:0%
a good time to legalize
 
00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:49.940 align:start position:0%
more drugs into New Hampshire
 
00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
and expose our children and expose towns
 
00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
to them that might not want it if it's
 
00:21:59.090 --> 00:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
in a liquor store in their town they
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
would be able to veto it okay they would
 
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
in this bill is that that the accounts
 
00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:04.940 align:start position:0%
would absolutely
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of positive uh from the municipal
 
00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
Association that the language that we
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
that we chose in here they're very very
 
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
happy with in terms of community control
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
over whether one of these things would
 
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
open up in their town
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
but go on
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
well some of us as you know will never
 
00:22:26.529 --> 00:22:26.539 align:start position:0%
be happy with legalizing
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
marijuana cannabis whatever you want to
 
00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
call it uh in New Hampshire whatsoever
 
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
so you know I I hope to represent all of
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
those people and always be a hard no
 
00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:41.460 align:start position:0%
just be on the record for that and we
 
00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I really do
 
00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:47.220 align:start position:0%
okay any other discussion on the motion
 
00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:51.059 align:start position:0%
to reconsider Senate bill 98. yes
 
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs uh thank you Mr
 
00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:55.980 align:start position:0%
Sharon uh I just want to say that I
 
00:22:58.850 --> 00:22:58.860 align:start position:0%
support uh reconsidering Senate Bill 98
 
00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:01.799 align:start position:0%
because I think that this amendment is
 
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
important as I understand it under
 
00:23:06.649 --> 00:23:06.659 align:start position:0%
current law even though marijuana has
 
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
been decriminalized people are still
 
00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
being arrested and getting criminal
 
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
records for it uh and state resources

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on the non-germain
 
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:46.609 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on the non-germain
amendment

00:37:46.609 --> 00:37:46.619 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
um I would ask if anybody has written
 
00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
testimony we'd we'd love if you could
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
submit it to the clerk so uh she can uh
 
00:37:57.890 --> 00:37:57.900 align:start position:0%
relax and not be too stressed over it

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:14.940 align:start position:0%
so basically the the purpose of this
 
00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
public hearing is to
 
00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
find out
 
00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:21.300 align:start position:0%
how people feel about this amendment and
 
00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
pros and cons and uh about this
 
00:38:24.119 --> 00:38:35.270 align:start position:0%
pros and cons and uh about this
amendment

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:37.849 --> 00:38:37.859 align:start position:0%
so good morning morning uh
 
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
representative Susan Almy on city of
 
00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:42.950 align:start position:0%
representative Susan Almy on city of
Lebanon

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
Lebanon
 
00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:46.380 align:start position:0%
from ways and means but on
 
00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
I've only talked a little bit with a
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
couple of the people in ways in Maine
 
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
since I learned this was happening which
 
00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
yeah I learned this was happening just
 
00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:01.740 align:start position:0%
two and a half days ago I think it is
 
00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:02.690 align:start position:0%
two and a half days ago I think it is
um

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:02.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:04.849 --> 00:39:04.859 align:start position:0%
and got
 
00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:07.740 align:start position:0%
the bill on
 
00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
I understand you're going to have a work
 
00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:12.180 align:start position:0%
session which is good because I think
 
00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:13.980 align:start position:0%
you're going to need a lot of amendments
 
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
after this
 
00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:16.730 align:start position:0%
after this
uh

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:16.740 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:18.770 align:start position:0%

their
 
00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
on you've got one small errata
 
00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:35.300 align:start position:0%
line 28
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:46.790 align:start position:0%
 
not

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
six I'm I didn't see definition
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh page six okay
 
00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:55.550 align:start position:0%
uh page six okay
uh

00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:58.430 --> 00:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
there's a on a person may not be
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
convicted of both a violation of this
 
00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
section and a violation of RSA 265 A1
 
00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
that is a list of definitions
 
00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
it is not anything that is a violation
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:16.849 --> 00:40:16.859 align:start position:0%
okay good pickup that's one the other
 
00:40:19.849 --> 00:40:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:24.900 align:start position:0%
related to what we do in ways and means
 
00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.250 align:start position:0%
related to what we do in ways and means
on

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:27.260 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
the line 11 on page 21 when when you're
 
00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
establishing the Cannabis fund
 
00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.890 align:start position:0%
establishing the Cannabis fund
um

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:36.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:41.329 --> 00:40:41.339 align:start position:0%
it is not 17 million 500.
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
on yeah we do have a new amendment to
 
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
change those dollar amounts changes that
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
to 15 million and not to the 500 because
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
representative Ames read this quickly
 
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
last night uh
 
00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.349 align:start position:0%
last night uh
and

00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:14.569 --> 00:41:14.579 align:start position:0%
there you do we do have Appropriations
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
in two places
 
00:41:19.609 --> 00:41:19.619 align:start position:0%
and they look somewhat different he
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
added them all together and said why are
 
00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:23.820 align:start position:0%
they giving 31 million
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
to this
 
00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:26.930 align:start position:0%
to this
um

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:26.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:28.670 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:32.089 --> 00:41:32.099 align:start position:0%
I am not sure I haven't had time yet to
 
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
talk with the drafting people but I'm
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
not sure we had this problem in our
 
00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:41.220 align:start position:0%
committee too and we left the double in
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
but the double was easier to connect at
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
that point
 
00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:47.210 align:start position:0%
that point
um

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:47.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
maybe it's sufficient to just change
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
this to 15 million
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
or on
 
00:41:56.569 --> 00:41:56.579 align:start position:0%
in the flow of what you're doing you
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
probably need it here but we also made
 
00:42:02.089 --> 00:42:02.099 align:start position:0%
sure we had it in the back so that
 
00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:11.089 --> 00:42:11.099 align:start position:0%
so that's just something I guess so it
 
00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
is true that uh giving the the model the
 
00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:15.980 align:start position:0%
business model
 
00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
that now the state is has a bigger cost
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
to the state to operate these stores
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
that it didn't have before so there will
 
00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:28.380 align:start position:0%
be some changes in the appropriation
 
00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:30.290 align:start position:0%
be some changes in the appropriation
amounts

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:30.300 align:start position:0%
amounts
 
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
more than this yeah okay so that's
 
00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
another problem that I really got I read
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
through this I read through it very
 
00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:41.700 align:start position:0%
carefully except for the criminal parts
 
00:42:47.089 --> 00:42:47.099 align:start position:0%
and on I came to the conclusion that you
 
00:42:47.099 --> 00:42:48.890 align:start position:0%
and on I came to the conclusion that you
were

00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:48.900 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
that the Liquor Commission was going to
 
00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.230 align:start position:0%
that the Liquor Commission was going to
uh

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
license retailers that was the old Bill
 
00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:00.300 align:start position:0%
yes that was 16. yeah I know that was
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
that was the old Bill correct and that
 
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
there was no tax
 
00:43:07.069 --> 00:43:07.079 align:start position:0%
so there was no Revenue yeah uh
 
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
representative Ames last night came to
 
00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:12.780 align:start position:0%
the conclusion that you decided that you
 
00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
were running the retail stores but I
 
00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
guess Contracting some employees that
 
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
were going to run them
 
00:43:23.329 --> 00:43:23.339 align:start position:0%
there's a possibility that could occur
 
00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
but that is not that is not you know I
 
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
mean at this point in time it will be uh
 
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
that that hasn't been determined that
 
00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
the commission has to work through that
 
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
but yes we are the the concept the
 
00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
business model is that we will not have
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
a tax per se because the state will be
 
00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
operating the stores and what that
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
requires is that the Liquor Commission
 
00:43:50.569 --> 00:43:50.579 align:start position:0%
figure out what to pay the farmers and
 
00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:53.700 align:start position:0%
what to charge the retailers I mean what
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
the retailers should charge
 
00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.050 align:start position:0%
the retailers should charge
uh

00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:59.809 --> 00:43:59.819 align:start position:0%
for for the marijuana well they are the
 
00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:02.220 align:start position:0%
retailer they are the retailers they are
 
00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:04.740 align:start position:0%
the retailers with um with employees in
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
those stores correct
 
00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.170 align:start position:0%
those stores correct
on

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:09.180 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
so in terms of how much the how much
 
00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
they're paying the cultivators that
 
00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
would be negotiated price between the
 
00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:24.589 --> 00:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
the cultivators do not have
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
much say except to not cultivate in that
 
00:44:30.349 --> 00:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
position I think
 
00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:32.460 align:start position:0%
that's true they could decide that they
 
00:44:34.849 --> 00:44:34.859 align:start position:0%
don't think it's worth worth you know
 
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
coming in but I would venture to say
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
that if I were a cultivator I would not
 
00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:42.180 align:start position:0%
be negotiating with the commission until
 
00:44:44.089 --> 00:44:44.099 align:start position:0%
uh I would not be beginning construction
 
00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
I would not be doing anything unless I
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
knew I had a contract with the
 
00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:50.460 align:start position:0%
commission once they produce the product
 
00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
or what what the how much money I was
 
00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
getting for I bet you even the banks
 
00:44:58.130 --> 00:44:58.140 align:start position:0%
would require that yeah and um
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
the problem with this is if you're
 
00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:05.460 align:start position:0%
allowing people to grow
 
00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
on on
 
00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
on Real Farms
 
00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
and they are producing a different level
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
type of marijuana they have a great deal
 
00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:19.380 align:start position:0%
more risk than the people who are
 
00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:22.980 align:start position:0%
growing it in the in the big
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
um big manufacturing plants let's call
 
00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
them uh the big manufacturing plants are
 
00:45:31.609 --> 00:45:31.619 align:start position:0%
the best way to guarantee that you've
 
00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
got high quality Maryland marijuana
 
00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
cannabis uh well little I know I would
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
venture to say that no one will be
 
00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
growing marijuana out in the fresh air
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire doesn't have a
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
very long growing season I would I can
 
00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
almost assure you that the only
 
00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:49.140 align:start position:0%
marijuana that you're ever going to see
 
00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
cultivate in the state is going to be
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
Factor you know within a side of a
 
00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
closed building in a controlled
 
00:45:58.910 --> 00:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
environment and there are there was one
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
farmer that came to our
 
00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:05.339 align:start position:0%
hearing okay and insisted that he had
 
00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:07.380 align:start position:0%
been growing hemp for some time under
 
00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
the under the federal
 
00:46:13.609 --> 00:46:13.619 align:start position:0%
law and that he really wanted to grow
 
00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
marijuana and he could do it because he
 
00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
already knew how to do it under the
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:19.970 align:start position:0%
federal law
um

00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:19.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
I would be much happier if this Bill
 
00:46:24.349 --> 00:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
said it can't be grown Outdoors except
 
00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
in a a particular kind of greenhouse
 
00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:32.099 align:start position:0%
because otherwise there are a number of
 
00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:35.220 align:start position:0%
people I think that want to try this um
 
00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
even though the Farm Bureau doesn't have
 
00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
any interest
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
that feels a little micromanaging at
 
00:46:43.849 --> 00:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
this point to decide how they're going
 
00:46:44.809 --> 00:46:44.819 align:start position:0%
to grow it and where they're going to
 
00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
grow it well the question is who who
 
00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
would who is the Liquor Commission going
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:59.329 --> 00:46:59.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:00.829 --> 00:47:00.839 align:start position:0%
all of them
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
including this guy wants to grow it
 
00:47:05.329 --> 00:47:05.339 align:start position:0%
outside and the people who who think
 
00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
they could grow it in greenhouses
 
00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:10.140 align:start position:0%
it's what they do with liquor now
 
00:47:13.210 --> 00:47:13.220 align:start position:0%
no they don't don't negotiate they buy
 
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
wine in bottles
 
00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
and they're they have access to a lot of
 
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
national information about how wine is
 
00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
sold everywhere and which wines are not
 
00:47:29.809 --> 00:47:29.819 align:start position:0%
doing well this year I know that because
 
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:38.220 align:start position:0%
okay all right anything else
 
00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:40.130 align:start position:0%
okay all right anything else
um

00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:40.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:49.309 --> 00:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
so then then there's also a question
 
00:47:49.319 --> 00:47:51.109 align:start position:0%
so then then there's also a question
about

00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh there are we now and this was in the
 
00:47:58.010 --> 00:47:58.020 align:start position:0%
previous Bill we've got
 
00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:04.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:08.220 align:start position:0%
uh oh no that's the old fund we have the
 
00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
alcohol Abuse Prevention and treatment
 
00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
fund already
 
00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
and on page 22 we are setting up the new
 
00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:21.890 align:start position:0%
and on page 22 we are setting up the new
on

00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:26.270 align:start position:0%
 
fund

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:29.460 align:start position:0%
shoot did I get this in the wrong place
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
A Substance Abuse Prevention and
 
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
Recovery Fund online 18.
 
00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:36.530 align:start position:0%
Recovery Fund online 18.
um

00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
they both sound like they're being doing
 
00:48:44.089 --> 00:48:44.099 align:start position:0%
pretty similar things this one does not
 
00:48:48.109 --> 00:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
have a 612 reference yet needs one
 
00:48:48.119 --> 00:48:49.569 align:start position:0%
have a 612 reference yet needs one
uh

00:48:49.569 --> 00:48:49.579 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:56.690 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:56.700 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:59.630 align:start position:0%
and
but

00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
it seemed I guess that because of the
 
00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:05.460 align:start position:0%
federal considerations we have to keep
 
00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
it separate from the other fund
 
00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
but there ought to be some kind of
 
00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
interaction I guess that you're going to
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
leave a lot of this to the
 
00:49:19.309 --> 00:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission to try to figure
 
00:49:19.319 --> 00:49:20.150 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission to try to figure
out

00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:24.890 align:start position:0%
out
absolutely

00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
so great any questions from the
 
00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:29.060 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
00:49:37.069 --> 00:49:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:41.540 align:start position:0%
no I yeah I'm I'm done I think that
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
oh you have multiple uh I suggest
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
someone do a search of the word tax yeah
 
00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
I did notice I fix everything yeah we
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
will be removing all the word taxes and
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
make it a little bit clearer that we're
 
00:49:58.609 --> 00:49:58.619 align:start position:0%
going to end up with a liquor store
 
00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
correct liquor store model yes thank you
 
00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
thank you okay uh next I'll call in
 
00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
Michael Holt who's from the Department
 
00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:11.060 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services who

atcs

00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:26.210 align:start position:0%

2023 1892 age which was the one that was

um so thanks for the opportunity to
 
00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:40.740 align:start position:0%
comment on this amendment um I'm not
 
00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
going to cover the public health related
 
00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
issues that have already been discussed
 
00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
and rejected like a cannabis Advisory
 
00:51:47.809 --> 00:51:47.819 align:start position:0%
Board which Public Health thinks is an
 
00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
important feature for a legalization
 
00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:50.569 align:start position:0%
important feature for a legalization
effort

00:51:50.569 --> 00:51:50.579 align:start position:0%
effort
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
um uh annulments which is another
 
00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:54.300 align:start position:0%
important social Equity provision in
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
cannabis legalization
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not going to cover issues
 
00:51:58.730 --> 00:51:58.740 align:start position:0%
that have already been decided policy
 
00:52:01.069 --> 00:52:01.079 align:start position:0%
wise like the preference for a free
 
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
market model over a state control model
 
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
um I did want to provide you a short
 
00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
list of items for consideration for an
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
additional Amendment
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
um and the list includes typos language
 
00:52:15.049 --> 00:52:15.059 align:start position:0%
changes for consistency and a few
 
00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:18.660 align:start position:0%
substantive issues for uh for discussion
 
00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:19.370 align:start position:0%
substantive issues for uh for discussion
um

00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
first off I'd like to say that from the
 
00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
perspective of the state's therapeutic
 
00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:25.619 align:start position:0%
cannabis program the state control model
 
00:52:30.349 --> 00:52:30.359 align:start position:0%
proposed Works only because it allows
 
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
dual use licenses for atcs to
 
00:52:37.609 --> 00:52:37.619 align:start position:0%
participate in retail sales of a
 
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
cannabis it's the only way this model
 
00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
Works absent this allowance the
 
00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
viability of the atcs to continue to
 
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
participate in the state's therapeutic
 
00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
cannabis program would be severely
 
00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:50.450 align:start position:0%
cannabis program would be severely
threatened

00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:50.460 align:start position:0%
threatened
 
00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:52.500 align:start position:0%
and the viability of the therapeutic
 
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
cannabis program in general would be in
 
00:52:57.170 --> 00:52:57.180 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy so I want to thank you for
 
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:01.740 align:start position:0%
maintaining the allowance for atcs to
 
00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:04.740 align:start position:0%
enter the retail sales Market as
 
00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:06.540 align:start position:0%
proposed by this amendment
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
that being said the bill could be
 
00:53:10.849 --> 00:53:10.859 align:start position:0%
clarified in a number of places
 
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
throughout the bill to make it more
 
00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:14.460 align:start position:0%
explicit there appears to be some
 
00:53:17.089 --> 00:53:17.099 align:start position:0%
conflicting Provisions that say oh all
 
00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:19.980 align:start position:0%
retail sales will be conducted only at
 
00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:22.140 align:start position:0%
State Stores but throughout the bill
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
there are uh the the references to allow
 
00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
dual use certificates for retail sales
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
is maintained so
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
um again some clarity uh should be uh
 
00:53:35.569 --> 00:53:35.579 align:start position:0%
should be exercised in the bill but
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
again maintaining the ability of the
 
00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
atcs to enter this Market is critical
 
00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
for the therapeutic cannabis program to
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
be maintained
 
00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:43.490 align:start position:0%
be maintained
um

00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
from a public health perspective there
 
00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:46.980 align:start position:0%
are three items on this list that I want
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
to emphasize the first being the most
 
00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:50.270 align:start position:0%
to emphasize the first being the most
important

00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
um the first edit appears on page nine
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
of the of the handout
 
00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
um you can see them all highlighted
 
00:53:58.609 --> 00:53:58.619 align:start position:0%
should be easy to follow along
 
00:54:01.069 --> 00:54:01.079 align:start position:0%
um but on page 19 uh the bill
 
00:54:05.089 --> 00:54:05.099 align:start position:0%
establishes a serving size limit of 20
 
00:54:09.010 --> 00:54:09.020 align:start position:0%
milligrams of THC per serving this is a
 
00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:12.780 align:start position:0%
unreasonably high and unsafe serving
 
00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:15.300 align:start position:0%
size amount it should be the statute
 
00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:17.700 align:start position:0%
should should say five milligrams per
 
00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
serving at most there's a provision in
 
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
this bill that allows the Liquor
 
00:54:23.809 --> 00:54:23.819 align:start position:0%
Commission to change that amount through
 
00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:26.460 align:start position:0%
rulemaking but the floor absolutely
 
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:28.559 align:start position:0%
should be five milligrams per serving
 
00:54:30.349 --> 00:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
this is the most critical piece Public
 
00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:33.180 align:start position:0%
Health Wise of this legislation that
 
00:54:36.049 --> 00:54:36.059 align:start position:0%
needs to be changed
 
00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
um the second issue I'd like to
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
highlight is on page 13 which proposes a
 
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
transfer or a plan to transfer the
 
00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:46.740 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program from the
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:54:50.809 --> 00:54:50.819 align:start position:0%
to The Liquor Commission
 
00:54:50.819 --> 00:54:51.829 align:start position:0%
to The Liquor Commission
um

00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
there's no appetite for either agency to
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
have this transfer
 
00:54:59.390 --> 00:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
um this bill would require a plan for
 
00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:01.980 align:start position:0%
that within about two years
 
00:55:05.089 --> 00:55:05.099 align:start position:0%
um I in my opinion this is a holdover
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
from previous uh versions of the bill
 
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
which established a a new cannabis uh
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
commission where that might be more
 
00:55:15.290 --> 00:55:15.300 align:start position:0%
appropriate but under the current model
 
00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:16.980 align:start position:0%
with the Liquor Commission
 
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
um it does not make uh policy sense
 
00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
um from our perspective and probably
 
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
from Liquor's perspective as well uh to
 
00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
consider a transfer of the medical
 
00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
program over to uh the the the
 
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
commercial retail program
 
00:55:34.609 --> 00:55:34.619 align:start position:0%
um so I'd urge that be removed as well
 
00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
um uh the the third uh point I wanted to
 
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
raise on page 16 of the um of the
 
00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.290 align:start position:0%
raise on page 16 of the um of the
handout

00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:42.300 align:start position:0%
handout
 
00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:43.370 align:start position:0%
handout
um

00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:43.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
yeah that's 15 and 16. there's a
 
00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
requirement in the bill for cannabis
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
products to be dispensed in child
 
00:55:54.650 --> 00:55:54.660 align:start position:0%
resistant Packaging
 
00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
but there is no requirement for cannabis
 
00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:01.140 align:start position:0%
to be dispensed in child resistant
 
00:56:03.049 --> 00:56:03.059 align:start position:0%
packaging and because these terms are
 
00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:04.980 align:start position:0%
Divine defined strictly
 
00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
um in section one
 
00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:08.220 align:start position:0%
um this uh this I believe this is an
 
00:56:11.089 --> 00:56:11.099 align:start position:0%
oversight all cannabis flower and all
 
00:56:13.849 --> 00:56:13.859 align:start position:0%
cannabis products uh should be dispensed
 
00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
in child resistant Packaging
 
00:56:19.069 --> 00:56:19.079 align:start position:0%
um so those are the those are the
 
00:56:20.809 --> 00:56:20.819 align:start position:0%
highlights I don't want to take up tons
 
00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
of your time but I I would urge you to
 
00:56:23.809 --> 00:56:23.819 align:start position:0%
go through this list
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
um it's uh there's other issues uh typos
 
00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:27.589 align:start position:0%
um it's uh there's other issues uh typos
redundancies

00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
redundancies
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
um lack of clarity
 
00:56:32.089 --> 00:56:32.099 align:start position:0%
um I guess one of the other I I can't
 
00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
stop myself one of the other things is
 
00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
um there's a there's a provision
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
throughout that allows
 
00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:40.069 align:start position:0%
throughout that allows
um

00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:42.109 --> 00:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
there are references to a municipality
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
uh limiting the number of licenses in
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
their Community however the new section
 
00:56:48.829 --> 00:56:48.839 align:start position:0%
on municipalities and and the
 
00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:50.460 align:start position:0%
requirement for them to take take a vote
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
does not seem to allow them to identify
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
the number of licenses in their uh in
 
00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
their in their in their towns it's only
 
00:56:59.870 --> 00:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
an up or a down yes we have them or no
 
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
we don't um there's also no provision
 
00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
for uh towns and cities to choose which
 
00:57:07.069 --> 00:57:07.079 align:start position:0%
types of facilities in the um uh in
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
their municipalities
 
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
um I'd also point out that there's a a
 
00:57:13.069 --> 00:57:13.079 align:start position:0%
peer there appears to be a redundant
 
00:57:13.079 --> 00:57:14.809 align:start position:0%
peer there appears to be a redundant
appropriation

00:57:14.809 --> 00:57:14.819 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
um for the money coming to us uh HHS
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
um uh and money going to The Liquor
 
00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
Commission one place that says eight
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
million the other place that says 17
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
million in two different sections of the
 
00:57:26.809 --> 00:57:26.819 align:start position:0%
law so again all those are detailed in
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
the in the handout
 
00:57:30.049 --> 00:57:30.059 align:start position:0%
um and I'm happy to you know answer
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
questions about this stuff now or later
 
00:57:33.839 --> 00:57:34.730 align:start position:0%
questions about this stuff now or later
um

00:57:34.730 --> 00:57:34.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:37.069 --> 00:57:37.079 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Cherry has a
 
00:57:37.079 --> 00:57:38.930 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Cherry has a
question

00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:38.940 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um given that this is the
 
00:57:43.609 --> 00:57:43.619 align:start position:0%
house Commerce Committee and not Panera
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
is where I could pick two I'm going to
 
00:57:47.690 --> 00:57:47.700 align:start position:0%
do a 1A and a 1V Mr chairman so I don't
 
00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:49.380 align:start position:0%
have to ask for a follow-up and so here
 
00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:50.700 align:start position:0%
we go
 
00:57:53.809 --> 00:57:53.819 align:start position:0%
um were you involved with this bill as
 
00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
it was drafted and ultimately passed in
 
00:57:59.089 --> 00:57:59.099 align:start position:0%
in this senate committee and the and the
 
00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:01.980 align:start position:0%
Senate as a whole and if so can you
 
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
explain how
 
00:58:07.549 --> 00:58:07.559 align:start position:0%
we could Poss they could possibly have
 
00:58:10.609 --> 00:58:10.619 align:start position:0%
inserted 20 milligrams rather than five
 
00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
in view of the fact that you have
 
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
identified that as unsafe
 
00:58:18.770 --> 00:58:18.780 align:start position:0%
um would they have had to be unaware of
 
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
this because you didn't give that input
 
00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:22.980 align:start position:0%
or anybody else or can you can you
 
00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
address that were you involved and if so
 
00:58:28.490 --> 00:58:28.500 align:start position:0%
how do you explain 20 in this version of
 
00:58:30.290 --> 00:58:30.300 align:start position:0%
the legislation
 
00:58:33.049 --> 00:58:33.059 align:start position:0%
when it is unsafe as you say and and
 
00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
should be five
 
00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:36.900 align:start position:0%
I've been in I've been involved in the
 
00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:40.260 align:start position:0%
development of this legislation since uh
 
00:58:42.890 --> 00:58:42.900 align:start position:0%
the first public hearing on the bill
 
00:58:44.569 --> 00:58:44.579 align:start position:0%
um the Senate did not introduce 20
 
00:58:47.329 --> 00:58:47.339 align:start position:0%
milligrams 20 milligrams came out of the
 
00:58:47.339 --> 00:58:48.589 align:start position:0%
milligrams 20 milligrams came out of the
house

00:58:48.589 --> 00:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:58:50.990 --> 00:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
got sent to the Senate
 
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.609 align:start position:0%
got sent to the Senate
oh

00:58:52.609 --> 00:58:52.619 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:58:54.289 --> 00:58:54.299 align:start position:0%
so his question is why didn't you
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
question it then
 
00:58:57.650 --> 00:58:57.660 align:start position:0%
when I was in the house when 639 in the
 
00:58:59.809 --> 00:58:59.819 align:start position:0%
house we uh because an earlier version
 
00:59:01.370 --> 00:59:01.380 align:start position:0%
of The Bill said
 
00:59:04.849 --> 00:59:04.859 align:start position:0%
um five milligrams and in some setting
 
00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:08.460 align:start position:0%
it was changed uh during executive
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
session and subcommittee work to 20.
 
00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:13.559 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:59:19.130 --> 00:59:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:21.289 --> 00:59:21.299 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs I also had a
 
00:59:23.329 --> 00:59:23.339 align:start position:0%
question on the dose you said that five
 
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
milligrams is a single serving my mom
 
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
was 411 and weighed all of 95 pounds
 
00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:30.780 align:start position:0%
with that I'm just wondering if that
 
00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:32.579 align:start position:0%
would have knocked her on our keister I
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
would have suggested that she start with
 
00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
half that cut cutting it
 
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
half of five would it would that would
 
00:59:40.730 --> 00:59:40.740 align:start position:0%
it be important to indicate that
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere on Packaging
 
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
there are requirements in the bill for
 
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
packaging and information packaging
 
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
information warning labels about the uh
 
00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
the time to affect you know how long it
 
00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:54.900 align:start position:0%
takes you know a product to uh to
 
00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:56.940 align:start position:0%
achieve effect
 
00:59:58.490 --> 00:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
um I believe there's sufficient
 
01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:01.260 align:start position:0%
education requirements in the bill so
 
01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:02.349 align:start position:0%
education requirements in the bill so
that

01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:02.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:07.140 align:start position:0%
dosing is uh is an Education topic that
 
01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
can be given to the public however
 
01:00:12.349 --> 01:00:12.359 align:start position:0%
starting the floor at 20 milligrams will
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely have a profound impact and an
 
01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:17.700 align:start position:0%
increase in accidental what we call
 
01:00:20.089 --> 01:00:20.099 align:start position:0%
poisonings unintentional poisonings of
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Philip
 
01:00:29.329 --> 01:00:29.339 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question uh
 
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
continuing the theme Here of the the
 
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
serving size given that uh five
 
01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:34.980 align:start position:0%
milligrams tends to be the standard
 
01:00:36.589 --> 01:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
serving size would there any be any
 
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
reason to include administrative
 
01:00:40.309 --> 01:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
allowance to change the serving size
 
01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
amount or should it just be set as a
 
01:00:44.329 --> 01:00:44.339 align:start position:0%
standard five milligrams and eliminate
 
01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:46.380 align:start position:0%
the administrative allowance to a change
 
01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
of serving size the administrative
 
01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:52.380 align:start position:0%
allowance for increasing over five was
 
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
language that was added when there was a
 
01:00:58.609 --> 01:00:58.619 align:start position:0%
cannabis Advisory Board in the bill and
 
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:01.740 align:start position:0%
the language uh proposed said
 
01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:04.740 align:start position:0%
um with the approval or the the the the
 
01:01:07.569 --> 01:01:07.579 align:start position:0%
in consultation with the Cannabis
 
01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:11.220 align:start position:0%
Advisory board so the idea here was that
 
01:01:12.829 --> 01:01:12.839 align:start position:0%
um if the Liquor Commission wanted to
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
increase it to say 10 that might be
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable other markets have a 10
 
01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:19.619 align:start position:0%
milligram size
 
01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:21.180 align:start position:0%
um uh and so we wanted to give the like
 
01:01:22.849 --> 01:01:22.859 align:start position:0%
a commission a little bit of flexibility
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
but have that have a um have a have a
 
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
consultation requirement with public
 
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
health experts
 
01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:29.450 align:start position:0%
health experts
um

01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:29.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:31.740 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question
 
01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:34.370 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question
uh

01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
one of the things need to change you
 
01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:39.180 align:start position:0%
know five with no allowance to change or
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
five with an allowance to change
 
01:01:43.609 --> 01:01:43.619 align:start position:0%
um if uh
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
if Liquor Commission were to change it
 
01:01:46.609 --> 01:01:46.619 align:start position:0%
from five to twenty through rulemaking
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
there would be significant uh
 
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
involvement from Advocates about a uh
 
01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:57.289 --> 01:01:57.299 align:start position:0%
um so the question could you talked
 
01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
about packaging
 
01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
so uh with the atcs now do they uh the
 
01:02:05.690 --> 01:02:05.700 align:start position:0%
package the marijuana in a form that
 
01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:07.260 align:start position:0%
children can't open
 
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
yes all cannabis and cannabis products
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh packaged by the ATC has come in child
 
01:02:14.809 --> 01:02:14.819 align:start position:0%
resistant so they already have that uh
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
including um child uh child resistant
 
01:02:18.890 --> 01:02:18.900 align:start position:0%
reclosable child resistant containers
 
01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
for multi-use items so given that atcs
 
01:02:25.010 --> 01:02:25.020 align:start position:0%
are non-profit
 
01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
this this bill would allow them for a
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
for-profit conversation I
 
01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.890 align:start position:0%
for-profit conversation I
the

01:02:30.890 --> 01:02:30.900 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:35.569 --> 01:02:35.579 align:start position:0%
the discussion is about the atcs and
 
01:02:38.089 --> 01:02:38.099 align:start position:0%
that uh you made it clear that they have
 
01:02:41.329 --> 01:02:41.339 align:start position:0%
to be included in the bill
 
01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
um I I didn't read it that way frankly
 
01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
um I read it that the Dual license was
 
01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
so that they could be cannabis producers
 
01:02:52.370 --> 01:02:52.380 align:start position:0%
but that I did see specifically a line
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
in the retail line that says only only
 
01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission can sell it so
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
what what I'm asking you is you're
 
01:03:02.089 --> 01:03:02.099 align:start position:0%
saying that it has to be in here they'll
 
01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
go out of business are you saying that
 
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
that there's not enough medical buyers
 
01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
as compared to what will happen in the
 
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
commission that the commission stores
 
01:03:16.609 --> 01:03:16.619 align:start position:0%
and that the commission stores will be
 
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
lower price
 
01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
than what the atcs are
 
01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
yes interesting okay that this has been
 
01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
our testimony since you know day one
 
01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:28.740 align:start position:0%
when this spill was introduced along
 
01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
with all the other um cannabis
 
01:03:33.289 --> 01:03:33.299 align:start position:0%
legalization bills that are perspective
 
01:03:35.089 --> 01:03:35.099 align:start position:0%
um is you know we need to the state
 
01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
needs to maintain the viability the
 
01:03:38.569 --> 01:03:38.579 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
um and every state that has legalized on
 
01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
cannabis thus far has been able to
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
maintain that program
 
01:03:46.370 --> 01:03:46.380 align:start position:0%
um but one of the key pieces there
 
01:03:48.770 --> 01:03:48.780 align:start position:0%
um for the the successful operation of a
 
01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:51.780 align:start position:0%
medical program after legalization is
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
that legalization models have taxes and
 
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
high taxes so there is a there is a cost
 
01:04:00.530 --> 01:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
benefit for patients
 
01:04:04.010 --> 01:04:04.020 align:start position:0%
to go to the medical dispensaries and
 
01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
purchase untaxed products
 
01:04:10.609 --> 01:04:10.619 align:start position:0%
um each of these versions of the bill
 
01:04:14.030 --> 01:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
makes the Cannabis cheaper and cheaper
 
01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
um and the only way under this model
 
01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
where the only retail sales are either
 
01:04:23.569 --> 01:04:23.579 align:start position:0%
the state or the atcs the atcs need to
 
01:04:25.069 --> 01:04:25.079 align:start position:0%
be able to enter this Market otherwise
 
01:04:27.289 --> 01:04:27.299 align:start position:0%
they there will be they won't be able to
 
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
compete patients will go to where the
 
01:04:31.849 --> 01:04:31.859 align:start position:0%
prices are low even though they're not
 
01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
getting medical education even though
 
01:04:35.030 --> 01:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
they're not getting the products that
 
01:04:38.089 --> 01:04:38.099 align:start position:0%
they need like ratio products CBD THC
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
ratio products products like
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
suppositories that no recreational
 
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
dispense dispensary is going to sell why
 
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the states sell it why would
 
01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
the state sell it well because they want
 
01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:51.470 align:start position:0%
the state sell it well because they want
to

01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:04:54.530 --> 01:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
sell it because they're the one person
 
01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
one entity that's been licensed in a
 
01:04:59.870 --> 01:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
recreational store that has a
 
01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:01.980 align:start position:0%
suppository as a product so that could
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
be what big difference about doing it
 
01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
through the commission is that we would
 
01:05:07.789 --> 01:05:07.799 align:start position:0%
actually be able to be doing things that
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
the that retail stores don't do that is
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
one very minor example illustrating the
 
01:05:15.289 --> 01:05:15.299 align:start position:0%
larger point of
 
01:05:17.569 --> 01:05:17.579 align:start position:0%
in order for this model to be viable the
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
atcs need to be included in retail sales
 
01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
as the amendment proposes the definition
 
01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
of dual use certificate on page four
 
01:05:28.490 --> 01:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
specifically says that allows the atcs
 
01:05:30.410 --> 01:05:30.420 align:start position:0%
to co-locate with and operate a retail
 
01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:32.700 align:start position:0%
cannabis store the rulemaking provisions
 
01:05:35.329 --> 01:05:35.339 align:start position:0%
on Dual use certificates include you
 
01:05:36.770 --> 01:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
know it's it's a whole page on
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
requirements for retail sales clearly
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
the intention of this amendment well is
 
01:05:45.230 --> 01:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
to include atcs and that sales okay
 
01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:46.970 align:start position:0%
to include atcs and that sales okay
gotcha

01:05:46.970 --> 01:05:46.980 align:start position:0%
gotcha
 
01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
all right representative Gibbs thank you
 
01:05:51.049 --> 01:05:51.059 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
um is it possible also that
 
01:05:57.309 --> 01:05:57.319 align:start position:0%
um without the Dual license opportunity
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh that some of the atcs might uh lose
 
01:06:04.849 --> 01:06:04.859 align:start position:0%
business because the therapeutic uh
 
01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
cannabis buyers might just find it
 
01:06:10.130 --> 01:06:10.140 align:start position:0%
simpler uh to go to the retail store
 
01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
without going through the process of
 
01:06:13.789 --> 01:06:13.799 align:start position:0%
getting approved for therapeutic
 
01:06:16.329 --> 01:06:16.339 align:start position:0%
cannabis absolutely yes that happens
 
01:06:19.069 --> 01:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
that is expected to happen with any
 
01:06:22.849 --> 01:06:22.859 align:start position:0%
legalization model uh patients can go as
 
01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
adults to uh uh to recreational uh
 
01:06:29.210 --> 01:06:29.220 align:start position:0%
dispensaries and avoid talking to their
 
01:06:31.789 --> 01:06:31.799 align:start position:0%
doctor avoid paying an administ an
 
01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
application fee for the cannabis card
 
01:06:35.329 --> 01:06:35.339 align:start position:0%
from us
 
01:06:37.309 --> 01:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
um and to avoid being on a essentially
 
01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
what is considered a stake list of uh of
 
01:06:42.049 --> 01:06:42.059 align:start position:0%
of patients so yes absolutely that will
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
happen regardless
 
01:06:47.289 --> 01:06:47.299 align:start position:0%
um so it is important to uh
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
incentivize people to maintain their
 
01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
registration on the on the therapeutic
 
01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:53.870 align:start position:0%
registration on the on the therapeutic
program

01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:06:58.130 --> 01:06:58.140 align:start position:0%
um and not self-medicate thank you
 
01:06:59.930 --> 01:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:07:02.329 --> 01:07:02.339 align:start position:0%
uh chair will call on Nathan Griffin
 
01:07:04.609 --> 01:07:04.619 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire cannabis party he
 
01:07:12.670 --> 01:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:16.730 --> 01:07:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:18.829 --> 01:07:18.839 align:start position:0%
push the button make sure you push the
 
01:07:23.329 --> 01:07:23.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
oh does that work now oh good yeah
 
01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:27.420 align:start position:0%
um I have a little material just to hand
 
01:07:30.109 --> 01:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
out in support of uh one of the points I
 
01:07:54.589 --> 01:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair
 
01:07:58.730 --> 01:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
um members of the committee thank you
 
01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to uh
 
01:08:06.589 --> 01:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
provide a little bit of hopefully
 
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
helpful information on this particular
 
01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:10.609 align:start position:0%
helpful information on this particular
bill

01:08:10.609 --> 01:08:10.619 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:13.740 align:start position:0%
um generally speaking I would say that
 
01:08:17.689 --> 01:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
this is a workable first uh prototype of
 
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
a cannabis legalization program from New
 
01:08:23.269 --> 01:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh it's not perfect it's got a
 
01:08:26.209 --> 01:08:26.219 align:start position:0%
bunch of warts I think there's aspects
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
of it of um of policy that could be
 
01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
improved but um it does appear
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
that um one of the features of this
 
01:08:38.110 --> 01:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
amendment is that it does give a
 
01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
significant amount of discretion over
 
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
the next couple of years
 
01:08:46.309 --> 01:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
um to The Liquor Commission and
 
01:08:48.829 --> 01:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
um my understanding and knowledge is
 
01:08:50.689 --> 01:08:50.699 align:start position:0%
that they've actually put in a fair
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
amount of work in studying this industry
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
over the last year in particular they've
 
01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
gotten up to speed
 
01:08:58.689 --> 01:08:58.699 align:start position:0%
that they would be
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
committed to making this uh successful
 
01:09:04.789 --> 01:09:04.799 align:start position:0%
both for the state in terms of Revenue
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
as well as the general pro lifting the
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
general prosperity of a lot of New
 
01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:13.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents and so I think that
 
01:09:16.930 --> 01:09:16.940 align:start position:0%
that gives us the opportunity to
 
01:09:20.209 --> 01:09:20.219 align:start position:0%
you know make this even more efficient
 
01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
and productive than some of the
 
01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
specifics within the bill so generally
 
01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
speaking I would say that it's a it's a
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
pretty good initial start and I would be
 
01:09:33.229 --> 01:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
in favor of with a couple of minor
 
01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
harmonizing improvements
 
01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
you know to recommend that this bill you
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
know pass and we get started on you know
 
01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
a proper cannabis legalization program
 
01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:47.819 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
um so the couple of points that I wanted
 
01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
to make are um that there is some
 
01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
obsolete language and a couple of things
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
um in here that could um could really
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
throw a bit of a monkey wrench into
 
01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
really into implementation
 
01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:03.660 align:start position:0%
some of which I think has been
 
01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
highlighted by others but one thing that
 
01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
is kind of important and this is related
 
01:10:12.229 --> 01:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
to the handout that I sent out is that
 
01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
um for up until about a year ago there
 
01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
was a lot of confusion in the industry
 
01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
and in government with regard to
 
01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:24.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis seeds and hemp seeds
 
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
they nobody really had clarity as to
 
01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
whether it was really cannabis and
 
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
whether it needed to be only sold let's
 
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
say Day by dispensaries and and licensed
 
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
operators or whether it was more like
 
01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
hemp and given my own background in
 
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis Banking and payments and
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
financial services it was a very
 
01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
bedeviling thing in in which to be
 
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
perfectly Frank um Bankers were more
 
01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:50.290 align:start position:0%
perfectly Frank um Bankers were more
comfortable

01:10:50.290 --> 01:10:50.300 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
01:10:53.090 --> 01:10:53.100 align:start position:0%
banking dispensaries and cultivators
 
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
than they were people who were selling
 
01:10:56.590 --> 01:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
seeds because it was in such a gray area
 
01:11:00.169 --> 01:11:00.179 align:start position:0%
however since the original language that
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
I think has um still kept been kept with
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
regard to seeds particularly um
 
01:11:09.530 --> 01:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
saying that the seeds would have to be
 
01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:11.209 align:start position:0%
saying that the seeds would have to be
um

01:11:11.209 --> 01:11:11.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know made to not be able to
 
01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
germinate and so on um the um DEA
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
um finally came out with
 
01:11:21.169 --> 01:11:21.179 align:start position:0%
um clear
 
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
um guidance on this
 
01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
um and um that's the material that I
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
sent out there's a an article from a
 
01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.590 align:start position:0%
sent out there's a an article from a
trade

01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
trade
 
01:11:32.270 --> 01:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
publication that summarizes that as well
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
as the actual guidance letter that was
 
01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
received by uh somebody who inquired of
 
01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
the DEA and their basic conclusion was
 
01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
that um cannabis products or cannabis
 
01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
plant materials that are under the 0.3
 
01:11:52.189 --> 01:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
percent THC by dry weight definition
 
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
that they have uh that the feds have
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
applied to hemp are considered hemp and
 
01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
this was very clarifying um you know
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
especially from a banking and payments
 
01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
point of view because now what was was
 
01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
able to happen in fact our own
 
01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
professional experience was that we were
 
01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
able to get a lot of clarification and
 
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
Banks were now able to provide normal
 
01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
financial services and banking to uh
 
01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
folks who were producing and selling
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
seeds because now they could basically
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
treat it from a compliance point of view
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
as hemp
 
01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
um so I would like to just call people's
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
attention to
 
01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
well I don't it it's actually on page
 
01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
three of the handout but it's basically
 
01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:42.649 align:start position:0%
three of the handout but it's basically
318-ft

01:12:42.649 --> 01:12:42.659 align:start position:0%
318-ft
 
01:12:45.950 --> 01:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
um colon one definitions um Roman
 
01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
numeral two there are um some references
 
01:12:52.189 --> 01:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
to seeds sterilized seed of the plant
 
01:12:54.530 --> 01:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
that is incapable of germination all
 
01:12:56.689 --> 01:12:56.699 align:start position:0%
this is basically obsolete language and
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
I think that if we leave it in here it's
 
01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
going to create some um uh
 
01:13:04.450 --> 01:13:04.460 align:start position:0%
contradictions that can result in
 
01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
confusion and
 
01:13:09.890 --> 01:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
um and disputes that are entirely
 
01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:11.090 align:start position:0%
um and disputes that are entirely
unnecessary

01:13:11.090 --> 01:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
01:13:14.930 --> 01:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
um so I would um just urge you guys
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
um in the working session to kind of
 
01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
just harmonize uh the you know the
 
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
current federal guidance and Regulatory
 
01:13:24.890 --> 01:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
on cannabis seeds and hemp seeds to be
 
01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
just included in the broad category of
 
01:13:28.970 --> 01:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
hemp which is basically the way it's
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
treated by you know bankers and
 
01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
financial service agencies and the
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
government at this point and and that
 
01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:35.750 align:start position:0%
government at this point and and that
way

01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
um uh you know if to whatever extent we
 
01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
are and there is reference in here to
 
01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:41.510 align:start position:0%
are and there is reference in here to
regulating

01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
regulating
 
01:13:44.209 --> 01:13:44.219 align:start position:0%
um you know hemp by the commission
 
01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
um that uh see it can both cannabis
 
01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
seeds and and hemp seeds be um just
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
considered to be um you know hemp
 
01:13:53.630 --> 01:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
products and and regulated uh to
 
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
whatever extent they are on that kind of
 
01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:56.510 align:start position:0%
whatever extent they are on that kind of
basis

01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:13:59.450 --> 01:13:59.460 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is that um you know I
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
would like to say
 
01:14:04.130 --> 01:14:04.140 align:start position:0%
that because there does seem to be
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
within this amendment a fair amount of
 
01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.970 align:start position:0%
within this amendment a fair amount of
discretion

01:14:07.970 --> 01:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
01:14:10.669 --> 01:14:10.679 align:start position:0%
um that the Liquor Commission would have
 
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
in actually executing and operating uh
 
01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
this um you know kind of hybrid State
 
01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:17.570 align:start position:0%
this um you know kind of hybrid State
model

01:14:17.570 --> 01:14:17.580 align:start position:0%
model
 
01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
um that um it would probably be a better
 
01:14:23.450 --> 01:14:23.460 align:start position:0%
idea if we have any ambition of actually
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
getting this through uh in the next
 
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
three weeks before the end of the
 
01:14:29.149 --> 01:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
legislative session
 
01:14:32.450 --> 01:14:32.460 align:start position:0%
um that um any that we kind of limit any
 
01:14:35.149 --> 01:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
amendments and corrections to um to just
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
kind of harmonize language make sure
 
01:14:38.930 --> 01:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
things are are consistent and minimize
 
01:14:41.330 --> 01:14:41.340 align:start position:0%
the number of tweaks and fixes even
 
01:14:42.830 --> 01:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
though you know there are a number of
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
you know smaller and medium-sized things
 
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
that would probably be better to include
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
in the bill and the reason for that I
 
01:14:52.189 --> 01:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
think is that um if we send too many
 
01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
changes over to the Senate that you know
 
01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
even if they may be um inclined to to
 
01:14:59.330 --> 01:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
work through it uh you know they're not
 
01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
really going to have time and and
 
01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
so a lot of our efforts will really come
 
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
to naught this year so my recommendation
 
01:15:08.330 --> 01:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
there would be that um we limit the
 
01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
number of amendments and changes to
 
01:15:12.169 --> 01:15:12.179 align:start position:0%
things that are you know kind of
 
01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
grammatically or harmonizingly
 
01:15:16.729 --> 01:15:16.739 align:start position:0%
um you know important and not give them
 
01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
too much on their plate to have to
 
01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
digest because they could run out the
 
01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
clock there
 
01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
um and you know to that point
 
01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:24.530 align:start position:0%
um and you know to that point
um

01:15:24.530 --> 01:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
you know one thing that I think that we
 
01:15:29.330 --> 01:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
should have some concern about and that
 
01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:30.470 align:start position:0%
should have some concern about and that
is

01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:15:32.810 --> 01:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
um it's less of an issue it I I think
 
01:15:35.090 --> 01:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
it's good public policy that we have
 
01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
annulment or expungement of criminal
 
01:15:40.490 --> 01:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
records for people who have um you know
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
had you know had uh
 
01:15:46.130 --> 01:15:46.140 align:start position:0%
not large-scale uh cartel type dealers
 
01:15:48.050 --> 01:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
but people who have had relatively small
 
01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
brushes with the law with regard to
 
01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:52.140 align:start position:0%
cannabis up to this point
 
01:15:54.610 --> 01:15:54.620 align:start position:0%
um that that would be good public policy
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that it's absolutely
 
01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
mandatory in an entire private
 
01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:01.570 align:start position:0%
mandatory in an entire private
commercial

01:16:01.570 --> 01:16:01.580 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
environment but I think one of the
 
01:16:05.689 --> 01:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
problems that we're going to run into
 
01:16:08.090 --> 01:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
and this could really derail this
 
01:16:12.649 --> 01:16:12.659 align:start position:0%
entirely is to have the state engage in
 
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
activities and practices that let's say
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
you know six or twelve months before you
 
01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
know people have you know paid um uh you
 
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
know legal prices and had consequences
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
and jail time and have a criminal record
 
01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
or um or uh you know that that
 
01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
contradiction could could result in
 
01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and other issues like that so I
 
01:16:34.970 --> 01:16:34.980 align:start position:0%
I would certainly suggest that there is
 
01:16:37.970 --> 01:16:37.980 align:start position:0%
some process by which people can obtain
 
01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
you know expungement of their records my
 
01:16:41.689 --> 01:16:41.699 align:start position:0%
suggestion is it might be less
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
burdensome on the state
 
01:16:46.010 --> 01:16:46.020 align:start position:0%
um if that was um but but like you said
 
01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
there's some things we can do today with
 
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
this bill and some things we might have
 
01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
okay I was just making that suggestion
 
01:16:53.630 --> 01:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah okay if you if you do we are
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
aware of the problem but that that
 
01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
probably needs to come after we've done
 
01:16:59.630 --> 01:16:59.640 align:start position:0%
something first okay well again I'm just
 
01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
concerned that uh that it you know could
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
derail things because people could be
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:17:05.810 --> 01:17:05.820 align:start position:0%
you know feel that that contradiction
 
01:17:09.770 --> 01:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
was uh you know unjust so anyway that's
 
01:17:11.689 --> 01:17:11.699 align:start position:0%
uh great all I had to add all right
 
01:17:13.209 --> 01:17:13.219 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the opportunity
 
01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
to testify today uh the purpose of this
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
testimony is not to re uh reiterate the
 
01:17:35.570 --> 01:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
numerous ways in which recreational
 
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
marijuana negatively impacts the states
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
in which it is legalized that
 
01:17:41.810 --> 01:17:41.820 align:start position:0%
information has been presented to the
 
01:17:43.370 --> 01:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
committee it's presented to the house
 
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's presented to the Senate and yet and
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
yet here we are keep we keep trying even
 
01:17:48.719 --> 01:17:49.610 align:start position:0%
yet here we are keep we keep trying even
though

01:17:49.610 --> 01:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
though
 
01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:50.450 align:start position:0%
though
um

01:17:50.450 --> 01:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:52.490 --> 01:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
even though they're we don't want to
 
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
accept the data in science that's out
 
01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
there on that the focus of this
 
01:17:57.050 --> 01:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
testimony is actually to discuss the
 
01:17:59.630 --> 01:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
amendment uh for this amendment and to
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
discuss the two key additions that I saw
 
01:18:03.649 --> 01:18:03.659 align:start position:0%
in the bill they've already been uh
 
01:18:05.330 --> 01:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
brought up and I'll just quickly go over
 
01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
page five line 19. it adds to the
 
01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
definition of a cannabis store is
 
01:18:13.490 --> 01:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
operated by the state of New Hampshire
 
01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
the other addition to this this is that
 
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
was not included in the original HP 39
 
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
language the second thing that I saw was
 
01:18:26.149 --> 01:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
page seven lines 23 through 35. there's
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
three new sections sections one two and
 
01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
three what these additions do is they
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
identify that all Cannabis stores will
 
01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
be operated by the state it carves out
 
01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
an operating system where decision
 
01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
making of this program goes directly
 
01:18:39.649 --> 01:18:39.659 align:start position:0%
through the Liquor Commission and
 
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
bypasses administrative rulemaking with
 
01:18:44.689 --> 01:18:44.699 align:start position:0%
administer with legislative oversight
 
01:18:46.729 --> 01:18:46.739 align:start position:0%
and it gives the commission authority to
 
01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
contract almost all aspects of this new
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
business with private contractors
 
01:18:54.050 --> 01:18:54.060 align:start position:0%
what this is doing is this is actually
 
01:18:55.850 --> 01:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
giving the impromater of having a
 
01:18:57.649 --> 01:18:57.659 align:start position:0%
state-run recreational marijuana program
 
01:18:59.810 --> 01:18:59.820 align:start position:0%
while quietly allowing private marijuana
 
01:19:02.209 --> 01:19:02.219 align:start position:0%
businesses to be the ones to nearly
 
01:19:04.610 --> 01:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
sustain the whole operation
 
01:19:07.010 --> 01:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
uh this is seems to me it's a bit of a
 
01:19:09.530 --> 01:19:09.540 align:start position:0%
quasi version of Last sessions 1598
 
01:19:12.169 --> 01:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
without uh without the state banking
 
01:19:14.090 --> 01:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
system and also without the liability
 
01:19:16.729 --> 01:19:16.739 align:start position:0%
protections for uh marijuana retail
 
01:19:16.739 --> 01:19:18.530 align:start position:0%
protections for uh marijuana retail
employees

01:19:18.530 --> 01:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
these additions to the language are
 
01:19:22.970 --> 01:19:22.980 align:start position:0%
significant and they rate being
 
01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
discussed in a more public fashion in a
 
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
more open fashion rather than having
 
01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
them buried into the text of a
 
01:19:32.270 --> 01:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
multi-page Amendment
 
01:19:33.709 --> 01:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
these changes actually make the
 
01:19:35.090 --> 01:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
amendment look like it was a rushed
 
01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
attempt to respond to Governor snooda's
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
request for recreational marijuana bill
 
01:19:42.530 --> 01:19:42.540 align:start position:0%
that he very mistakenly feels will
 
01:19:44.689 --> 01:19:44.699 align:start position:0%
legalize this drug in a way that can be
 
01:19:46.189 --> 01:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
controlled and doesn't harm Granite
 
01:19:46.199 --> 01:19:47.229 align:start position:0%
controlled and doesn't harm Granite
Staters

01:19:47.229 --> 01:19:47.239 align:start position:0%
Staters
 
01:19:49.850 --> 01:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
through the governor's flip-flop on
 
01:19:51.770 --> 01:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
recreational marijuana in the ninth hour
 
01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:54.300 align:start position:0%
of the lettuce legislative session to
 
01:19:56.689 --> 01:19:56.699 align:start position:0%
this committee's willingness to jam in
 
01:19:58.250 --> 01:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
this bill that's already been shot down
 
01:19:59.510 --> 01:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
in the Senate
 
01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
into the amendment language actually
 
01:20:04.189 --> 01:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
that quietly changes some very
 
01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
fundamental parts of this of the intent
 
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
of this language it's clear that this
 
01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
isn't any way to legislate
 
01:20:14.030 --> 01:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
the whole scenario tells me that this
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
committee is no longer doing the will of
 
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
the people it's trying to do an end
 
01:20:20.570 --> 01:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
round around the Senate and instead of
 
01:20:22.970 --> 01:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
spending the last week's uh finalizing
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
some of the bills it's looking to play
 
01:20:27.050 --> 01:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
politics with legislation I apologize if
 
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
that offends anybody but it just seems
 
01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
like it
 
01:20:33.010 --> 01:20:33.020 align:start position:0%
this is wrong it shouldn't be happening
 
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
this amendment should be a standalone
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
bill that it's introduced next year so
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
they can be just discussed properly and
 
01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
out in the open
 
01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
and I would I know that some of the
 
01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
discussion today was on labeling and on
 
01:20:48.050 --> 01:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
dosing and I just wanted to add to that
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
that the late I'm glad that Mr Holt
 
01:20:52.970 --> 01:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
discussed labeling and dosing and that
 
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
was a comment that you all had
 
01:20:56.810 --> 01:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
labeling and dosing for the medical
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
marijuana program is currently not as
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
adequate as it should be and there needs
 
01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
to be more patient education that was
 
01:21:06.890 --> 01:21:06.900 align:start position:0%
identified in Senate bill 180. it was
 
01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
successfully passed in the Senate and
 
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
then this bill took that public the
 
01:21:15.530 --> 01:21:15.540 align:start position:0%
consumer protection Bill and retained it
 
01:21:18.110 --> 01:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
it was a good bill and it actually
 
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
deserves your your second look it
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
actually deserves to be moved forward if
 
01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
Public Public Health oversight is your
 
01:21:27.229 --> 01:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
main goal
 
01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
uh I would like to say in closing I just
 
01:21:32.209 --> 01:21:32.219 align:start position:0%
have one request and I and this is I've
 
01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
not heard this today but in all of the
 
01:21:37.130 --> 01:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
discussion about recreational marijuana
 
01:21:39.050 --> 01:21:39.060 align:start position:0%
the one thing that people keep saying is
 
01:21:42.050 --> 01:21:42.060 align:start position:0%
that is that they're doing it for the
 
01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
will of the people because there's
 
01:21:45.530 --> 01:21:45.540 align:start position:0%
overwhelming public demand well there's
 
01:21:47.810 --> 01:21:47.820 align:start position:0%
not and we know that the UNH poll that
 
01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
always gets cited is flawed and the
 
01:21:51.530 --> 01:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
better poll to be looking at would be
 
01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
Emerson College which shows the majority
 
01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
majority of New Hampshire residents
 
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
actually are not clamoring for
 
01:21:59.330 --> 01:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
legalization and it's time for
 
01:22:01.490 --> 01:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
legislators so stop using people as
 
01:22:03.709 --> 01:22:03.719 align:start position:0%
human Shields so you can justify
 
01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
marijuana for State profit
 
01:22:08.630 --> 01:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
if public demand was the utmost
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
importance of everything you do the nine
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
people in this room would not would have
 
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
voted for parental rights because 80
 
01:22:19.250 --> 01:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
percent of families and parents want
 
01:22:22.570 --> 01:22:22.580 align:start position:0%
that nearly 80. well thank you
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
all I'm saying is that don't use
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
pump the will of the people as an excuse
 
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
I respectfully request that you do not
 
01:22:39.890 --> 01:22:39.900 align:start position:0%
Advance this amendment
 
01:22:41.930 --> 01:22:41.940 align:start position:0%
ushering legislation this way is wrong
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
in the behavior only communicates to the
 
01:22:45.649 --> 01:22:45.659 align:start position:0%
public view that this is a legislative
 
01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
game and not a serious effort to have a
 
01:22:50.330 --> 01:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
discussion on a solemn topic
 
01:22:52.850 --> 01:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
chair will call on Matt Simon from
 
01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:13.430 align:start position:0%
chair will call on Matt Simon from
primeatc

01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:14.930 --> 01:23:14.940 align:start position:0%
excuse me Mr chairman is it not
 
01:23:17.630 --> 01:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
customary to ask after someone testifies
 
01:23:19.450 --> 01:23:19.460 align:start position:0%
if there are any questions
 
01:23:21.890 --> 01:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
did you have a question I'm sorry I
 
01:23:23.330 --> 01:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
looked around I didn't see anybody's
 
01:23:26.630 --> 01:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
hand up I didn't well uh do we have to
 
01:23:28.610 --> 01:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
signify by raising hands before you ask
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
the question I will make sure that I ask
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
just asking procedurally if we're not
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
going to have questions no I I I thought
 
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
it was just an oversight okay thank you
 
01:23:44.030 --> 01:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:46.430 --> 01:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
good morning Matt good morning Mr
 
01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:48.410 align:start position:0%
good morning Matt good morning Mr
chairman

01:23:48.410 --> 01:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:23:50.330 --> 01:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
for the record Matt Simon I represent
 
01:23:53.390 --> 01:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
Prime ATC you all know me by now been
 
01:23:56.630 --> 01:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
here several times this year
 
01:23:58.250 --> 01:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
I felt a little bit like Charles Dickens
 
01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
trying to decide how to testify on this
 
01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:01.070 align:start position:0%
trying to decide how to testify on this
bill

01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:24:03.290 --> 01:24:03.300 align:start position:0%
is the worst best of amendments it was
 
01:24:05.689 --> 01:24:05.699 align:start position:0%
the worst of amendments not entirely
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
sure what we're talking about here so
 
01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
I'll comment on
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
two ways that this could be interpreted
 
01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
I'm guilty of having read page four
 
01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
lines 31 30 and 31 where it says a dual
 
01:24:19.370 --> 01:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
use certificate means license allowing
 
01:24:20.930 --> 01:24:20.940 align:start position:0%
an alternative treatment center to
 
01:24:23.689 --> 01:24:23.699 align:start position:0%
co-locate with and operate a retail
 
01:24:25.970 --> 01:24:25.980 align:start position:0%
cannabis store
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
and I
 
01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you
 
01:24:35.390 --> 01:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
as I said page four lines 30 31 say dual
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
use certificates mean license allowing
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment center
 
01:24:42.050 --> 01:24:42.060 align:start position:0%
to operate to co-locate with and operate
 
01:24:44.689 --> 01:24:44.699 align:start position:0%
a retail cannabis store so we were
 
01:24:47.689 --> 01:24:47.699 align:start position:0%
taking that at its word and believing
 
01:24:49.490 --> 01:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
that this was an attempt to actually
 
01:24:52.130 --> 01:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
create a workable compromise between the
 
01:24:54.290 --> 01:24:54.300 align:start position:0%
state control model and a model that
 
01:24:56.689 --> 01:24:56.699 align:start position:0%
included Private Sales
 
01:24:59.090 --> 01:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
so if that is what we're talking about I
 
01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
think we're talking about a potentially
 
01:25:02.209 --> 01:25:02.219 align:start position:0%
workable compromise if we're talking
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
about as a system that is only state-run
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
stores I think we're talking about an
 
01:25:08.630 --> 01:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
unworkable boondoggle that we would have
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
no choice but to absolutely oppose for
 
01:25:13.850 --> 01:25:13.860 align:start position:0%
the reasons we opposed House Bill 1598
 
01:25:14.990 --> 01:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
last year
 
01:25:16.669 --> 01:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
so I want to back up a little bit having
 
01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
made that comment I want to say I
 
01:25:19.970 --> 01:25:19.980 align:start position:0%
appreciate the comments that have come
 
01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
from the corner office focusing on harm
 
01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
reduction and the the primary goal of
 
01:25:28.130 --> 01:25:28.140 align:start position:0%
cannabis regulation should be to reduce
 
01:25:30.830 --> 01:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
harms that has been my message for the
 
01:25:33.530 --> 01:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
last 15 years there are harms associated
 
01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
with prohibition that can only be
 
01:25:38.450 --> 01:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
resolved and addressed via responsible
 
01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:39.890 align:start position:0%
resolved and addressed via responsible
regulation

01:25:39.890 --> 01:25:39.900 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
01:25:41.930 --> 01:25:41.940 align:start position:0%
so evaluating this amendment on that
 
01:25:43.729 --> 01:25:43.739 align:start position:0%
basis would the amendment actually
 
01:25:46.010 --> 01:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
reduce harms well we'll reduce some
 
01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
harms any legalization bill would reduce
 
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
some harms because adults would no
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
longer be fined or arrested for cannabis
 
01:25:53.630 --> 01:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
possession that's why there's so much
 
01:25:56.270 --> 01:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
impetus to get this done thousands of
 
01:25:57.890 --> 01:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
granite Staters are driving across the
 
01:25:59.930 --> 01:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
border coming back with cannabis they're
 
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
being fined and arrested it's unjust it
 
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
should end tomorrow
 
01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
there are a whole other set of harms
 
01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
that are prohibition related harms these
 
01:26:12.890 --> 01:26:12.900 align:start position:0%
are harms that you can only end if you
 
01:26:14.990 --> 01:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
create a functional regulatory system
 
01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
and create a market that actually works
 
01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
would this bill create a functional
 
01:26:23.149 --> 01:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
regulated market for cannabis in my
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
opinion it would not if it if it is
 
01:26:28.430 --> 01:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
amended to clearly allow sales by atcs
 
01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
and agency stores then probably yes if
 
01:26:33.229 --> 01:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
it's limited to state-run stores the
 
01:26:35.330 --> 01:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
most likely result is that it will be as
 
01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
I said an unworkable boondoggle so what
 
01:26:40.189 --> 01:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
I've given you is written testimony is
 
01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
an op-ed published by my former
 
01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
colleague Karen O'Keefe with the
 
01:26:45.770 --> 01:26:45.780 align:start position:0%
marijuana policy project it ran in the
 
01:26:48.050 --> 01:26:48.060 align:start position:0%
Concord Monitor today I hope every
 
01:26:49.610 --> 01:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
member of the general court will take
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
time to read this op-ed because Karen is
 
01:26:54.290 --> 01:26:54.300 align:start position:0%
an attorney who has been dealing with
 
01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
the intersection of federal and state
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis policies for about 20 years
 
01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
she is seen every state that has thought
 
01:27:04.729 --> 01:27:04.739 align:start position:0%
about going down this road to state-run
 
01:27:04.739 --> 01:27:06.110 align:start position:0%
about going down this road to state-run
stores

01:27:06.110 --> 01:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
stores
 
01:27:08.930 --> 01:27:08.940 align:start position:0%
try it on sounds like a good idea and
 
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
then you get a few steps down the road
 
01:27:13.550 --> 01:27:13.560 align:start position:0%
and they all back out they all stop
 
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
because it is a direct conflict with
 
01:27:18.530 --> 01:27:18.540 align:start position:0%
federal law it's very different for a
 
01:27:21.169 --> 01:27:21.179 align:start position:0%
state to pass a law that merely licenses
 
01:27:23.629 --> 01:27:23.639 align:start position:0%
private entities to risk Federal arrest
 
01:27:25.550 --> 01:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
and prosecution because make no that
 
01:27:27.550 --> 01:27:27.560 align:start position:0%
mistake that is what we're doing
 
01:27:31.250 --> 01:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
uh to be engaging in this business is to
 
01:27:33.649 --> 01:27:33.659 align:start position:0%
commit federal crimes so these can
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
either be done
 
01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
there is Federal Protection in the form
 
01:27:39.229 --> 01:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
of a budget amendment but we are dealing
 
01:27:41.810 --> 01:27:41.820 align:start position:0%
with a situation where cannabis is still
 
01:27:43.370 --> 01:27:43.380 align:start position:0%
illegal under federal law
 
01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
and we have a federal policy that
 
01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:48.060 align:start position:0%
tolerates State cannabis sales as long
 
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
as they're regulated
 
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
but no state has taken the step of
 
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
actually running its own stores and I
 
01:27:55.490 --> 01:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
simply don't believe they will I think
 
01:27:57.110 --> 01:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
the most likely
 
01:27:59.450 --> 01:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
outcome is they won't do it and there
 
01:28:00.830 --> 01:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
won't be any stores
 
01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:02.750 align:start position:0%
won't be any stores
so

01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:05.930 --> 01:28:05.940 align:start position:0%
we have expressed repeatedly a
 
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
willingness to compromise on this we
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
just we demonstrated during the process
 
01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:12.900 align:start position:0%
for 639 we're perfectly willing to
 
01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:14.340 align:start position:0%
accept the Liquor Commission as a
 
01:28:16.610 --> 01:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
regulatory agency they have zero
 
01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:18.420 align:start position:0%
experience with cannabis as far as I
 
01:28:19.850 --> 01:28:19.860 align:start position:0%
know they've never touched a cannabis
 
01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:20.689 align:start position:0%
know they've never touched a cannabis
plant

01:28:20.689 --> 01:28:20.699 align:start position:0%
plant
 
01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
but we're willing to trust that they can
 
01:28:25.250 --> 01:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
deal with the Steep learning curve that
 
01:28:27.709 --> 01:28:27.719 align:start position:0%
will exist and do this if the law is
 
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
written correctly as we thought 639 was
 
01:28:33.410 --> 01:28:33.420 align:start position:0%
we're willing to accept even that
 
01:28:35.570 --> 01:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
state-run stores can be part of a
 
01:28:38.689 --> 01:28:38.699 align:start position:0%
successful Statewide policy but what we
 
01:28:40.970 --> 01:28:40.980 align:start position:0%
cannot accept is that excluding atcs
 
01:28:42.770 --> 01:28:42.780 align:start position:0%
from retail sales is in any way
 
01:28:44.930 --> 01:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
consistent with the principles of harm
 
01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:45.950 align:start position:0%
consistent with the principles of harm
reduction

01:28:45.950 --> 01:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program is a harm
 
01:28:51.229 --> 01:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
reduction program our mission is harm
 
01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
reduction we dispense cannabis we've
 
01:28:57.050 --> 01:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
been doing it for six and a half years
 
01:28:59.570 --> 01:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
the three atcs between them have about
 
01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
20 years experience dispensing cannabis
 
01:29:04.629 --> 01:29:04.639 align:start position:0%
in compliance with strict regulations
 
01:29:07.010 --> 01:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
the last few years we've had oversight
 
01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
from 11 medical professionals on the
 
01:29:10.669 --> 01:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
therapeutic medical cannabis medical
 
01:29:12.350 --> 01:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
oversight board
 
01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:15.060 align:start position:0%
we've been under a microscope since day
 
01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
one the opponents who fought against
 
01:29:18.649 --> 01:29:18.659 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis have been waiting
 
01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
for the single slightest screw-up so
 
01:29:22.850 --> 01:29:22.860 align:start position:0%
they can come in here and try to take
 
01:29:26.209 --> 01:29:26.219 align:start position:0%
our program away try to clamp down on it
 
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
there have been no reports of problems
 
01:29:31.370 --> 01:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
associated with the atcs and their
 
01:29:33.890 --> 01:29:33.900 align:start position:0%
dispensing of cannabis we've been a
 
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
model of successful very limited model
 
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
but a model of successful regulation and
 
01:29:42.890 --> 01:29:42.900 align:start position:0%
as Mr Holt said if this bill Amendment
 
01:29:45.410 --> 01:29:45.420 align:start position:0%
were to pass as is it the most likely
 
01:29:47.629 --> 01:29:47.639 align:start position:0%
result well there are two sets of likely
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
result one is that it won't be
 
01:29:51.649 --> 01:29:51.659 align:start position:0%
implemented in which case you've got a
 
01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
boondoggle the other is that it is
 
01:29:55.970 --> 01:29:55.980 align:start position:0%
actually implemented successfully and
 
01:29:57.470 --> 01:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
maybe interstate commerce happens and
 
01:29:58.910 --> 01:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
you can import cannabis from somewhere
 
01:30:01.070 --> 01:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
else well we don't need the atcs anymore
 
01:30:02.810 --> 01:30:02.820 align:start position:0%
we don't need the therapeutic cannabis
 
01:30:04.970 --> 01:30:04.980 align:start position:0%
program anymore we're just going to have
 
01:30:07.129 --> 01:30:07.139 align:start position:0%
state-run stores and that's going to be
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
the way so we can't sit idly by and
 
01:30:14.030 --> 01:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
pretend that that's okay
 
01:30:16.189 --> 01:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
wiping away everything that we've worked
 
01:30:18.050 --> 01:30:18.060 align:start position:0%
for to build a successful therapeutic
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
cannabis program over the last seven
 
01:30:22.370 --> 01:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
years everything that Prime ATC staff
 
01:30:26.510 --> 01:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
has worked hard for uh would be placed
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
in serious risk
 
01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:31.010 align:start position:0%
in serious risk
so

01:30:31.010 --> 01:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:31.020 --> 01:30:33.470 align:start position:0%
so
I

01:30:33.470 --> 01:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:30:35.689 --> 01:30:35.699 align:start position:0%
since this committee did not consider HB
 
01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
1598 that was in the criminal justice
 
01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
committee last year I'd like to hit a
 
01:30:41.930 --> 01:30:41.940 align:start position:0%
few of the talking points that I hit a
 
01:30:43.250 --> 01:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
lot last year when we were dealing with
 
01:30:46.970 --> 01:30:46.980 align:start position:0%
1598. there's a lot of people who love
 
01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
the state liquor stores and it's easy to
 
01:30:51.649 --> 01:30:51.659 align:start position:0%
understand why if you like alcohol you
 
01:30:54.290 --> 01:30:54.300 align:start position:0%
walk into a state liquor store you see
 
01:30:56.629 --> 01:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
rum from Jamaica you see the best
 
01:30:59.810 --> 01:30:59.820 align:start position:0%
bourbon from Kentucky you see sake from
 
01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:00.950 align:start position:0%
bourbon from Kentucky you see sake from
Japan

01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
Japan
 
01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative almie's favorite wine is
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
always there unless they have a bad year
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
and then it's not there but the product
 
01:31:09.890 --> 01:31:09.900 align:start position:0%
selection is amazing the prices are
 
01:31:12.050 --> 01:31:12.060 align:start position:0%
lower than neighboring states it's very
 
01:31:15.709 --> 01:31:15.719 align:start position:0%
consumer friendly so people might assume
 
01:31:19.370 --> 01:31:19.380 align:start position:0%
that state-run cannabis store will be
 
01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:21.110 align:start position:0%
that state-run cannabis store will be
similar

01:31:21.110 --> 01:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
similar
 
01:31:22.850 --> 01:31:22.860 align:start position:0%
the only way it can be similar is if
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce happens and you're
 
01:31:26.450 --> 01:31:26.460 align:start position:0%
able to import California and Oregon and
 
01:31:28.910 --> 01:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
all these other states products we can't
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
assume that will happen next year we
 
01:31:32.209 --> 01:31:32.219 align:start position:0%
have no idea when that might happen
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
until it happens cannabis markets have
 
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
to be entirely intrastate which means no
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
product will be on the Shelf of the
 
01:31:41.810 --> 01:31:41.820 align:start position:0%
state-run cannabis store unless a New
 
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire business produced that product
 
01:31:47.629 --> 01:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
now what kind of business is going to
 
01:31:49.010 --> 01:31:49.020 align:start position:0%
invest money
 
01:31:51.169 --> 01:31:51.179 align:start position:0%
in a program where the most likely
 
01:31:52.669 --> 01:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
result is it's not even going to be
 
01:31:54.410 --> 01:31:54.420 align:start position:0%
implemented and we're going to spend a
 
01:31:55.790 --> 01:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
bunch of money and not be able to bring
 
01:31:57.470 --> 01:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
our products to Market
 
01:32:00.169 --> 01:32:00.179 align:start position:0%
that sounds like a recipe for absolute
 
01:32:03.310 --> 01:32:03.320 align:start position:0%
disaster Financial ruin for businesses
 
01:32:06.169 --> 01:32:06.179 align:start position:0%
policy embarrassment for the state it is
 
01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
not appealing to us in any way
 
01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:11.870 align:start position:0%
not appealing to us in any way
um

01:32:11.870 --> 01:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:14.030 --> 01:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
as has been said if Growers and
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
processors don't like the prices offered
 
01:32:17.570 --> 01:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
by the state it's a crime to sell to
 
01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
literally anybody else
 
01:32:21.770 --> 01:32:21.780 align:start position:0%
if you're a distiller in New Hampshire
 
01:32:23.870 --> 01:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
you can sell your New Hampshire made rum
 
01:32:25.250 --> 01:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
to anybody in the world that wants to
 
01:32:27.410 --> 01:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
buy it but if you're a cannabis grower
 
01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and you know like the
 
01:32:29.930 --> 01:32:29.940 align:start position:0%
deal you're getting from the Liquor
 
01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
Commission you're suddenly going to feel
 
01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
like a farmer in the former Soviet Union
 
01:32:37.610 --> 01:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
because you have no recourse
 
01:32:39.530 --> 01:32:39.540 align:start position:0%
and if you do sell it outside the system
 
01:32:40.970 --> 01:32:40.980 align:start position:0%
that would be a felony and you might
 
01:32:42.410 --> 01:32:42.420 align:start position:0%
wind up in the New Hampshire equivalent
 
01:32:44.330 --> 01:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
of a gulag
 
01:32:47.149 --> 01:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
let's not go down this road please Mr
 
01:32:47.159 --> 01:32:55.250 align:start position:0%
let's not go down this road please Mr
chairman

01:32:55.250 --> 01:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:57.110 --> 01:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
so with regard to the therapeutic canvas
 
01:32:58.790 --> 01:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
program we've already reached a point of
 
01:33:01.550 --> 01:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
basically stagnant growth it's because
 
01:33:03.530 --> 01:33:03.540 align:start position:0%
cannabis is available across the border
 
01:33:07.370 --> 01:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
in every direction in cheap stores the
 
01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
prices have plummeted because there are
 
01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
hundreds of producers
 
01:33:13.010 --> 01:33:13.020 align:start position:0%
Maine is essentially the wild Northeast
 
01:33:14.930 --> 01:33:14.940 align:start position:0%
of cannabis there are hundreds and
 
01:33:17.390 --> 01:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
hundreds of very lightly regulated
 
01:33:19.669 --> 01:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis producers
 
01:33:21.290 --> 01:33:21.300 align:start position:0%
a little known fact they don't even
 
01:33:23.450 --> 01:33:23.460 align:start position:0%
require independent lab testing in the
 
01:33:25.070 --> 01:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis Market in Maine so
 
01:33:26.750 --> 01:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
that's a cost that's imposed on New
 
01:33:29.629 --> 01:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire atcs that is not imposed on
 
01:33:33.950 --> 01:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
Main operators we Face a number of major
 
01:33:36.890 --> 01:33:36.900 align:start position:0%
operating disadvantages relative to less
 
01:33:38.510 --> 01:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
heavily regulated businesses in
 
01:33:40.189 --> 01:33:40.199 align:start position:0%
neighboring states
 
01:33:42.530 --> 01:33:42.540 align:start position:0%
we want effective regulation
 
01:33:44.930 --> 01:33:44.940 align:start position:0%
we want it for adult use just as we want
 
01:33:47.689 --> 01:33:47.699 align:start position:0%
it for therapeutic cannabis
 
01:33:49.970 --> 01:33:49.980 align:start position:0%
this amendment doesn't do it unless we
 
01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:51.540 align:start position:0%
are talking about a version that allows
 
01:33:54.709 --> 01:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
atcs to sell cannabis so if we are happy
 
01:33:55.910 --> 01:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
to discuss
 
01:33:59.149 --> 01:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
compromise and if not it's really nice
 
01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
outside let's enjoy the beautiful
 
01:34:04.129 --> 01:34:04.139 align:start position:0%
weather and see what happens in a study
 
01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
commission thank you Mr chair okay thank
 
01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:09.420 align:start position:0%
you very much representative Philo
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony you
 
01:34:12.610 --> 01:34:12.620 align:start position:0%
mentioned that two possible options
 
01:34:15.169 --> 01:34:15.179 align:start position:0%
outcomes of this bill would be either
 
01:34:16.910 --> 01:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
that we pass it and decide to not go
 
01:34:18.890 --> 01:34:18.900 align:start position:0%
through with it or that the therapeutic
 
01:34:21.229 --> 01:34:21.239 align:start position:0%
cannabis have uh program were to fall
 
01:34:22.669 --> 01:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
apart as a result of this bill being
 
01:34:25.550 --> 01:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
passed would a third possible outcome be
 
01:34:26.890 --> 01:34:26.900 align:start position:0%
that we actually pass the Bill
 
01:34:29.209 --> 01:34:29.219 align:start position:0%
implements it in that that somebody
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
withstanding were to sue in the federal
 
01:34:32.930 --> 01:34:32.940 align:start position:0%
courts the entire program becomes
 
01:34:35.330 --> 01:34:35.340 align:start position:0%
enjoined and the state has
 
01:34:37.689 --> 01:34:37.699 align:start position:0%
tar on its face as a result of having a
 
01:34:40.189 --> 01:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
program that it passed being joined by
 
01:34:41.629 --> 01:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
01:34:42.530 --> 01:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:34:44.209 --> 01:34:44.219 align:start position:0%
representative I did not mean to suggest
 
01:34:45.530 --> 01:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
that there are only two possible
 
01:34:47.390 --> 01:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
outcomes I think the outcome you
 
01:34:49.010 --> 01:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
describe is contained within the first
 
01:34:51.169 --> 01:34:51.179 align:start position:0%
outcome of it won't be implemented and
 
01:34:54.649 --> 01:34:54.659 align:start position:0%
will be at boondoggle thank you
 
01:34:56.570 --> 01:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
okay we do have more questions
 
01:34:58.189 --> 01:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs
 
01:34:59.750 --> 01:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for taking my question
 
01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
I just want to understand
 
01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:04.620 align:start position:0%
um your position I I know where you're
 
01:35:07.490 --> 01:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
at with the atcs and and the retail
 
01:35:10.669 --> 01:35:10.679 align:start position:0%
outlet are you also envisioning other
 
01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
types of of retail uh stores being run
 
01:35:15.290 --> 01:35:15.300 align:start position:0%
by entrepreneurs
 
01:35:17.870 --> 01:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh as you
 
01:35:20.570 --> 01:35:20.580 align:start position:0%
know we advocated for HB 639 which would
 
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
have created a robust free market
 
01:35:25.129 --> 01:35:25.139 align:start position:0%
approach to cannabis we have never asked
 
01:35:27.649 --> 01:35:27.659 align:start position:0%
for a special treatment at all we want
 
01:35:29.810 --> 01:35:29.820 align:start position:0%
to create a fair market that bill would
 
01:35:31.970 --> 01:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
have allowed adult use businesses to to
 
01:35:33.530 --> 01:35:33.540 align:start position:0%
serve the therapeutic cannabis program
 
01:35:35.209 --> 01:35:35.219 align:start position:0%
if they got a therapeutic cannabis
 
01:35:37.310 --> 01:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
endorsement we put a lot of thought how
 
01:35:39.530 --> 01:35:39.540 align:start position:0%
to make this not special treatment for
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
the atcs but we're that being said not
 
01:35:44.629 --> 01:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
going to stand idly by while something
 
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
passes that would wipe out our program
 
01:35:50.689 --> 01:35:50.699 align:start position:0%
and take away our reason to exist and we
 
01:35:52.850 --> 01:35:52.860 align:start position:0%
think it would do that if it restricts
 
01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
or if it doesn't allow ET sale ATC sales
 
01:35:57.229 --> 01:35:57.239 align:start position:0%
another question yeah and just to
 
01:36:00.110 --> 01:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
clarify again you're saying no to State
 
01:36:02.689 --> 01:36:02.699 align:start position:0%
one Cannabis stores
 
01:36:05.450 --> 01:36:05.460 align:start position:0%
no I I didn't say that I thought we were
 
01:36:06.649 --> 01:36:06.659 align:start position:0%
here to talk about a potential
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
compromise the amendment as I read it
 
01:36:10.010 --> 01:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
would have been an improvement over HB
 
01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
1598 it would have allowed both
 
01:36:14.810 --> 01:36:14.820 align:start position:0%
privately owned agency stores which I
 
01:36:16.189 --> 01:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
knew nothing about until I started
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
reading about them but they would be
 
01:36:19.790 --> 01:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
somewhat they would be privately owned
 
01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
and operated but very much tied into the
 
01:36:25.010 --> 01:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
to the state system and that would be
 
01:36:28.430 --> 01:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
one option and allowing atcs to engage
 
01:36:30.530 --> 01:36:30.540 align:start position:0%
in Private Sales would be another option
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
I thought we were talking about a hybrid
 
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
approach that would allow some ATC
 
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
stores some agency stores some state-run
 
01:36:39.649 --> 01:36:39.659 align:start position:0%
stores if in fact they are viable and
 
01:36:41.209 --> 01:36:41.219 align:start position:0%
that we would be talking about a viable
 
01:36:43.070 --> 01:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
compromise thanks
 
01:36:45.770 --> 01:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
okay representative McAleer uh thank you
 
01:36:47.149 --> 01:36:47.159 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
01:36:50.330 --> 01:36:50.340 align:start position:0%
um last night we uh as Representatives
 
01:36:52.910 --> 01:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
got also got a letter from Karen O'Keefe
 
01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
and I thought you were sort of going
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
there because she talked about a a
 
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
safety valve to get out if you read this
 
01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
particular letter and but you just you
 
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
sort of didn't go there could you
 
01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
explain how that would work
 
01:37:09.890 --> 01:37:09.900 align:start position:0%
well it's it's not my position to
 
01:37:12.290 --> 01:37:12.300 align:start position:0%
advocate for a safety valve I worked for
 
01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
that Organization for 10 years and
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
Karen's good friend of mine and former
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
colleague but uh
 
01:37:19.669 --> 01:37:19.679 align:start position:0%
her her ask was twofold either have a
 
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
safety valve or allow Private Sales by
 
01:37:25.010 --> 01:37:25.020 align:start position:0%
atcs uh from our perspective if it's
 
01:37:26.629 --> 01:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
just a safety valve it's it's not
 
01:37:28.370 --> 01:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
sufficient to save the therapeutic
 
01:37:31.490 --> 01:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
canvas program if the state stores were
 
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
to become operational if interstate
 
01:37:36.290 --> 01:37:36.300 align:start position:0%
commerce were to to take to become
 
01:37:39.410 --> 01:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
viable we would be wiped out
 
01:37:42.890 --> 01:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
represent Gibbs thank you uh doesn't
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
this Amendment provide for dual use
 
01:37:49.790 --> 01:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
licenses so that atcs could
 
01:37:53.330 --> 01:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
um uh also do recreational Cannabis
 
01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:54.470 align:start position:0%
um uh also do recreational Cannabis
business

01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:37:57.770 --> 01:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
representative that is exactly what it
 
01:38:00.890 --> 01:38:00.900 align:start position:0%
says on page four line 30 and 31 and
 
01:38:02.570 --> 01:38:02.580 align:start position:0%
there are references throughout the bill
 
01:38:05.169 --> 01:38:05.179 align:start position:0%
to dual use certificates and and and
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
dispensing and things like that but
 
01:38:09.410 --> 01:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
there are also two places in the bill
 
01:38:12.290 --> 01:38:12.300 align:start position:0%
where it says all retail stores shall be
 
01:38:15.229 --> 01:38:15.239 align:start position:0%
run by the state I initially thought the
 
01:38:17.930 --> 01:38:17.940 align:start position:0%
intent was the workable compromise and
 
01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
there have been amendments suggested to
 
01:38:21.470 --> 01:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
clean up that language and make it clear
 
01:38:24.169 --> 01:38:24.179 align:start position:0%
that the compromise version is what was
 
01:38:26.209 --> 01:38:26.219 align:start position:0%
actually intended but what I've been
 
01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
hearing this morning is not that so
 
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
again it is the best of amendments and
 
01:38:35.570 --> 01:38:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:37.970 --> 01:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
so the question there is
 
01:38:40.129 --> 01:38:40.139 align:start position:0%
um if there was a compromise then we
 
01:38:44.590 --> 01:38:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:46.850 --> 01:38:46.860 align:start position:0%
I didn't say that we needed to create a
 
01:38:49.030 --> 01:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
tax I said that we need to have a system
 
01:38:51.169 --> 01:38:51.179 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some imagination
 
01:38:53.390 --> 01:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
because the state's planning to extract
 
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
revenue from Cannabis sales without
 
01:38:57.950 --> 01:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
having attacks so
 
01:38:59.689 --> 01:38:59.699 align:start position:0%
there is probably a way to do that
 
01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
within the code the only other way we've
 
01:39:03.229 --> 01:39:03.239 align:start position:0%
done it through liquor is we have agency
 
01:39:06.050 --> 01:39:06.060 align:start position:0%
stores but those agency stores are
 
01:39:08.570 --> 01:39:08.580 align:start position:0%
getting the product wholesale through
 
01:39:10.370 --> 01:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
the commission so they're paying a
 
01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:11.330 align:start position:0%
the commission so they're paying a
markup

01:39:11.330 --> 01:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
markup
 
01:39:15.110 --> 01:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
if in other words if you that that puts
 
01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
this way you couldn't be a cultivator
 
01:39:20.770 --> 01:39:20.780 align:start position:0%
and a retailer because the cultivator
 
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
provides the product to the commission
 
01:39:24.649 --> 01:39:24.659 align:start position:0%
then the commission would provide the
 
01:39:27.169 --> 01:39:27.179 align:start position:0%
product back to the ATC so that would be
 
01:39:28.910 --> 01:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
the problem you'll have to figure out in
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
the next week
 
01:39:32.090 --> 01:39:32.100 align:start position:0%
well I don't know that I'm the one that
 
01:39:34.010 --> 01:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
needs to figure it out Mr chairman but I
 
01:39:36.350 --> 01:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that we would be selling
 
01:39:37.970 --> 01:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
products other than the ones that we
 
01:39:39.649 --> 01:39:39.659 align:start position:0%
produce and the products we produce
 
01:39:40.610 --> 01:39:40.620 align:start position:0%
would be coming from The Liquor
 
01:39:43.550 --> 01:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
Commission system and therefore it would
 
01:39:46.729 --> 01:39:46.739 align:start position:0%
already be ex the the profit or tax or
 
01:39:48.590 --> 01:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
whatever the revenue would already be
 
01:39:50.810 --> 01:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
extracted before we get it I don't know
 
01:39:52.250 --> 01:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
how it would handle the products we
 
01:39:53.870 --> 01:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
produce whether we would have to sell
 
01:39:55.370 --> 01:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
them to the Liquor Commission and buy
 
01:39:57.290 --> 01:39:57.300 align:start position:0%
them back to sell to adults I don't know
 
01:39:59.629 --> 01:39:59.639 align:start position:0%
that's at least viable in concept
 
01:40:01.850 --> 01:40:01.860 align:start position:0%
cutting us out of sales is not viable
 
01:40:04.129 --> 01:40:04.139 align:start position:0%
fair enough okay
 
01:40:06.290 --> 01:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
you know anybody else any more questions
 
01:40:09.290 --> 01:40:09.300 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much uh we're we're
 
01:40:11.390 --> 01:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
behind on time so I asked people who
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
when they come up could you please uh be
 
01:40:15.250 --> 01:40:15.260 align:start position:0%
a model of brevity
 
01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh next up is uh Jim Riddle
 
01:40:28.490 --> 01:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
you the hemp farmer
 
01:40:36.350 --> 01:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
I tried not to look like a farmer today
 
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
right yeah my name is Jim Riddle Mr
 
01:40:43.250 --> 01:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee uh thank
 
01:40:45.530 --> 01:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
you for holding this hearing
 
01:40:49.129 --> 01:40:49.139 align:start position:0%
um I also uh I lived at Hillsboro New
 
01:40:51.890 --> 01:40:51.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I serve as a policy
 
01:40:54.530 --> 01:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
advisor for NH can the New Hampshire
 
01:40:57.169 --> 01:40:57.179 align:start position:0%
cannabis Association but the comments I
 
01:40:59.390 --> 01:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
offered today are on my own behalf fair
 
01:41:03.110 --> 01:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
enough I do hold a USDA uh hemp grower
 
01:41:07.550 --> 01:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:10.610 --> 01:41:10.620 align:start position:0%
to produce seeds
 
01:41:13.790 --> 01:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
but under my license requirements a USDA
 
01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:15.530 align:start position:0%
but under my license requirements a USDA
rules

01:41:15.530 --> 01:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:41:18.590 --> 01:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
I have to destroy any plant materials
 
01:41:23.570 --> 01:41:23.580 align:start position:0%
that exceed 0.3 percent THC
 
01:41:25.570 --> 01:41:25.580 align:start position:0%
and I can do that by burying them
 
01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
burning them composting them and I love
 
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
making compost so that's not a problem
 
01:41:34.490 --> 01:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
seeds are what I'm interested in and the
 
01:41:37.370 --> 01:41:37.380 align:start position:0%
DEA it was mentioned previously has
 
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
officially determined that any cannabis
 
01:41:41.930 --> 01:41:41.940 align:start position:0%
seeds regardless of their genetic
 
01:41:44.570 --> 01:41:44.580 align:start position:0%
potential are hemp
 
01:41:48.530 --> 01:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
um and that is one part of your bill in
 
01:41:54.350 --> 01:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
the definition of cannabis that should
 
01:41:57.770 --> 01:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
be amended by removing seeds seeds
 
01:41:59.930 --> 01:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
belong in the definition and description
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
of hemp that's in that definition of
 
01:42:06.310 --> 01:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis and seed growers should not be
 
01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
regulated under any uh cannabis we're
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
already regulated under the USDA hemp
 
01:42:13.679 --> 01:42:14.930 align:start position:0%
already regulated under the USDA hemp
program

01:42:14.930 --> 01:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:42:18.169 --> 01:42:18.179 align:start position:0%
but I'm ready to invest in craft
 
01:42:18.179 --> 01:42:19.729 align:start position:0%
but I'm ready to invest in craft
cannabis

01:42:19.729 --> 01:42:19.739 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
01:42:22.490 --> 01:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
and turn those byproducts at compost
 
01:42:25.010 --> 01:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
into valuable product
 
01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:29.820 align:start position:0%
but only in a open competitive market
 
01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:31.250 align:start position:0%
but only in a open competitive market
um

01:42:31.250 --> 01:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:35.090 --> 01:42:35.100 align:start position:0%
it's on May 6th and 7th my wife and I to
 
01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
celebrate our 38th wedding anniversary
 
01:42:40.490 --> 01:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
attended to Vermont cannabis and hemp
 
01:42:43.310 --> 01:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
Expo near Burlington
 
01:42:46.250 --> 01:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
I I was really impressed by the turnout
 
01:42:48.770 --> 01:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
there were well over 2 000 people in
 
01:42:51.050 --> 01:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
attendance but what really impressed me
 
01:42:54.290 --> 01:42:54.300 align:start position:0%
was the exhibitors there were over 120
 
01:42:57.530 --> 01:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
exhibits and the number and variety of
 
01:43:00.590 --> 01:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
businesses that are supporting uh uh
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis is what I really was I expected
 
01:43:06.050 --> 01:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
to see cultivators and dispensaries but
 
01:43:08.330 --> 01:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
there were Bankers with booths insurance
 
01:43:11.090 --> 01:43:11.100 align:start position:0%
companies greenhouse builders Farm
 
01:43:13.850 --> 01:43:13.860 align:start position:0%

universities and much more and the the
 
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
whole Expo was just a buzz and I
 
01:43:34.370 --> 01:43:34.380 align:start position:0%
don't mean that as people being buzzed
 
01:43:37.010 --> 01:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
it was a buzz of economic activity
 
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
people were making deals I mean all over
 
01:43:43.669 --> 01:43:43.679 align:start position:0%
the place and it was really encouraging
 
01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
to see you and I even met people from
 
01:43:48.470 --> 01:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that were there investing
 
01:43:50.810 --> 01:43:50.820 align:start position:0%
in the Vermont market now that's money
 
01:43:53.090 --> 01:43:53.100 align:start position:0%
that's just going out of state just like
 
01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:54.719 align:start position:0%
all the consumers that are driving
 
01:43:58.729 --> 01:43:58.739 align:start position:0%
across the borders and then driving back
 
01:43:58.739 --> 01:44:01.189 align:start position:0%
across the borders and then driving back
um

01:44:01.189 --> 01:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
but I've been uh you know listening to
 
01:44:06.050 --> 01:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
the uh debate uh here in the legislature
 
01:44:07.370 --> 01:44:07.380 align:start position:0%
and one of the most promising things
 
01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
I've learned is research showing that
 
01:44:12.770 --> 01:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
cannabis legalization has been shown
 
01:44:15.709 --> 01:44:15.719 align:start position:0%
repeatedly now to decrease dependency on
 
01:44:15.719 --> 01:44:17.450 align:start position:0%
repeatedly now to decrease dependency on
opioids

01:44:17.450 --> 01:44:17.460 align:start position:0%
opioids
 
01:44:19.790 --> 01:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
and one of the studies the title is
 
01:44:21.790 --> 01:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
cannabis significant significantly
 
01:44:24.649 --> 01:44:24.659 align:start position:0%
reduces the use of prescription opioids
 
01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
and improves the quality of life and
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
authorities and authorized patients
 
01:44:32.450 --> 01:44:32.460 align:start position:0%
results of a large perspective study and
 
01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
that study concluded the high rate of
 
01:44:37.250 --> 01:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
Cannabis used for chronic pain and the
 
01:44:39.370 --> 01:44:39.380 align:start position:0%
subsequent reductions in opioid use
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
suggest that cannabis may play a harm
 
01:44:44.750 --> 01:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
reduction role in the opioid overdose
 
01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
crisis potentially improving the quality
 
01:44:49.490 --> 01:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
of life of patients and overall Public
 
01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:51.109 align:start position:0%
of life of patients and overall Public
Health

01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
Health
 
01:44:53.930 --> 01:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
with your leadership we have a chance to
 
01:44:55.550 --> 01:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
help stop
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
at least put a good dent in New
 
01:45:00.890 --> 01:45:00.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's opioid epidemic
 
01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
we can keep the Cannabis dollars in our
 
01:45:05.149 --> 01:45:05.159 align:start position:0%
state while capturing revenue for drug
 
01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
abuse prevention and treatment
 
01:45:09.590 --> 01:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
we have a chance to stop unnecessary
 
01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
arrests and incarceration
 
01:45:14.810 --> 01:45:14.820 align:start position:0%
and redirect police resources to focus
 
01:45:16.609 --> 01:45:16.619 align:start position:0%
on real crimes
 
01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
we can provide income for farmers and
 
01:45:22.189 --> 01:45:22.199 align:start position:0%
businesses and stimulate economic
 
01:45:24.830 --> 01:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
activity if done right
 
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
now finally I urge you to amend the bill
 
01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
that you're considering to allow home
 
01:45:33.709 --> 01:45:33.719 align:start position:0%
cultivation I know this is Steve Hill
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
but especially for medical cannabis
 
01:45:37.199 --> 01:45:38.410 align:start position:0%
but especially for medical cannabis
patients

01:45:38.410 --> 01:45:38.420 align:start position:0%
patients
 
01:45:43.010 --> 01:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
and HB 611 already passed the house it's
 
01:45:46.370 --> 01:45:46.380 align:start position:0%
been tabled by the Senate
 
01:45:46.380 --> 01:45:47.270 align:start position:0%
been tabled by the Senate
um

01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:50.229 --> 01:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
I think it's really important that
 
01:45:53.930 --> 01:45:53.940 align:start position:0%
especially medical patients have the
 
01:45:57.229 --> 01:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
ability to choose what varieties what
 
01:46:00.590 --> 01:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
strains what balance is best for them
 
01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
and I think the atcs do a great job but
 
01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:05.930 align:start position:0%
and I think the atcs do a great job but
they

01:46:05.930 --> 01:46:05.940 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:46:09.370 --> 01:46:09.380 align:start position:0%
aren't everywhere it's a it's a big uh
 
01:46:12.890 --> 01:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
Hassle and cost and and also uh just not
 
01:46:15.229 --> 01:46:15.239 align:start position:0%
available for people
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
um to always drive to them or to find
 
01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
what they're looking for and
 
01:46:20.639 --> 01:46:23.209 align:start position:0%
what they're looking for and
just

01:46:23.209 --> 01:46:23.219 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:46:26.090 --> 01:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
there's been comment that you can't grow
 
01:46:29.390 --> 01:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
good cannabis outdoors in New Hampshire
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
and that's just simply not true in fact
 
01:46:34.189 --> 01:46:34.199 align:start position:0%
more and more research in the Cannabis
 
01:46:38.090 --> 01:46:38.100 align:start position:0%
trade is showing that outdoor Sun grown
 
01:46:40.129 --> 01:46:40.139 align:start position:0%
that gets exercised from the wind that
 
01:46:42.550 --> 01:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
gets attacked by pests
 
01:46:47.629 --> 01:46:47.639 align:start position:0%
actually produces much more uh balanced
 
01:46:49.609 --> 01:46:49.619 align:start position:0%
terpenes those are like the flavor
 
01:46:52.250 --> 01:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
profile of cannabis that's what has
 
01:46:55.010 --> 01:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
different effects out whereas indoor
 
01:46:57.410 --> 01:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
grown is like comparing a tomato from a
 
01:46:59.209 --> 01:46:59.219 align:start position:0%
greenhouse to one that was grown
 
01:47:01.490 --> 01:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
outdoors in your Healthy soil in your
 
01:47:05.950 --> 01:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
garden it's just has much more
 
01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
complexity uh so and you certainly there
 
01:47:12.950 --> 01:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
are varieties that will finish in a 120
 
01:47:14.810 --> 01:47:14.820 align:start position:0%
day if you can grow peaches you can grow
 
01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:15.890 align:start position:0%
day if you can grow peaches you can grow
pot

01:47:15.890 --> 01:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
pot
 
01:47:18.129 --> 01:47:18.139 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:47:21.649 --> 01:47:21.659 align:start position:0%
we learned something new every day great
 
01:47:22.970 --> 01:47:22.980 align:start position:0%
thank you very much do we have any
 
01:47:24.830 --> 01:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
questions representative McAleer uh
 
01:47:26.450 --> 01:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:47:28.370 --> 01:47:28.380 align:start position:0%
um just a quick clarification when you
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
say that a homegrown pot are you talking
 
01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
about only people that have a medical
 
01:47:36.109 --> 01:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
card or anybody well there's a bill uh
 
01:47:38.570 --> 01:47:38.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question there's a
 
01:47:41.090 --> 01:47:41.100 align:start position:0%
bill that's tabled by the Senate that
 
01:47:44.270 --> 01:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
would only allow medical card holders
 
01:47:45.709 --> 01:47:45.719 align:start position:0%
that would be a good place to start
 
01:47:47.629 --> 01:47:47.639 align:start position:0%
because that bill already exists it's
 
01:47:50.209 --> 01:47:50.219 align:start position:0%
been heard and the Senate didn't kill it
 
01:47:52.970 --> 01:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
they tabled it so that's a good starting
 
01:47:56.450 --> 01:47:56.460 align:start position:0%
point but to me if there's going to be a
 
01:47:59.570 --> 01:47:59.580 align:start position:0%
monopoly run by the state and the atcs
 
01:48:01.490 --> 01:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
that's not many
 
01:48:05.209 --> 01:48:05.219 align:start position:0%
much variety I think the compromise the
 
01:48:08.930 --> 01:48:08.940 align:start position:0%
balance is okay seeds are already in
 
01:48:11.990 --> 01:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce I can order any seed
 
01:48:14.330 --> 01:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
I want the post office will deliver it
 
01:48:17.530 --> 01:48:17.540 align:start position:0%
because the DEA has said seeds are hemp
 
01:48:21.169 --> 01:48:21.179 align:start position:0%
and so people can get seeds it's not a
 
01:48:23.390 --> 01:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
problem to get seeds of any kind of
 
01:48:26.270 --> 01:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
strain you want that interstate commerce
 
01:48:29.390 --> 01:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
is already happening there so why not
 
01:48:31.790 --> 01:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
balance the state control State making
 
01:48:35.450 --> 01:48:35.460 align:start position:0%
money atcs making the money with people
 
01:48:38.030 --> 01:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
making having Freedom Liberty to make
 
01:48:40.850 --> 01:48:40.860 align:start position:0%
their own choices so that's but start
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
with the medical because the bill
 
01:48:43.669 --> 01:48:43.679 align:start position:0%
already exists
 
01:48:44.990 --> 01:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:48:47.510 --> 01:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
yeah representative
 
01:48:49.790 --> 01:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
my only question is
 
01:48:53.030 --> 01:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:55.250 --> 01:48:55.260 align:start position:0%
I like the previous speaker I have mixed
 
01:48:59.209 --> 01:48:59.219 align:start position:0%
feelings I support legalization I do not
 
01:49:02.030 --> 01:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
support a soviet-style state-run
 
01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:04.870 align:start position:0%
support a soviet-style state-run
monopoly

01:49:04.870 --> 01:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
monopoly
 
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
now if the atcs can stay in it and
 
01:49:10.010 --> 01:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
especially if you can allow medical
 
01:49:13.070 --> 01:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
homegrown I think you got a good bill
 
01:49:14.570 --> 01:49:14.580 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions from the
 
01:49:16.910 --> 01:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
committee none thank you very much thank
 
01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:17.689 align:start position:0%
committee none thank you very much thank
you

01:49:17.689 --> 01:49:17.699 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:49:21.290 --> 01:49:21.300 align:start position:0%
uh Heather Brown you didn't put any time
 
01:49:23.689 --> 01:49:23.699 align:start position:0%
so but can you promise me you'll be
 
01:49:26.330 --> 01:49:26.340 align:start position:0%
quick and not say anything new or
 
01:49:28.729 --> 01:49:28.739 align:start position:0%
different or say only things new nothing
 
01:49:31.790 --> 01:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
I tend not to put a time because you
 
01:49:33.590 --> 01:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
know sometimes you give me more than 30
 
01:49:36.910 --> 01:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
seconds and I appreciate it
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
I've never been known to cut anybody off
 
01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:49.850 align:start position:0%
 
proceed

01:49:49.850 --> 01:49:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:53.689 --> 01:49:53.699 align:start position:0%
I would like to say that I appreciate
 
01:49:56.030 --> 01:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
the efforts that individuals have made
 
01:49:59.090 --> 01:49:59.100 align:start position:0%
at tackling the issue regarding
 
01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:01.090 align:start position:0%
at tackling the issue regarding
legalization

01:50:01.090 --> 01:50:01.100 align:start position:0%
legalization
 
01:50:01.100 --> 01:50:02.649 align:start position:0%
legalization
unfortunately

01:50:02.649 --> 01:50:02.659 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
01:50:07.070 --> 01:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
literally I believe lines
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
sorry don't worry about the lines just
 
01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
give us the point I just want to tell
 
01:50:15.229 --> 01:50:15.239 align:start position:0%
you sir thank you for my opportunity
 
01:50:18.649 --> 01:50:18.659 align:start position:0%
literally lines 1 through 28
 
01:50:21.229 --> 01:50:21.239 align:start position:0%
are excellent in this bill the rest of
 
01:50:23.209 --> 01:50:23.219 align:start position:0%
the bill should be tossed this is an
 
01:50:26.330 --> 01:50:26.340 align:start position:0%
awful Amendment this is horrible
 
01:50:29.450 --> 01:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
line 29 on the first page actually
 
01:50:32.990 --> 01:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
states that no one other than the state
 
01:50:34.910 --> 01:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
would be able to be involved in the
 
01:50:37.629 --> 01:50:37.639 align:start position:0%
retail sales of cannabis
 
01:50:41.030 --> 01:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
has a member of the therapeutic cannabis
 
01:50:44.590 --> 01:50:44.600 align:start position:0%
medical oversight board I believe that
 
01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
this bill this amendment jeopardizes the
 
01:50:50.090 --> 01:50:50.100 align:start position:0%
future of the therapeutic cannabis
 
01:50:53.090 --> 01:50:53.100 align:start position:0%
program it puts all of our patients at
 
01:50:58.189 --> 01:50:58.199 align:start position:0%
risk it puts our atcs at risk it puts it
 
01:51:02.450 --> 01:51:02.460 align:start position:0%
opens it opens up a door for patients to
 
01:51:06.890 --> 01:51:06.900 align:start position:0%
have to resort to the black market or to
 
01:51:09.290 --> 01:51:09.300 align:start position:0%
traveling over state lines more so than
 
01:51:11.209 --> 01:51:11.219 align:start position:0%
what they are already doing
 
01:51:14.209 --> 01:51:14.219 align:start position:0%
I do not think New Hampshire should be
 
01:51:17.149 --> 01:51:17.159 align:start position:0%
going backwards in regards to cannabis I
 
01:51:19.609 --> 01:51:19.619 align:start position:0%
think we should be moving forward I do
 
01:51:22.250 --> 01:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
not believe this bill moves forward for
 
01:51:24.770 --> 01:51:24.780 align:start position:0%
everyone that would potentially utilize
 
01:51:27.729 --> 01:51:27.739 align:start position:0%
cannabis whether they are patient or not
 
01:51:30.770 --> 01:51:30.780 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
01:51:34.430 --> 01:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
it is appreciated by all of us and there
 
01:51:36.470 --> 01:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
is nobody in this room that wants
 
01:51:39.229 --> 01:51:39.239 align:start position:0%
legalization more than what I do but
 
01:51:41.229 --> 01:51:41.239 align:start position:0%
this is not the way to do it
 
01:51:44.510 --> 01:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
jeopardizing one group of people for the
 
01:51:46.910 --> 01:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
sake of the state being able to make a
 
01:51:50.750 --> 01:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
little extra money is inappropriate I as
 
01:51:52.970 --> 01:51:52.980 align:start position:0%
a patient if I lose the therapeutic
 
01:51:56.270 --> 01:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis program then I myself would be
 
01:51:58.910 --> 01:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
forced either to revert back to crossing
 
01:52:01.790 --> 01:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
state lines or into the black market
 
01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
because even proposed the system
 
01:52:07.850 --> 01:52:07.860 align:start position:0%
proposed in this bill would not be able
 
01:52:10.490 --> 01:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
to allow me to treat my medical
 
01:52:13.129 --> 01:52:13.139 align:start position:0%
conditions in the same way that I have
 
01:52:15.590 --> 01:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
been treating them for the last several
 
01:52:19.370 --> 01:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
years I should not be put into that
 
01:52:21.290 --> 01:52:21.300 align:start position:0%
position neither should any other
 
01:52:23.330 --> 01:52:23.340 align:start position:0%
patient within the state
 
01:52:26.629 --> 01:52:26.639 align:start position:0%
I have to agree although I appreciated
 
01:52:28.430 --> 01:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
his statements on allowing medical
 
01:52:32.890 --> 01:52:32.900 align:start position:0%
homegrow I don't think that this bill
 
01:52:36.350 --> 01:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
would allow that as an option or that
 
01:52:40.010 --> 01:52:40.020 align:start position:0%
that's even a thought for it I believe
 
01:52:43.609 --> 01:52:43.619 align:start position:0%
that really at this point I mean I I
 
01:52:46.129 --> 01:52:46.139 align:start position:0%
know that the governor came around and
 
01:52:49.729 --> 01:52:49.739 align:start position:0%
made the statements that he made and I
 
01:52:51.770 --> 01:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
know that another individual said you
 
01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:52.609 align:start position:0%
know that another individual said you
know

01:52:52.609 --> 01:52:52.619 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't hide behind doing it for
 
01:52:57.649 --> 01:52:57.659 align:start position:0%
the people well I am one of your people
 
01:53:01.310 --> 01:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
and I do want legalization but I do not
 
01:53:04.729 --> 01:53:04.739 align:start position:0%
want it in this fashion I believe that
 
01:53:07.790 --> 01:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
the individuals that should be able to
 
01:53:10.250 --> 01:53:10.260 align:start position:0%
participate in this market
 
01:53:13.070 --> 01:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
are the citizens of New Hampshire if
 
01:53:14.689 --> 01:53:14.699 align:start position:0%
you're worried about creating a
 
01:53:17.090 --> 01:53:17.100 align:start position:0%
marijuana mile like we've seen in many
 
01:53:20.510 --> 01:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
other states then please put licensing
 
01:53:24.169 --> 01:53:24.179 align:start position:0%
caps in put caps in in regards to how
 
01:53:26.209 --> 01:53:26.219 align:start position:0%
many particular businesses can be
 
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
allowed in a particular area do it that
 
01:53:33.290 --> 01:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
way it is very possible make New
 
01:53:36.169 --> 01:53:36.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire unappealing to out-of-state
 
01:53:39.410 --> 01:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
large cannabis corporations that would
 
01:53:43.490 --> 01:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
come in here and decimate the market
 
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
just like they have done in Maine just
 
01:53:49.370 --> 01:53:49.380 align:start position:0%
like they have done in Massachusetts and
 
01:53:51.410 --> 01:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
just like they have done it out in
 
01:53:53.450 --> 01:53:53.460 align:start position:0%
California in Colorado and many other
 
01:53:53.460 --> 01:53:54.590 align:start position:0%
California in Colorado and many other
areas

01:53:54.590 --> 01:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
you know if you want New Hampshire to be
 
01:53:59.870 --> 01:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
different than the rest of the nation
 
01:54:04.129 --> 01:54:04.139 align:start position:0%
that has legalized then let's put caps
 
01:54:08.149 --> 01:54:08.159 align:start position:0%
let's put restrictions let's not allow
 
01:54:12.229 --> 01:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
every individual to be able to have a
 
01:54:14.149 --> 01:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
license to be able to open a business
 
01:54:17.330 --> 01:54:17.340 align:start position:0%
put the restrictions in that way don't
 
01:54:19.970 --> 01:54:19.980 align:start position:0%
make it so that the only people that are
 
01:54:22.570 --> 01:54:22.580 align:start position:0%
allowed to participate
 
01:54:25.370 --> 01:54:25.380 align:start position:0%
sufficiently and successfully within
 
01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
cannabis in New Hampshire is the state
 
01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:29.209 align:start position:0%
cannabis in New Hampshire is the state
itself

01:54:29.209 --> 01:54:29.219 align:start position:0%
itself
 
01:54:31.790 --> 01:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
that's doing an injustice to the people
 
01:54:37.310 --> 01:54:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:37.320 --> 01:54:38.410 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:54:38.410 --> 01:54:38.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:45.950 --> 01:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
my question is how many stores do we
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
have in this system
 
01:54:52.070 --> 01:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
we have a hundred liquor stores 100
 
01:54:53.689 --> 01:54:53.699 align:start position:0%
give or take
 
01:54:57.709 --> 01:54:57.719 align:start position:0%
so we have a cap on how many stores can
 
01:55:00.590 --> 01:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
have marijuana if this if this passes
 
01:55:02.570 --> 01:55:02.580 align:start position:0%
this way we're not going to sell
 
01:55:04.070 --> 01:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
marijuana in the liquor stores they
 
01:55:07.970 --> 01:55:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:10.669 --> 01:55:10.679 align:start position:0%
why aren't we okay that's a good I did
 
01:55:12.770 --> 01:55:12.780 align:start position:0%
not know that I thought this the stores
 
01:55:15.770 --> 01:55:15.780 align:start position:0%
were going to be no a portion of a state
 
01:55:17.450 --> 01:55:17.460 align:start position:0%
liquor store no they're going to be
 
01:55:19.070 --> 01:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
Standalone stores
 
01:55:24.189 --> 01:55:24.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:27.410 --> 01:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
there is a cap in my mind and maybe
 
01:55:30.590 --> 01:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
that's I'm incorrect but there's take
 
01:55:32.330 --> 01:55:32.340 align:start position:0%
the hundred stores
 
01:55:36.169 --> 01:55:36.179 align:start position:0%
now they're standalones I find out and
 
01:55:39.550 --> 01:55:39.560 align:start position:0%
that is a cap and I understand that if a
 
01:55:42.649 --> 01:55:42.659 align:start position:0%
city like Manchester says we don't want
 
01:55:42.659 --> 01:55:43.669 align:start position:0%
city like Manchester says we don't want
them

01:55:43.669 --> 01:55:43.679 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:55:45.490 --> 01:55:45.500 align:start position:0%
they can't be in Manchester
 
01:55:49.070 --> 01:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh and and so I'm I'm a little confused
 
01:55:50.510 --> 01:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
as to
 
01:55:52.189 --> 01:55:52.199 align:start position:0%
your your
 
01:55:56.870 --> 01:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
we have a cap uh a number but it's not
 
01:56:03.410 --> 01:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
the right number for you
 
01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
no my point was in reference to if you
 
01:56:12.229 --> 01:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
allowed a system where private citizens
 
01:56:14.870 --> 01:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
could participate in the Cannabis Market
 
01:56:17.810 --> 01:56:17.820 align:start position:0%
where they could be the ones to sell it
 
01:56:21.129 --> 01:56:21.139 align:start position:0%
retail produce cultivate and manufacture
 
01:56:26.330 --> 01:56:26.340 align:start position:0%
this bill does not allow it if private
 
01:56:28.189 --> 01:56:28.199 align:start position:0%
citizens were allowed to enter the
 
01:56:31.310 --> 01:56:31.320 align:start position:0%
market that is where it would also be
 
01:56:34.609 --> 01:56:34.619 align:start position:0%
necessary to take care of some of these
 
01:56:36.950 --> 01:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
concerns and worries that individuals
 
01:56:38.530 --> 01:56:38.540 align:start position:0%
have raised
 
01:56:41.390 --> 01:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
by instilling caps
 
01:56:45.770 --> 01:56:45.780 align:start position:0%
by creating a restriction on how many of
 
01:56:48.050 --> 01:56:48.060 align:start position:0%
what business can be allowed in any
 
01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
particular area one more question please
 
01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
is any of the states that have
 
01:57:00.109 --> 01:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
accepted uh made made marijuana legal
 
01:57:04.189 --> 01:57:04.199 align:start position:0%
are any of those States uh have the
 
01:57:07.189 --> 01:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
retail orientation we have here in New
 
01:57:09.109 --> 01:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire nobody's done it done its way
 
01:57:11.810 --> 01:57:11.820 align:start position:0%
this way but no other state has caps
 
01:57:11.820 --> 01:57:13.450 align:start position:0%
this way but no other state has caps
either

01:57:13.450 --> 01:57:13.460 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:57:15.890 --> 01:57:15.900 align:start position:0%
actually I mean they're saying all these
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
terrible things and I'm going well these
 
01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
states don't have regulation actually to
 
01:57:23.030 --> 01:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
to form a correction okay
 
01:57:25.189 --> 01:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the other states do have
 
01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
caps in regards but it's more on the
 
01:57:31.609 --> 01:57:31.619 align:start position:0%
municipality level and you will find
 
01:57:34.850 --> 01:57:34.860 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the communities that are
 
01:57:38.209 --> 01:57:38.219 align:start position:0%
more free and open with cannabis will
 
01:57:42.109 --> 01:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
allow more cannabis businesses so say
 
01:57:46.010 --> 01:57:46.020 align:start position:0%
just as an example in Lebanon there are
 
01:57:48.589 --> 01:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
licensing caps in Lebanon but with the
 
01:57:51.050 --> 01:57:51.060 align:start position:0%
way that their Lebanon Maine with the
 
01:57:54.530 --> 01:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
way that their rules and their laws are
 
01:57:57.649 --> 01:57:57.659 align:start position:0%
written the only place that retail
 
01:58:01.910 --> 01:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
businesses are allowed is on 202. so
 
01:58:05.390 --> 01:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
that is why you have quote unquote a
 
01:58:09.109 --> 01:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
marijuana mile on 202 it's because that
 
01:58:12.109 --> 01:58:12.119 align:start position:0%
is the old Place Lebanon allows retail
 
01:58:13.550 --> 01:58:13.560 align:start position:0%
business fair enough
 
01:58:17.689 --> 01:58:17.699 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
01:58:19.910 --> 01:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
okay I only have a couple more cards
 
01:58:21.890 --> 01:58:21.900 align:start position:0%

thank you so much for bringing this
 
01:59:07.490 --> 01:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
amendment if you think this is an issue
 
01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
that is important and cannot be kicked
 
01:59:10.790 --> 01:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
down the road
 
01:59:12.410 --> 01:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
um we also you know appreciate the
 
01:59:14.209 --> 01:59:14.219 align:start position:0%
leadership of both parties in the house
 
01:59:15.950 --> 01:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
for their efforts to push us through
 
01:59:17.570 --> 01:59:17.580 align:start position:0%
this session
 
01:59:20.030 --> 01:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
um we agree so I think you all received
 
01:59:22.310 --> 01:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
amendments from Paul Toomey I think two
 
01:59:24.589 --> 01:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
of the four were included in this and we
 
01:59:26.270 --> 01:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
we suggest that you incorporate the
 
01:59:27.410 --> 01:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
other two I think those would address
 
01:59:28.970 --> 01:59:28.980 align:start position:0%
the issues that you've heard concerns
 
01:59:28.980 --> 01:59:30.350 align:start position:0%
the issues that you've heard concerns
around

01:59:30.350 --> 01:59:30.360 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:59:33.530 --> 01:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
um thus far but I want to back this up a
 
01:59:34.669 --> 01:59:34.679 align:start position:0%
lot of the conversation we've heard
 
01:59:36.290 --> 01:59:36.300 align:start position:0%
today has been around money and revenue
 
01:59:37.609 --> 01:59:37.619 align:start position:0%
and who's going to make what and where
 
01:59:39.229 --> 01:59:39.239 align:start position:0%
that money is going to go and I think we
 
01:59:40.430 --> 01:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
really want to back it up to the fact
 
01:59:41.689 --> 01:59:41.699 align:start position:0%
that we really agree with what the
 
01:59:44.089 --> 01:59:44.099 align:start position:0%
governor said uh two Fridays ago when he
 
01:59:45.410 --> 01:59:45.420 align:start position:0%
talked about this is not about money
 
01:59:47.149 --> 01:59:47.159 align:start position:0%
this is about harm reduction in
 
01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
additional harm reduction from our
 
01:59:50.450 --> 01:59:50.460 align:start position:0%
perspective this is about racial Justice
 
01:59:52.129 --> 01:59:52.139 align:start position:0%
and so I just want to give you all some
 
01:59:55.129 --> 01:59:55.139 align:start position:0%
data points marijuana is that perfect
 
01:59:56.990 --> 01:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
issue where we can compare apples to
 
01:59:58.370 --> 01:59:58.380 align:start position:0%
apples in the criminal legal system
 
02:00:00.350 --> 02:00:00.360 align:start position:0%
because we know as a baseline that black
 
02:00:02.149 --> 02:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
people and white people use marijuana at
 
02:00:04.729 --> 02:00:04.739 align:start position:0%
roughly the same rate yet nationally
 
02:00:07.370 --> 02:00:07.380 align:start position:0%
people black people are 3.5 times more
 
02:00:08.930 --> 02:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
likely to be arrested for marijuana
 
02:00:10.910 --> 02:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
possession so Stark racial disparity
 
02:00:12.709 --> 02:00:12.719 align:start position:0%
nationally in New Hampshire it's even
 
02:00:14.870 --> 02:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
worse in New Hampshire according to the
 
02:00:17.570 --> 02:00:17.580 align:start position:0%
most recent data I think from 2021 and
 
02:00:20.750 --> 02:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
so this is UCR data that agencies give
 
02:00:24.589 --> 02:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
to the to FBI black people are 4.6 times
 
02:00:26.930 --> 02:00:26.940 align:start position:0%
more likely to be arrested than white
 
02:00:29.209 --> 02:00:29.219 align:start position:0%
people and this is again the state's own
 
02:00:31.669 --> 02:00:31.679 align:start position:0%
data so this is fundamentally about
 
02:00:33.530 --> 02:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
racial Justice and right and wrong and
 
02:00:35.270 --> 02:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about you know well
 
02:00:37.370 --> 02:00:37.380 align:start position:0%
this is we we don't have perfect right
 
02:00:38.510 --> 02:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
now and we're just going to kick this
 
02:00:40.250 --> 02:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
can down the road what we're doing is
 
02:00:42.649 --> 02:00:42.659 align:start position:0%
kicking can down the road of this racial
 
02:00:44.450 --> 02:00:44.460 align:start position:0%
Injustice that's happening every day in
 
02:00:46.430 --> 02:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in addition we're still
 
02:00:47.930 --> 02:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
arresting again according to the most
 
02:00:50.930 --> 02:00:50.940 align:start position:0%
recent data over 1100 people every
 
02:00:52.430 --> 02:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
single year in our state for simple
 
02:00:54.830 --> 02:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
possession of marijuana and so while
 
02:00:56.629 --> 02:00:56.639 align:start position:0%
we've heard often times in testimony
 
02:00:58.189 --> 02:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
that many of these people are no longer
 
02:01:00.890 --> 02:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
going to jail all those people are being
 
02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:02.639 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily brought into our criminal
 
02:01:04.729 --> 02:01:04.739 align:start position:0%
legal system and having the possibility
 
02:01:07.790 --> 02:01:07.800 align:start position:0%
of jail time but also the fines and fees
 
02:01:09.410 --> 02:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
that are associated with an arrest that
 
02:01:10.729 --> 02:01:10.739 align:start position:0%
can have devastating collateral
 
02:01:12.770 --> 02:01:12.780 align:start position:0%
consequences they also leave you with a
 
02:01:14.149 --> 02:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
criminal record so when you're trying to
 
02:01:15.649 --> 02:01:15.659 align:start position:0%
get a job when you're trying to get
 
02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
housing even child custody issues
 
02:01:19.330 --> 02:01:19.340 align:start position:0%
marijuana possession
 
02:01:23.209 --> 02:01:23.219 align:start position:0%
can be problematic and before this um so
 
02:01:25.070 --> 02:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
because there's no like easy way to find
 
02:01:26.689 --> 02:01:26.699 align:start position:0%
all the various collateral consequences
 
02:01:28.490 --> 02:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
there's some great clearinghouses so I
 
02:01:30.350 --> 02:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
looked at the national inventory of
 
02:01:31.970 --> 02:01:31.980 align:start position:0%
collateral consequences of conviction
 
02:01:33.589 --> 02:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
which is a great National Clearinghouse
 
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
that tracks all state-level collateral
 
02:01:37.370 --> 02:01:37.380 align:start position:0%
consequences and I went to New Hampshire
 
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
and looked at just misdemeanor mandatory
 
02:01:42.169 --> 02:01:42.179 align:start position:0%
collateral consequences so there could
 
02:01:43.729 --> 02:01:43.739 align:start position:0%
be additional because it's a drug but
 
02:01:46.129 --> 02:01:46.139 align:start position:0%
just looking at mandatory collateral
 
02:01:47.810 --> 02:01:47.820 align:start position:0%
consequences that attach if you have a
 
02:01:50.330 --> 02:01:50.340 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor conviction we have 99
 
02:01:53.209 --> 02:01:53.219 align:start position:0%
separate collateral consequences which
 
02:01:55.250 --> 02:01:55.260 align:start position:0%
is absolutely ridiculous and so every
 
02:01:57.470 --> 02:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
time we talk about postponing and not
 
02:01:59.330 --> 02:01:59.340 align:start position:0%
dealing with this now for these 1100
 
02:02:01.010 --> 02:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
plus people who were still arresting
 
02:02:03.410 --> 02:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
every single year the collateral
 
02:02:05.870 --> 02:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
consequences the fines the fees the
 
02:02:07.609 --> 02:02:07.619 align:start position:0%
harms the racial Injustice because of
 
02:02:10.010 --> 02:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
our disparities track with that and so
 
02:02:11.629 --> 02:02:11.639 align:start position:0%
from our perspective we can no longer
 
02:02:13.729 --> 02:02:13.739 align:start position:0%
kick this can down the road we
 
02:02:15.410 --> 02:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
appreciate the leadership's effort to
 
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
get this done we think this is a good
 
02:02:19.189 --> 02:02:19.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment there's some few small tweaks
 
02:02:20.510 --> 02:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
that we hope that you all incorporate
 
02:02:22.669 --> 02:02:22.679 align:start position:0%
that I know Paul to me his email to the
 
02:02:24.290 --> 02:02:24.300 align:start position:0%
members we hope that you'll do that and
 
02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:31.609 --> 02:02:31.619 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
 
02:02:33.290 --> 02:02:33.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
um just for clarity uh you mentioned
 
02:02:40.070 --> 02:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
that 1100 people every year uh
 
02:02:42.649 --> 02:02:42.659 align:start position:0%
approximately 1100 are arrested for
 
02:02:45.490 --> 02:02:45.500 align:start position:0%
marijuana possession and that is after
 
02:02:48.530 --> 02:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
decriminalization am I correct yes so
 
02:02:52.070 --> 02:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
that is 2021 data FBI UCR data and that
 
02:02:53.810 --> 02:02:53.820 align:start position:0%
was after decriminalization yes that was
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
I think back in 2018 yep thank you thank
 
02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:00.410 align:start position:0%
I think back in 2018 yep thank you thank
you

02:03:00.410 --> 02:03:00.420 align:start position:0%

okay thank you very much thank you so
 
02:03:05.089 --> 02:03:05.099 align:start position:0%
much all right got three cards left uh

Kevin Pratt
 
02:03:09.070 --> 02:03:09.080 align:start position:0%
who's in pose to the bill
 
02:03:11.209 --> 02:03:11.219 align:start position:0%

I'm all set a lot of my questions are
 
02:03:16.430 --> 02:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
already answered I didn't realize it was
 
02:03:19.129 --> 02:03:19.139 align:start position:0%
representative Pratt I apologize sooner
 
02:03:21.709 --> 02:03:21.719 align:start position:0%
that's all right uh will this bill be
 
02:03:23.149 --> 02:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
coming back to criminal justice and
 
02:03:26.810 --> 02:03:26.820 align:start position:0%
Public Safety no no okay because Sandy
 
02:03:28.910 --> 02:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
is no uh
 
02:03:31.850 --> 02:03:31.860 align:start position:0%
local control where the bill looks does
 
02:03:34.189 --> 02:03:34.199 align:start position:0%
local control lose the ability for
 
02:03:36.830 --> 02:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
licensing of these facilities no they
 
02:03:38.330 --> 02:03:38.340 align:start position:0%
would be able to say to the commission
 
02:03:40.430 --> 02:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
we don't want any store in our town okay
 
02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:41.510 align:start position:0%
we don't want any store in our town okay
good

02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:03:44.450 --> 02:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
uh and about growing facilities also the
 
02:03:46.629 --> 02:03:46.639 align:start position:0%
same way for growing facilities
 
02:03:49.149 --> 02:03:49.159 align:start position:0%
cultivators yes the cultivators too okay
 
02:03:51.410 --> 02:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
and well we just wanted to make a
 
02:03:52.609 --> 02:03:52.619 align:start position:0%
statement that Raymond has a liquor
 
02:03:54.649 --> 02:03:54.659 align:start position:0%
store so it sounds like now it doesn't
 
02:03:56.689 --> 02:03:56.699 align:start position:0%
have to be in the liquor store it's not
 
02:03:58.310 --> 02:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
intended to be in liquor stores it's
 
02:03:59.930 --> 02:03:59.940 align:start position:0%
tend to be a standalone store Raymond
 
02:04:01.729 --> 02:04:01.739 align:start position:0%
doesn't want any head shops thank you
 
02:04:05.330 --> 02:04:05.340 align:start position:0%
I'm all day perfect thank you
 
02:04:08.930 --> 02:04:08.940 align:start position:0%
okay uh Paul I had a question oh we do
 
02:04:11.109 --> 02:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
have a question I'm sorry
 
02:04:13.850 --> 02:04:13.860 align:start position:0%
representative Waltz has a question by
 
02:04:19.310 --> 02:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
the way I believe uh that this is an opt
 
02:04:22.910 --> 02:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
in issue correct so I just want to make
 
02:04:25.070 --> 02:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
it as opposed to opt out and it would be
 
02:04:27.890 --> 02:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
better for towns to be able to
 
02:04:30.050 --> 02:04:30.060 align:start position:0%
opt-in is better yeah opt-in is better
 
02:04:32.750 --> 02:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
but isn't this opt out this is opt-in oh
 
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
it is in opt-in okay thank you
 
02:04:37.550 --> 02:04:37.560 align:start position:0%
good thank you okay
 
02:04:41.629 --> 02:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:41.639 --> 02:04:48.910 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:04:48.910 --> 02:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:52.189 --> 02:04:52.199 align:start position:0%
reps representative Representatives my
 
02:04:54.350 --> 02:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
name is Paul Morrissette and I'm a
 
02:04:58.189 --> 02:04:58.199 align:start position:0%
partner in East Coast cannabis uh in War
 
02:05:02.089 --> 02:05:02.099 align:start position:0%
of Maine uh we're we have uh uh several
 
02:05:05.209 --> 02:05:05.219 align:start position:0%
stores and uh we were vertically
 
02:05:07.490 --> 02:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
integrated so we do cultivation and
 
02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:09.530 align:start position:0%
integrated so we do cultivation and
Manufacturing

02:05:09.530 --> 02:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing
 
02:05:11.390 --> 02:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
um the partners in this business around
 
02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire boys the CEOs here Dana
 
02:05:16.250 --> 02:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
breeley and he's went to Concord High
 
02:05:18.470 --> 02:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
School so we're not Maine people we'd
 
02:05:20.209 --> 02:05:20.219 align:start position:0%
love to do business in the state of New
 
02:05:20.219 --> 02:05:21.649 align:start position:0%
love to do business in the state of New
Hampshire

02:05:21.649 --> 02:05:21.659 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:05:21.659 --> 02:05:22.510 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
um

02:05:22.510 --> 02:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we're cultivators and
 
02:05:27.350 --> 02:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
we're manufacturers and I wanted to go
 
02:05:31.310 --> 02:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
quickly quickly through the three
 
02:05:34.129 --> 02:05:34.139 align:start position:0%
kinds of things that happen during call
 
02:05:37.550 --> 02:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
during cannabis business and their
 
02:05:40.669 --> 02:05:40.679 align:start position:0%
cultivation and Manufacturing and Retail
 
02:05:43.850 --> 02:05:43.860 align:start position:0%
so under under cultivation I think the
 
02:05:45.770 --> 02:05:45.780 align:start position:0%
problem with the state isn't the stores
 
02:05:48.589 --> 02:05:48.599 align:start position:0%
the stores are fine anybody can operate
 
02:05:51.109 --> 02:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
a store the problem is you're the sole
 
02:05:54.410 --> 02:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
buyer and um it's impossible to estimate
 
02:05:57.410 --> 02:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
the crops size so if we're let's take
 
02:05:59.689 --> 02:05:59.699 align:start position:0%
cultivation for example right let's say
 
02:06:01.490 --> 02:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
you guys issue 20 license I think I've
 
02:06:03.589 --> 02:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
seen that somewhere there right we're
 
02:06:06.530 --> 02:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
either gonna undergrow or overgrow and
 
02:06:08.510 --> 02:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
we can't tell when we're putting a crop
 
02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
in exactly what it's going to weigh so
 
02:06:12.530 --> 02:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
basically whether you've got a state
 
02:06:15.050 --> 02:06:15.060 align:start position:0%
buyer or you have us giving you us all
 
02:06:17.270 --> 02:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
the information it's impossible to
 
02:06:20.330 --> 02:06:20.340 align:start position:0%
estimate the size of the crops so uh
 
02:06:22.850 --> 02:06:22.860 align:start position:0%
your supply will either be short or
 
02:06:24.649 --> 02:06:24.659 align:start position:0%
Worse the supply will be in excess of
 
02:06:26.750 --> 02:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
the market which will result in two
 
02:06:30.290 --> 02:06:30.300 align:start position:0%
outcomes a oversupply which will crash
 
02:06:33.290 --> 02:06:33.300 align:start position:0%
the price and will ensue I'm talking
 
02:06:36.229 --> 02:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
cultivation or B at some point organic
 
02:06:37.850 --> 02:06:37.860 align:start position:0%
crops will spoil and have to be
 
02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
destroyed since there was only one
 
02:06:41.510 --> 02:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
customer who doesn't need or want that
 
02:06:43.550 --> 02:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
product bankruptcies of licensed
 
02:06:45.589 --> 02:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
cultivators will insude costing Untold
 
02:06:47.870 --> 02:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
Millions to private businesses who
 
02:06:49.810 --> 02:06:49.820 align:start position:0%
trusted the state system that failed
 
02:06:52.430 --> 02:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
lawsuits probably will be inevitable the
 
02:06:54.350 --> 02:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
only way to avoid this scenario is for
 
02:06:56.390 --> 02:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
the state to contractually agree to buy
 
02:06:58.790 --> 02:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
everything a grower can produce which of
 
02:06:59.930 --> 02:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
course will bankrupt The Liquor
 
02:06:59.940 --> 02:07:01.570 align:start position:0%
course will bankrupt The Liquor
Commission

02:07:01.570 --> 02:07:01.580 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
02:07:05.209 --> 02:07:05.219 align:start position:0%
next Manufacturing
 
02:07:07.850 --> 02:07:07.860 align:start position:0%
most most manufacturers one of the
 
02:07:09.709 --> 02:07:09.719 align:start position:0%
products they make is gummies and other
 
02:07:11.930 --> 02:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
common products but the state will have
 
02:07:14.089 --> 02:07:14.099 align:start position:0%
limited space for each products on their
 
02:07:16.550 --> 02:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
stores in their stores and since there
 
02:07:18.169 --> 02:07:18.179 align:start position:0%
won't be room for everyone's brand of
 
02:07:20.510 --> 02:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
gummies much will be destroyed along
 
02:07:22.370 --> 02:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
with other products bankrupting
 
02:07:24.290 --> 02:07:24.300 align:start position:0%
manufacturers who trusted the state
 
02:07:26.510 --> 02:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
system that failed there's no way to
 
02:07:28.550 --> 02:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
control Supply there's no way to control
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
what you need to have like cultivation
 
02:07:33.050 --> 02:07:33.060 align:start position:0%
the only way to avoid this scenario is
 
02:07:35.270 --> 02:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
for the state to buy all products
 
02:07:37.189 --> 02:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
manufacturers produce which of course
 
02:07:38.750 --> 02:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
will bankrupt The Liquor Commission
 
02:07:42.290 --> 02:07:42.300 align:start position:0%
you'll be taking the risk instead of us
 
02:07:44.750 --> 02:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
um retail since the state sets the price
 
02:07:46.430 --> 02:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
to pay for all products there is no
 
02:07:48.589 --> 02:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
incentive to develop new or high quality
 
02:07:50.510 --> 02:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
products your state stores will be
 
02:07:52.550 --> 02:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
stocked with low and mid-grade at best
 
02:07:55.129 --> 02:07:55.139 align:start position:0%
products cultivators and manufacturers
 
02:07:57.169 --> 02:07:57.179 align:start position:0%
have no incentive to develop new or
 
02:07:59.330 --> 02:07:59.340 align:start position:0%
better products since the state will set
 
02:08:01.669 --> 02:08:01.679 align:start position:0%
the price and may not even want the
 
02:08:04.250 --> 02:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
product in their stores so
 
02:08:08.330 --> 02:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
my position is this can't fly because
 
02:08:11.270 --> 02:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
it's not feasible for the supply chain
 
02:08:14.390 --> 02:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
that they have set up it we set up grows
 
02:08:16.669 --> 02:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
in Maine for millions and millions of
 
02:08:20.030 --> 02:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
dollars okay and I'm going to trust the
 
02:08:21.890 --> 02:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
state buyer to come in and give me a
 
02:08:24.550 --> 02:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
fair price for my product and understand
 
02:08:27.050 --> 02:08:27.060 align:start position:0%
these flower products they aren't all
 
02:08:30.050 --> 02:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
the same Outdoors relatively cheap and
 
02:08:31.790 --> 02:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
then there's different grades and types
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
and strains of indoors by the hundreds
 
02:08:35.990 --> 02:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
and thousands depends on the quality
 
02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
it's like buying wine so I have a hard
 
02:08:43.189 --> 02:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
time figuring how a state person is
 
02:08:46.070 --> 02:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
going to come in and negotiate after I
 
02:08:48.169 --> 02:08:48.179 align:start position:0%
spent seven million dollars to put up a
 
02:08:50.750 --> 02:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
grow how in the world I'm going to come
 
02:08:52.609 --> 02:08:52.619 align:start position:0%
to a price with him with the Cannabis
 
02:08:54.649 --> 02:08:54.659 align:start position:0%
the other problems is it's state to
 
02:08:56.930 --> 02:08:56.940 align:start position:0%
state if he uses Massachusetts for
 
02:08:59.030 --> 02:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
example Massachusetts recently crashed
 
02:09:02.089 --> 02:09:02.099 align:start position:0%
over supplied Mains having some of the
 
02:09:04.609 --> 02:09:04.619 align:start position:0%
same problem right where's the price is
 
02:09:05.930 --> 02:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
going to come that he's going to pay me
 
02:09:08.330 --> 02:09:08.340 align:start position:0%
based on a failed Market or based on a
 
02:09:09.709 --> 02:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Market which he doesn't
 
02:09:12.109 --> 02:09:12.119 align:start position:0%
know what to pay for and why would he
 
02:09:14.390 --> 02:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
pay me a lot he's going to push me down
 
02:09:16.729 --> 02:09:16.739 align:start position:0%
you know and you're going to get to the
 
02:09:19.010 --> 02:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
point where nobody's making money we've
 
02:09:22.370 --> 02:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
talked to many Growers across many
 
02:09:25.070 --> 02:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
states and you can ask Matt Simon I
 
02:09:27.169 --> 02:09:27.179 align:start position:0%
think he told me he has too I haven't
 
02:09:30.530 --> 02:09:30.540 align:start position:0%
found one person we'd love to be part of
 
02:09:33.410 --> 02:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
this in our own state but we cannot
 
02:09:35.750 --> 02:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
justify spending millions and millions
 
02:09:37.910 --> 02:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
of dollars to put up a cannabis
 
02:09:40.310 --> 02:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
cultivation and Manufacturing to supply
 
02:09:43.250 --> 02:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
the state who's going to decide whether
 
02:09:45.290 --> 02:09:45.300 align:start position:0%
they're going to buy it at all and if
 
02:09:47.270 --> 02:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
they do what they're going to pay me for
 
02:09:49.729 --> 02:09:49.739 align:start position:0%
my product can you think of any other
 
02:09:52.310 --> 02:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
business where that happens it certainly
 
02:09:53.890 --> 02:09:53.900 align:start position:0%
don't happen in the Liquor Commission
 
02:09:56.930 --> 02:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
Smirnoff ain't telling you know we ain't
 
02:09:58.609 --> 02:09:58.619 align:start position:0%
telling Smirnoff what to pay for the
 
02:10:02.510 --> 02:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
Vodka so my problem with this is I just
 
02:10:04.669 --> 02:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
I want to see legalization here on want
 
02:10:07.070 --> 02:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
to participate in this just structurally
 
02:10:09.470 --> 02:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
is not going to work and the state's
 
02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
going to buy the liability when this all
 
02:10:15.770 --> 02:10:15.780 align:start position:0%
fails and um that's basically it
 
02:10:15.780 --> 02:10:19.550 align:start position:0%
fails and um that's basically it
questions

02:10:19.550 --> 02:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:22.129 --> 02:10:22.139 align:start position:0%
representative kibbs thank you
 
02:10:26.209 --> 02:10:26.219 align:start position:0%
uh I have two questions uh the first one
 
02:10:28.070 --> 02:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
is basically yes or no and I should
 
02:10:30.649 --> 02:10:30.659 align:start position:0%
point out that um I grew up in an
 
02:10:32.390 --> 02:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
agricultural family
 
02:10:36.350 --> 02:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
isn't agriculture a risky type of
 
02:10:39.290 --> 02:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
business oh absolutely we all know you
 
02:10:40.970 --> 02:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
can go down and buy some tomatoes and
 
02:10:43.010 --> 02:10:43.020 align:start position:0%
plant them on the side of your deck but
 
02:10:44.930 --> 02:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
if I asked you how many pounds you're
 
02:10:46.430 --> 02:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
going to get out of those Tomatoes when
 
02:10:48.530 --> 02:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
you're done you can't tell me that we
 
02:10:51.169 --> 02:10:51.179 align:start position:0%
have other problems like we get bugs and
 
02:10:53.510 --> 02:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
the crops has to be destroyed or mold or
 
02:10:56.089 --> 02:10:56.099 align:start position:0%
something like that or pathogens we're
 
02:10:59.330 --> 02:10:59.340 align:start position:0%
we're in Maine we're tested at the
 
02:11:00.950 --> 02:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
recreational level they mentioned before
 
02:11:02.510 --> 02:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
there's no testing in Maine that's
 
02:11:05.390 --> 02:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
Medical but we're tested for everything
 
02:11:08.950 --> 02:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
okay second question uh
 
02:11:12.709 --> 02:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
thank you uh uh how would you propose to
 
02:11:15.649 --> 02:11:15.659 align:start position:0%
correct the problem that you described
 
02:11:19.310 --> 02:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
I throw this bill in the trash and start
 
02:11:21.830 --> 02:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
over with a good bill that has an open
 
02:11:24.169 --> 02:11:24.179 align:start position:0%
Natural Market for the Live Free or Die
 
02:11:27.290 --> 02:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
State and you know allows allow stores
 
02:11:30.109 --> 02:11:30.119 align:start position:0%
and the atcs and anybody else that wants
 
02:11:32.689 --> 02:11:32.699 align:start position:0%
to get in business we'd suggest small
 
02:11:36.290 --> 02:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
smaller tiering of licenses okay to not
 
02:11:38.089 --> 02:11:38.099 align:start position:0%
bring the big corporate guys that you're
 
02:11:40.129 --> 02:11:40.139 align:start position:0%
talking in here you know so so
 
02:11:43.010 --> 02:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
cultivation you know is smaller you know
 
02:11:44.870 --> 02:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
and to have a free and open market just
 
02:11:46.430 --> 02:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
like we do with everything else in the
 
02:11:49.070 --> 02:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
state and you know that's it are you
 
02:11:50.810 --> 02:11:50.820 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we put limits on how
 
02:11:52.490 --> 02:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
much they cultivate
 
02:11:54.709 --> 02:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
I'm not suggesting what you just said
 
02:11:56.209 --> 02:11:56.219 align:start position:0%
what did you just say for a limitation
 
02:11:58.550 --> 02:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
no I didn't I didn't well that's what
 
02:12:00.709 --> 02:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
it's selling so what was your what was
 
02:12:03.370 --> 02:12:03.380 align:start position:0%
your saying that small
 
02:12:06.410 --> 02:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
we'd like to have a lot of small a
 
02:12:08.990 --> 02:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
smaller businesses participate in this
 
02:12:10.790 --> 02:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
so how do we make a business how do we
 
02:12:13.310 --> 02:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
ensure that how do we insure that yeah
 
02:12:15.410 --> 02:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
we have a we have a free and open market
 
02:12:17.030 --> 02:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
and we allow Heather for free open
 
02:12:18.229 --> 02:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
market means they could be as big as
 
02:12:20.510 --> 02:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
they want how do we keep them you're
 
02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
saying small I understand how does the
 
02:12:26.030 --> 02:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
state legislate that they be small and I
 
02:12:27.770 --> 02:12:27.780 align:start position:0%
didn't dictate that they'd be small I
 
02:12:29.450 --> 02:12:29.460 align:start position:0%
think you allow anybody you could how do
 
02:12:31.129 --> 02:12:31.139 align:start position:0%
you dictate that they're small you set
 
02:12:33.169 --> 02:12:33.179 align:start position:0%
the tiers and the sizes for the grows or
 
02:12:35.510 --> 02:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing you limit the square
 
02:12:35.520 --> 02:12:36.490 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing you limit the square
footage

02:12:36.490 --> 02:12:36.500 align:start position:0%
footage
 
02:12:39.169 --> 02:12:39.179 align:start position:0%
set the tears for the growing in other
 
02:12:40.910 --> 02:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
words we're going to tell them how much
 
02:12:43.129 --> 02:12:43.139 align:start position:0%
they can grow we're going to tell them
 
02:12:46.370 --> 02:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
okay in Maine for for cultivation right
 
02:12:48.709 --> 02:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
there's four tiers of cultivation you've
 
02:12:50.870 --> 02:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
got tier one that's up to 500 square
 
02:12:53.030 --> 02:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
feet you've got tier two that's up to
 
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
two thousand square feet of budding
 
02:12:57.109 --> 02:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
space you've got tier three which is
 
02:12:58.790 --> 02:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
seven thousand and you got tier four
 
02:13:01.250 --> 02:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
which is twenty thousand okay so the
 
02:13:03.050 --> 02:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
largest license in Maine is twenty
 
02:13:04.430 --> 02:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
thousand now if you go to Massachusetts
 
02:13:08.089 --> 02:13:08.099 align:start position:0%
okay who has a much bigger problem their
 
02:13:10.550 --> 02:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
their license is a hundred thousand okay
 
02:13:13.069 --> 02:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
and a big company called true Leaf came
 
02:13:15.109 --> 02:13:15.119 align:start position:0%
in there and they built the giant grow
 
02:13:17.089 --> 02:13:17.099 align:start position:0%
200 people worked there over a hundred
 
02:13:20.510 --> 02:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
thousand square feet okay recently in
 
02:13:23.209 --> 02:13:23.219 align:start position:0%
the last five or six months the markets
 
02:13:24.649 --> 02:13:24.659 align:start position:0%
crash because there's too much in the
 
02:13:27.050 --> 02:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
market they had twenty thousand pounds
 
02:13:30.290 --> 02:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
of an organic sitting on a shelf you
 
02:13:33.050 --> 02:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
know waiting to be thrown away or just
 
02:13:35.330 --> 02:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
destroyed you know we have to have good
 
02:13:38.689 --> 02:13:38.699 align:start position:0%
policy I would limit uh like I think
 
02:13:40.970 --> 02:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
somebody else brought up I'd say three
 
02:13:43.490 --> 02:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
three stores from the same
 
02:13:45.229 --> 02:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
but you know you can only have ownership
 
02:13:48.830 --> 02:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
in three stores and uh that'll limit a
 
02:13:50.149 --> 02:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
lot of the big guys from coming in
 
02:13:51.649 --> 02:13:51.659 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to do that you
 
02:13:54.010 --> 02:13:54.020 align:start position:0%
know they want they want a big okay
 
02:13:57.050 --> 02:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
Representative Vincent has a question
 
02:13:58.669 --> 02:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks a lot for
 
02:14:00.530 --> 02:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:14:02.990 --> 02:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
um so most likely this bill is going to
 
02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
have a bunch of amendments tacked onto
 
02:14:06.950 --> 02:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
it say the bill has a bunch of
 
02:14:10.250 --> 02:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
amendments but it keeps the growth but
 
02:14:14.149 --> 02:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
but the state keeps the control
 
02:14:16.189 --> 02:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be would you before getting
 
02:14:18.410 --> 02:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
this bill at least getting your foot in
 
02:14:20.450 --> 02:14:20.460 align:start position:0%
the door and when the state realizes
 
02:14:22.550 --> 02:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
that they're not going to make it or
 
02:14:24.350 --> 02:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
they're going to fail we'd have changes
 
02:14:28.490 --> 02:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
to it so put through a bill that we
 
02:14:31.250 --> 02:14:31.260 align:start position:0%
physically don't think will work in the
 
02:14:33.890 --> 02:14:33.900 align:start position:0%
long run and because it's something I I
 
02:14:35.330 --> 02:14:35.340 align:start position:0%
don't want to do well listen it's not
 
02:14:37.010 --> 02:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
the first time that the state's done
 
02:14:40.069 --> 02:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
this however however remember are you
 
02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
asking another question yes thank you
 
02:14:43.550 --> 02:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chairman if I may you may
 
02:14:45.410 --> 02:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
ask one more it was kind of like kind of
 
02:14:47.209 --> 02:14:47.219 align:start position:0%
the same question but thank you very
 
02:14:49.149 --> 02:14:49.159 align:start position:0%
much I appreciate that
 
02:14:53.149 --> 02:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
uh remember where this is coming from
 
02:14:55.129 --> 02:14:55.139 align:start position:0%
with no disrespect from the corner
 
02:14:57.649 --> 02:14:57.659 align:start position:0%
office so we're trying to I mean that's
 
02:15:00.109 --> 02:15:00.119 align:start position:0%
the way it's going to pass yeah and okay
 
02:15:03.229 --> 02:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm not in disagreement with you
 
02:15:05.510 --> 02:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
come on
 
02:15:08.870 --> 02:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm done thank you
 
02:15:10.609 --> 02:15:10.619 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony thank you
 
02:15:12.589 --> 02:15:12.599 align:start position:0%
all right I got one card left uh he's
 
02:15:16.490 --> 02:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
from Maine uh Dana barely and I'm sure
 
02:15:17.689 --> 02:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
you don't have oh that's right you do
 
02:15:19.069 --> 02:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
have a store right
 
02:15:23.330 --> 02:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:25.850 --> 02:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
would you believe it it was a would you
 
02:15:27.770 --> 02:15:27.780 align:start position:0%
believe I guess but it
 
02:15:29.629 --> 02:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
hearing that it's would you believe that
 
02:15:30.770 --> 02:15:30.780 align:start position:0%
hearing the discussion on the one hand
 
02:15:32.629 --> 02:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
of a Live Free or Die model but on the
 
02:15:34.430 --> 02:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
other hand discussion of tears and
 
02:15:37.069 --> 02:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
regulations in no more than three stores
 
02:15:38.689 --> 02:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
would you believe that I'm having a
 
02:15:42.290 --> 02:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
difficulty reconciling the two of those
 
02:15:45.410 --> 02:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
could you describe how you reconcile on
 
02:15:47.209 --> 02:15:47.219 align:start position:0%
the one hand to live for your do you uh
 
02:15:50.030 --> 02:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
Live Free or Die model of sales and on
 
02:15:51.229 --> 02:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
the other hand
 
02:15:53.750 --> 02:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
what I just heard is a discussion of a
 
02:15:56.030 --> 02:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
very complex licensing system that seems
 
02:15:57.890 --> 02:15:57.900 align:start position:0%
no different than they have a very just
 
02:15:59.270 --> 02:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
getting a Liquor Commission involved
 
02:16:01.550 --> 02:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
you're right so that is a that is a
 
02:16:03.350 --> 02:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
great would you believe that it is hard
 
02:16:07.609 --> 02:16:07.619 align:start position:0%
to to fix that dichotomy okay so so
 
02:16:08.990 --> 02:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
that's Dana is a partner he could
 
02:16:10.550 --> 02:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
probably help answer that question I
 
02:16:12.410 --> 02:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
could build some of these for sure thank
 
02:16:13.970 --> 02:16:13.980 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you all for hearing
 
02:16:13.980 --> 02:16:15.050 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you all for hearing
me

02:16:15.050 --> 02:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:16:16.430 --> 02:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
um to avoid some redundancy I won't
 
02:16:17.689 --> 02:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
speak on any of the topics that Paul
 
02:16:19.790 --> 02:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned but I am a conquer High
 
02:16:21.109 --> 02:16:21.119 align:start position:0%
graduate I grew up here in New Hampshire
 
02:16:22.669 --> 02:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
and only ended up in Maine simply
 
02:16:23.990 --> 02:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
because they had a program that would
 
02:16:26.209 --> 02:16:26.219 align:start position:0%
allow me to flourish uh similar to what
 
02:16:28.430 --> 02:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
Matt said here we're not asking for
 
02:16:30.050 --> 02:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
anything of preference at the end of the
 
02:16:31.850 --> 02:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
day we just want uh even playing field
 
02:16:34.429 --> 02:16:34.439 align:start position:0%
which this bill doesn't allow for in its
 
02:16:35.990 --> 02:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
current state
 
02:16:37.250 --> 02:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
there's been a couple people that have
 
02:16:39.230 --> 02:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
touched on federal illegality so I don't
 
02:16:40.549 --> 02:16:40.559 align:start position:0%
think I need to speak much more to that
 
02:16:41.990 --> 02:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
obviously there's a huge conflict of
 
02:16:43.490 --> 02:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
interest here between what the feds want
 
02:16:45.950 --> 02:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
and having state employees buy and sell
 
02:16:48.110 --> 02:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
a federally illegal substance
 
02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:49.310 align:start position:0%
a federally illegal substance
two

02:16:49.310 --> 02:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:16:51.410 --> 02:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
markets don't work with one buyer period
 
02:16:53.389 --> 02:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
in any industry there's a reason Most
 
02:16:54.830 --> 02:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
states set up barriers to inhibit
 
02:16:56.629 --> 02:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
monopolies unlike this proposal which
 
02:16:58.730 --> 02:16:58.740 align:start position:0%
requires it what happens when the market
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
compresses and prices plummet as it does
 
02:17:03.110 --> 02:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
in all states representative hunt you
 
02:17:04.310 --> 02:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned negotiating wholesale
 
02:17:06.650 --> 02:17:06.660 align:start position:0%
contracts before building our grows and
 
02:17:07.849 --> 02:17:07.859 align:start position:0%
that would be contingent on Bank
 
02:17:09.530 --> 02:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
financing so I'd like to dive into that
 
02:17:11.389 --> 02:17:11.399 align:start position:0%
a little bit there is no institutional
 
02:17:13.009 --> 02:17:13.019 align:start position:0%
funding in cannabis to start
 
02:17:16.190 --> 02:17:16.200 align:start position:0%
any Bank under the FDIC cannot touch us
 
02:17:18.410 --> 02:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
because the FDIC is federal majority of
 
02:17:20.150 --> 02:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
capital raises are done with private
 
02:17:22.129 --> 02:17:22.139 align:start position:0%
Equity who won't negotiate a weak
 
02:17:24.049 --> 02:17:24.059 align:start position:0%
contract so let's look at the timeline
 
02:17:25.549 --> 02:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
and costs associated
 
02:17:27.290 --> 02:17:27.300 align:start position:0%
takes about a year to get a grow built
 
02:17:29.570 --> 02:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
another 10 months until you have a crop
 
02:17:31.190 --> 02:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
ready because it's Agriculture and that
 
02:17:32.570 --> 02:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
takes time
 
02:17:34.669 --> 02:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
and it's about call it seven to ten
 
02:17:35.990 --> 02:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars in capex to get this
 
02:17:38.209 --> 02:17:38.219 align:start position:0%
stood up then you so on those numbers
 
02:17:39.770 --> 02:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
you've got about four years for the
 
02:17:42.230 --> 02:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
operator to recoup their cap expenditure
 
02:17:44.750 --> 02:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
that's five years since the Inception of
 
02:17:47.750 --> 02:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
the contract that you suggested that our
 
02:17:49.129 --> 02:17:49.139 align:start position:0%
businesses will potentially live or die
 
02:17:51.889 --> 02:17:51.899 align:start position:0%
by so any somewhat Savvy operator will
 
02:17:53.629 --> 02:17:53.639 align:start position:0%
negotiate multi-year contracts to
 
02:17:56.150 --> 02:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
guarantee their Roi retail in Most
 
02:17:58.310 --> 02:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
states however experienced significant
 
02:18:00.110 --> 02:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
compression within the first three years
 
02:18:02.389 --> 02:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
the problem here this estate will either
 
02:18:04.429 --> 02:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
sustain massive losses if you negotiate
 
02:18:06.530 --> 02:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
long-term contracts with Growers for
 
02:18:08.410 --> 02:18:08.420 align:start position:0%
high wholesale prices so they can recoup
 
02:18:10.730 --> 02:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
meanwhile retail is plummeting and
 
02:18:12.349 --> 02:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
therefore no margins for the state-run
 
02:18:12.359 --> 02:18:13.730 align:start position:0%
therefore no margins for the state-run
stores

02:18:13.730 --> 02:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
stores
 
02:18:16.009 --> 02:18:16.019 align:start position:0%
we're not on an island here you're not
 
02:18:17.450 --> 02:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
just competing with New Hampshire but
 
02:18:20.150 --> 02:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
Mass Vermont and Maine where that price
 
02:18:22.009 --> 02:18:22.019 align:start position:0%
compression is already occurring so you
 
02:18:23.690 --> 02:18:23.700 align:start position:0%
either sell in line with their pricing
 
02:18:25.490 --> 02:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
and lose a ton of State money to the

02:18:32.509 --> 02:18:32.519 align:start position:0%
curiosity
 
02:18:34.310 --> 02:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
with a show of hands how many people
 
02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:35.509 align:start position:0%
with a show of hands how many people
here

02:18:35.509 --> 02:18:35.519 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:18:44.089 --> 02:18:44.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:45.589 --> 02:18:45.599 align:start position:0%
you really don't think we're going to
 
02:18:47.509 --> 02:18:47.519 align:start position:0%
admit to that do you if you travel on
 
02:18:49.129 --> 02:18:49.139 align:start position:0%
vacation to Maine you buy in Maine you
 
02:18:50.209 --> 02:18:50.219 align:start position:0%
use in Maine and you leave Maine you
 
02:18:51.469 --> 02:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
realize that's leaving correct I have
 
02:18:53.089 --> 02:18:53.099 align:start position:0%
driven by the main stores multiple times
 
02:18:55.610 --> 02:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
but no I have not stepped put in one of
 
02:18:57.049 --> 02:18:57.059 align:start position:0%
them yet all right
 
02:18:59.389 --> 02:18:59.399 align:start position:0%
so representative Burroughs you brought
 
02:19:01.849 --> 02:19:01.859 align:start position:0%
up dosing concerns that is a great point
 
02:19:04.310 --> 02:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
in such a complex issue with Edibles
 
02:19:06.589 --> 02:19:06.599 align:start position:0%
alone One Singular Lane of cannabis
 
02:19:08.810 --> 02:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
products how five milligram affects me
 
02:19:11.150 --> 02:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
versus one of you has a plethora of
 
02:19:13.490 --> 02:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
variables What's Your Metabolism like
 
02:19:15.410 --> 02:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
when was your last meal are you hydrated
 
02:19:17.990 --> 02:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
what kind of concentrate was used Nano
 
02:19:19.730 --> 02:19:19.740 align:start position:0%
emulsified concentrates are readily
 
02:19:21.169 --> 02:19:21.179 align:start position:0%
available and provide effects within a
 
02:19:23.330 --> 02:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
matter of minutes others take up to
 
02:19:26.450 --> 02:19:26.460 align:start position:0%
hours therefore selling cannabis is more
 
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
in line with being a sommelier than
 
02:19:29.690 --> 02:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
simply operating a point of sale in a
 
02:19:30.530 --> 02:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
liquor store
 
02:19:32.270 --> 02:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
or one of the new stores we're proposing
 
02:19:33.709 --> 02:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
to build
 
02:19:35.389 --> 02:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
our staff get trained for months
 
02:19:37.190 --> 02:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
generally after coming from years of
 
02:19:40.190 --> 02:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
experience either as a tender or a user
 
02:19:42.709 --> 02:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
cannabis is highly complex which is why
 
02:19:44.209 --> 02:19:44.219 align:start position:0%
the private sector should be able to
 
02:19:45.950 --> 02:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
operate we know this inside and out
 
02:19:47.810 --> 02:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
which is why our stores flourish I'm
 
02:19:49.130 --> 02:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
curious to see how the state is going to
 
02:19:51.290 --> 02:19:51.300 align:start position:0%
train hundreds of employees to safely
 
02:19:53.870 --> 02:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
and knowledgeably help sell to cannabis
 
02:19:56.929 --> 02:19:56.939 align:start position:0%
consumers of all ages sizes intolerance
 
02:19:59.090 --> 02:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
at the high level necessary for the
 
02:20:00.469 --> 02:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
safety of our customers which has been
 
02:20:02.270 --> 02:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned a few times is the priority of
 
02:20:05.870 --> 02:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:07.490 --> 02:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
representative hunt you also mentioned
 
02:20:08.990 --> 02:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
outdoor cultivation doesn't work in New
 
02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:10.490 align:start position:0%
outdoor cultivation doesn't work in New
Hampshire

02:20:10.490 --> 02:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:20:12.650 --> 02:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
that it I'm wrong okay okay I was
 
02:20:13.670 --> 02:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
curious yeah because all the neighboring
 
02:20:15.230 --> 02:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
states it does very well and I just
 
02:20:16.550 --> 02:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
checked in the bill and it looks better
 
02:20:18.349 --> 02:20:18.359 align:start position:0%
it's better to get more tanning that
 
02:20:21.290 --> 02:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
part I do agree with I disagree with but
 
02:20:23.150 --> 02:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day what makes you
 
02:20:24.950 --> 02:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
answer unique where it couldn't and I
 
02:20:26.210 --> 02:20:26.220 align:start position:0%
think that bill will actually suggest
 
02:20:27.950 --> 02:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
that outdoor cultivation gets three
 
02:20:29.389 --> 02:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
times the square footage of indoor
 
02:20:29.399 --> 02:20:31.969 align:start position:0%
times the square footage of indoor
operators

02:20:31.969 --> 02:20:31.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
this is a weak Bill New Hampshire isn't
 
02:20:36.469 --> 02:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
Texas it's geographically small and
 
02:20:38.090 --> 02:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
surrounded by legal states with robust
 
02:20:40.070 --> 02:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
successful programs there are a plethora
 
02:20:42.110 --> 02:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
of successful programs Nationwide why
 
02:20:43.429 --> 02:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
are we trying to reinvent the wheel
 
02:20:45.290 --> 02:20:45.300 align:start position:0%
States like Oregon have tried that and
 
02:20:46.910 --> 02:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
are now the pro proud owners of the
 
02:20:49.250 --> 02:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
worst programs Nationwide
 
02:20:51.230 --> 02:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
what I propose a similar in line with
 
02:20:53.150 --> 02:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
what Paul just said cap it at three
 
02:20:55.190 --> 02:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
stairs and cap it at 10 000 square feet
 
02:20:57.050 --> 02:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
of cultivation
 
02:20:58.910 --> 02:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
this will deter massive State out of
 
02:21:01.010 --> 02:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
state players which ruin most markets it
 
02:21:03.290 --> 02:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
will Empower municipalities to opt in or
 
02:21:04.969 --> 02:21:04.979 align:start position:0%
opt out that is how you control your
 
02:21:07.429 --> 02:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote green Miles and you allow
 
02:21:09.050 --> 02:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
them to set up aggressive zoning
 
02:21:10.490 --> 02:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
infrastructure like they have done in
 
02:21:11.990 --> 02:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
multiple states that works extremely
 
02:21:13.550 --> 02:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
well you're very concerned about green
 
02:21:16.010 --> 02:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
Miles you know how you inhibit them you
 
02:21:18.050 --> 02:21:18.060 align:start position:0%
limit them to a certain area if there's
 
02:21:19.610 --> 02:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
100 liquor stores that's way more
 
02:21:21.710 --> 02:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
exposure than a mile that's got four or
 
02:21:23.150 --> 02:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
five and you're gonna have a lot more
 
02:21:24.770 --> 02:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
Youth and whatever we're trying to deter
 
02:21:27.170 --> 02:21:27.180 align:start position:0%
seeing them
 
02:21:30.190 --> 02:21:30.200 align:start position:0%
is there any questions
 
02:21:32.750 --> 02:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you
 
02:21:36.650 --> 02:21:36.660 align:start position:0%
under this proposal while the business
 
02:21:39.830 --> 02:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
goes through its Growing Pains does the
 
02:21:42.050 --> 02:21:42.060 align:start position:0%
state stop arresting people for
 
02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
marijuana and does the state stop wasted
 
02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
law enforcement resources on marijuana
 
02:21:50.150 --> 02:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
100 percent
 
02:21:53.450 --> 02:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
okay 100 yeah I didn't hear your answer
 
02:21:56.389 --> 02:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
oh I said 100 yes stop arresting people
 
02:21:57.770 --> 02:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
for cannabis offenses yeah thank you
 
02:21:59.809 --> 02:21:59.819 align:start position:0%
representative Philo
 
02:22:01.190 --> 02:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony I'm
 
02:22:02.630 --> 02:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
actually interested in the dosing and
 
02:22:04.250 --> 02:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
the minimum dosing that should be
 
02:22:06.349 --> 02:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
allowed uh particularly in Edibles and
 
02:22:08.750 --> 02:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
other products the bill recommends five
 
02:22:10.370 --> 02:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
do you actually recommend going to a
 
02:22:11.750 --> 02:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
micro dosing do you think five is
 
02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh where would you think we
 
02:22:15.349 --> 02:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
should fall as a state there's a lot of
 
02:22:17.090 --> 02:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
successful programs in the 10 milligram
 
02:22:18.950 --> 02:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
range I think that's a good starting
 
02:22:21.410 --> 02:22:21.420 align:start position:0%
number you know and as consumers get
 
02:22:22.849 --> 02:22:22.859 align:start position:0%
educated when they're in these retail
 
02:22:24.290 --> 02:22:24.300 align:start position:0%
stores you know like was mentioned
 
02:22:26.510 --> 02:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
before start with five you know like
 
02:22:28.910 --> 02:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
like a lot of substances it's tough to
 
02:22:31.250 --> 02:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
undo start small and then grow within
 
02:22:33.050 --> 02:22:33.060 align:start position:0%
your tolerance don't take out a huge
 
02:22:33.060 --> 02:22:34.849 align:start position:0%
your tolerance don't take out a huge
bite

02:22:34.849 --> 02:22:34.859 align:start position:0%
bite
 
02:22:36.530 --> 02:22:36.540 align:start position:0%
yeah my understanding in Massachusetts
 
02:22:39.830 --> 02:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
and they do have stores nearby me is I
 
02:22:41.990 --> 02:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
have two in Winchendon
 
02:22:44.870 --> 02:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
um that the a it's five milligrams but
 
02:22:46.670 --> 02:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
then they limit to how much you can buy
 
02:22:49.370 --> 02:22:49.380 align:start position:0%
on a per day basis so there is an
 
02:22:52.070 --> 02:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
overall cap in terms of how much you can
 
02:22:52.080 --> 02:22:53.929 align:start position:0%
overall cap in terms of how much you can
buy

02:22:53.929 --> 02:22:53.939 align:start position:0%
buy
 
02:22:56.809 --> 02:22:56.819 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions see none we
 
02:22:58.610 --> 02:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you and with
 
02:23:03.110 --> 02:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
that I will close the hearing on the uh
 
02:23:05.750 --> 02:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
so um for the next bill committee
 
02:23:08.150 --> 02:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
members uh we have seven cards they're
 
02:23:10.250 --> 02:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
all two to three minutes
 
02:23:12.410 --> 02:23:12.420 align:start position:0%
so if we get through we could do them
 
02:23:15.469 --> 02:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
all the everybody's in support there's
 
02:23:18.170 --> 02:23:18.180 align:start position:0%
no opposition to this bill are you guys
 
02:23:20.030 --> 02:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
want to break for lunch or want to go
 
02:23:21.770 --> 02:23:21.780 align:start position:0%
through this and get it done

can take it three minutes break three
 
02:23:32.630 --> 02:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:32.640 --> 02:23:34.210 align:start position:0%
 
no

02:23:34.210 --> 02:23:34.220 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:32:29.750 --> 02:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:29.760 --> 02:32:31.070 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:32:31.070 --> 02:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:32:31.080 --> 02:32:33.410 align:start position:0%
foreign
okay

public hearing on Senate Bill 85 and
 
02:32:47.570 --> 02:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:49.550 --> 02:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
okay so we're going to hold you to your
 
02:32:53.450 --> 02:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:55.550 --> 02:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
which I I pulled the mic yeah the red
 
02:32:57.830 --> 02:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
butt light bun and then pull it close to
 
02:33:01.010 --> 02:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
you make sure the red button and
 
02:33:02.929 --> 02:33:02.939 align:start position:0%
you push the button just push the button
 
02:33:07.070 --> 02:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
it'll yeah and really close you can see
 
02:33:08.330 --> 02:33:08.340 align:start position:0%
how it's
 
02:33:10.790 --> 02:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
is that good there you go okay good
 
02:33:12.530 --> 02:33:12.540 align:start position:0%
morning chairman hunt and the members of
 
02:33:14.090 --> 02:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
the House committee for Commerce and
 
02:33:16.550 --> 02:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
consumer affairs my name is Ellen Plum
 
02:33:18.590 --> 02:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
I'm a family physician with the New

Hampshire Academy of family physicians
 
02:33:23.330 --> 02:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
and I'm a primary care provider
 
02:33:26.090 --> 02:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
I come to you today not as an expert in
 
02:33:28.429 --> 02:33:28.439 align:start position:0%
policy or in government spending but as
 
02:33:30.650 --> 02:33:30.660 align:start position:0%
a clinician who is faced every day with
 
02:33:32.809 --> 02:33:32.819 align:start position:0%
the realities of how mental illness and
 
02:33:34.429 --> 02:33:34.439 align:start position:0%
behavioral emergencies are dealt with
 
02:33:36.889 --> 02:33:36.899 align:start position:0%
within our communities I come today to
 
02:33:39.290 --> 02:33:39.300 align:start position:0%
ask for your immediate support of Senate
 
02:33:41.990 --> 02:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
Bill 85. our Primary Care on-call
 
02:33:43.849 --> 02:33:43.859 align:start position:0%
coverage systems were created to help
 
02:33:46.130 --> 02:33:46.140 align:start position:0%
patients who need basic medical guidance
 
02:33:48.469 --> 02:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
they were not created to be psychiatric
 
02:33:50.690 --> 02:33:50.700 align:start position:0%
crisis management and stabilization
 
02:33:53.330 --> 02:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
strategies and yet suicidal patients
 
02:33:55.190 --> 02:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
frequently call these Services first
 
02:33:57.230 --> 02:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
knowing that they will reliably be
 
02:33:59.450 --> 02:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
connected to a provider Health Care
 
02:34:01.130 --> 02:34:01.140 align:start position:0%
settings across the state are
 
02:34:03.830 --> 02:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
increasingly understaffed the workforce
 
02:34:06.050 --> 02:34:06.060 align:start position:0%
needed to adequately triage clinical
 
02:34:08.750 --> 02:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
requests results in delayed access to
 
02:34:11.150 --> 02:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
point-of-care Services a concerning
 
02:34:13.130 --> 02:34:13.140 align:start position:0%
reality when considering a potentially
 
02:34:16.429 --> 02:34:16.439 align:start position:0%
life-threatening scenario like suicide I
 
02:34:17.809 --> 02:34:17.819 align:start position:0%
work in a clinic with Behavioral Health
 
02:34:20.389 --> 02:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
clinical teams that can support my work
 
02:34:22.969 --> 02:34:22.979 align:start position:0%
and my patients but this is far from the
 
02:34:25.610 --> 02:34:25.620 align:start position:0%
standard practice across the state where
 
02:34:27.710 --> 02:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
patients have limited access to adequate
 
02:34:30.530 --> 02:34:30.540 align:start position:0%
services to meet their needs psychiatric
 
02:34:32.929 --> 02:34:32.939 align:start position:0%
complexity feels to be increasing in my
 
02:34:35.150 --> 02:34:35.160 align:start position:0%
patient Community as our psychosocial
 
02:34:37.190 --> 02:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
determinants of suicidality such as
 
02:34:40.010 --> 02:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
chronic stress Financial insecurity and
 
02:34:42.410 --> 02:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
housing instability this is a reality
 
02:34:44.690 --> 02:34:44.700 align:start position:0%
that our Primary Care infrastructure and
 
02:34:47.150 --> 02:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
Workforce was simply not designed to
 
02:34:49.730 --> 02:34:49.740 align:start position:0%
sustain and yet we are asked to do so on
 
02:34:51.050 --> 02:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
a daily basis
 
02:34:53.210 --> 02:34:53.220 align:start position:0%
Primary Care Providers have neither the
 
02:34:55.790 --> 02:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
time nor the training to safely and
 
02:34:58.010 --> 02:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
competently stabilize a suicidal patient
 
02:35:00.410 --> 02:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
over the phone we are unable to see them
 
02:35:02.630 --> 02:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
on the demand and we certainly cannot
 
02:35:05.090 --> 02:35:05.100 align:start position:0%
travel to meet them where they are at
 
02:35:07.370 --> 02:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
yet we are routinely called upon to
 
02:35:08.870 --> 02:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
intervene when a patient calls our
 
02:35:11.929 --> 02:35:11.939 align:start position:0%
clinic in crisis we desperately need to
 
02:35:14.389 --> 02:35:14.399 align:start position:0%
consider sustainable alternatives to
 
02:35:16.550 --> 02:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
fund programs like the ones described in
 
02:35:19.429 --> 02:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
SB 85 and to ensure that these services
 
02:35:22.309 --> 02:35:22.319 align:start position:0%
are uniformly available to all patients
 
02:35:25.429 --> 02:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
regardless of insurance status to that
 
02:35:27.650 --> 02:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
end I strongly encourage you to vote in
 
02:35:33.230 --> 02:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
support of SB 86 85 sorry thank you
 
02:35:34.910 --> 02:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much for your
 
02:35:36.429 --> 02:35:36.439 align:start position:0%
testimony do we have any questions
 
02:35:39.170 --> 02:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
02:35:42.349 --> 02:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
um do you know how many states are have
 
02:35:44.290 --> 02:35:44.300 align:start position:0%
integrated this practice
 
02:35:48.290 --> 02:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
I do not it's not in my um scope of
 
02:35:50.450 --> 02:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
knowledge I just know what my experience
 
02:35:52.250 --> 02:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
is here in New Hampshire yeah just to
 
02:35:54.349 --> 02:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
02:35:58.070 --> 02:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
um lately there have been a lot of news
 
02:36:01.130 --> 02:36:01.140 align:start position:0%
segments regarding this bill and how
 
02:36:02.990 --> 02:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
it's very effective in many other states
 
02:36:05.090 --> 02:36:05.100 align:start position:0%
so it has been implemented great thanks
 
02:36:06.889 --> 02:36:06.899 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
02:36:06.899 --> 02:36:08.230 align:start position:0%
thank you for
that

02:36:08.230 --> 02:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:36:12.230 --> 02:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
oh oh God it representative
 
02:36:16.670 --> 02:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
um is this a I noticed that it came
 
02:36:19.190 --> 02:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
through insurance I mean it's Health and
 
02:36:21.950 --> 02:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
Human Services but here we're we are
 
02:36:24.070 --> 02:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
considering how to pay
 
02:36:28.550 --> 02:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh for an expansion and extensions of of
 
02:36:31.670 --> 02:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
your particular
 
02:36:36.170 --> 02:36:36.180 align:start position:0%
service is am I am I correct in that
 
02:36:42.550 --> 02:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:45.650 --> 02:36:45.660 align:start position:0%
do we have
 
02:36:45.660 --> 02:36:46.370 align:start position:0%
do we have
um

02:36:46.370 --> 02:36:46.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:50.330 --> 02:36:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:52.849 --> 02:36:52.859 align:start position:0%
um the financial uh how much it's going
 
02:36:55.610 --> 02:36:55.620 align:start position:0%
to cost or if we pass no we do not
 
02:36:58.550 --> 02:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
is this a study committee no is there is
 
02:37:00.170 --> 02:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
a commission and study committee in here
 
02:37:02.990 --> 02:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
to figure out sustainable funding but
 
02:37:05.330 --> 02:37:05.340 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
02:37:08.349 --> 02:37:08.359 align:start position:0%
um a procedure maybe Dr Brown would you
 
02:37:10.969 --> 02:37:10.979 align:start position:0%
he'll describe it for you thank you very
 
02:37:12.770 --> 02:37:12.780 align:start position:0%

02:37:17.460 --> 02:37:19.010 align:start position:0%
well we wanted to explain the team
system

02:37:19.010 --> 02:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:37:24.710 --> 02:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:28.070 --> 02:37:28.080 align:start position:0%

thank you chairman
 
02:37:32.870 --> 02:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
my name is Dr Alex Brown and I'm here
 
02:37:34.250 --> 02:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
today on behalf of the New Hampshire
 
02:37:36.230 --> 02:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
Psychological Association in strong
 
02:37:38.570 --> 02:37:38.580 align:start position:0%
support of Senate bill 85. this
 
02:37:39.830 --> 02:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
statement is also endorsed by the
 
02:37:41.929 --> 02:37:41.939 align:start position:0%
behavioral health advisory committee I'm
 
02:37:44.030 --> 02:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
a licensed psychologist and during my 10
 
02:37:46.010 --> 02:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
years in practice I've worked almost
 
02:37:47.929 --> 02:37:47.939 align:start position:0%
entirely within the primary care setting
 
02:37:50.330 --> 02:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
I see firsthand what it means when
 
02:37:51.889 --> 02:37:51.899 align:start position:0%
patients cannot access appropriate
 
02:37:54.170 --> 02:37:54.180 align:start position:0%
services and the downstream effects this
 
02:37:55.969 --> 02:37:55.979 align:start position:0%
has on primary care and our emergency
 
02:37:55.979 --> 02:37:57.530 align:start position:0%
has on primary care and our emergency
departments

02:37:57.530 --> 02:37:57.540 align:start position:0%
departments
 
02:38:00.469 --> 02:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
data from the CDC indicates that suicide
 
02:38:02.330 --> 02:38:02.340 align:start position:0%
is among the top 10 leading causes of
 
02:38:04.010 --> 02:38:04.020 align:start position:0%
death for granite Staters which
 
02:38:06.590 --> 02:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
disproportionately impacts both I hate
 
02:38:08.270 --> 02:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
to interrupt you but we've kind of got
 
02:38:10.490 --> 02:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
that already okay for the testimony and
 
02:38:11.570 --> 02:38:11.580 align:start position:0%
I know you want to read your testimony
 
02:38:13.490 --> 02:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
we will put it in to the permanent
 
02:38:15.889 --> 02:38:15.899 align:start position:0%
record the uh could you just focus on
 
02:38:18.170 --> 02:38:18.180 align:start position:0%
helping him out understand what is
 
02:38:21.070 --> 02:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
exactly yeah with this bill so this bill
 
02:38:26.330 --> 02:38:26.340 align:start position:0%
is a uh this calls for us removing the
 
02:38:28.309 --> 02:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
prior authorization
 
02:38:31.070 --> 02:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
um which which impacts uh patient access
 
02:38:34.610 --> 02:38:34.620 align:start position:0%
to the crisis Management Services that
 
02:38:36.469 --> 02:38:36.479 align:start position:0%
is uh that are described in the bill
 
02:38:39.410 --> 02:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
there's the three arms there is the um
 
02:38:42.710 --> 02:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
the 988 crisis hotline which is sort of
 
02:38:44.750 --> 02:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
well publicized
 
02:38:46.910 --> 02:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
um and effective but the other two
 
02:38:46.920 --> 02:38:48.050 align:start position:0%
um and effective but the other two
Services

02:38:48.050 --> 02:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
Services
 
02:38:51.349 --> 02:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
um the of the the three arms are the
 
02:38:51.359 --> 02:38:52.250 align:start position:0%
um the of the the three arms are the
um

02:38:52.250 --> 02:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:54.290 --> 02:38:54.300 align:start position:0%
receiving units as well as the mobile
 
02:38:56.750 --> 02:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
crisis Outreach
 
02:38:58.670 --> 02:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so why don't you talk about the
 
02:39:01.610 --> 02:39:01.620 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis unit what what is that all
 
02:39:03.710 --> 02:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
about so to help you understand so these
 
02:39:06.110 --> 02:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
are Regional these are Regional centers
 
02:39:08.690 --> 02:39:08.700 align:start position:0%
that are set up
 
02:39:11.270 --> 02:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
um and they are non-hospital settings
 
02:39:14.929 --> 02:39:14.939 align:start position:0%
where patients can be received and
 
02:39:17.570 --> 02:39:17.580 align:start position:0%
stabilized and the mobile crisis units
 
02:39:20.630 --> 02:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
are just that they are they are teams
 
02:39:23.450 --> 02:39:23.460 align:start position:0%
that are that mobilize in response um on
 
02:39:23.460 --> 02:39:24.429 align:start position:0%
that are that mobilize in response um on
demand

02:39:24.429 --> 02:39:24.439 align:start position:0%
demand
 
02:39:28.670 --> 02:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
to Patient uh patient crises in the
 
02:39:31.190 --> 02:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
communities they go to where they are in
 
02:39:33.050 --> 02:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
their homes in their workplaces again
 
02:39:34.910 --> 02:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
non-hospital settings wherever they're
 
02:39:36.770 --> 02:39:36.780 align:start position:0%
holed up at that moment where the crisis
 
02:39:39.050 --> 02:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
is correct yeah
 
02:39:39.060 --> 02:39:40.250 align:start position:0%
is correct yeah
okay

02:39:40.250 --> 02:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:39:40.260 --> 02:39:42.950 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

02:39:42.950 --> 02:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:45.110 --> 02:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
you got one minute to wrap up all right
 
02:39:46.490 --> 02:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:39:46.500 --> 02:39:47.330 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:39:47.330 --> 02:39:47.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:49.969 --> 02:39:49.979 align:start position:0%
well I would I think I would like to uh
 
02:39:52.250 --> 02:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
I did submit the data I think uh that
 
02:39:53.929 --> 02:39:53.939 align:start position:0%
that actually I think is really critical
 
02:39:56.210 --> 02:39:56.220 align:start position:0%
to understanding the need for this
 
02:39:58.309 --> 02:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
um I will just say that um I wanna for
 
02:39:59.630 --> 02:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
the for the record I want to tell the
 
02:40:00.770 --> 02:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
story of a patient that I'll call
 
02:40:02.690 --> 02:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
Richard who has constant ideas of
 
02:40:04.790 --> 02:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
killing himself he is unemployed and
 
02:40:06.650 --> 02:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
relies on Hospital financial assistance
 
02:40:08.809 --> 02:40:08.819 align:start position:0%
to address his complex Health needs in
 
02:40:10.429 --> 02:40:10.439 align:start position:0%
the past two years Richard has presented
 
02:40:12.349 --> 02:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
to the Ed no less than six times for
 
02:40:14.630 --> 02:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
suicidal ideation and has been admitted
 
02:40:16.670 --> 02:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
four of those times when there have been
 
02:40:18.170 --> 02:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
not enough available beds on the
 
02:40:19.730 --> 02:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
psychiatric service he has been managed
 
02:40:21.469 --> 02:40:21.479 align:start position:0%
on the medical floors all during a
 
02:40:23.210 --> 02:40:23.220 align:start position:0%
global pandemic when hospital beds have
 
02:40:25.190 --> 02:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
been in short supply none of this is
 
02:40:27.050 --> 02:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
uncommon it is in fact the state of
 
02:40:29.450 --> 02:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
crisis in crisis Management in the state
 
02:40:31.490 --> 02:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire it is both excessively
 
02:40:32.990 --> 02:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
expensive and it is clinically
 
02:40:35.450 --> 02:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
ineffective in contrast mobile response
 
02:40:36.950 --> 02:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
units and receiving centers have been
 
02:40:38.690 --> 02:40:38.700 align:start position:0%
shown to both improve clinical outcomes
 
02:40:41.030 --> 02:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
as well as health spending I strongly
 
02:40:43.550 --> 02:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
urge this committee to support SB 85 we
 
02:40:44.870 --> 02:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
urgently need to embrace alternative
 
02:40:46.910 --> 02:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
models to fund preventative Services to
 
02:40:48.650 --> 02:40:48.660 align:start position:0%
keep patients Like Richard out of our
 
02:40:50.630 --> 02:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
swelling emergency departments
 
02:40:52.610 --> 02:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
the problem with it with which has been
 
02:40:54.650 --> 02:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
well publicized in this state and who
 
02:40:56.330 --> 02:40:56.340 align:start position:0%
also deserve evidence-based options
 
02:40:58.130 --> 02:40:58.140 align:start position:0%
beyond our overburdened Primary Care
 
02:41:00.410 --> 02:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
Workforce for crisis stabilization this
 
02:41:02.450 --> 02:41:02.460 align:start position:0%
is true I called Richard yesterday for a
 
02:41:04.250 --> 02:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
scheduled Telehealth appointment and he
 
02:41:05.510 --> 02:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
could not speak because he was getting
 
02:41:08.110 --> 02:41:08.120 align:start position:0%
into an Uber on the way to the ER
 
02:41:10.730 --> 02:41:10.740 align:start position:0%
nhpa applauds the inclusion of a study
 
02:41:12.530 --> 02:41:12.540 align:start position:0%
commission to ensure sustainability of
 
02:41:14.170 --> 02:41:14.180 align:start position:0%
an effective system for crisis services
 
02:41:16.670 --> 02:41:16.680 align:start position:0%

policy and economic perspectives this
 
02:41:22.490 --> 02:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
work cannot wait and this bill must not
 
02:41:26.570 --> 02:41:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:28.070 --> 02:41:28.080 align:start position:0%

through support education and advocacy I
 
02:42:31.370 --> 02:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
will try to be brief because I know that
 
02:42:34.010 --> 02:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
we are between you guys and lunch I've
 
02:42:35.929 --> 02:42:35.939 align:start position:0%
got some data in here that I'm not going
 
02:42:38.410 --> 02:42:38.420 align:start position:0%
to go through you can read that I have
 
02:42:41.090 --> 02:42:41.100 align:start position:0%
faith in you but I did just want to
 
02:42:43.429 --> 02:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
highlight the reason you have this bill
 
02:42:45.710 --> 02:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
which is the insurance provision on the
 
02:42:47.270 --> 02:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
prior authorizations which you've heard
 
02:42:49.010 --> 02:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
a little bit about
 
02:42:49.020 --> 02:42:50.090 align:start position:0%
a little bit about
um

02:42:50.090 --> 02:42:50.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:52.309 --> 02:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
in keeping with parity requirements this
 
02:42:53.809 --> 02:42:53.819 align:start position:0%
bill would prohibit insurance companies
 
02:42:56.090 --> 02:42:56.100 align:start position:0%
from requiring prior authorizations for
 
02:42:57.950 --> 02:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
emergency Mental Health Services when
 
02:42:59.990 --> 02:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
provided within the Mental Health crisis
 
02:43:03.889 --> 02:43:03.899 align:start position:0%
program which is the mobile crisis teams
 
02:43:03.899 --> 02:43:06.170 align:start position:0%
program which is the mobile crisis teams
um

02:43:06.170 --> 02:43:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:08.030 --> 02:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
if a person has a physical health
 
02:43:09.710 --> 02:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
emergency there is no prior
 
02:43:11.990 --> 02:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
authorization required for them to go to
 
02:43:13.670 --> 02:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
the emergency room and receive emergency
 
02:43:16.610 --> 02:43:16.620 align:start position:0%
medical care a mental health emergency
 
02:43:18.770 --> 02:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
should be not not be treated any
 
02:43:21.770 --> 02:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
differently if a person calls 988 or not
 
02:43:24.050 --> 02:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
or the New Hampshire rapid response and
 
02:43:25.849 --> 02:43:25.859 align:start position:0%
is determined that a mobile crisis team
 
02:43:27.889 --> 02:43:27.899 align:start position:0%
response is appropriate there should not
 
02:43:29.750 --> 02:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
be a prior authorization required before
 
02:43:32.030 --> 02:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
the mobile team is deployed
 
02:43:34.270 --> 02:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
as you've heard mobile crisis teams
 
02:43:36.710 --> 02:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
dispatch to the community they can be
 
02:43:38.389 --> 02:43:38.399 align:start position:0%
seen someone can be seen in their home
 
02:43:41.469 --> 02:43:41.479 align:start position:0%
at Dunkin Donuts anywhere
 
02:43:44.210 --> 02:43:44.220 align:start position:0%
and so when you look at this bill if
 
02:43:45.950 --> 02:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
there was a prior authorization not only
 
02:43:48.050 --> 02:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
does it delay treatment but it could end
 
02:43:49.849 --> 02:43:49.859 align:start position:0%
up costing more because if somebody has
 
02:43:51.889 --> 02:43:51.899 align:start position:0%
to have a prior authorization before a
 
02:43:54.050 --> 02:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
mobile team comes out and sees them it's
 
02:43:55.969 --> 02:43:55.979 align:start position:0%
easier to just go to the emergency room
 
02:43:57.469 --> 02:43:57.479 align:start position:0%
because you know that if you go to the
 
02:43:59.150 --> 02:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
emergency room there is no prior
 
02:44:03.650 --> 02:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
authorization so in order to keep folks
 
02:44:05.510 --> 02:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
out of the emergency rooms when they're
 
02:44:07.670 --> 02:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
in crisis so they can be seen in the
 
02:44:09.110 --> 02:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
community it's really important that
 
02:44:11.450 --> 02:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
there is no prior authorization and it's
 
02:44:13.370 --> 02:44:13.380 align:start position:0%
my understanding that as this bill came
 
02:44:16.429 --> 02:44:16.439 align:start position:0%
out of the Senate that the insurers were
 
02:44:18.110 --> 02:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
on board with this and they can speak
 
02:44:19.550 --> 02:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
for themselves but I think they're
 
02:44:21.410 --> 02:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
neutral and they may not be speaking so
 
02:44:24.050 --> 02:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
that is my understanding and I will take
 
02:44:28.070 --> 02:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:29.929 --> 02:44:29.939 align:start position:0%
okay representative Herbert but remember
 
02:44:32.270 --> 02:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
you're delaying in the process here just
 
02:44:33.950 --> 02:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh 15 seconds
 
02:44:37.490 --> 02:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
um so the mobile unit uh
 
02:44:39.410 --> 02:44:39.420 align:start position:0%
um makes it uh you don't have to have a
 
02:44:41.270 --> 02:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
prior authorization if a mobile unit
 
02:44:43.190 --> 02:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
shows up
 
02:44:45.110 --> 02:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
that's what that's what exactly what
 
02:44:47.630 --> 02:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
this bill would do it would eliminate
 
02:44:49.790 --> 02:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
the prior authorization or prohibit a
 
02:44:51.889 --> 02:44:51.899 align:start position:0%
prior authorization for a mobile unit to
 
02:44:54.770 --> 02:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
go to somebody's house
 
02:44:56.870 --> 02:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
didn't feel up
 
02:44:59.450 --> 02:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
uh thank you during during a
 
02:45:01.730 --> 02:45:01.740 align:start position:0%
psychological emergency does a delay in
 
02:45:03.530 --> 02:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
care increase danger to the patient
 
02:45:03.540 --> 02:45:06.550 align:start position:0%
care increase danger to the patient
absolutely

02:45:06.550 --> 02:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:09.170 --> 02:45:09.180 align:start position:0%
okay we're all set
 
02:45:12.230 --> 02:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:17.750 --> 02:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:23.210 --> 02:45:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:24.590 --> 02:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
and please don't tell anything we've
 
02:45:25.610 --> 02:45:25.620 align:start position:0%
already heard
 
02:45:27.530 --> 02:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
say something new
 
02:45:28.969 --> 02:45:28.979 align:start position:0%
I'll try not to
 
02:45:31.849 --> 02:45:31.859 align:start position:0%
my name is Amy valeris I have a PhD in

MSW and a clinical license and social
 
02:45:36.590 --> 02:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
work and I'm here to urge you to support
 
02:45:40.010 --> 02:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
SB 85 I'm a social worker at a primary
 
02:45:43.309 --> 02:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
care clinic in Concord and I can attest
 
02:45:45.290 --> 02:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
to the Mental Health crisis in our
 
02:45:48.230 --> 02:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
community Rising exponentially both in
 
02:45:50.510 --> 02:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
number and intensity in the last three
 
02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:51.469 align:start position:0%
number and intensity in the last three
years

02:45:51.469 --> 02:45:51.479 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:45:54.290 --> 02:45:54.300 align:start position:0%
research has shown that nearly half of
 
02:45:58.010 --> 02:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
all people whose suicide have seen their
 
02:46:00.410 --> 02:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
Primary Care office in the month before
 
02:46:02.570 --> 02:46:02.580 align:start position:0%
this is a statistic that weighs quite
 
02:46:04.490 --> 02:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
heavily on those of us in primary care
 
02:46:07.370 --> 02:46:07.380 align:start position:0%
even one suicide has us spinning for
 
02:46:10.010 --> 02:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
days in weeks and years and should have
 
02:46:12.290 --> 02:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
could have would have if we could go
 
02:46:14.690 --> 02:46:14.700 align:start position:0%
back and see what could we have done in
 
02:46:16.370 --> 02:46:16.380 align:start position:0%
our roles differently
 
02:46:18.650 --> 02:46:18.660 align:start position:0%
the truth is all the Education and
 
02:46:20.510 --> 02:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
Training and validated Assessments in
 
02:46:23.510 --> 02:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
the world cannot give us a secure sense
 
02:46:25.370 --> 02:46:25.380 align:start position:0%
of whether somebody is stable enough or
 
02:46:27.230 --> 02:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
safe enough to walk out the doors of our
 
02:46:27.240 --> 02:46:29.090 align:start position:0%
safe enough to walk out the doors of our
Clinic

02:46:29.090 --> 02:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
Clinic
 
02:46:31.309 --> 02:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
this is a heavy burden to bear and
 
02:46:32.990 --> 02:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
speaks to the need for the Mental Health
 
02:46:36.290 --> 02:46:36.300 align:start position:0%
crisis response to live both inside and
 
02:46:37.969 --> 02:46:37.979 align:start position:0%
outside the walls of Health Care
 
02:46:40.670 --> 02:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
available and easy to access in the
 
02:46:42.770 --> 02:46:42.780 align:start position:0%
community where people live
 
02:46:44.929 --> 02:46:44.939 align:start position:0%
it is of a men's Solace to know that
 
02:46:47.210 --> 02:46:47.220 align:start position:0%
they have access to a simple number like
 
02:46:47.220 --> 02:46:48.770 align:start position:0%
they have access to a simple number like
988

02:46:48.770 --> 02:46:48.780 align:start position:0%
988
 
02:46:51.230 --> 02:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
I am not exaggerating when I say it is
 
02:46:53.389 --> 02:46:53.399 align:start position:0%
this number that allows us to sleep at
 
02:46:56.210 --> 02:46:56.220 align:start position:0%
night and when we lose sleep because we
 
02:46:58.550 --> 02:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
are worried about patients we burn out
 
02:47:00.889 --> 02:47:00.899 align:start position:0%
and we leave health care and currently
 
02:47:03.110 --> 02:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
that is a problem for all of us because
 
02:47:05.330 --> 02:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
it when Healthcare is understaffed all
 
02:47:07.730 --> 02:47:07.740 align:start position:0%
of our health care needs go unaddressed
 
02:47:10.130 --> 02:47:10.140 align:start position:0%
it is not only addressing the needs of
 
02:47:12.050 --> 02:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
people in a mental health crisis but
 
02:47:14.090 --> 02:47:14.100 align:start position:0%
also addressing the overwhelming burnout
 
02:47:16.730 --> 02:47:16.740 align:start position:0%
of men of health care workers please
 
02:47:19.130 --> 02:47:19.140 align:start position:0%
support SB 85 so New Hampshire people
 
02:47:21.230 --> 02:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
can continue to access crisis Services
 
02:47:23.630 --> 02:47:23.640 align:start position:0%

02:50:32.389 --> 02:50:32.399 align:start position:0%
the actual take effect no read the line
 
02:50:34.309 --> 02:50:34.319 align:start position:0%

02:50:59.710 --> 02:50:59.720 align:start position:0%
okay it's not exceedingly clear to me
 
02:51:02.750 --> 02:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
this is how we structure uh OLS
 
02:51:04.790 --> 02:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
structures repeals uh when we ask them
 
02:51:06.650 --> 02:51:06.660 align:start position:0%

02:51:20.160 --> 02:51:24.590 align:start position:0%
scrolling you wrote about the support
neutral

02:51:24.590 --> 02:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:28.490 --> 02:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:28.500 --> 02:51:30.770 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:51:30.770 --> 02:51:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:33.530 --> 02:51:33.540 align:start position:0%
I thought you guys were neutral we are
 
02:51:34.670 --> 02:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the chance to speak
 
02:51:36.110 --> 02:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
Sabrina Dunlap director of government
 
02:51:38.210 --> 02:51:38.220 align:start position:0%
relations at Anthem I just wanted to
 
02:51:40.670 --> 02:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
clarify a couple things we spoke when
 
02:51:42.349 --> 02:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
this was in Senate HHS and at the time
 
02:51:45.110 --> 02:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
had concerns around some definitions
 
02:51:47.210 --> 02:51:47.220 align:start position:0%
that seemed vague the commission did not
 
02:51:49.010 --> 02:51:49.020 align:start position:0%
include the insurance department or
 
02:51:50.330 --> 02:51:50.340 align:start position:0%
anyone from ahip so that has been
 
02:51:50.340 --> 02:51:51.950 align:start position:0%
anyone from ahip so that has been
amended

02:51:51.950 --> 02:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
amended
 
02:51:55.790 --> 02:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
um and the amended version I think where
 
02:51:58.190 --> 02:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
carriers are okay with because some of
 
02:52:00.469 --> 02:52:00.479 align:start position:0%
the definitional vagueness went away I
 
02:52:02.630 --> 02:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify that there is
 
02:52:04.490 --> 02:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
currently no prior auth for emergency
 
02:52:07.969 --> 02:52:07.979 align:start position:0%
services including mobile rapid response
 
02:52:11.450 --> 02:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
so the amended version clarifies that
 
02:52:13.070 --> 02:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
mental health emergencies are part of
 
02:52:15.349 --> 02:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
the existing definition of emergency
 
02:52:17.330 --> 02:52:17.340 align:start position:0%
services for which there is no prior off
 
02:52:20.210 --> 02:52:20.220 align:start position:0%
so anyway I just wanted to clarify that
 
02:52:22.130 --> 02:52:22.140 align:start position:0%
um and make it clear like I don't think
 
02:52:23.690 --> 02:52:23.700 align:start position:0%
insurance is actually a barrier to these
 
02:52:25.910 --> 02:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
Services currently but we support the
 
02:52:27.349 --> 02:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
commission and
 
02:52:29.750 --> 02:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
support rapid response mobile crisis
 
02:52:31.550 --> 02:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
02:52:34.610 --> 02:52:34.620 align:start position:0%
fair enough thank you any questions from
 
02:52:36.110 --> 02:52:36.120 align:start position:0%

02:52:39.769 --> 02:52:39.779 align:start position:0%

02:52:59.269 --> 02:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:59.279 --> 02:53:00.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:53:00.950 --> 02:53:00.960 align:start position:0%

for having me be sure you pull the mic
 
02:53:06.889 --> 02:53:06.899 align:start position:0%
close for the record my name is Emma
 
02:53:08.450 --> 02:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
savini I am the children's Behavioral
 
02:53:10.250 --> 02:53:10.260 align:start position:0%
Health policy coordinator at new Futures
 
02:53:12.790 --> 02:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
new Futures is a
 
02:53:15.110 --> 02:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan non-profit organization that
 
02:53:16.790 --> 02:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
Advocates educates and collaborates for
 
02:53:18.050 --> 02:53:18.060 align:start position:0%
the health and well-being of all Granite
 
02:53:21.710 --> 02:53:21.720 align:start position:0%
Staters I'll keep it extremely brief we
 
02:53:24.530 --> 02:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
are here in support of SP 85 we think
 
02:53:26.510 --> 02:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
the study commission is necessary to
 
02:53:28.370 --> 02:53:28.380 align:start position:0%
find a sustainable funding source for
 
02:53:30.230 --> 02:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
these programs that you've heard how
 
02:53:32.410 --> 02:53:32.420 align:start position:0%
important they are to our communities
 
02:53:34.790 --> 02:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
many states Across the Nation right now
 
02:53:36.170 --> 02:53:36.180 align:start position:0%
are dealing with the same issue and
 
02:53:37.849 --> 02:53:37.859 align:start position:0%
dealing with it in different ways so
 
02:53:39.349 --> 02:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
this study commission would just Loop in
 
02:53:40.730 --> 02:53:40.740 align:start position:0%
the legislature to make sure that we
 
02:53:42.650 --> 02:53:42.660 align:start position:0%
find a solution that works for New
 
02:53:42.660 --> 02:53:43.610 align:start position:0%
find a solution that works for New
Hampshire

02:53:43.610 --> 02:53:43.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:53:45.590 --> 02:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
secondly removing the pre-authorization
 
02:53:48.590 --> 02:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
requirements just makes these Services
 
02:53:50.750 --> 02:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
more accessible to people would help
 
02:53:53.269 --> 02:53:53.279 align:start position:0%
reduce our strain on the emergency
 
02:53:56.210 --> 02:53:56.220 align:start position:0%
departments and it's also an
 
02:53:57.769 --> 02:53:57.779 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practice that has been
 
02:54:00.349 --> 02:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
shown to be more cost effective I'm
 
02:54:03.830 --> 02:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:06.469 --> 02:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
I think they're ready for lunch thank
 
02:54:09.889 --> 02:54:09.899 align:start position:0%

02:54:12.469 --> 02:54:12.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Psychological Association
 
02:54:14.450 --> 02:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
and didn't check anything but I assume
 
02:54:16.389 --> 02:54:16.399 align:start position:0%
you're in support of the bill
 
02:54:19.370 --> 02:54:19.380 align:start position:0%
put a card in this time all right let's
 
02:54:19.380 --> 02:54:21.429 align:start position:0%
put a card in this time all right let's
see

02:54:21.429 --> 02:54:21.439 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:54:23.750 --> 02:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
getting better
 
02:54:26.210 --> 02:54:26.220 align:start position:0%
I'm new here and you used to be a rep
 
02:54:27.610 --> 02:54:27.620 align:start position:0%
that I remember
 
02:54:31.010 --> 02:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee for
 
02:54:32.269 --> 02:54:32.279 align:start position:0%
the record my name is John dejoy
 
02:54:33.769 --> 02:54:33.779 align:start position:0%
representing New Hampshire Psychological
 
02:54:36.170 --> 02:54:36.180 align:start position:0%
Association as you heard from Dr Brown
 
02:54:39.710 --> 02:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
and HPA fully supports SP 85 just to
 
02:54:42.170 --> 02:54:42.180 align:start position:0%
want to make two points this bill and
 
02:54:43.790 --> 02:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
the testimony around this bill you heard
 
02:54:46.610 --> 02:54:46.620 align:start position:0%
from the uh the doctor as well as from
 
02:54:49.969 --> 02:54:49.979 align:start position:0%
Dr Brown points out quite clearly the
 
02:54:51.650 --> 02:54:51.660 align:start position:0%
need for Primary Care Behavioral Health
 
02:54:54.889 --> 02:54:54.899 align:start position:0%
why we brought in Senate Bill 235 that
 
02:54:56.269 --> 02:54:56.279 align:start position:0%
is now retained that we're still working
 
02:54:58.370 --> 02:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
on with the insurance department and why
 
02:55:01.670 --> 02:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
that bill is so important secondly one
 
02:55:04.130 --> 02:55:04.140 align:start position:0%
of the in the commission there are no
 
02:55:06.349 --> 02:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
clinicians on the commission I
 
02:55:08.510 --> 02:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
understand it's a fiscal commission
 
02:55:10.730 --> 02:55:10.740 align:start position:0%
primarily but you can't talk about
 
02:55:12.290 --> 02:55:12.300 align:start position:0%
finances without understanding the
 
02:55:14.269 --> 02:55:14.279 align:start position:0%
practice and we would ask that a member
 
02:55:17.450 --> 02:55:17.460 align:start position:0%
of nhpa be added as a named member of
 
02:55:19.490 --> 02:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
the commission with that I'll conclude
 
02:55:21.230 --> 02:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
my remarks
 
02:55:21.240 --> 02:55:25.610 align:start position:0%
my remarks
foreign

02:55:25.610 --> 02:55:25.620 align:start position:0%

we'll

02:55:37.670 --> 02:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
02:55:42.230 --> 02:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
see close to public hearing on uh Senate
 
02:55:43.849 --> 02:55:43.859 align:start position:0%
bill I do have a I do have a question
 
02:55:45.650 --> 02:55:45.660 align:start position:0%
for you Mr chairman okay
 
02:55:47.630 --> 02:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
is the same committee for cannabis still
 
02:55:49.370 --> 02:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
going to be the same members is the
 
02:55:51.410 --> 02:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
liquor committee okay Liquor Division
 
02:55:51.420 --> 02:55:52.969 align:start position:0%
liquor committee okay Liquor Division
yes

02:55:52.969 --> 02:55:52.979 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:55:56.809 --> 02:55:56.819 align:start position:0%
okay and uh so I will be discussing with
 
02:55:59.630 --> 02:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
the commission uh what we've got here in
 
02:56:02.510 --> 02:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
the hearing and seeing how we can figure
 
02:56:05.090 --> 02:56:05.100 align:start position:0%
out some way to keep the atcs in it
 
02:56:07.550 --> 02:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
because everybody seems to want to hug
 
02:56:13.330 --> 02:56:13.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:16.190 --> 02:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
but I I have to be I'll be honest I
 
02:56:18.050 --> 02:56:18.060 align:start position:0%
voted against atcs from right from the
 
02:56:20.630 --> 02:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
get-go because to me that they were it
 
02:56:21.950 --> 02:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
was the Campbell's nose Under the Tent
 
02:56:24.110 --> 02:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
let alone the fact that if we were ever
 
02:56:26.690 --> 02:56:26.700 align:start position:0%
to legalize marijuana how are we going
 
02:56:28.849 --> 02:56:28.859 align:start position:0%
to deal with them and I knew this I
 
02:56:30.170 --> 02:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
predicted this problem was going to
 
02:56:30.180 --> 02:56:31.809 align:start position:0%
predicted this problem was going to
occur

02:56:31.809 --> 02:56:31.819 align:start position:0%
occur
 
02:56:34.010 --> 02:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
cannot be administered
 
02:56:35.510 --> 02:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
I have to be administered through
 
02:56:36.950 --> 02:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
medicinal needs
 
02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:38.690 align:start position:0%
medicinal needs
uh

02:56:38.690 --> 02:56:38.700 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:56:42.889 --> 02:56:42.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:44.570 --> 02:56:44.580 align:start position:0%
right but that all you're doing is
 
02:56:46.550 --> 02:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
arguing for what I would say is then why
 
02:56:48.650 --> 02:56:48.660 align:start position:0%
can't leave the atcs alone just let them
 
02:56:50.269 --> 02:56:50.279 align:start position:0%
stay alone but no they're convinced
 
02:56:51.110 --> 02:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
they're going to put them out of
 
02:56:53.210 --> 02:56:53.220 align:start position:0%
business because evidently the patients
 
02:56:54.830 --> 02:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
don't seem to understand what you just
 
02:56:54.840 --> 02:56:56.710 align:start position:0%
don't seem to understand what you just
said

02:56:56.710 --> 02:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:57:00.469 --> 02:57:00.479 align:start position:0%
so with that we're done Dems are going
 
02:57:05.570 --> 02:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:07.309 --> 02:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
Barley House
 
02:57:10.190 --> 02:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
it's a free lunch
 
02:57:10.200 --> 02:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
it's a free lunch
foreign
