good morning Mr chairman members of the
committee

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:45.180 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
I am here to rep uh to introduce this
 
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
morning csm9 my name is uh
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative Terry Roy I represent
 
00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:55.740 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 32.
 
00:08:59.389 --> 00:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
this Constitutional Amendment
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
um would
 
00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
restrict municipalities from Raising
 
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
more than two percent in any given year
 
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
for the general population and more than
 
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:13.740 align:start position:0%
one percent in any given year for
 
00:09:17.329 --> 00:09:17.339 align:start position:0%
disabled residents or senior citizens
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
I feel that we can all agree that one of
 
00:09:23.389 --> 00:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
the main complaints or issues or
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
concerns that all of our constituents
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
have Democrat Republican independent is
 
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
the rising and ever increasing cost of
 
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
property taxes in the state
 
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.050 align:start position:0%
property taxes in the state
now

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
I could have been given the speech to
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
this committee probably 30 years ago and
 
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:40.740 align:start position:0%
it would have been the same exact thing
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
we seem to be
 
00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:44.940 align:start position:0%
grappling with this for decades and we
 
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
don't know how to deal with it
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
and while we kick the can down the road
 
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
and by we I don't mean us perhaps
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
sitting here but our predecessors and
 
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
their predecessors before them
 
00:09:57.769 --> 00:09:57.779 align:start position:0%
the people who are really paying for are
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
the citizens who are or owning property
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
and in particularly senior citizens we
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
are without
 
00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:07.820 align:start position:0%
um a doubt in arguably
 
00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:09.959 align:start position:0%
taxing senior citizens out of their
 
00:10:09.959 --> 00:10:11.389 align:start position:0%
taxing senior citizens out of their
homes

00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
homes
 
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
um there there's people I've heard from
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
constituents that have to sell their
 
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
homes that they've lived in their whole
 
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
lives and worked their whole careers to
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
pay for because they can no longer
 
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:22.740 align:start position:0%
afford their property taxes
 
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.470 align:start position:0%
afford their property taxes
now

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
we can debate whose fault that is but I
 
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
think that that's another that's another
 
00:10:30.769 --> 00:10:30.779 align:start position:0%
issue but in the meantime you know it's
 
00:10:32.449 --> 00:10:32.459 align:start position:0%
kind of like first stage you got to stop
 
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
believing we have to put the brakes on
 
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
this and force us to have a conversation
 
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
as a legislature in municipalities how
 
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
to deal with this property tax issue and
 
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
if we don't do something to stop it it's
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
just going to keep going and going
 
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
so Massachusetts over 30 years ago
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
introduced something called proposition
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
two and a half and similarly it froze
 
00:10:56.329 --> 00:10:56.339 align:start position:0%
two and a half percent as a property tax
 
00:10:56.339 --> 00:10:58.430 align:start position:0%
two and a half percent as a property tax
cap

00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
cap
 
00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.690 align:start position:0%
cap
um

00:10:59.690 --> 00:10:59.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:02.820 align:start position:0%
we as a legislature would not be doing
 
00:11:05.569 --> 00:11:05.579 align:start position:0%
this all this is is enabling the
 
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state to have a say
 
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
so if we were to pass this it wouldn't
 
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't go into effect what it would
 
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
do was put on the ballot and it would
 
00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
let the citizens of the state come out
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
and say yeah we we agree it should be
 
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
Frozen at a certain level or no we don't
 
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.410 align:start position:0%
Frozen at a certain level or no we don't
agree

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
agree
 
00:11:26.569 --> 00:11:26.579 align:start position:0%
um so I think it's time the citizens how
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
to say in this property tax situation
 
00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
and the problem has been
 
00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:35.700 align:start position:0%
um part of it
 
00:11:38.449 --> 00:11:38.459 align:start position:0%
that people don't really understand how
 
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
town meeting Works we've kind of failed
 
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
Civics wise and for many of us even even
 
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
legislators aren't really sure how it
 
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
works and if you can't go to town
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
meeting or if you don't understand how
 
00:11:51.769 --> 00:11:51.779 align:start position:0%
it works
 
00:11:53.449 --> 00:11:53.459 align:start position:0%
you just realize when you get your tax
 
00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
bill oh my God taxes have gone up yet
 
00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.630 align:start position:0%
bill oh my God taxes have gone up yet
again

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
so what this would do if the citizens
 
00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
chose to pass it
 
00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:02.820 align:start position:0%
would be it would freeze the property
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
tax a two percent increase over the
 
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
previous year's tax
 
00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:09.660 align:start position:0%
but they would be able to override that
 
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:11.700 align:start position:0%
if the municipality can make a
 
00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
convincing argument to their citizens
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
why it needed to go up
 
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
there's a mechanism to override the two
 
00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
percent and the citizens can vote to do
 
00:12:22.009 --> 00:12:22.019 align:start position:0%
so all this does is keep the
 
00:12:22.019 --> 00:12:23.509 align:start position:0%
so all this does is keep the
municipality

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
from putting it forward without the
 
00:12:27.889 --> 00:12:27.899 align:start position:0%
citizens direct approval on a ballot
 
00:12:29.569 --> 00:12:29.579 align:start position:0%
where they can actually see what it
 
00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:32.220 align:start position:0%
means instead of at a town meeting in
 
00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
the middle of the night with a raise of
 
00:12:35.449 --> 00:12:35.459 align:start position:0%
hands or years and days when people
 
00:12:36.769 --> 00:12:36.779 align:start position:0%
don't even know what's happening or
 
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:39.620 align:start position:0%
understand how to how to navigate it
 
00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
so what I want to do with this is I'm
 
00:12:44.449 --> 00:12:44.459 align:start position:0%
hoping we can start a conversation that
 
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
we've been avoiding for for decades on
 
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
how to help out our our citizens with
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
this property tax issue and while we're
 
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
doing it protect senior citizens and
 
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
disabled people from losing their homes
 
00:12:59.629 --> 00:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
because they just can no longer afford
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
these tax increases
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
again I just want to reiterate if we
 
00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
pass this it doesn't mean it goes into
 
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
effect all this does is say
 
00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:11.459 align:start position:0%
citizens in New Hampshire
 
00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
this is what we've come up with to offer
 
00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
you are you interested or not and it's
 
00:13:19.009 --> 00:13:19.019 align:start position:0%
up to them devoted to pass it all this
 
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
is is really enabling
 
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:23.180 align:start position:0%
the citizens to have a voice
 
00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
so with that I'd be happy to take any
 
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.530 align:start position:0%
so with that I'd be happy to take any
questions

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.670 align:start position:0%
questions
okay

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
um before we get the questions we're
 
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
going to ask representative manager if
 
00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:36.620 align:start position:0%
you could co-host me for the really
 
00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:39.620 align:start position:0%
Christina to do that
 
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
at this point I believe I need Christina
 
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
Dyer's assistance there if she can
 
00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
okay so maybe she can work on that while
 
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.230 align:start position:0%
okay so maybe she can work on that while
uh

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:53.700 align:start position:0%
we'll first go to uh representative
 
00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
corner at our hand rates first
 
00:13:59.449 --> 00:13:59.459 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative Roy
 
00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
when I see things like this I get a
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
little bit concerned and I don't
 
00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
understand how it would work in this
 
00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
situation Grant it it's a hypothetical
 
00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
but say there was a natural disaster
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
that wiped out the school buildings in a
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
community for a fire it was a flood
 
00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
there was a landslide and the and the
 
00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
school was completely gone
 
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
it would cause and that in order to do
 
00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
so taxes needed to be raised more than
 
00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
if you say that there's a provision in
 
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519 align:start position:0%
here that could be overridden if the
 
00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers agree but what if the
 
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers didn't agree what if it went
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
to the voters and and they decided no
 
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
they had to wait for the town meeting
 
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
and then they voted no we're not going
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
to let you do that what would happen how
 
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
would the community deal with
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
this situation if it's again if it's in
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
the Constitution that they can't change
 
00:15:08.569 --> 00:15:08.579 align:start position:0%
it they can't go over two percent
 
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:12.660 align:start position:0%
representative Porter but I I kind of um
 
00:15:14.449 --> 00:15:14.459 align:start position:0%
without being cheeky think you answered
 
00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:17.459 align:start position:0%
the question for me the community would
 
00:15:19.129 --> 00:15:19.139 align:start position:0%
have spoken when they said no we're not
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
going to do that I mean so that
 
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry no I guess the question is how
 
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
would the the
 
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
in other words the elected officials of
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
the Town how would they be able to
 
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
override their own citizens and
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
constituents and say we know better than
 
00:15:39.769 --> 00:15:39.779 align:start position:0%
you we do need this school so I I guess
 
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
I guess the problem is is again I want
 
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:45.180 align:start position:0%
the citizens to be able to have the say
 
00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
in the matter and I would I would submit
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
I I would hope that they would want to
 
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
replace the school
 
00:15:53.389 --> 00:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
um in that situation but having said
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
that if they didn't
 
00:15:55.199 --> 00:15:56.329 align:start position:0%
that if they didn't
um

00:15:56.329 --> 00:15:56.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:58.129 --> 00:15:58.139 align:start position:0%
I really I mean
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
you can't I don't think we're in the
 
00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
business of forcing them to do what they
 
00:16:03.769 --> 00:16:03.779 align:start position:0%
don't want to do and people would then I
 
00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
guess vote with their feet and leave the
 
00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:07.019 align:start position:0%
town that did not want to replace at
 
00:16:07.019 --> 00:16:08.269 align:start position:0%
town that did not want to replace at
school

00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
um but I that's really hypothetical
 
00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:19.980 align:start position:0%
no it just seems to me that we're
 
00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:23.820 align:start position:0%
putting the town if the vote was close
 
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
and it was 51 to 49 percent
 
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:29.220 align:start position:0%
that means almost half the people want
 
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
to replace their school
 
00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.590 align:start position:0%
to replace their school
what

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
is the recourse then that just have to
 
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:39.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:42.660 align:start position:0%
well I I guess
 
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:44.820 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm looking at a bigger picture
 
00:16:47.769 --> 00:16:47.779 align:start position:0%
I mean the same thing applies in 51
 
00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:50.519 align:start position:0%
voted for a certain President 50 didn't
 
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
and we end up with the president we get
 
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
I mean that's the way the Democracy
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
works but I can see your point you know
 
00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
when you get into a really small town
 
00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:01.259 align:start position:0%
one uh one anti-government curmudgeon
 
00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
might be able to to flip the vulpit
 
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
again that's just how democracy works
 
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
and I think if we don't give the
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
citizens a choice to vote and say you
 
00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
know uh I am in favor or not in favor
 
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:15.900 align:start position:0%
um it's us it's us
 
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
um dictating to them what they're gonna
 
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:18.839 align:start position:0%
what they're gonna have and what they're
 
00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:19.860 align:start position:0%
not and what they're going to pay and
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
what they're not and again I would
 
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
remind you that it's it's the senior
 
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
citizens and the disabled people who are
 
00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
going to foot this bill it's not really
 
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
it's the Young Folks working are able to
 
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
keep up with these increases every year
 
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
hardly but they are better than people
 
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
who get you know fourteen hundred
 
00:17:39.289 --> 00:17:39.299 align:start position:0%
dollars a month Social Security when you
 
00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:41.460 align:start position:0%
get that kind of money and you see a 500
 
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
or 600 increase on your taxes you're
 
00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
talking about percentages of your yearly
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
income and these are the folks I think
 
00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:50.700 align:start position:0%
we really need to save here while these
 
00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
debates occur such as what you just
 
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.130 align:start position:0%
debates occur such as what you just
discussed

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:00.289 --> 00:18:00.299 align:start position:0%
next uh representative I'm going to go
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
to representative Gallagher and then and
 
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
then after that representative
 
00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:08.700 align:start position:0%
for two purposes so you know next up
 
00:18:10.909 --> 00:18:10.919 align:start position:0%
here from our representative Gallagher
 
00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
here microphone endurance
 
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.169 align:start position:0%
here microphone endurance
so

00:18:15.169 --> 00:18:15.179 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
um you were describing in your testimony
 
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:22.140 align:start position:0%
how this would work in a town meeting
 
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.529 align:start position:0%
how this would work in a town meeting
for

00:18:24.529 --> 00:18:24.539 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
um places that municipalities that are
 
00:18:30.049 --> 00:18:30.059 align:start position:0%
organized as towns
 
00:18:33.049 --> 00:18:33.059 align:start position:0%
um I'm from Concord I represent a city
 
00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:36.059 align:start position:0%
we don't do Town meetings we do
 
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
um we have a city council and mayor and
 
00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
city manager how
 
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.830 align:start position:0%
city manager how
would

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
that situ How would
 
00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:49.860 align:start position:0%
this Amendment affect cities with
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
uh city government
 
00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
organized in that manner
 
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher I I only
 
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned town meeting because that's
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
the one that's really confusing for a
 
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:03.720 align:start position:0%
lot of people especially folks that move
 
00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:05.700 align:start position:0%
from out of state or from cities like
 
00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
yourself don't really a lot of them
 
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
don't understand the process but it
 
00:19:12.289 --> 00:19:12.299 align:start position:0%
doesn't specify in the amendment
 
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:14.039 align:start position:0%
um town city or whatever just as a
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
municipality so for example if Concord
 
00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
wanted to raise property taxes uh three
 
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
percent one year they would need to go
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
to the voters of Concord for an override
 
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that so it really would
 
00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:31.860 align:start position:0%
be no different for a town or a city
 
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
thank you uh we're gonna go to next to
 
00:19:36.049 --> 00:19:36.059 align:start position:0%
representative manager Cody and then
 
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:41.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:43.980 align:start position:0%
representative Roy for taking my
 
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:46.980 align:start position:0%
question for me it
 
00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
um kind of brings a very fundamental
 
00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:53.700 align:start position:0%
question about Democratic process uh
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
voters elect us to represent their View
 
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
and they hold us accountable hopefully
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
to carry their you know I get emails and
 
00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:07.940 align:start position:0%
calls from my
 
00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
and uh to say the due diligence and what
 
00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
to me in the process this seems to be
 
00:20:18.289 --> 00:20:18.299 align:start position:0%
putting it right back to the voters and
 
00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
saying you make the decision how you
 
00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
want to uh raise uh revenue or pay for
 
00:20:27.169 --> 00:20:27.179 align:start position:0%
the taxes you know I will only
 
00:20:27.179 --> 00:20:28.730 align:start position:0%
the taxes you know I will only
facilitate

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:28.740 align:start position:0%
facilitate
 
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
and then why do we have to go through
 
00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
the process of electing you if my
 
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
constituents ask that kind of question
 
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
how do I respond uh
 
00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
that this is as a role for me is that's
 
00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
why we get the big bucks paid and the
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
big title of State reps so just if you
 
00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:53.820 align:start position:0%
can address that oh I'd be happy to and
 
00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
I'd also be happy if you'd share some of
 
00:20:57.409 --> 00:20:57.419 align:start position:0%
those big bucks because I didn't seem to
 
00:20:59.090 --> 00:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
get my check this year from the
 
00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.350 align:start position:0%
get my check this year from the
legislature

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:03.380 align:start position:0%
um so this is we're talking about
 
00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
democracy at the at the closest level so
 
00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
for state representatives we don't we
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
don't set tax rates for towns
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
um it would be their local local local
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
local Representatives on their town
 
00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
councils on their City councilors
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
um and and at that level
 
00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:25.559 align:start position:0%
the voters always get a chance to vote
 
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
on a budget
 
00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
and what happens is a lot in
 
00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
increasingly so across the state they
 
00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:34.140 align:start position:0%
end up with something called a default
 
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
budget in other words they do vote down
 
00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:37.980 align:start position:0%
the increases
 
00:21:39.289 --> 00:21:39.299 align:start position:0%
um but it really doesn't help because
 
00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
the default budget's almost the same as
 
00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
the budget anyway because of contractual
 
00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:45.900 align:start position:0%
obligations and a myriad of other things
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
all this does is say it gives the it
 
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
gives them one more chance to say no to
 
00:21:54.409 --> 00:21:54.419 align:start position:0%
a tax increase so I don't think that
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
we're we're abrogating our
 
00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:57.900 align:start position:0%
responsibility or we're deflecting it
 
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
back to the taxpayers because at our
 
00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.430 align:start position:0%
back to the taxpayers because at our
level

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
we don't get involved in the in the
 
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
exact in the rate setting for the towns
 
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
for the state representative level all
 
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
we're doing is saying to the people in
 
00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to give you one more chance
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
to approve or not approve the tax
 
00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
increase is being proposed by the
 
00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.010 align:start position:0%
increase is being proposed by the
municipality

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
00:22:24.289 --> 00:22:24.299 align:start position:0%
I hope that answers your question a
 
00:22:27.529 --> 00:22:27.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
oh no I understand so this but we have
 
00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
to work together the state downshifts to
 
00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
the counties and the cities and the
 
00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
towns so that is our role or I see
 
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
myself as uh you know facilitating that
 
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:45.950 align:start position:0%
myself as uh you know facilitating that
or

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
uh advocating for my constituency not
 
00:22:53.149 --> 00:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
downshifting and tax rates are set local
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
level I understand that but how we
 
00:22:59.390 --> 00:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
facilitate state has a big say in how it
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
facilitates uh how it directs so from
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
that angle
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
takes away
 
00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:18.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:21.049 --> 00:23:21.059 align:start position:0%
okay I'll I'll take that as a question I
 
00:23:21.059 --> 00:23:22.010 align:start position:0%
okay I'll I'll take that as a question I
think

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:25.740 align:start position:0%
um so I'm glad you said that well first
 
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
of all two things I'm sure you probably
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
understand that you and I probably
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
disagree fundamentally on the whole
 
00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:32.940 align:start position:0%
downshifting thing but but that's good
 
00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:34.919 align:start position:0%
though because this gives us this would
 
00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:37.020 align:start position:0%
give us that conversation we can't we've
 
00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:38.700 align:start position:0%
been we've been having that debate
 
00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
between one side and the other about
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
downshifting and whose responsibility is
 
00:23:45.049 --> 00:23:45.059 align:start position:0%
it's been going on for decades and it
 
00:23:46.669 --> 00:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
will continue to go on after you and I
 
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
are no longer in the house I think it's
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
time that we stop kicking the can and we
 
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:52.980 align:start position:0%
force ourselves to have the conversation
 
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
so if municipalities can no longer raise
 
00:23:58.730 --> 00:23:58.740 align:start position:0%
revenue however to whatever extent they
 
00:24:00.649 --> 00:24:00.659 align:start position:0%
want while we fight about who's going to
 
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
pay for it
 
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to be forced to the
 
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
table and it's going to force us to come
 
00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
to some kind of an agreement on how to
 
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:10.919 align:start position:0%
help municipalities if we just continue
 
00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
having the finger pointing downshifting
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
we'll know it's your responsibility
 
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
argument it's just going to continue on
 
00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:19.980 align:start position:0%
forever and ever well in the meantime as
 
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
I said in my opening statement senior
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
citizens are being forced out young
 
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:26.460 align:start position:0%
people can't move in the taxes are just
 
00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:30.140 align:start position:0%
too darn High to borrow a statement
 
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
so I I think that it's good that we have
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
that debate about whose responsibility
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
it is but the people are suffering while
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
we debate are the citizens so all I'm
 
00:24:42.289 --> 00:24:42.299 align:start position:0%
saying here is let the citizens have a
 
00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
chance to say no we're not paying for
 
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:47.820 align:start position:0%
that now you who I elected figure out
 
00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
how to help us because in the meantime
 
00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
all that's happening is the cities and
 
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:53.940 align:start position:0%
towns just keep saying the state's
 
00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:55.799 align:start position:0%
downshifting we have to raise the taxes
 
00:24:57.409 --> 00:24:57.419 align:start position:0%
and the state's saying well we don't
 
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
have any money and to to raise the money
 
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:01.980 align:start position:0%
we'd have to raise taxes on businesses
 
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
so while we have that debate let's save
 
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
the citizens and it'll Force us to have
 
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
let me think of a moment here
 
00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
I look at my screen I'd like to see some
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
thumbs up the quality of the sound that
 
00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
you're hearing can you hear me well
 
00:25:24.289 --> 00:25:24.299 align:start position:0%
give me a thumbs up if you can hear me
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh and look we have
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
several Representatives on the committee
 
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:31.980 align:start position:0%
who's RN cue to speak we'll be going
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
through representative power next and
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
then representative Gilman uh and then
 
00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
we have several more viewed up let me uh
 
00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
just uh suggest that at this point in
 
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
the process you should be asking those
 
00:25:51.649 --> 00:25:51.659 align:start position:0%
who are testifying any questions to help
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
us understand the bill and the intent of
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
the bill and uh
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
the time for debate of the uh of the
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
bill will actually be during the
 
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
so uh as as emotional or as passionate I
 
00:26:09.169 --> 00:26:09.179 align:start position:0%
guess it's a better word as many many
 
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
people are around some of these issues I
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
want to ask you to try not to debate the
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
issue with the with the individual is
 
00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
testifying just ask questions about the
 
00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
bill to get a better understanding of it
 
00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:23.940 align:start position:0%
and we'll have a healthy debate during
 
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
the Executive Center but at this point
 
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
I'd like to go to representative power
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
and then we'll go to representative
 
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
field after that
 
00:26:33.649 --> 00:26:33.659 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Dolan and thank you
 
00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
representative Roy for taking my
 
00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
question I have two questions and I'm
 
00:26:39.649 --> 00:26:39.659 align:start position:0%
happy to go to the end of the line on my
 
00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
second question that would be up to the
 
00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:42.049 align:start position:0%
second question that would be up to the
chair

00:26:42.049 --> 00:26:42.059 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
so my first question is with regard to
 
00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
the override
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
um representative Roy could you qualify
 
00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
what the override
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
um would look like is there a statute to
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
reference I'm aware of a tax cap
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
override as well as the 10 rule override
 
00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
did you um you know explain what the
 
00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:04.140 align:start position:0%
threshold would be for that override
 
00:27:06.529 --> 00:27:06.539 align:start position:0%
vote thank you
 
00:27:09.409 --> 00:27:09.419 align:start position:0%
um I believe as written in the um in the
 
00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment
 
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
it indicates that they will be a ballot
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
election to vote on the override so
 
00:27:22.669 --> 00:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
um if a town suggests a tax increase for
 
00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:26.460 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever reason they would
 
00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:29.820 align:start position:0%
um they would create a ballot with that
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
question on it and that would clearly
 
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
explain the amount of the override and
 
00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.690 align:start position:0%
explain the amount of the override and
why

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:38.820 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you I I do see that it's it's
 
00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:41.480 align:start position:0%
a two-thirds threshold that was my um
 
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
oversight and should I go to the end of
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
the line for my second question chair
 
00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:49.860 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
so the second question is I was just
 
00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
wanting to understand the rationale for
 
00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
the two Provisions in the bill one for
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
the general
 
00:27:58.919 --> 00:27:59.990 align:start position:0%
the general
um

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
I guess taxpayer or public and the
 
00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:03.230 align:start position:0%
I guess taxpayer or public and the
second

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
um one for the certain disabled citizens
 
00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
and those older than 67 years old why
 
00:28:12.049 --> 00:28:12.059 align:start position:0%
the difference in the two percent and
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
the one percent
 
00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
um tax cap if you will sure thank you
 
00:28:18.769 --> 00:28:18.779 align:start position:0%
for that question
 
00:28:21.049 --> 00:28:21.059 align:start position:0%
um the way I see it in many of my
 
00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:23.700 align:start position:0%
constituents have voiced this to me is
 
00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
that when you have a job and you're
 
00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:27.260 align:start position:0%
gainfully employed
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
you can reasonably expect or hope to to
 
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
get raises to opportunities to increase
 
00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
your income
 
00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:38.820 align:start position:0%
um to to at least match if not exceed
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
the the property tax increases
 
00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
when you are a disabled person living on
 
00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
social security or you're over 67 and
 
00:28:48.289 --> 00:28:48.299 align:start position:0%
retired living on Social Security you're
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
on a fixed income there there are no
 
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
increases if there are it's less than
 
00:28:54.289 --> 00:28:54.299 align:start position:0%
one percent you know um and if you have
 
00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:55.740 align:start position:0%
a one percent increase in your income
 
00:28:57.049 --> 00:28:57.059 align:start position:0%
and a five percent increase in your
 
00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
taxes you've actually lost money so I
 
00:29:03.049 --> 00:29:03.059 align:start position:0%
picked people who were on a fixed income
 
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
with no opportunity to to increase that
 
00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:08.220 align:start position:0%
so a disabled person can say you know
 
00:29:09.169 --> 00:29:09.179 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to go out and get a
 
00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:10.740 align:start position:0%
second job so I can afford these taxes
 
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:11.940 align:start position:0%
they're not allowed to work or they
 
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
can't work a senior citizen same thing
 
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
um you know someone who's worked 30 and
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
40 years and finally made retirement
 
00:29:21.769 --> 00:29:21.779 align:start position:0%
they're on a fixed income and they just
 
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
have no way to to increase their income
 
00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:26.460 align:start position:0%
to match the property taxes that's why I
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
made their cap lower than people who
 
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
work or or at least assumably are able
 
00:29:35.389 --> 00:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
to create more Revenue
 
00:29:38.269 --> 00:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
thank you next we have uh representative
 
00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:40.140 align:start position:0%
filament and after that we'll go to
 
00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.289 align:start position:0%
filament and after that we'll go to
Birmingham

00:29:42.289 --> 00:29:42.299 align:start position:0%
Birmingham
 
00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:44.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and thank you
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
represent representative Roy for taking
 
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
um I would like to clarify that this
 
00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
bill says uh
 
00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:55.860 align:start position:0%
that the tax cap is on the actual amount
 
00:29:58.909 --> 00:29:58.919 align:start position:0%
of taxes paid not on the tax rate is
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
that true yes that is correct it's on
 
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
the actual tax from the year before not
 
00:30:06.649 --> 00:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
on the tax rate the rate is set it's
 
00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
totally separate than the actual
 
00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:11.460 align:start position:0%
taxation amount
 
00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
um follow-up Mr chair
 
00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:14.940 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.549 align:start position:0%
go ahead
so

00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:18.649 --> 00:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
if that's the case are you concerned at
 
00:30:21.169 --> 00:30:21.179 align:start position:0%
all about uh decrease in the services
 
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
that a town can supply because their the
 
00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
revenue is
 
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
flat or not enough to cover
 
00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:32.220 align:start position:0%
what we currently have
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
um well I I would let me speak to it as
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
a citizen of my town
 
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
um yeah if if it was put to me as a
 
00:30:41.149 --> 00:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
citizen and a voter saying look if we
 
00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:43.799 align:start position:0%
can't raise three percent this year
 
00:30:45.409 --> 00:30:45.419 align:start position:0%
we're going to lose a cruiser we're
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
going to lose an officer we're going to
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
lose a fire truck
 
00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:49.500 align:start position:0%
that would be something that would
 
00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:50.700 align:start position:0%
concern me and that would be something
 
00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
that I would talk to my family and
 
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
community members about and we as a
 
00:30:57.529 --> 00:30:57.539 align:start position:0%
community would decide whether or not to
 
00:31:00.649 --> 00:31:00.659 align:start position:0%
to override the cap so that we could
 
00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:02.700 align:start position:0%
maintain the level of services that we
 
00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:04.310 align:start position:0%
maintain the level of services that we
have

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
um but I would also want as a citizen to
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
be able to say you know what
 
00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
um I think that that while that service
 
00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:13.740 align:start position:0%
is important it's not important enough
 
00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:16.980 align:start position:0%
for me to not be able to afford uh my
 
00:31:18.769 --> 00:31:18.779 align:start position:0%
medicare this year my medical insurance
 
00:31:21.289 --> 00:31:21.299 align:start position:0%
this year you know as a senior citizen a
 
00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:22.980 align:start position:0%
lot of our senior citizens are making
 
00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:26.220 align:start position:0%
choices between food and and heat and
 
00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
things of this nature so it's it's you
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
know it's I don't want to say it's easy
 
00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
for us but it's easier for us to sit
 
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
back and say well you know we need to
 
00:31:36.049 --> 00:31:36.059 align:start position:0%
have these services but there are people
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
out there that are literally
 
00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919 align:start position:0%
um heating their houses with their oven
 
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039 align:start position:0%
because they can't afford the oil Bill
 
00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
and they they want to pay their taxes
 
00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:47.820 align:start position:0%
because they'll lose their house so I
 
00:31:49.789 --> 00:31:49.799 align:start position:0%
mean these these These are tough tough
 
00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:51.419 align:start position:0%
conversations and tough decisions to
 
00:31:52.669 --> 00:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
happen I don't want to make light to
 
00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:56.460 align:start position:0%
them but we have to do something to let
 
00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
the citizens at least have a say if they
 
00:31:59.810 --> 00:31:59.820 align:start position:0%
decide you know what we we need that
 
00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:01.559 align:start position:0%
service we want to raise the tax they
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
can do so but it also says lets them
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
have the ability to say no
 
00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:14.289 align:start position:0%
have the ability to say no
LaSalle

00:32:14.289 --> 00:32:14.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um for for taking my uh
 
00:32:19.789 --> 00:32:19.799 align:start position:0%
comments in question uh representative
 
00:32:19.799 --> 00:32:20.870 align:start position:0%
comments in question uh representative
Roy

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
Roy
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
um first I'd like to disclose
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of things one is I am
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
an alderman as well as a State Rep I'm
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
an alderman in the city of Nashua I'm
 
00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
also one of those people that
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
um not currently goodness but who has
 
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
heeded my house with wood burning stoves
 
00:32:42.889 --> 00:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
and kept my food on a side porch because
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
I didn't during the winter time because
 
00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
I didn't have enough money to fix a um a
 
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
refrigerator so I truly do understand
 
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
I'm also on a fake thinking so I
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
understand what
 
00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
um elderly disabled Etc people go
 
00:32:59.930 --> 00:32:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:04.669 --> 00:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
my comment or question I should say is
 
00:33:06.889 --> 00:33:06.899 align:start position:0%
um two things well I do have one more
 
00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
comment and I apologize for taking so
 
00:33:10.909 --> 00:33:10.919 align:start position:0%
much time but the tax rates actually are
 
00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
set by the dra in Concord and yes it is
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
based on the budget that is submitted by
 
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
the city but it is
 
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
um the rate itself is actually set by
 
00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:24.179 align:start position:0%
Concord and not by this city
 
00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
um the taxes that are paid include the
 
00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
tax rates for the schools the tax rate
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
for the county and then the tax rate
 
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
that's set by the dra for the um the
 
00:33:36.769 --> 00:33:36.779 align:start position:0%
cities now having said that I can tell
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
you that um in in Nashua
 
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
quite often and I'm sure this is through
 
00:33:45.769 --> 00:33:45.779 align:start position:0%
the entire State Municipal elections
 
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
don't bring out a lot of Voters
 
00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:49.559 align:start position:0%
people who are passionate will come out
 
00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:52.140 align:start position:0%
so my concern is that you mentioned
 
00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:53.460 align:start position:0%
right up from the beginning that
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes citizens aren't knowledgeable
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
about town meetings
 
00:33:59.450 --> 00:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
well that's a town meet
 
00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:00.590 align:start position:0%
well that's a town meet
me

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
where they can vote on a budget and so
 
00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:04.740 align:start position:0%
on in the cities the municipalities it
 
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't quite work that way we would
 
00:34:08.089 --> 00:34:08.099 align:start position:0%
literally have to have a special
 
00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
election to kind of get this on a ballot
 
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
or I would have to wait two years for
 
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
the next ballot has that been taken into
 
00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:19.669 align:start position:0%
the next ballot has that been taken into
consideration

00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:20.389 align:start position:0%
consideration
um

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
that the lack of citizen participation
 
00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
oftentimes in the Municipal elections as
 
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
well as
 
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:28.740 align:start position:0%
how you would have to put this on the
 
00:34:30.649 --> 00:34:30.659 align:start position:0%
ballot to override
 
00:34:32.329 --> 00:34:32.339 align:start position:0%
um I guess that's my my comment and
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:34:36.589 --> 00:34:36.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative clay
 
00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
um actually I I did take that into
 
00:34:40.129 --> 00:34:40.139 align:start position:0%
consideration regarding voter
 
00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:42.419 align:start position:0%
participation and I I actually hope this
 
00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:44.700 align:start position:0%
would drive up voter participation I
 
00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
think that if the voters actually had a
 
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
choice to say hey if you don't show up
 
00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
with the polls your taxes going up and
 
00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:51.300 align:start position:0%
if you don't show up you know you had a
 
00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:52.669 align:start position:0%
if you don't show up you know you had a
chance

00:34:52.669 --> 00:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
chance
 
00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
um so I I hope that it would actually
 
00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
drive higher participation greater
 
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
interest in what the towns and cities
 
00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:02.780 align:start position:0%
are spending the money on and actually
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
drive citizen engagement and maybe in a
 
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
positive way they might learn you know
 
00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:08.750 align:start position:0%
positive way they might learn you know
what

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:35:10.849 --> 00:35:10.859 align:start position:0%
um I I my taxes are going to go up
 
00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
because they they need this or they need
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
that and they go look and they say you
 
00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
know what they do need this I actually
 
00:35:18.589 --> 00:35:18.599 align:start position:0%
now that I look at it whereas before
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
they may have just sat home and said
 
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
yeah they're always asking for something
 
00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:24.599 align:start position:0%
so I I hope that it drives a greater
 
00:35:26.089 --> 00:35:26.099 align:start position:0%
Civic engagement and greater
 
00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:28.380 align:start position:0%
participation at the polls
 
00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
um with regard to passing it um and I
 
00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
I'm actually a member of my Municipal
 
00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
budget committee so I I kind of have an
 
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
idea of what this is too
 
00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:39.770 align:start position:0%
idea of what this is too
um

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:39.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
as far as special elections and things
 
00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
like gecko I'm not sure as far as how
 
00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:46.140 align:start position:0%
the City Works
 
00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
um with regard to their budget if this
 
00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
the city uh they if they vote on your
 
00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
budget or not or if it's just passed
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
then that's it I know in the town
 
00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
um we vote on the budget
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
um so it really would just be that if
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
they knew that the budget was going to
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
exceed it two percent as part of the
 
00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
regular voting they would just put that
 
00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:06.660 align:start position:0%
on the ballot and and that would be that
 
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if the city would require a
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
special election to do it or not
 
00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
um but again it's
 
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that if we pass this the
 
00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:18.740 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
citizens get to decide whether they want
 
00:36:23.569 --> 00:36:23.579 align:start position:0%
this or not so if they decide you know
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
that's too complicated or too expensive
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
to do it they won't do it
 
00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
00:36:40.609 --> 00:36:40.619 align:start position:0%
um I I guess my follow-up would be
 
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
um on the surface we we often say that
 
00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.190 align:start position:0%
um on the surface we we often say that
um

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:49.609 --> 00:36:49.619 align:start position:0%
the citizens are request it is educated
 
00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
and they listen to us they listen to
 
00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
advertisers and and so on about so if
 
00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:57.660 align:start position:0%
you're hit with do you do you not want
 
00:36:59.390 --> 00:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
your taxes to go up
 
00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.109 align:start position:0%
your taxes to go up
um

00:37:00.109 --> 00:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:04.020 align:start position:0%
I think the average person this is my
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
opinion but um would say no I I'll do
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
anything to make sure my taxes going up
 
00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
not understanding the ramifications and
 
00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:13.980 align:start position:0%
then again once that ramification hits
 
00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
we have to cut Services Etc because we
 
00:37:18.849 --> 00:37:18.859 align:start position:0%
can't go up more than two percent
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
overall in one percent
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
um on senior citizens and I can tell you
 
00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
from my district I have a lot of senior
 
00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
citizens that we give senior citizen
 
00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:31.740 align:start position:0%
credits to and um and so on so we reduce
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
their taxes
 
00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:36.180 align:start position:0%
um I'm afraid that we might have to get
 
00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:37.740 align:start position:0%
rid of that if we did something like
 
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
this because this in fact would do that
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
but don't you feel that
 
00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:43.740 align:start position:0%
um anybody would and I guess the
 
00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
rhetorical question want to save money
 
00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:47.460 align:start position:0%
and therefore might vote
 
00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
um their wallet versus
 
00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
um what may be considered common sense I
 
00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
mean objective remember this is the
 
00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:03.980 align:start position:0%
our opinions you know debate to go
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
I know I know people feel strongly about
 
00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:16.730 align:start position:0%
 
I

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:20.329 --> 00:38:20.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:24.180 align:start position:0%
I understand that so so uh but I just as
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
you think as you're about to speak uh
 
00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
especially those that are still on the
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
list try to perform your comment in the
 
00:38:36.829 --> 00:38:36.839 align:start position:0%
film of a question as opposed to here's
 
00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
my opinion of of the bill and so forth
 
00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:41.460 align:start position:0%
we will have plenty of time here in
 
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
executive session to go through
 
00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:46.140 align:start position:0%
how we feel in the opinions of that so I
 
00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:47.700 align:start position:0%
I don't mean to interrupt uh
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative plea I just want to try
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're staying on track
 
00:38:53.569 --> 00:38:53.579 align:start position:0%
if you could have some some final
 
00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
follow-up you'd like to offer no no and
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
I would like to apologize for having
 
00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:00.300 align:start position:0%
interjected an opinion I do know better
 
00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:02.820 align:start position:0%
than that um thank you very much for the
 
00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
time I'd be happy to respond to her last
 
00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:07.740 align:start position:0%
um her last question
 
00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:08.630 align:start position:0%
um her last question
um

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:11.569 --> 00:39:11.579 align:start position:0%
with regard to the the citizen education
 
00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:13.980 align:start position:0%
and and stuff I would hope that this
 
00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:16.980 align:start position:0%
this bill I think it's our job
 
00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
um part of our job is to is to be
 
00:39:22.609 --> 00:39:22.619 align:start position:0%
um Educators if you will in Civics for
 
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
our for our constituents rather than say
 
00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
you know I'm afraid you really don't
 
00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
know the ramifications of what you're
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
going to do so I'm going to do it for
 
00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
you I think it's our job to say and
 
00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
explain and educate our constituents
 
00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
um on on what we do and the
 
00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:41.460 align:start position:0%
ramifications of a vote I guess that's I
 
00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:46.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:49.329 --> 00:39:49.339 align:start position:0%
I would uh
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:56.460 align:start position:0%
for human purposes we're going to next
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
go to representative lasalles who's here
 
00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:04.370 align:start position:0%
go to representative lasalles who's here
representative

00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Roy for
 
00:40:09.609 --> 00:40:09.619 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh I question
 
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
concerns the basis of the uh limit the
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
cap on the previous year's test taxes
 
00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:24.660 align:start position:0%
uh we just went through a revaluation in
 
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
my town and based upon the revaluation
 
00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
some people's taxes went up some
 
00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:35.660 align:start position:0%
people's taxes went down if you base the
 
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
tax cap on the previous year's taxes in
 
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
some cases
 
00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:47.420 align:start position:0%
people who had a a
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
revaluation that went down would be
 
00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:53.839 align:start position:0%
could possibly be hit by a bigger tax
 
00:40:56.589 --> 00:40:56.599 align:start position:0%
while somebody's
 
00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
revaluation that went up wouldn't be
 
00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
eligible for any tax increase so how
 
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
well if I'm understanding a question
 
00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
correctly I I think if if a tax in a
 
00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
previous year for example
 
00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
is was one thousand dollars
 
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
the next year's tax could not increase
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
by more than
 
00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.550 align:start position:0%
by more than
um

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
uh ten dollars that would be a twenty
 
00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:29.089 align:start position:0%
uh ten dollars that would be a twenty
percent

00:41:29.089 --> 00:41:29.099 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
um if I'm doing math right
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
um so it regardless of one if someone
 
00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
had to decrease the year before or not
 
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
the question is what could the increase
 
00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:42.540 align:start position:0%
be the next year and that's all that
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
this would control is is the increase
 
00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:47.940 align:start position:0%
for the next year
 
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
um based on the previous year so if if
 
00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
someone's taxes went up or down the year
 
00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:55.140 align:start position:0%
before I I think that it would be um
 
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
irrelevant to the to the amendment
 
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:00.300 align:start position:0%
because it only addresses how much the
 
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
increase would be for the the current
 
00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:06.550 align:start position:0%
increase would be for the the current
year

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
next uh I give the microphone
 
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
representative for 11 and then after
 
00:42:13.609 --> 00:42:13.619 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:16.970 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and thank you
um

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:16.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative Roy for taking my
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
question I noted in your intro that you
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned dealing with the property the
 
00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
ever increasing property tax
 
00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
um and I'm wondering if you considered
 
00:42:35.089 --> 00:42:35.099 align:start position:0%
any other Alternatives uh because
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
from my point of view where I sit here
 
00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
reading the bill this deals with a small
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
number of people in our state
 
00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:47.540 align:start position:0%
to attack what is a very large problem
 
00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:50.220 align:start position:0%
for a lot of people in our state and I
 
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
wonder wondering if you thought of any
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
other Alternatives besides this specific
 
00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:56.390 align:start position:0%
other Alternatives besides this specific
one

00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
um if I could answer with start with a
 
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
question when you when you say a small
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
number of people could you explain what
 
00:43:05.329 --> 00:43:05.339 align:start position:0%
you mean by that
 
00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
um well the majority of our population
 
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
is not senior citizens
 
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
and the majority of our population is
 
00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:14.940 align:start position:0%
not disabled people although they are
 
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
prevalent in our state by a small number
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
I meant a specific subset of citizens
 
00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
okay senior citizens and disabled
 
00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:25.370 align:start position:0%
okay senior citizens and disabled
persons

00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:25.380 align:start position:0%
persons
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
well sure the the amendment covers
 
00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
actually everybody it freezes cap at two
 
00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:34.140 align:start position:0%
percent the one percent cap is for
 
00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
senior citizens and disabled people I
 
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
met excuse me I misunderstood thank you
 
00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:40.980 align:start position:0%
very much that's all I need okay thank
 
00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:48.890 align:start position:0%
very much that's all I need okay thank
you

00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
representative Roy for taking my
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
question that's a two-part question
 
00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:56.569 align:start position:0%
question that's a two-part question
really

00:43:56.569 --> 00:43:56.579 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:43:59.390 --> 00:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
um and the first part is um
 
00:44:01.609 --> 00:44:01.619 align:start position:0%
questioning your reference to
 
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts proposition two and a half
 
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
um Massachusetts also has an income tax
 
00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
isn't that correct
 
00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:13.740 align:start position:0%
yes so so property taxes is not the only
 
00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
source of Revenue that the state derives
 
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so I just wanted to clarify
 
00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:24.300 align:start position:0%
that from my own memory of living in
 
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts many many years ago
 
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
um and for others who may not be aware
 
00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:33.660 align:start position:0%
um secondly uh could I answer could I
 
00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:35.220 align:start position:0%
expound on my answer please different
 
00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
please and I'm sorry to interrupt no
 
00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:38.819 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
um being a refugee from Massachusetts
 
00:44:44.809 --> 00:44:44.819 align:start position:0%
myself I can speak to so that they have
 
00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
quite a few uh revenue streams uh
 
00:44:49.849 --> 00:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
property tax sales tax excise tax
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
um there's there's taxes for everything
 
00:44:53.329 --> 00:44:53.339 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:44:57.069 --> 00:44:57.079 align:start position:0%
your municipalities do not benefit from
 
00:45:00.589 --> 00:45:00.599 align:start position:0%
your income taxes other than state aid
 
00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:03.300 align:start position:0%
which we also provide and
 
00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:04.010 align:start position:0%
which we also provide and
um

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
so the municipalities derived the the
 
00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
majority of their income for their
 
00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:10.740 align:start position:0%
services and police departments and fire
 
00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:15.660 align:start position:0%
etc etc schools from property taxes so
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
um it it is comparable in that aspect
 
00:45:19.849 --> 00:45:19.859 align:start position:0%
but the state itself has much more
 
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
Revenue to Dole out in state aid than we
 
00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:24.660 align:start position:0%
do so yes right and to fulfill its
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
obligations to the municipalities
 
00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
um my question has to do with
 
00:45:34.849 --> 00:45:34.859 align:start position:0%
well I'll just make it very specific to
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
the city of Lebanon the city of Lebanon
 
00:45:41.569 --> 00:45:41.579 align:start position:0%
has a very high rate of Taxation however
 
00:45:44.329 --> 00:45:44.339 align:start position:0%
we are dominated by tax-exempt
 
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
institutions and one of those tax exempt
 
00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:49.980 align:start position:0%
institutions is a hospital that serves
 
00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
all of the people of New Hampshire
 
00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
Vermont Maine and many in Massachusetts
 
00:45:59.450 --> 00:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
how would this Constitutional Amendment
 
00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:01.450 align:start position:0%
how would this Constitutional Amendment
affect

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:01.460 align:start position:0%
affect
 
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:04.380 align:start position:0%
municipalities that are dominated by
 
00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
tax-exempt institutions and Lebanon is
 
00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:09.060 align:start position:0%
not the only one and those tax-exempt
 
00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
institutions serve many more people than
 
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
the people who live in those
 
00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.770 align:start position:0%
the people who live in those
municipalities

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
well the the amendment doesn't doesn't
 
00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:22.140 align:start position:0%
address taxation for people who aren't
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
taxed so it really wouldn't impact that
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
at all but it sounds like it sounds like
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
that would be a different piece of
 
00:46:29.569 --> 00:46:29.579 align:start position:0%
legislation that would need to deal with
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
tax-exempt organizations
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
um but this this is only for for people
 
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
residents who pay taxes
 
00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
and since those organizations don't it
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
really I don't uh maybe I'm missing the
 
00:46:43.849 --> 00:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
point in your question and I'd be happy
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
to to take it again if if I'm not
 
00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:48.780 align:start position:0%
answering your question well my I guess
 
00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:50.700 align:start position:0%
the point of my question is that there
 
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
are municipalities in New Hampshire
 
00:46:58.370 --> 00:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
um whose tax base is affected by the
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
presence of tax exempt institutions that
 
00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
serve the entire population of the state
 
00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
and other states as well not just by
 
00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:16.140 align:start position:0%
that into a question
 
00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:18.900 align:start position:0%
well I believe I did and my question
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
originally was how did representative
 
00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
Roy you know how do you see
 
00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities like Lebanon that have a
 
00:47:29.809 --> 00:47:29.819 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of tax-exempt
 
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
property in them as well as high numbers
 
00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:34.980 align:start position:0%
of elderly and disabled people paying
 
00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:36.780 align:start position:0%
high property taxes
 
00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
how do you think this Constitutional
 
00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment might affect
 
00:47:43.849 --> 00:47:43.859 align:start position:0%
those municipalities that really have no
 
00:47:43.859 --> 00:47:45.109 align:start position:0%
those municipalities that really have no
control

00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:48.300 align:start position:0%
over a lot of the land in there
 
00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
well I I guess I would I would stick
 
00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:56.220 align:start position:0%
with my original answer that that it
 
00:47:58.609 --> 00:47:58.619 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it wouldn't change the the
 
00:47:58.619 --> 00:47:59.890 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it wouldn't change the the
landscape

00:47:59.890 --> 00:47:59.900 align:start position:0%
landscape
 
00:48:02.809 --> 00:48:02.819 align:start position:0%
of of who pays tax and who doesn't pay
 
00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
Stacks if if
 
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
if there's an issue and this is again
 
00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
I'm happy for to have these
 
00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
conversations because it's it makes us
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
talk about revenue streams and and if if
 
00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
there needs to be legislation to fix
 
00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:20.220 align:start position:0%
that uh tax exempt issue then then let's
 
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
have that discussion too
 
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
um but I don't think your senior
 
00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
citizens and disabled folks should have
 
00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
to carry the weight when you have a an
 
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
organization like that that could pay
 
00:48:34.849 --> 00:48:34.859 align:start position:0%
more taxes and help them out so again
 
00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:37.140 align:start position:0%
let's let's save them
 
00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
while we figure out what to do and this
 
00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
forces us to have that conversation
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
okay next we're going to go to
 
00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:47.940 align:start position:0%

doesn't the power to do what your bill
 
00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
wants to do as far as setting the
 
00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:02.270 align:start position:0%
wants to do as far as setting the
percentages

00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
percentages
 
00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
within the local communities if someone
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
wants to do a long article and having
 
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
the people vote on that to limit that
 
00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:21.470 align:start position:0%
the people vote on that to limit that
increase

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
folks

00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:26.329 --> 00:49:26.339 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
representative Roy
 
00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
doesn't the power to do what you want to
 
00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
do in your bill exists the local
 
00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
community if someone in a group of 25
 
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
more people wanted to go on article
 
00:49:40.550 --> 00:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
to limit the tax rate going up two
 
00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
percent or three percent uh couldn't
 
00:49:44.569 --> 00:49:44.579 align:start position:0%
they do that locally rather than having
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
a constitutional amendment
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
um you know I I'm not sure whether that
 
00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:51.900 align:start position:0%
would be legal or not but let's assume
 
00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
for the sake of discussion it is
 
00:49:57.410 --> 00:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
um in the very next election uh 25 more
 
00:49:58.730 --> 00:49:58.740 align:start position:0%
people could come back and change it
 
00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:01.740 align:start position:0%
back again or raise it even higher what
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
the amendment would do would take that
 
00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
out of and again especially for towns
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
where you have Town meetings and and you
 
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
know there's there's a whole it's a it's
 
00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
it's an interesting culture there's a
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
whole strategy behind telling readings
 
00:50:16.609 --> 00:50:16.619 align:start position:0%
um you know dragging them out as late as
 
00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
possible to see who goes home before
 
00:50:20.329 --> 00:50:20.339 align:start position:0%
calling certain votes and and a lot of
 
00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
that's complicated and it's very New
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
England and it's awesome but it's
 
00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
difficult on senior citizens disabled
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
people to sit at a town meeting all
 
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:29.220 align:start position:0%
night to make sure that their taxes
 
00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:31.740 align:start position:0%
don't go up so I agree with you
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
um in principle a town could set up
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
Warren article to freeze their taxes I'm
 
00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
not sure about the legality of it but
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
um the very next town meeting um it
 
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
could be reversed and if you can't keep
 
00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
that number of people there to make sure
 
00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
that doesn't happen again in the middle
 
00:50:48.049 --> 00:50:48.059 align:start position:0%
of the night
 
00:50:48.059 --> 00:50:48.650 align:start position:0%
of the night
um

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
you know that's what you end up with
 
00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
which is why I feel like if it's in the
 
00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:55.190 align:start position:0%
which is why I feel like if it's in the
Constitution

00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
um it sets it sets running rules for
 
00:50:59.450 --> 00:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
municipalities and it puts the power
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
back in the in the um in the citizens
 
00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
hands and lets them decide whether or
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
not they actually need an increase or
 
00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:07.670 align:start position:0%
not they actually need an increase or
not

00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
good yes thank you
 
00:51:12.349 --> 00:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
I representative Matt Yuri is next and
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
then I believe we have representative
 
00:51:19.069 --> 00:51:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
representative Roy for taking my
 
00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:24.900 align:start position:0%
question uh I am one of the Selectmen
 
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
here in Northampton and I've sat in the
 
00:51:29.329 --> 00:51:29.339 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements for uh
 
00:51:33.049 --> 00:51:33.059 align:start position:0%
for my town and the school and I'm
 
00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:37.380 align:start position:0%
curious if this tax cap could put us at
 
00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
risk of running afoul of bargaining in
 
00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
good faith if for some reason the town
 
00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
felt that we could not
 
00:51:48.349 --> 00:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
if we could not execute or if we could
 
00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
not negotiate
 
00:51:54.109 --> 00:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
a contract because of uh the approach to
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
to that number uh would we be in some
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
could we be in some legal trouble uh and
 
00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:02.220 align:start position:0%
and consider that we are not bargaining
 
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
in good faith
 
00:52:05.329 --> 00:52:05.339 align:start position:0%
have you considered that or do you do
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
you see any risk there I actually have
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
considered that um interesting short
 
00:52:10.559 --> 00:52:11.450 align:start position:0%
considered that um interesting short
story

00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
story
 
00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
um when proposition two and a half
 
00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
passed in Massachusetts I was a wee lad
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
and my um my father was a police officer
 
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
and I remember the police Union
 
00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:23.940 align:start position:0%
um fighting that tooth and nail and all
 
00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:26.940 align:start position:0%
the unions fighting it because of uh
 
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
they had a mandatory arbitration I
 
00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:31.380 align:start position:0%
believe at the time and what happened
 
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
was once this passed
 
00:52:35.329 --> 00:52:35.339 align:start position:0%
um there was no question about
 
00:52:36.829 --> 00:52:36.839 align:start position:0%
bargaining in good faith because it's
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
simply the the Constitution prohibited
 
00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:41.220 align:start position:0%
uh any any race that would go over that
 
00:52:43.849 --> 00:52:43.859 align:start position:0%
cap so it is the Constitution would
 
00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:46.339 align:start position:0%
supersede anything
 
00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
contractually or bargaining in good
 
00:52:50.569 --> 00:52:50.579 align:start position:0%
faith um
 
00:52:52.609 --> 00:52:52.619 align:start position:0%
situations like that because you just
 
00:52:54.589 --> 00:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to bargain any
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
higher than that
 
00:52:58.370 --> 00:52:58.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
and next we have well before we go to
 
00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:04.740 align:start position:0%
representative 11 after uh after her I'd
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
like to go to the public
 
00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:08.700 align:start position:0%
if there's anybody that wants to speak
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:53:10.559 --> 00:53:14.109 align:start position:0%
that that
uh

00:53:14.109 --> 00:53:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
through the zoom software if you're just
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
listening over the telephone you can
 
00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
raise your hand and indicate to me that
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
you want to speak by hitting star six
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
so uh representative managuri our
 
00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:34.609 align:start position:0%
 
s

00:53:34.609 --> 00:53:34.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:36.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks
 
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
representative Roy for hearing me again
 
00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
and sorry for my misunderstanding I've
 
00:53:44.089 --> 00:53:44.099 align:start position:0%
only read the bill like 16 times what I
 
00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
what I want to ask well my real question
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
at the base of all of it is did you
 
00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
think of any alternative methods to deal
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
with our ever increasing property taxes
 
00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
here in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:54:00.349 --> 00:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
yeah I've I've actually um
 
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
I I fought a lot I it's
 
00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's probably all I think about since
 
00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:07.140 align:start position:0%
I've been elected is how to fix this and
 
00:54:09.049 --> 00:54:09.059 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the same applies to everyone I
 
00:54:10.970 --> 00:54:10.980 align:start position:0%
see on this Hollywood Squares in front
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
of me
 
00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
um you know the question is do we need a
 
00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:16.140 align:start position:0%
new Revenue stream
 
00:54:19.609 --> 00:54:19.619 align:start position:0%
um do how do we handle it do we but why
 
00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
that debate I think is for us to have
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
and uh for us to have rather quickly
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
and I think that this Constitutional
 
00:54:29.089 --> 00:54:29.099 align:start position:0%
Amendment will force us to have that
 
00:54:29.099 --> 00:54:30.530 align:start position:0%
Amendment will force us to have that
debate

00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:30.540 align:start position:0%
debate
 
00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
um because you're going to have people
 
00:54:34.609 --> 00:54:34.619 align:start position:0%
saying hey we need to raise taxes more
 
00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
and you're we need to have this service
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
and that service and you're going to
 
00:54:39.589 --> 00:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
have people saying hey this is great we
 
00:54:42.049 --> 00:54:42.059 align:start position:0%
don't need any more taxes
 
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
um I I feel like this this will force us
 
00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
to finally stop kicking the can down the
 
00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
road and figure out how best to handle
 
00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:52.140 align:start position:0%
funding issues in this state that at the
 
00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
end of the day while while the red and
 
00:54:55.849 --> 00:54:55.859 align:start position:0%
the blue team are up here kicking each
 
00:54:58.250 --> 00:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
other the people down there are are
 
00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:00.780 align:start position:0%
having so I mean it just breaks my heart
 
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
to see senior citizens have to sell
 
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
their family home I I just you know it
 
00:55:07.849 --> 00:55:07.859 align:start position:0%
really makes it difficult to sleep at
 
00:55:09.410 --> 00:55:09.420 align:start position:0%
night to see
 
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
um senior citizens in a grocery store
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
having to put car items back because
 
00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
they're like Jesus I can't afford that
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
this week knowing that we're
 
00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:20.700 align:start position:0%
municipalities are taking that money
 
00:55:23.809 --> 00:55:23.819 align:start position:0%
and um it's it's just I think we need
 
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
that we need to we need to put the
 
00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
brakes on this while we figure it out
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
and force ourselves to figure it out
 
00:55:32.809 --> 00:55:32.819 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chair yeah
 
00:55:34.970 --> 00:55:34.980 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Roy I hear you
 
00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
loud and clear
 
00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:38.089 align:start position:0%
loud and clear
um

00:55:38.089 --> 00:55:38.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:40.260 align:start position:0%
yet I wonder
 
00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:41.690 align:start position:0%
yet I wonder
if

00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:41.700 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
changing the Constitution of our state
 
00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
is the actual way to start a
 
00:55:48.349 --> 00:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
conversation about how we support one
 
00:55:48.359 --> 00:55:50.870 align:start position:0%
conversation about how we support one
another

00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
is that a question
 
00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:53.990 align:start position:0%
is that a question
yes

00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
is changing the Constitution of our
 
00:55:59.150 --> 00:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
state mandating something for our entire
 
00:56:01.849 --> 00:56:01.859 align:start position:0%
State a way to start a conversation
 
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
well um I'll I'll entertain that I think
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
I think we've tried to start the
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
conversation haven't we
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
um over and over and over again uh with
 
00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:13.980 align:start position:0%
different different you know do we need
 
00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:15.780 align:start position:0%
a sales tax do we need an income tax do
 
00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:17.640 align:start position:0%
we need this do we need that we've had
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
these conversations and we've had them
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
for decades
 
00:56:21.119 --> 00:56:21.849 align:start position:0%
for decades
um

00:56:21.849 --> 00:56:21.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
and both sides have an opinion and we're
 
00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
pretty well entrenched in our opinions
 
00:56:28.849 --> 00:56:28.859 align:start position:0%
and and the the line doesn't move in the
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
meantime while we're while we're we're
 
00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:33.540 align:start position:0%
having a conversation at this level the
 
00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:35.460 align:start position:0%
people who are living at the real level
 
00:56:38.329 --> 00:56:38.339 align:start position:0%
are suffering um so I think we can take
 
00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
a pause in our never-ending conversation
 
00:56:44.329 --> 00:56:44.339 align:start position:0%
to help them out and just maybe that'll
 
00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
Force us to no longer
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
um we're gonna have to someone's gonna
 
00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
have to cross the line somewhere and
 
00:56:50.089 --> 00:56:50.099 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have to figure out a
 
00:56:50.099 --> 00:56:51.109 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have to figure out a
solution

00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your answer
 
00:56:55.609 --> 00:56:55.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:56:57.890 --> 00:56:57.900 align:start position:0%
we have a couple more Representatives
 
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
that have additional questions
 
00:57:06.109 --> 00:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
we do not Mr chair
 
00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
okay let's go to representative
 
00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:16.849 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:57:16.849 --> 00:57:16.859 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:16.859 --> 00:57:17.630 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:17.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
my questions about the separability of
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
different Provisions within the
 
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.549 align:start position:0%
different Provisions within the
amendment

00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:57:27.650 --> 00:57:27.660 align:start position:0%
um I'm just
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
um you know hearing both sides of this
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
debate I'm wondering about potential
 
00:57:33.839 --> 00:57:35.230 align:start position:0%
debate I'm wondering about potential
uh

00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
Avenues towards compromise and um
 
00:57:43.069 --> 00:57:43.079 align:start position:0%
I I support disability rights so I'm
 
00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:44.660 align:start position:0%
glad you
 
00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
made a
 
00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:50.940 align:start position:0%
car route to give disabled people a
 
00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
lower rate but I'm also sensitive to the
 
00:57:58.970 --> 00:57:58.980 align:start position:0%
concerns that my colleagues have raised
 
00:58:02.089 --> 00:58:02.099 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering if you'd be open to
 
00:58:04.809 --> 00:58:04.819 align:start position:0%
amendments to your amendment to say
 
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
just do the portion for people with
 
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities or if
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
um you're insisting that it passed the
 
00:58:17.329 --> 00:58:17.339 align:start position:0%
past asteroid in
 
00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
well um thank you representative for the
 
00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:22.140 align:start position:0%
question as you know that the it's your
 
00:58:23.210 --> 00:58:23.220 align:start position:0%
bill now
 
00:58:26.329 --> 00:58:26.339 align:start position:0%
um so if you if you choose to amend it
 
00:58:28.490 --> 00:58:28.500 align:start position:0%
um that that would be up to you I I
 
00:58:31.849 --> 00:58:31.859 align:start position:0%
would rather see it stay as written for
 
00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
everyone because
 
00:58:36.049 --> 00:58:36.059 align:start position:0%
um what you end up doing then is you end
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
up in my opinion you end up
 
00:58:41.210 --> 00:58:41.220 align:start position:0%
um kind of pitting people against each
 
00:58:43.069 --> 00:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
other you know
 
00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
um trying to trying to get to that level
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
where I don't have to pay the tax
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
anymore and and then they vote
 
00:58:51.770 --> 00:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
um kind of with no skin in the game and
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
everyone else's taxes continue to go up
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
and continue to go up and continue to go
 
00:58:57.890 --> 00:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
up so you'll have senior citizens and
 
00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:00.660 align:start position:0%
disabled people and and
 
00:59:03.289 --> 00:59:03.299 align:start position:0%
um other people who who have that low
 
00:59:03.299 --> 00:59:04.430 align:start position:0%
um other people who who have that low
cap

00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
cap
 
00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:06.660 align:start position:0%
continuing to vote for increases on
 
00:59:08.569 --> 00:59:08.579 align:start position:0%
people who don't so I think it's kind of
 
00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:10.140 align:start position:0%
kind of an All or Nothing kind of thing
 
00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:11.700 align:start position:0%
but I appreciate the the thought and
 
00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:13.510 align:start position:0%
but I appreciate the the thought and
question

00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
we are over time on our schedule we've
 
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
been at this for a little over an hour I
 
00:59:23.289 --> 00:59:23.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
to continue
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
to work on this uh we're just going to
 
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:30.660 align:start position:0%
be pushing that schedule a little bit uh
 
00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:32.940 align:start position:0%
so next we have representative Porter
 
00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
with an additional question and then
 
00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:36.839 align:start position:0%
representative colleague
 
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I'll be brief I'm
 
00:59:41.089 --> 00:59:41.099 align:start position:0%
wondering representative Roy I live in a
 
00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
property poor town
 
00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
um and I'm wondering so sometimes we
 
00:59:48.530 --> 00:59:48.540 align:start position:0%
have difficulties uh maintaining levels
 
00:59:50.809 --> 00:59:50.819 align:start position:0%
of services that make us an attractive
 
00:59:53.089 --> 00:59:53.099 align:start position:0%
town for people to move to and for
 
00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:55.980 align:start position:0%
businesses to come to because we are
 
00:59:59.390 --> 00:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
struggling to keep Services afloat the
 
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
school's good without overburdening our
 
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayers but we still do overburden not
 
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and I agree with you on that
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if this
 
01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:12.180 align:start position:0%
this Constitutional Amendment were to
 
01:00:14.329 --> 01:00:14.339 align:start position:0%
pass if it's going to be do you think it
 
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
will set up a system of Have and Have
 
01:00:20.569 --> 01:00:20.579 align:start position:0%
Not towns where towns that are doing
 
01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
well and can continue to attract people
 
01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
versus towns like Hillsboro that have a
 
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
problem with that
 
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
um so I I have I'm sensitive to that
 
01:00:30.829 --> 01:00:30.839 align:start position:0%
issue because ever since I came to the
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
legislature last term I've heard that
 
01:00:35.329 --> 01:00:35.339 align:start position:0%
you know property Rich towns property
 
01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
poor towns and that's an interesting
 
01:00:40.309 --> 01:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
debate to have but I feel like it it may
 
01:00:42.049 --> 01:00:42.059 align:start position:0%
it may actually
 
01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
him actually help because it gives your
 
01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
citizens that you know the the ability
 
01:00:49.789 --> 01:00:49.799 align:start position:0%
to say
 
01:00:49.799 --> 01:00:51.410 align:start position:0%
to say
okay

01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
we can't afford this so we're going to
 
01:00:56.690 --> 01:00:56.700 align:start position:0%
vote that down or we actually need that
 
01:00:58.430 --> 01:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
service it lets them decide what they
 
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
can afford and what they can't so for
 
01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:02.940 align:start position:0%
for someone who's interested in moving
 
01:01:04.849 --> 01:01:04.859 align:start position:0%
to your town
 
01:01:07.549 --> 01:01:07.559 align:start position:0%
um it they're not necessarily going to
 
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
move in say wow their taxes are going to
 
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
be ridiculous because they they don't
 
01:01:14.329 --> 01:01:14.339 align:start position:0%
have a big base it lets them say well we
 
01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
can go in there and we can help control
 
01:01:18.289 --> 01:01:18.299 align:start position:0%
the tax increases
 
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
um but but I I think that the the
 
01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
question of equity among among
 
01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
properties in towns is is really a
 
01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
different one this is kind of neutral in
 
01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
that it's a flat rate across the state
 
01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:32.940 align:start position:0%
for every citizen to vote or accept or
 
01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:34.069 align:start position:0%
for every citizen to vote or accept or
not

01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
um but I do appreciate that that that
 
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
situation thank you
 
01:01:41.329 --> 01:01:41.339 align:start position:0%
one last question from representative
 
01:01:41.339 --> 01:01:42.950 align:start position:0%
one last question from representative
clay

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
clay
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
thank you and and I will try to be brief
 
01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:47.220 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
um I I started mentioning earlier that
 
01:01:49.799 --> 01:01:53.049 align:start position:0%
um I I started mentioning earlier that
um

01:01:53.049 --> 01:01:53.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:55.559 align:start position:0%
municipalities such as Nashua does give
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
senior citizens exemptions on Veterans
 
01:01:59.589 --> 01:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
tax credits
 
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
disability blind deaf kind of exemption
 
01:02:08.329 --> 01:02:08.339 align:start position:0%
and tax credits as well so my question
 
01:02:10.370 --> 01:02:10.380 align:start position:0%
is in all of those cases there's
 
01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:12.839 align:start position:0%
criteria that they have to meet uh for
 
01:02:14.450 --> 01:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
instance they have to be over the age of
 
01:02:17.329 --> 01:02:17.339 align:start position:0%
70 and and we do a graduate and so on
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
for the senior citizens would this one
 
01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
percent for senior citizens and
 
01:02:24.530 --> 01:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
disability have any criteria or you just
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
proof of age and proof of disability
 
01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
yeah that that would be uh that would be
 
01:02:32.569 --> 01:02:32.579 align:start position:0%
it there'd be no other criteria
 
01:02:35.329 --> 01:02:35.339 align:start position:0%
I think a senior I mean I mean let's be
 
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
honest there are some them well-off
 
01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
senior citizens there's probably some
 
01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
well-off disabled people but we we can
 
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
also probably agree that's not the norm
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
or the majority so for a senior citizen
 
01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
on Social Security
 
01:02:48.770 --> 01:02:48.780 align:start position:0%
um and as we know most companies don't
 
01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
have pensions anymore a lot of them
 
01:02:52.849 --> 01:02:52.859 align:start position:0%
that's their only income even though you
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
have that tax credit where they get you
 
01:02:56.450 --> 01:02:56.460 align:start position:0%
know 600 or a thousand dollars or
 
01:02:59.450 --> 01:02:59.460 align:start position:0%
whatever it is off their total bill as
 
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
you increase taxes every year and their
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
income does not increase
 
01:03:06.890 --> 01:03:06.900 align:start position:0%
that that benefit is great but it
 
01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect them or help them in the
 
01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
real world where they're on a fixed
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
income and their taxes keep increasing
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
but their revenue doesn't so it kind of
 
01:03:17.930 --> 01:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
like me saying okay
 
01:03:20.289 --> 01:03:20.299 align:start position:0%
um representative Klee you owe me 200
 
01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
but you know what I'll knock a hundred
 
01:03:24.289 --> 01:03:24.299 align:start position:0%
dollars off but that doesn't do you any
 
01:03:27.530 --> 01:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
good if you only have fifty dollars so I
 
01:03:30.109 --> 01:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
I feel like you know I I'm cognizant
 
01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:32.460 align:start position:0%
that we do have tax breaks and credits
 
01:03:35.329 --> 01:03:35.339 align:start position:0%
for veterans and senior citizens but as
 
01:03:37.609 --> 01:03:37.619 align:start position:0%
we keep increasing taxes those benefits
 
01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
that we offer
 
01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:41.460 align:start position:0%
um I really have no help once once the
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
tax rate itself becomes beyond their
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
ability to pay based on their fixed
 
01:03:45.119 --> 01:03:46.010 align:start position:0%
ability to pay based on their fixed
income

01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:46.020 align:start position:0%
income
 
01:03:50.329 --> 01:03:50.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
may I have a follow-up by Mr chair thank
 
01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
you on
 
01:03:58.010 --> 01:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
I think thank you um representative Roy
 
01:04:01.849 --> 01:04:01.859 align:start position:0%
yes in some respects it does but um the
 
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
the current tax exemptions
 
01:04:06.289 --> 01:04:06.299 align:start position:0%
um that I speak of with senior citizens
 
01:04:07.849 --> 01:04:07.859 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:04:11.329 --> 01:04:11.339 align:start position:0%
um set at an income level and um and
 
01:04:14.030 --> 01:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
their home the value of their home would
 
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
that when that count towards that so
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
that would take into consideration the
 
01:04:23.089 --> 01:04:23.099 align:start position:0%
um those with the low income that would
 
01:04:24.349 --> 01:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
lose them
 
01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:27.420 align:start position:0%
I guess my question was more towards I
 
01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:28.789 align:start position:0%
I guess my question was more towards I
have

01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
constituents here who are senior
 
01:04:32.329 --> 01:04:32.339 align:start position:0%
citizens and own million dollar homes
 
01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:34.799 align:start position:0%
literally a million dollar homes
 
01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:37.140 align:start position:0%
um at Value and so on and my concern is
 
01:04:39.289 --> 01:04:39.299 align:start position:0%
that we would take that million dollar
 
01:04:42.049 --> 01:04:42.059 align:start position:0%
home and only
 
01:04:44.569 --> 01:04:44.579 align:start position:0%
um give them the one percent so this
 
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
this is a question Mike where were were
 
01:04:50.569 --> 01:04:50.579 align:start position:0%
you considering those types of things
 
01:04:54.770 --> 01:04:54.780 align:start position:0%
when you um set this and um
 
01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
we would that would mean a young family
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
I guess the the converse of that would
 
01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
be a young family who doesn't meet those
 
01:05:02.329 --> 01:05:02.339 align:start position:0%
criterias would now be paying two
 
01:05:04.490 --> 01:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
percent not necessarily owning a one
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
million dollar home
 
01:05:08.089 --> 01:05:08.099 align:start position:0%
sure um let me I'll be happy to answer
 
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
that well first of all let's let's be
 
01:05:13.130 --> 01:05:13.140 align:start position:0%
clear this only addresses increases so
 
01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
the million dollar uh tax on the million
 
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
dollar home is going to be what it is
 
01:05:20.030 --> 01:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
the increase because they're over that
 
01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:22.140 align:start position:0%
age would only be one percent the young
 
01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
family's tax is what it is on their
 
01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
property and their increase would only
 
01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
be two percent
 
01:05:30.530 --> 01:05:30.540 align:start position:0%
um I I feel like the bureaucracy that we
 
01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
would have to create to vet every single
 
01:05:35.809 --> 01:05:35.819 align:start position:0%
person as a means test in the Shell game
 
01:05:37.849 --> 01:05:37.859 align:start position:0%
we'd start playing with money
 
01:05:40.609 --> 01:05:40.619 align:start position:0%
um and people you know putting their
 
01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
houses in trusts and put it in their
 
01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
kids I I think it'd be much easier to
 
01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
blanket say the increase because
 
01:05:49.309 --> 01:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
remember the vast vast majority of our
 
01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
senior citizens are not living in a
 
01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
million dollar homes many of them are
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
living in an assisted living
 
01:05:57.049 --> 01:05:57.059 align:start position:0%
um and and God forbid some of them are
 
01:05:58.849 --> 01:05:58.859 align:start position:0%
eating cat food because they can't
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
afford to pay the heat in their house so
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
I I uh I hate to see them damaged with
 
01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
the with the uh because of the the Daddy
 
01:06:08.569 --> 01:06:08.579 align:start position:0%
Warbucks out there who are who managed
 
01:06:12.890 --> 01:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
a thing
 
01:06:21.069 --> 01:06:21.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:24.410 --> 01:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
and stuck with us for a little over an
 
01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
hour and and you've answered every
 
01:06:29.089 --> 01:06:29.099 align:start position:0%
question that was opposed to you so
 
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
again I want to thank you and we're
 
01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
going to at this point close to hearing
 
01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:35.510 align:start position:0%
going to at this point close to hearing
still

01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:06:37.130 --> 01:06:37.140 align:start position:0%
would you thank you to everybody on the
 
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
committee it was a great discussion
 
01:06:41.450 --> 01:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:43.010 --> 01:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to take a break in a
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
minute but let me just have a couple of
 
01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
administrative uh comments to the
 
01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
community uh
 
01:06:52.730 --> 01:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
I I handed out a couple of admonishments
 
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
during during this past hearing please
 
01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
no one should take any of that
 
01:06:59.210 --> 01:06:59.220 align:start position:0%
personally I I was admined several times
 
01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
last year by last year's chairman uh for
 
01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
the same issue we have to we have to
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that during the hearing
 
01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
process we are really asking questions
 
01:07:13.309 --> 01:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
of those that are testifying uh to get a
 
01:07:15.529 --> 01:07:15.539 align:start position:0%
better understanding of the bill and the
 
01:07:18.289 --> 01:07:18.299 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill uh any
 
01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
especially with emotional issues that
 
01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
come before us it's very easy to
 
01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
want to get into the
 
01:07:30.349 --> 01:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
into the arena and Duke it out a little
 
01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:33.059 align:start position:0%
bit with it with uh with some of the the
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
folks that are proposing these bills
 
01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
just the time to do that is the
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
executive session with each other and so
 
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
I would just again uh especially as we
 
01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
tackle some of the emotional issues that
 
01:07:47.569 --> 01:07:47.579 align:start position:0%
are going to be coming up in our
 
01:07:50.029 --> 01:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
calendar and let me tell you that that
 
01:07:52.970 --> 01:07:52.980 align:start position:0%
it was without it was it was with
 
01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
purpose that some of our early bills
 
01:07:58.670 --> 01:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
were not the emotional ones we really
 
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
wanted to try to practice our process
 
01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
and make sure that we we understood how
 
01:08:07.010 --> 01:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
to use this this Zoom process especially
 
01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
without the with some of the what I'll
 
01:08:11.690 --> 01:08:11.700 align:start position:0%
call easier bills or less emotional
 
01:08:13.069 --> 01:08:13.079 align:start position:0%
bills but we are going to have some
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
emotional uh bills and accompanying
 
01:08:19.729 --> 01:08:19.739 align:start position:0%
testimony coming up so I would uh ask
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
the community to try your hardest that
 
01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
during the hearing that you've formed
 
01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
your comments in the form of a question
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
and uh and let's let's hold off in the
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
debate if we can have all the debate we
 
01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:33.900 align:start position:0%
want during the executive session if
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate at that point
 
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
so again please
 
01:08:41.570 --> 01:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
nobody should take any of my comments
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
personally it was it wasn't meant that
 
01:08:47.209 --> 01:08:47.219 align:start position:0%
way uh we we all have to work our issue
 
01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
of a power process works thirdly uh the
 
01:08:54.970 --> 01:08:54.980 align:start position:0%
weather in Concord here is deteriorating
 
01:08:58.010 --> 01:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
uh and I think if you've watched any of
 
01:08:59.809 --> 01:08:59.819 align:start position:0%
the news today you know that it's going
 
01:09:01.689 --> 01:09:01.699 align:start position:0%
to continue to deteriorate
 
01:09:06.530 --> 01:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
so we are uh
 
01:09:09.289 --> 01:09:09.299 align:start position:0%
we have this Zoom process on the
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
dialogue process to participate in
 
01:09:13.789 --> 01:09:13.799 align:start position:0%
meetings I personally would would like
 
01:09:15.490 --> 01:09:15.500 align:start position:0%
to see more people come in person
 
01:09:18.769 --> 01:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
personal choice based on your own uh
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
safety uh
 
01:09:21.839 --> 01:09:24.470 align:start position:0%
safety uh
but

01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:26.460 align:start position:0%
those are people who aren't here in
 
01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:29.460 align:start position:0%
person uh I would like you to consider
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
your own personal safety in the fact
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
that if you have a long way to drive
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
home after we're done today you might
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
want to think about leaving early and
 
01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
participating through the zoom process
 
01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh that's that that's fine with me but
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
also as a reminder we are Administration
 
01:09:53.329 --> 01:09:53.339 align:start position:0%
works with the zoom process if you leave
 
01:09:55.970 --> 01:09:55.980 align:start position:0%
after the hearings prior to the
 
01:09:57.950 --> 01:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
executive session and if you want to you
 
01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
want to participate in your example on
 
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
your car phone on your drive home unless
 
01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
you are unless your image appears on the
 
01:10:09.229 --> 01:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
screen in the zoom you can participate
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
but you can't vote so keep that in mind
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
if you want to leave a little bit
 
01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
earlier during the during the hearing
 
01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
process so that you're available to vote
 
01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
during the executive section uh keep
 
01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
that in mind as as you make your
 
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
decision but but what is most important
 
01:10:28.669 --> 01:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
is your personal safety and please don't
 
01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
risk that just because uh you want to be
 
01:10:34.729 --> 01:10:34.739 align:start position:0%
here and found here with me so I would
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
ask you to think about that and make
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
your own personal decision
 
01:10:41.689 --> 01:10:41.699 align:start position:0%
okay with that uh we are a little behind
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
our next our next bill
 
01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:46.620 align:start position:0%
that we're going to consider is House
 
01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
Bill 64 and but before we do that I'd
 
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
like to take a recess for about five
 
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
minutes and and if you have
 
01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
and I want to make a trip to the the
 
01:10:59.689 --> 01:10:59.699 align:start position:0%
bathroom or if you want to get the three
 
01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
uh snack or whatever go right ahead and
 
01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:07.380 align:start position:0%
we will reconvene at 25 minutes past 10
 
01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:08.570 align:start position:0%
we will reconvene at 25 minutes past 10
o'clock

01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
chairman Dolan
 
01:11:16.610 --> 01:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
hi it's representative van Peterborough
 
01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:19.140 align:start position:0%
24. uh I just want to give you a heads
 
01:11:22.689 --> 01:11:22.699 align:start position:0%
up as you think about the the schedule
 
01:11:26.090 --> 01:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
that I'm the prime sponsor for House
 
01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
Bill 189 which is the last bill we're
 
01:11:30.530 --> 01:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
taking up this morning I'm going to
 
01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:33.900 align:start position:0%
recommend an Ito on that bill because it
 
01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
turns out that just like my other bill
 
01:11:38.450 --> 01:11:38.460 align:start position:0%
it turns out it's redundant uh and says
 
01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
the same thing so as another bill that's
 
01:11:44.450 --> 01:11:44.460 align:start position:0%
coming before the house so uh if that
 
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
relieves your sense of pressure I hope
 
01:11:50.689 --> 01:11:50.699 align:start position:0%
that's helpful to know so I'm just going
 
01:11:52.189 --> 01:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
to get up and say we don't need it
 
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
because there's another bill coming that
 
01:11:56.450 --> 01:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
does the same thing
 
01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:57.169 align:start position:0%
does the same thing
um

01:11:57.169 --> 01:11:57.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:59.689 --> 01:11:59.699 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to recommend an itl thank
 
01:12:01.729 --> 01:12:01.739 align:start position:0%
you for that heads up that will uh what
 
01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:06.900 align:start position:0%
we can do is if the committee is so uh
 
01:12:10.970 --> 01:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
uh fine we can we can detect that one uh
 
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
right away right that's what I was
 
01:12:14.689 --> 01:12:14.699 align:start position:0%
thinking and that would get us maybe get
 
01:12:16.010 --> 01:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
us back on track
 
01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
yeah well thank you uh so let's see
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%

a blue button that says mute and then a
 
01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
button that says more correct if I raise
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
my hand it doesn't show
 
01:16:55.370 --> 01:16:55.380 align:start position:0%

01:17:49.570 --> 01:17:49.580 align:start position:0%
so right that's what it should say
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative power do you have do you
 
01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:53.030 align:start position:0%
representative power do you have do you
have

01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
um something to add to that that might
 
01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
be able to help because it it looks all
 
01:17:58.729 --> 01:17:58.739 align:start position:0%
good on this end I'm going to ask
 
01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
Christina too
 
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
representative Powers hand up yeah I was
 
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
just hearing what representative Porter
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
was saying and so I was investigating so
 
01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
I could learn as well and I'm seeing the
 
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
same that she's um seeing the mute and
 
01:18:15.709 --> 01:18:15.719 align:start position:0%
then the more blue buttons and when I
 
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
press more it's as she reports rename
 
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
and edit profile picture
 
01:18:22.669 --> 01:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
and then when so your hand is raised
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
right now on on the screen that I can
 
01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:27.060 align:start position:0%
see Plus on your tile can you see you're
 
01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
hand raised yes I see a blue hand icon
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
blue hand icon yeah you you see your
 
01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
hand raised representative power yes I
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
do and I see a blue hand icon for you
 
01:18:44.930 --> 01:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
and as well as for representative van
 
01:18:48.050 --> 01:18:48.060 align:start position:0%
right I was checking this out too yeah I
 
01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
can see you and representative van I
 
01:18:52.490 --> 01:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
cannot see a hand by me
 
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have that edit edit uh photo
 
01:18:59.450 --> 01:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
option because I'd like to to put a
 
01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
photo there when I'm not there and in
 
01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
some Zoom meetings I have one that
 
01:19:05.209 --> 01:19:05.219 align:start position:0%
appears but in the State House zooms
 
01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
it's just a blank screen so I don't know
 
01:19:10.010 --> 01:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
how I get that choice
 
01:19:13.850 --> 01:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
so when when you go to join the meeting
 
01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:15.350 align:start position:0%
so when when you go to join the meeting
there's

01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
um a dialog box that comes up that says
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
test audio right have you have you all
 
01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:21.900 align:start position:0%
done that and then there's other options
 
01:19:24.229 --> 01:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
like look it has video in other
 
01:19:30.890 --> 01:19:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you that clarifies I was wondering
 
01:19:39.310 --> 01:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:42.490 --> 01:19:42.500 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
representative Porter I will I will do
 
01:19:46.450 --> 01:19:46.460 align:start position:0%
what I can
 
01:19:50.030 --> 01:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
help you out it's it's not a big deal
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative it's just I can't see my
 
01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
hand raised or lowered so I don't know
 
01:19:57.729 --> 01:19:57.739 align:start position:0%
if I forgot to lower it and
 
01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
I don't care how about this yeah leave
 
01:20:03.950 --> 01:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
it up could you leave your hand up or
 
01:20:07.010 --> 01:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:09.290 --> 01:20:09.300 align:start position:0%
can you did you get the message that I
 
01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
asked you to lower your hand
 
01:20:15.290 --> 01:20:15.300 align:start position:0%
where would that have shown
 
01:20:18.169 --> 01:20:18.179 align:start position:0%
I didn't I didn't see
 
01:20:21.229 --> 01:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
you didn't see it may I also add
 
01:20:24.649 --> 01:20:24.659 align:start position:0%
something to that so in the participant
 
01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:27.300 align:start position:0%
white box where it lists all the
 
01:20:30.169 --> 01:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
participants and we see panelists in
 
01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
blue and then attendees yep in Gray well
 
01:20:34.970 --> 01:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of that
 
01:20:38.630 --> 01:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
um I guess um screen if you will yeah a
 
01:20:41.149 --> 01:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
sidebar screen down at the bottom you
 
01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
should see invite mute me and raise
 
01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
hands so if you toggle raised paint
 
01:20:47.870 --> 01:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
raise hand then you'll see it change to
 
01:20:50.209 --> 01:20:50.219 align:start position:0%
lower hands so perhaps representative
 
01:20:52.970 --> 01:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
Porter although you can't see the blue
 
01:20:56.090 --> 01:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
hand icon currently you might be able to
 
01:20:58.490 --> 01:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
discern whether your hand is up or down
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
based on the the button how it toggles
 
01:21:04.010 --> 01:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
do you see that on the bottom yes I do
 
01:21:05.870 --> 01:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
understand that that process it just
 
01:21:08.810 --> 01:21:08.820 align:start position:0%
requires me to be vigilant in that
 
01:21:11.570 --> 01:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
little box and it's okay I can do that
 
01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
but I don't multitask as well as the
 
01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
younger folks around me do so so
 
01:21:18.410 --> 01:21:18.420 align:start position:0%
additionally I don't have the specific
 
01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
answer at this point in time but when
 
01:21:23.810 --> 01:21:23.820 align:start position:0%
you did set up your Zoom account because
 
01:21:25.310 --> 01:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
I do see that you have your still
 
01:21:27.229 --> 01:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
picture yeah
 
01:21:29.090 --> 01:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
Etc and your name as you like it
 
01:21:31.610 --> 01:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
displayed there may be some options in
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
there that need to be um set or unset
 
01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
okay maybe representative Maggiore or
 
01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:39.370 align:start position:0%
okay maybe representative Maggiore or
Christina

01:21:39.370 --> 01:21:39.380 align:start position:0%
Christina
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
knows the answer to that better than I
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
do at this point
 
01:21:44.810 --> 01:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
it's just strange because it wasn't like
 
01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
that when I got on this morning I was
 
01:21:49.850 --> 01:21:49.860 align:start position:0%
fine and perfect the way everyone else
 
01:21:52.430 --> 01:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
is this morning it just changed it just
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
changed it changed within the last half
 
01:21:59.450 --> 01:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
I really encourage this uh Tech talk
 
01:22:04.510 --> 01:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
here where uh
 
01:22:07.850 --> 01:22:07.860 align:start position:0%
and those both who are those who may be
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
further along in the learning process
 
01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
are helping
 
01:22:13.610 --> 01:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
the rest of us so I really do appreciate
 
01:22:15.709 --> 01:22:15.719 align:start position:0%
that but I'd like to get now back to
 
01:22:17.630 --> 01:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
work here we're going to take up House
 
01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
if you're if you'd like to
 
01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
unmute your um your video or turn your
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
video on if you're going to print it off
 
01:22:35.630 --> 01:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
you can do that now and uh
 
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to open the hearing on
 
01:22:49.610 --> 01:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:53.209 --> 01:22:53.219 align:start position:0%
which is uh relative to renewable
 
01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
generation facility property
 
01:23:00.169 --> 01:23:00.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:02.689 --> 01:23:02.699 align:start position:0%
this is a no
 
01:23:05.290 --> 01:23:05.300 align:start position:0%
payment and lowest taxes public
 
01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
listening right we are an acronym
 
01:23:10.729 --> 01:23:10.739 align:start position:0%
called up pilot
 
01:23:10.739 --> 01:23:12.290 align:start position:0%
called up pilot
acronym

01:23:12.290 --> 01:23:12.300 align:start position:0%
acronym
 
01:23:14.870 --> 01:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
s for payment
 
01:23:16.669 --> 01:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:23:18.350 --> 01:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
you hear that it has nothing to do with
 
01:23:21.290 --> 01:23:21.300 align:start position:0%
Aviation it has to do with the
 
01:23:24.050 --> 01:23:24.060 align:start position:0%
exactly so uh
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
we have representative Aaron on the line
 
01:23:35.090 --> 01:23:35.100 align:start position:0%

uh I bring before you today this bill
 
01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
which seeks to fix and clarify a problem
 
01:24:09.410 --> 01:24:09.420 align:start position:0%
within RSA 72 colon 74 payment in lieu
 
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
of taxes for renewable generation
 
01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:13.189 align:start position:0%
of taxes for renewable generation
facilities

01:24:13.189 --> 01:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:24:15.410 --> 01:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
the problem was identified by The
 
01:24:17.570 --> 01:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
Honorable Jim Grenier of lemster last
 
01:24:20.450 --> 01:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
year during his auditing duties as Town
 
01:24:22.970 --> 01:24:22.980 align:start position:0%
Auditor in lemster
 
01:24:25.570 --> 01:24:25.580 align:start position:0%
The Honorable Jim grineer alerted me
 
01:24:28.189 --> 01:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
representative Porter and others
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
regarding an issue with the way the
 
01:24:32.450 --> 01:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue was dealing with
 
01:24:34.610 --> 01:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
renewable energy generating facilities
 
01:24:37.010 --> 01:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
valuation calculations
 
01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
for those facilities who have entered
 
01:24:41.030 --> 01:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
into pilot agreements where their
 
01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:43.010 align:start position:0%
into pilot agreements where their
municipalities

01:24:43.010 --> 01:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:24:45.290 --> 01:24:45.300 align:start position:0%
we tried to get this fix in last year
 
01:24:47.810 --> 01:24:47.820 align:start position:0%
when he found the error but because of
 
01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
past deadlines and coded complications
 
01:24:53.810 --> 01:24:53.820 align:start position:0%
regarding work on bills in the Senate it
 
01:24:56.990 --> 01:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
did not make it through the process
 
01:25:00.530 --> 01:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
without going into too much detail dra
 
01:25:02.450 --> 01:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
had been including these facilities into
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
their Statewide education property tax
 
01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:06.530 align:start position:0%
their Statewide education property tax
calculations

01:25:06.530 --> 01:25:06.540 align:start position:0%
calculations
 
01:25:11.110 --> 01:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
although both RSA 76 colon 8 and RSA
 
01:25:15.470 --> 01:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
83-ft colon 9 made it clear that they
 
01:25:17.149 --> 01:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
should be excluded from the education
 
01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
tax and instead taxed as utilities
 
01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
including them in swept calculations
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
resulted in a decrease in State
 
01:25:27.890 --> 01:25:27.900 align:start position:0%
education Aid to the communities where
 
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
the facility is located
 
01:25:33.169 --> 01:25:33.179 align:start position:0%
which means local property taxpayers saw
 
01:25:36.290 --> 01:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
their bills their tax bills increased
 
01:25:38.570 --> 01:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
that is what happened to the lemster
 
01:25:40.729 --> 01:25:40.739 align:start position:0%
taxpayers when the renewable generation
 
01:25:43.729 --> 01:25:43.739 align:start position:0%
facility switched to Pilot payments
 
01:25:46.130 --> 01:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
The Honorable Jim grineer was looking at
 
01:25:49.970 --> 01:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
adequacy estimates for 2021 last year
 
01:25:52.010 --> 01:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
for the town of lemster
 
01:25:54.770 --> 01:25:54.780 align:start position:0%
lemster had recently changed to a pilot
 
01:25:57.950 --> 01:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
agreement with a local wind farm and he
 
01:25:59.450 --> 01:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
saw that the Statewide education
 
01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
property tax increased by 40 percent
 
01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
and caused a 60 to 70 thousand dollar
 
01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:07.739 align:start position:0%
decrease in adequacy funding for their
 
01:26:09.770 --> 01:26:09.780 align:start position:0%
school as a result
 
01:26:11.629 --> 01:26:11.639 align:start position:0%
he discovered that the wind farm
 
01:26:14.209 --> 01:26:14.219 align:start position:0%
valuation had not been excluded from the
 
01:26:16.129 --> 01:26:16.139 align:start position:0%
tax-based valuation as it should have
 
01:26:16.139 --> 01:26:17.510 align:start position:0%
tax-based valuation as it should have
been

01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:26:20.450 --> 01:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
the issue is discussed with dra and
 
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
Barbara Reid of the New Hampshire
 
01:26:24.770 --> 01:26:24.780 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association representative
 
01:26:26.930 --> 01:26:26.940 align:start position:0%
Marjorie Porter and Lauren Martin of
 
01:26:29.629 --> 01:26:29.639 align:start position:0%
Avatar and they all determined that the
 
01:26:30.890 --> 01:26:30.900 align:start position:0%
language in this bill that I'm
 
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
presenting needed to be placed in
 
01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
statute for clarity
 
01:26:38.930 --> 01:26:38.940 align:start position:0%
so I'm simply making the statutes match
 
01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
up with each other for Clarity by
 
01:26:44.629 --> 01:26:44.639 align:start position:0%
submitting the change to RSA 72 colon 74
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
2 which inserts the Line quote but shall
 
01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
be excluded from the tax base used to
 
01:26:53.090 --> 01:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
determine Statewide education property
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
tax in accordance with RSA 76 colon 8 1A
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
end quote to make it clear how the tax
 
01:27:04.729 --> 01:27:04.739 align:start position:0%
calculation is to be calculated in the
 
01:27:06.590 --> 01:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
case of renewable generation facility
 
01:27:08.930 --> 01:27:08.940 align:start position:0%
that has a pilot agreement with their
 
01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:11.510 align:start position:0%
that has a pilot agreement with their
municipality

01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
01:27:14.450 --> 01:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
with this in place dra can correctly
 
01:27:16.870 --> 01:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
calculate the necessary tax calculations
 
01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
as the statutes require for these pilot
 
01:27:22.610 --> 01:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
facilities which impacts adequacy
 
01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:23.750 align:start position:0%
facilities which impacts adequacy
funding

01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:27:25.850 --> 01:27:25.860 align:start position:0%
it is important for the interest of fair
 
01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
Taxation and the funding of students in
 
01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
lemster and other towns that are
 
01:27:33.050 --> 01:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
affected such as places like Groton and
 
01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:36.060 align:start position:0%
Antrim many of our towns may not have
 
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
even noticed the problem and have been
 
01:27:40.490 --> 01:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
shortchanged on education funding as a
 
01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:41.750 align:start position:0%
shortchanged on education funding as a
result

01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
result
 
01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
so I asked you please to pass this bill
 
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
through this committee and I'm happy to
 
01:27:47.689 --> 01:27:47.699 align:start position:0%
take your questions
 
01:27:50.990 --> 01:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
and I believe that um uh uh honorable
 
01:27:54.110 --> 01:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
Jim grineer is also um on the list of
 
01:27:56.689 --> 01:27:56.699 align:start position:0%
people to testify on this bill
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
yes we have uh representative Porter on
 
01:28:02.030 --> 01:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
the list and representative Grenier here
 
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh on the list as well but uh would you
 
01:28:06.530 --> 01:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
take a question from representative
 
01:28:09.649 --> 01:28:09.659 align:start position:0%
manager booty yeah sure
 
01:28:13.550 --> 01:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh Aaron my
 
01:28:16.370 --> 01:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
question is does this apply only to the
 
01:28:19.010 --> 01:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
commercial or is it to individual
 
01:28:23.689 --> 01:28:23.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
well I believe
 
01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
um whatever facility is uh has gone into
 
01:28:32.110 --> 01:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
a pilot agreement
 
01:28:35.209 --> 01:28:35.219 align:start position:0%
and is a renewable generation facility I
 
01:28:38.270 --> 01:28:38.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know that it uh distinguishes
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
between commercial or non-commercial I
 
01:28:42.830 --> 01:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
would imagine they'd be commercial
 
01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:51.110 align:start position:0%
would imagine they'd be commercial
anyway

01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:54.110 --> 01:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
I will hold back thank you
 
01:28:57.050 --> 01:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
uh representative Porter do you have
 
01:28:58.910 --> 01:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
some testimony
 
01:29:01.610 --> 01:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
I do Mr chair and I I thank
 
01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron she did a wonderful
 
01:29:06.410 --> 01:29:06.420 align:start position:0%
job explaining what the problem has been
 
01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
and what the fix is
 
01:29:12.290 --> 01:29:12.300 align:start position:0%
um when when the legislature established
 
01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
the ability for renewable generating
 
01:29:17.090 --> 01:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
facilities to enter into these payment
 
01:29:19.970 --> 01:29:19.980 align:start position:0%
in lieu of taxes uh situations with
 
01:29:22.129 --> 01:29:22.139 align:start position:0%
communities they're in um it did create
 
01:29:25.970 --> 01:29:25.980 align:start position:0%
confusion for the dra and representative
 
01:29:28.370 --> 01:29:28.380 align:start position:0%
then representative Grenier and I worked
 
01:29:30.610 --> 01:29:30.620 align:start position:0%
on the bill that supposedly fixed it
 
01:29:33.169 --> 01:29:33.179 align:start position:0%
evidently we didn't fix it thoroughly
 
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
enough for Dra so this bill indeed does
 
01:29:40.729 --> 01:29:40.739 align:start position:0%
um take care of what the problem is and
 
01:29:43.790 --> 01:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
it doesn't impact my community of Antrim
 
01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
because they do have a wind farm and to
 
01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
answer representative me and japoodi's
 
01:29:48.719 --> 01:29:50.830 align:start position:0%
answer representative me and japoodi's
question

01:29:50.830 --> 01:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
utility properties are taxed differently
 
01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
then Residential Properties are so any
 
01:30:04.490 --> 01:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
utility property is taxed in a different
 
01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
way than an individual would be to begin
 
01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
with and this bill specifically states
 
01:30:13.729 --> 01:30:13.739 align:start position:0%
that renewable energy facilities like
 
01:30:16.610 --> 01:30:16.620 align:start position:0%
wind farms are utilities and to be taxed
 
01:30:18.649 --> 01:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
that way and not included in the
 
01:30:21.290 --> 01:30:21.300 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax so I you know if
 
01:30:22.850 --> 01:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
that helps you to understand it any
 
01:30:25.189 --> 01:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
better and I'll be glad to answer any
 
01:30:31.330 --> 01:30:31.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:34.610 --> 01:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
so that that clarifies to a great degree
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
so there's no Baseline as to what
 
01:30:41.570 --> 01:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
megawatt or kilowatt uh it's just
 
01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:43.010 align:start position:0%
megawatt or kilowatt uh it's just
commercial

01:30:43.010 --> 01:30:43.020 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
01:30:44.810 --> 01:30:44.820 align:start position:0%
it's just utilities
 
01:30:47.090 --> 01:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:48.169 align:start position:0%
you know
um

01:30:48.169 --> 01:30:48.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:56.450 --> 01:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:58.430 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:30:58.430 --> 01:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:06.250 align:start position:0%
yeah
uh

01:31:06.250 --> 01:31:06.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:08.209 --> 01:31:08.219 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan we're having a hard
 
01:31:09.649 --> 01:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
time hearing you could you adjust your
 
01:31:09.659 --> 01:31:17.330 align:start position:0%
time hearing you could you adjust your
microphone

01:31:17.330 --> 01:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
not necessarily on your computer but the
 
01:31:23.209 --> 01:31:23.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:23.219 --> 01:31:24.470 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:31:26.930 --> 01:31:26.940 align:start position:0%
very much better thank you so much
 
01:31:40.189 --> 01:31:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:46.850 --> 01:31:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
um thank you chairman Dolan
 
01:31:50.570 --> 01:31:50.580 align:start position:0%
um the first comment is I'm having
 
01:31:53.390 --> 01:31:53.400 align:start position:0%
trouble hearing you
 
01:31:57.530 --> 01:31:57.540 align:start position:0%
the audio is non-existent
 
01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
for me can you hear me now though yes
 
01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:01.550 align:start position:0%
for me can you hear me now though yes
yes

01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:32:04.250 --> 01:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
yep better
 
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
good all right thank you chairman Dolan
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
so um I have a question and I'm not sure
 
01:32:12.649 --> 01:32:12.659 align:start position:0%
if it's appropriate for for me to to ask
 
01:32:14.689 --> 01:32:14.699 align:start position:0%
the question at this point in time it's
 
01:32:17.570 --> 01:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
just a clarification with regard to
 
01:32:19.189 --> 01:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
um a definition
 
01:32:21.229 --> 01:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
and the question is it doesn't need to
 
01:32:23.330 --> 01:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
be answered if it's inappropriate I just
 
01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
I was having trouble understanding
 
01:32:30.890 --> 01:32:30.900 align:start position:0%
um what exactly is a payment in lieu of
 
01:32:35.450 --> 01:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
taxes I don't understand what that is
 
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
I will try to explain it it's it's kind
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
of weedy and I would recommend that you
 
01:32:43.790 --> 01:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
you do your research you seem to be a
 
01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
good researcher representative power
 
01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:47.510 align:start position:0%
good researcher representative power
um

01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:51.530 --> 01:32:51.540 align:start position:0%
ah some properties are not taxable the
 
01:32:53.629 --> 01:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
hospital for example all the state
 
01:32:56.209 --> 01:32:56.219 align:start position:0%
buildings in in Concord
 
01:32:58.850 --> 01:32:58.860 align:start position:0%
um the University of New Hampshire those
 
01:33:02.209 --> 01:33:02.219 align:start position:0%
are all non-taxable properties but many
 
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
of them
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
um voluntarily choose to pay in lieu of
 
01:33:09.770 --> 01:33:09.780 align:start position:0%
taxes they make a payment to the
 
01:33:13.129 --> 01:33:13.139 align:start position:0%
communities in which they're housed to
 
01:33:15.709 --> 01:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
help out with the
 
01:33:15.719 --> 01:33:17.090 align:start position:0%
help out with the
um

01:33:17.090 --> 01:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:19.310 --> 01:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
facility the services that they receive
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
from the community
 
01:33:25.129 --> 01:33:25.139 align:start position:0%
um back in I believe it was 2009 or 10
 
01:33:27.770 --> 01:33:27.780 align:start position:0%
or one of those years
 
01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
there was a an interest in having more
 
01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
renewable energy properties developed
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
within the state and one incentive to
 
01:33:39.649 --> 01:33:39.659 align:start position:0%
get renewable prop renewable energy
 
01:33:39.659 --> 01:33:40.990 align:start position:0%
get renewable prop renewable energy
properties

01:33:40.990 --> 01:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
properties
 
01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
established in the state was to allow
 
01:33:46.669 --> 01:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
them also to make a payment in lieu of
 
01:33:46.679 --> 01:33:48.410 align:start position:0%
them also to make a payment in lieu of
taxes

01:33:48.410 --> 01:33:48.420 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
um to the towns in which they serve so
 
01:33:53.450 --> 01:33:53.460 align:start position:0%
instead of having somebody go in and
 
01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
assess the the value of the property as
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
they would any other property in the
 
01:34:02.290 --> 01:34:02.300 align:start position:0%
town the the renewable energy
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
facility says
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
we'll pay you this much in taxes over
 
01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
the next 10 years in order for to be
 
01:34:10.970 --> 01:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
able to be in your community
 
01:34:13.550 --> 01:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
um it makes things more Equitable they
 
01:34:15.530 --> 01:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
thought and it was an encouragement to
 
01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:16.790 align:start position:0%
thought and it was an encouragement to
get

01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:34:18.970 --> 01:34:18.980 align:start position:0%
um renewable energy
 
01:34:22.129 --> 01:34:22.139 align:start position:0%
developed in the state and so that all
 
01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
happened prior to the time that I came
 
01:34:25.970 --> 01:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
into the state house but the problems
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
with dra because of that needed to be
 
01:34:30.470 --> 01:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
solved because it did create some
 
01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
assessment and valuation problems um
 
01:34:36.290 --> 01:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
County wise and and school-wide which is
 
01:34:38.810 --> 01:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
why representative Grenier and I filed
 
01:34:41.930 --> 01:34:41.940 align:start position:0%
the bill back in 2014 to clarify and why
 
01:34:45.530 --> 01:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
this fix is needed does that answer your
 
01:34:48.169 --> 01:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you on representative
 
01:34:50.450 --> 01:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
Porter that that does confirm my
 
01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
understanding so in summary
 
01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:53.990 align:start position:0%
understanding so in summary
um

01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:57.410 --> 01:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
this the this pilot agreement is is it
 
01:35:00.110 --> 01:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
is it correct in stating it's a donation
 
01:35:02.810 --> 01:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
of sorts is there any level or is there
 
01:35:05.629 --> 01:35:05.639 align:start position:0%
any negotiation or conversation
 
01:35:08.510 --> 01:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
um had to arrive at a particular dollar
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
amount yes that happens within the town
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
itself between the town that's hosting
 
01:35:16.490 --> 01:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
and the renewable energy facility so I
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
know that the one in Antrim
 
01:35:22.129 --> 01:35:22.139 align:start position:0%
um the pilot payment is one of the
 
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
higher ones that's that's around because
 
01:35:26.810 --> 01:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
that was what was negotiated I don't
 
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
know about lemster representative Aaron
 
01:35:30.890 --> 01:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
might know that perfect thank you
 
01:35:33.050 --> 01:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
representative Porter I appreciate it
 
01:35:35.330 --> 01:35:35.340 align:start position:0%
let me let me also offer some
 
01:35:37.790 --> 01:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
explanations and give you some examples
 
01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
of Pilots to help people understand them
 
01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
that aren't familiar with them
 
01:35:44.450 --> 01:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
oftentimes uh
 
01:35:46.330 --> 01:35:46.340 align:start position:0%
Pilots are done as part of an
 
01:35:48.169 --> 01:35:48.179 align:start position:0%
intermunicipality agreement as well
 
01:35:51.229 --> 01:35:51.239 align:start position:0%
because uh one town and one municipality
 
01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
really can't tax another town but there
 
01:35:58.370 --> 01:35:58.380 align:start position:0%
may be some impact uh one that I
 
01:36:00.669 --> 01:36:00.679 align:start position:0%
personally uh worked on
 
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
because of the town that I'm from
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
Londonderry you may not realize but the
 
01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:07.679 align:start position:0%
Manchester Airport is about 75 percent
 
01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
contained within the town of London
 
01:36:12.890 --> 01:36:12.900 align:start position:0%
there and so we've worked out since
 
01:36:15.189 --> 01:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
since we really can't tax Manchester
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
property tax wise we have an into we
 
01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
have an Indian municipality
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
into municipality agreement that
 
01:36:24.410 --> 01:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
contains a pilot
 
01:36:26.810 --> 01:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
with the city of Manchester so that the
 
01:36:30.770 --> 01:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
airport pays Londonderry uh a certain
 
01:36:33.410 --> 01:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
amount each year for the impact of the
 
01:36:33.420 --> 01:36:34.310 align:start position:0%
amount each year for the impact of the
community

01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:36:39.470 --> 01:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
uh another example is uh there is a very
 
01:36:40.810 --> 01:36:40.820 align:start position:0%
a a
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
750 megawatt uh Power Plant in the
 
01:36:46.729 --> 01:36:46.739 align:start position:0%
northern part of London area just south
 
01:36:48.110 --> 01:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
of the airport
 
01:36:53.149 --> 01:36:53.159 align:start position:0%
and we've negotiated a pilot with that
 
01:36:54.649 --> 01:36:54.659 align:start position:0%
power plant
 
01:36:57.709 --> 01:36:57.719 align:start position:0%
great really for a couple of reasons one
 
01:37:02.689 --> 01:37:02.699 align:start position:0%
it benefits both entities the uh
 
01:37:05.090 --> 01:37:05.100 align:start position:0%
the power plant
 
01:37:07.370 --> 01:37:07.380 align:start position:0%
knows exactly how much they're going to
 
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
be paying
 
01:37:10.970 --> 01:37:10.980 align:start position:0%
uh for several years out and it's a
 
01:37:13.010 --> 01:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
multi-year agreement so they can they
 
01:37:15.290 --> 01:37:15.300 align:start position:0%
can plan their future business and the
 
01:37:16.850 --> 01:37:16.860 align:start position:0%
community knows how much they're going
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
to be receiving on the revenue side so
 
01:37:22.250 --> 01:37:22.260 align:start position:0%
the town doesn't have to uh
 
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
be confused about how much money they're
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
going to get in tax revenue the next
 
01:37:30.169 --> 01:37:30.179 align:start position:0%
year so it helps both the entity and the
 
01:37:32.830 --> 01:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
community with their planning
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of tax payments and tax revenue
 
01:37:38.810 --> 01:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
so that's another example of pilot
 
01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay uh yes again I just wanted to
 
01:37:44.890 --> 01:37:44.900 align:start position:0%
correct one thing you said
 
01:37:49.370 --> 01:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
750 megawatt that's a huge one did you
 
01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:50.770 align:start position:0%
750 megawatt that's a huge one did you
mean

01:37:50.770 --> 01:37:50.780 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
750 kilowatt no uh this is a this is a
 
01:37:58.610 --> 01:37:58.620 align:start position:0%
this is a huge power plant this is a 750
 
01:38:02.450 --> 01:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
megawatt has its own pipeline it has its
 
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
own natural gas pipeline that comes up
 
01:38:06.890 --> 01:38:06.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:08.810 align:start position:0%
thank you
uh

01:38:08.810 --> 01:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
um yeah if you go by the Manchester
 
01:38:13.010 --> 01:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
Airport on the on the South Side you may
 
01:38:16.129 --> 01:38:16.139 align:start position:0%
see a steam plume uh that emanates from
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
the plant uh
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
and that's that's what that that is it's
 
01:38:21.970 --> 01:38:21.980 align:start position:0%
right right near the uh the yogic
 
01:38:25.490 --> 01:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:28.370 --> 01:38:28.380 align:start position:0%
okay is it Mr chair I sorry to interrupt
 
01:38:30.410 --> 01:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
but I see that representative Aaron's
 
01:38:32.510 --> 01:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
hand is up and maybe in response to the
 
01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:33.590 align:start position:0%
hand is up and maybe in response to the
question

01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
yes uh we go to representative Aaron but
 
01:38:38.270 --> 01:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
I also also like after her to go to
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative uh a former
 
01:38:42.169 --> 01:38:42.179 align:start position:0%
representative Grenier as the uh to
 
01:38:43.850 --> 01:38:43.860 align:start position:0%
testify as well
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I uh Mr chair I just wanted to say
 
01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
that um for further clarification
 
01:38:53.149 --> 01:38:53.159 align:start position:0%
regarding pilot uh I believe that uh
 
01:38:55.790 --> 01:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
Lauren Martin of Avatar may also be
 
01:38:59.570 --> 01:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
testifying today so on this bill so she
 
01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
might you might be able to direct that
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
question to her as well
 
01:39:04.370 --> 01:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:39:07.490 --> 01:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
uh representative Nigeria do we have rep
 
01:39:09.649 --> 01:39:09.659 align:start position:0%
we have former representative uh Grenier
 
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
on the line I do not thank you Mr chair
 
01:39:15.229 --> 01:39:15.239 align:start position:0%
I do not see representative uh Grenier
 
01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
on the line by name or or any other way
 
01:39:20.570 --> 01:39:20.580 align:start position:0%
that I could identify but there are two
 
01:39:22.729 --> 01:39:22.739 align:start position:0%
people calling in if representative
 
01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
Grenier is either of the numbers that
 
01:39:29.390 --> 01:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
end in three four five or six eight one
 
01:39:31.610 --> 01:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
um and uh and he would raise his hand
 
01:39:33.590 --> 01:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
then we could recognize him otherwise I
 
01:39:35.689 --> 01:39:35.699 align:start position:0%
do not see representative Grenier
 
01:39:35.699 --> 01:39:39.110 align:start position:0%
do not see representative Grenier
in

01:39:39.110 --> 01:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:40.930 --> 01:39:40.940 align:start position:0%
he is okay
 
01:39:43.310 --> 01:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
681 yes
 
01:39:44.750 --> 01:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
01:39:47.390 --> 01:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
Grenier you uh should be all set you
 
01:39:49.610 --> 01:39:49.620 align:start position:0%
will not need to raise your hand which
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
is uh uh which is uh star nine so you'll
 
01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
need to star six in order to speak
 
01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:58.910 align:start position:0%
need to star six in order to speak
yeah

01:39:58.910 --> 01:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
you are there we go there we
 
01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
go am I there yes you are
 
01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
01:40:10.129 --> 01:40:10.139 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chair and thank you
 
01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
honorable members of Municipal and
 
01:40:15.530 --> 01:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
County government for hearing this bill
 
01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:16.430 align:start position:0%
County government for hearing this bill
um

01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:18.290 --> 01:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
I I do want to make just a couple of
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
points based on a couple of questions I
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
work long and hard with representative
 
01:40:24.290 --> 01:40:24.300 align:start position:0%
Porter on this
 
01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
um Pilots came in to existence to
 
01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.159 align:start position:0%
encourage the development of these
 
01:40:33.770 --> 01:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
utilities and they are commercial
 
01:40:35.689 --> 01:40:35.699 align:start position:0%
utilities they're not something that
 
01:40:37.250 --> 01:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
goes on at the home
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
one of the benefits of these two towns
 
01:40:43.310 --> 01:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
of course is revenue and we say that
 
01:40:45.290 --> 01:40:45.300 align:start position:0%
towns need to have a commercial building
 
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
or an industry to help with their taxes
 
01:40:50.990 --> 01:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
this was that the other thing that it
 
01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
does and I think many people fail to
 
01:40:55.930 --> 01:40:55.940 align:start position:0%
know this is it they generate
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
6.60 cents per thousand in state revenue
 
01:41:03.250 --> 01:41:03.260 align:start position:0%
and that's another reason why utilities
 
01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
are not supposed to be taxed for the
 
01:41:07.610 --> 01:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
swept tax because it winds up being
 
01:41:09.229 --> 01:41:09.239 align:start position:0%
double taxation
 
01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
now I have I found this because
 
01:41:15.770 --> 01:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
um I don't know why this is sort of
 
01:41:18.350 --> 01:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
thing I do and and I found it about a
 
01:41:19.550 --> 01:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
year ago
 
01:41:24.590 --> 01:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
I I have I think uh a written
 
01:41:27.770 --> 01:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
document that I sent I I didn't know
 
01:41:30.410 --> 01:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
that I needed to read through that Mr
 
01:41:32.209 --> 01:41:32.219 align:start position:0%
chair would you prefer that I just take
 
01:41:33.950 --> 01:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
questions now or would you like me to
 
01:41:36.410 --> 01:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
read through that document I I would I
 
01:41:43.010 --> 01:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:45.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
so I can't I I can't hear
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
have you supplied that
 
01:41:54.770 --> 01:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
yes I sent it a long time ago but maybe
 
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
I best just read through it then if it's
 
01:41:59.689 --> 01:41:59.699 align:start position:0%
not clear that I've sent it so I will do
 
01:41:59.699 --> 01:42:00.410 align:start position:0%
not clear that I've sent it so I will do
that

01:42:00.410 --> 01:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:42:03.169 --> 01:42:03.179 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill is that is that
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
okay yes it is
 
01:42:08.330 --> 01:42:08.340 align:start position:0%
okay the
 
01:42:10.189 --> 01:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:42:12.410 --> 01:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill is to clarify
 
01:42:15.649 --> 01:42:15.659 align:start position:0%
language a language issue in RSA 7274
 
01:42:18.169 --> 01:42:18.179 align:start position:0%
that has led to dra failing to exempt
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
many utilities renewable energy
 
01:42:22.430 --> 01:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
facilities from the state education
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
property tax as a co-sponsor of The
 
01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
Mending legislation HB 1549 attached I
 
01:42:31.189 --> 01:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
have those things all together in a
 
01:42:33.470 --> 01:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
document I know it was never the intent
 
01:42:35.209 --> 01:42:35.219 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the exemption of these
 
01:42:36.890 --> 01:42:36.900 align:start position:0%
utilities from the state education
 
01:42:39.470 --> 01:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
property tax which I'll call swept
 
01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
henceforth there was there was not
 
01:42:46.129 --> 01:42:46.139 align:start position:0%
language in that 2014 Bill to eliminate
 
01:42:48.410 --> 01:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
the exemption as several other statutes
 
01:42:51.050 --> 01:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
would have needed to be changed it is
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
important to understand the swept is
 
01:42:54.649 --> 01:42:54.659 align:start position:0%
used to determine the state adequacy
 
01:42:56.930 --> 01:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
funds paid to each town the funds are
 
01:42:59.330 --> 01:42:59.340 align:start position:0%
collected and stay in District
 
01:43:01.250 --> 01:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
there are some towns that receive no
 
01:43:03.770 --> 01:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
money because the sweat raises enough
 
01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
Revenue to provide education to be
 
01:43:09.470 --> 01:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
determined by the state legislature most
 
01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
towns do receive some level of fiscal
 
01:43:13.970 --> 01:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
support in addition to sweat funds which
 
01:43:16.010 --> 01:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
are entire sweat funds are entirely
 
01:43:18.770 --> 01:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
local when a town has an increase in
 
01:43:20.750 --> 01:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
sweat revenues all things being equal
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
there will be there will be a one for
 
01:43:26.990 --> 01:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
one reduction in adequacy Grant funds
 
01:43:30.050 --> 01:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
from the state and thus a decrease in
 
01:43:32.090 --> 01:43:32.100 align:start position:0%
state tax burden
 
01:43:35.149 --> 01:43:35.159 align:start position:0%
on the next paragraph I go through a
 
01:43:38.450 --> 01:43:38.460 align:start position:0%
detailed description using
 
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
um the tax warrant for swept for lemster
 
01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
and their tax rate statement both of
 
01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
which from dra I don't think I'm going
 
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
to read that to you it is available I
 
01:43:52.609 --> 01:43:52.619 align:start position:0%
did send it but um the the long and
 
01:43:55.609 --> 01:43:55.619 align:start position:0%
short of it is the way dra is doing this
 
01:44:01.729 --> 01:44:01.739 align:start position:0%
is costing um lemster 42 882 dollars for
 
01:44:05.810 --> 01:44:05.820 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year 20. 20. it should be
 
01:44:08.090 --> 01:44:08.100 align:start position:0%
noted that before lemster entered into a
 
01:44:10.729 --> 01:44:10.739 align:start position:0%
payment of taxes with the local wind
 
01:44:12.350 --> 01:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
fund the equalized value of the Wind
 
01:44:14.450 --> 01:44:14.460 align:start position:0%
Farm was never used to calculate the
 
01:44:16.910 --> 01:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
swept tax while lemster never really
 
01:44:20.209 --> 01:44:20.219 align:start position:0%
wanted to enter into a pilot the legal
 
01:44:22.729 --> 01:44:22.739 align:start position:0%
cost of being pressured to do so and I
 
01:44:24.530 --> 01:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
understand why the company wanted a
 
01:44:29.149 --> 01:44:29.159 align:start position:0%
pilot they ultimately did enter into a
 
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
pilot in after that point they got less
 
01:44:35.570 --> 01:44:35.580 align:start position:0%
money than they were getting in taxes
 
01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
and then dra now was taxing the town in
 
01:44:45.530 --> 01:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
the um swept tax warrant for the wind
 
01:44:48.530 --> 01:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
farm and
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
um how fair is that I mean really so I
 
01:44:56.030 --> 01:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
hope you will support the bill and fix
 
01:44:57.950 --> 01:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
this inconsistency regarding the
 
01:44:59.930 --> 01:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
exception from swept and the subsequent
 
01:45:02.209 --> 01:45:02.219 align:start position:0%
loss of State adequacy Grant funds for
 
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
many towns with renewable energy
 
01:45:06.290 --> 01:45:06.300 align:start position:0%
facilities and there are going to be a
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
lot more in the future particularly with
 
01:45:10.189 --> 01:45:10.199 align:start position:0%
photovoltaic there are some big ones
 
01:45:13.010 --> 01:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
going up around here these facilities
 
01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:15.719 align:start position:0%
are a plus for State funds at 660 per
 
01:45:15.719 --> 01:45:16.790 align:start position:0%
are a plus for State funds at 660 per
thousand

01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
01:45:20.090 --> 01:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
from the state utility property tax the
 
01:45:22.129 --> 01:45:22.139 align:start position:0%
present practice of taxing the wind farm
 
01:45:26.090 --> 01:45:26.100 align:start position:0%
is double State Taxation and
 
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
I I would
 
01:45:32.030 --> 01:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
implore you to not de facto punish the
 
01:45:34.669 --> 01:45:34.679 align:start position:0%
towns for entering into Pilots but pass
 
01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
this bill and clarify this in
 
01:45:40.010 --> 01:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
consistency one other point I want to
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
make because the question was raised why
 
01:45:44.109 --> 01:45:44.119 align:start position:0%
would you do a pilot in some towns
 
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
lemster had a very good site for a wind
 
01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:48.229 align:start position:0%
lemster had a very good site for a wind
farm

01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
farm
 
01:45:51.050 --> 01:45:51.060 align:start position:0%
the taxes were reasonably low but have
 
01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
subsequently gone up towns that have
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
high tax rates and a good site for any
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
sort of renewable energy facility are
 
01:46:00.590 --> 01:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
going to be deprived of that opportunity
 
01:46:04.250 --> 01:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
unless you can do a pilot the original
 
01:46:07.550 --> 01:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
wind fund had around a million dollars a
 
01:46:10.810 --> 01:46:10.820 align:start position:0%
year in taxes just in local County Etc
 
01:46:13.729 --> 01:46:13.739 align:start position:0%
they couldn't exist that way and
 
01:46:15.890 --> 01:46:15.900 align:start position:0%
ultimately that those numbers have come
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
down and there seems to be some
 
01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:19.390 align:start position:0%
down and there seems to be some
reasonable

01:46:19.390 --> 01:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
01:46:22.850 --> 01:46:22.860 align:start position:0%
future for the relationship between the
 
01:46:22.860 --> 01:46:23.689 align:start position:0%
future for the relationship between the
town

01:46:23.689 --> 01:46:23.699 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:46:27.890 --> 01:46:27.900 align:start position:0%
and the um and the wind farm one other
 
01:46:30.169 --> 01:46:30.179 align:start position:0%
thing is when this started out and I
 
01:46:32.090 --> 01:46:32.100 align:start position:0%
don't want to in any way sound negative
 
01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
to dra what they've had to go through in
 
01:46:36.050 --> 01:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
dealing with this and coming up with
 
01:46:38.890 --> 01:46:38.900 align:start position:0%
Fair values and all is almost
 
01:46:41.629 --> 01:46:41.639 align:start position:0%
incredible maybe it is
 
01:46:45.290 --> 01:46:45.300 align:start position:0%
so they have had to start with the first
 
01:46:48.169 --> 01:46:48.179 align:start position:0%
Wind Farm which was lemster and
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
subsequently we have comparative issues
 
01:46:53.870 --> 01:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
ETC this is a minor thing that needs
 
01:46:56.629 --> 01:46:56.639 align:start position:0%
fixing there's a I don't believe anyone
 
01:46:59.209 --> 01:46:59.219 align:start position:0%
has any malicious intent it's one of
 
01:47:00.649 --> 01:47:00.659 align:start position:0%
those things where I guess you folks
 
01:47:03.530 --> 01:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
call unintended consequences
 
01:47:05.629 --> 01:47:05.639 align:start position:0%
so that's what I have to say about this
 
01:47:07.850 --> 01:47:07.860 align:start position:0%
I do have that document present I don't

today uh we'll tell you what happened a
 
01:49:05.570 --> 01:49:05.580 align:start position:0%
year and a half ago when the governor
 
01:49:07.550 --> 01:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
Wentworth Regional School District and I
 
01:49:09.530 --> 01:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
do not want this deal or thunder
 
01:49:12.410 --> 01:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
but very briefly her petition Warren
 
01:49:14.030 --> 01:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
article was rendered moot by an
 
01:49:15.410 --> 01:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
amendment at a poorly attended
 
01:49:17.810 --> 01:49:17.820 align:start position:0%
deliberative session held in Wolfeboro
 
01:49:20.270 --> 01:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
and hours drive away for some of my
 
01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:21.770 align:start position:0%
and hours drive away for some of my
constituents

01:49:21.770 --> 01:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
embodies operating under traditional
 
01:49:27.050 --> 01:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
rules for RSA 39 3 petition warrant
 
01:49:28.729 --> 01:49:28.739 align:start position:0%
articles must appear on the warrant
 
01:49:31.010 --> 01:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
without any change in the intended
 
01:49:33.770 --> 01:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
effect of the petitioned article
 
01:49:36.490 --> 01:49:36.500 align:start position:0%
however embodies operating under SP2
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
citizens do not have this right of
 
01:49:41.390 --> 01:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
redress a petition Warren article may be
 
01:49:43.250 --> 01:49:43.260 align:start position:0%
rendered moved by Amendment at a poorly
 
01:49:45.290 --> 01:49:45.300 align:start position:0%
attended deliberative session which may
 
01:49:47.030 --> 01:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
be scheduled at a time and place
 
01:49:50.030 --> 01:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
inconvenient for certain citizens this
 
01:49:51.709 --> 01:49:51.719 align:start position:0%
is exactly what happened in the governor
 
01:49:54.109 --> 01:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
Wentworth Regional School District
 
01:49:57.590 --> 01:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
HB 67 would restore the right of redress
 
01:50:00.109 --> 01:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
to the citizens in sb2 districts by
 
01:50:01.970 --> 01:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
requiring both the original and the
 
01:50:03.770 --> 01:50:03.780 align:start position:0%
amended warrant article to appear on the
 
01:50:06.229 --> 01:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
ballot if both passed the amended
 
01:50:07.790 --> 01:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
version would take effect so there would
 
01:50:09.709 --> 01:50:09.719 align:start position:0%
be no conflict
 
01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
my constituents ought to be able to
 
01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
bring their concerns before the voters I
 
01:50:15.890 --> 01:50:15.900 align:start position:0%
urge you to restore my constituents
 
01:50:19.370 --> 01:50:19.380 align:start position:0%
right to redress by voting hb67 ought to
 
01:50:23.090 --> 01:50:23.100 align:start position:0%
pass and I'll be glad to take questions
 
01:50:25.970 --> 01:50:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:28.370 --> 01:50:28.380 align:start position:0%
we have any questions for representative
 
01:50:30.169 --> 01:50:30.179 align:start position:0%
Marsh before we go on to our next
 
01:50:30.179 --> 01:50:35.149 align:start position:0%
Marsh before we go on to our next
speaker

01:50:35.149 --> 01:50:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:50:48.950 --> 01:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative moss and I miss being on
 
01:50:50.570 --> 01:50:50.580 align:start position:0%
a Health and Human Services committee
 
01:50:54.350 --> 01:50:54.360 align:start position:0%
with you uh we miss having you
 
01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
maybe so my question is how would you
 
01:51:03.410 --> 01:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
identify the uh amended article from the
 
01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:04.310 align:start position:0%
identify the uh amended article from the
uh

01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:51:07.550 --> 01:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh original article uh when it's in the
 
01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:08.629 align:start position:0%
uh original article uh when it's in the
warrant

01:51:08.629 --> 01:51:08.639 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
01:51:11.330 --> 01:51:11.340 align:start position:0%
uh I believe that the Selectmen have the
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
right to uh identify things on the
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
warrant uh for instance they can also
 
01:51:17.810 --> 01:51:17.820 align:start position:0%
say whether they recommend or do not
 
01:51:20.450 --> 01:51:20.460 align:start position:0%
recommend particular warrant articles so
 
01:51:22.430 --> 01:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
I believe that the local Selectmen would
 
01:51:24.890 --> 01:51:24.900 align:start position:0%
have the ability to identify it in
 
01:51:26.450 --> 01:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
whatever way they think is appropriate
 
01:51:27.950 --> 01:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
for whatever Warren articles might
 
01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:29.450 align:start position:0%
for whatever Warren articles might
appear

01:51:29.450 --> 01:51:29.460 align:start position:0%
appear
 
01:51:33.950 --> 01:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:36.649 --> 01:51:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:41.930 --> 01:51:41.940 align:start position:0%

01:52:47.450 --> 01:52:47.460 align:start position:0%
Brookfield is the smallest of the six

towns within the school district which
 
01:52:53.450 --> 01:52:53.460 align:start position:0%

that it was a lightly attended meeting
 
01:53:25.970 --> 01:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
it was lightly attended from four voters
 
01:53:28.010 --> 01:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
outside of the district because it was a
 
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:29.760 align:start position:0%

01:54:05.050 --> 01:54:05.060 align:start position:0%
and a half excuse me to 25
 
01:54:07.550 --> 01:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:54:09.709 --> 01:54:09.719 align:start position:0%
thus rendering the warrant article
 
01:54:09.719 --> 01:54:10.970 align:start position:0%
thus rendering the warrant article
meaningless

01:54:10.970 --> 01:54:10.980 align:start position:0%
meaningless
 
01:54:13.129 --> 01:54:13.139 align:start position:0%
the budget committee article was amended
 
01:54:15.950 --> 01:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
by wholesale changes so as to make the
 
01:54:18.649 --> 01:54:18.659 align:start position:0%
budget committee advisory appointed by
 
01:54:20.689 --> 01:54:20.699 align:start position:0%
the school board and with fewer members
 
01:54:24.770 --> 01:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
thus nullifying the article's intent to
 
01:54:27.410 --> 01:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
have an elected body other than the
 
01:54:29.689 --> 01:54:29.699 align:start position:0%
school board to create the budget which
 
01:54:32.270 --> 01:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
is what RSA 195
 
01:54:38.689 --> 01:54:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:42.530 --> 01:54:42.540 align:start position:0%
the January February 2013 issue of the
 
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal association's
 
01:54:46.850 --> 01:54:46.860 align:start position:0%
Town and Country magazine under the
 
01:54:49.850 --> 01:54:49.860 align:start position:0%
legal q a section offered the following
 
01:54:52.370 --> 01:54:52.380 align:start position:0%
assessment regarding amendments to warn
 
01:54:55.910 --> 01:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
articles for sb2 towns and districts and
 
01:54:57.290 --> 01:54:57.300 align:start position:0%
I quote
 
01:54:59.870 --> 01:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
one of the obvious consequences of this
 
01:55:02.810 --> 01:55:02.820 align:start position:0%
system is that it gives opponents of any
 
01:55:05.450 --> 01:55:05.460 align:start position:0%
issue a strategic advantage
 
01:55:08.689 --> 01:55:08.699 align:start position:0%
those who want to say no only have to do
 
01:55:11.090 --> 01:55:11.100 align:start position:0%
it once either by altering the article
 
01:55:14.149 --> 01:55:14.159 align:start position:0%
at the first session or by voting no at
 
01:55:15.890 --> 01:55:15.900 align:start position:0%
the second session
 
01:55:18.350 --> 01:55:18.360 align:start position:0%
those who are in favor of an article on
 
01:55:20.450 --> 01:55:20.460 align:start position:0%
the other hand must attend both sessions
 
01:55:23.810 --> 01:55:23.820 align:start position:0%
and say yes twice
 
01:55:25.790 --> 01:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
the traditionally low attendance at
 
01:55:27.470 --> 01:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
deliberative sessions create some
 
01:55:29.090 --> 01:55:29.100 align:start position:0%
additional tension about the
 
01:55:31.250 --> 01:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
deliberative sessions power to amend
 
01:55:33.890 --> 01:55:33.900 align:start position:0%
articles end quote
 
01:55:36.669 --> 01:55:36.679 align:start position:0%
I would also add unlike an urban area
 
01:55:40.669 --> 01:55:40.679 align:start position:0%
organized under sb2 in large rural sb2
 
01:55:42.830 --> 01:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
Regional School Districts where the
 
01:55:45.590 --> 01:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
larger town like Wolfeboro is the Hub
 
01:55:47.570 --> 01:55:47.580 align:start position:0%
and the location of the annual
 
01:55:50.270 --> 01:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
deliberatives session often the majority
 
01:55:53.390 --> 01:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
of Voters live outside of that town and
 
01:55:55.070 --> 01:55:55.080 align:start position:0%
have greater impediments to
 
01:55:57.169 --> 01:55:57.179 align:start position:0%
participation in the deliberative
 
01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
session due to the greater travel
 
01:56:01.790 --> 01:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
distances and or through inclement
 
01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:02.689 align:start position:0%
distances and or through inclement
weather

01:56:02.689 --> 01:56:02.699 align:start position:0%
weather
 
01:56:05.450 --> 01:56:05.460 align:start position:0%
as such there is a much greater risk
 
01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
that fewer of the district's voter voter
 
01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
majority will be present at the
 
01:56:13.550 --> 01:56:13.560 align:start position:0%
deliberative session to address to
 
01:56:15.530 --> 01:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
address proposed amendments to Warrant
 
01:56:15.540 --> 01:56:19.609 align:start position:0%
address proposed amendments to Warrant
articles

01:56:19.609 --> 01:56:19.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:22.370 --> 01:56:22.380 align:start position:0%
further I would add that petition more
 
01:56:24.590 --> 01:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
and articles to further disadvantage in
 
01:56:26.590 --> 01:56:26.600 align:start position:0%
that they must surmount the SP2
 
01:56:30.109 --> 01:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
institutional opposition as well as risk
 
01:56:32.270 --> 01:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
amendments to the article which may
 
01:56:34.790 --> 01:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
render it moot or so Twisted as to
 
01:56:36.950 --> 01:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
become the opposite of the presented
 
01:56:40.910 --> 01:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
article's intent in my 2019 experience
 
01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
District voters recognize both of my
 
01:56:45.530 --> 01:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
articles had been amended so as to be
 
01:56:47.689 --> 01:56:47.699 align:start position:0%
moved and neither past
 
01:56:50.629 --> 01:56:50.639 align:start position:0%
but it is my understanding that it in at
 
01:56:52.430 --> 01:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
least one other New Hampshire school
 
01:56:55.310 --> 01:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
district where smaller member towns had
 
01:56:56.990 --> 01:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
wished to change
 
01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
the cost allocation formula to be
 
01:57:02.950 --> 01:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
weighted more heavily to allocation via
 
01:57:05.270 --> 01:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation
 
01:57:07.790 --> 01:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
through a petition Warren article
 
01:57:10.250 --> 01:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
the article was amended to have the
 
01:57:13.490 --> 01:57:13.500 align:start position:0%
exact opposite effect and was
 
01:57:16.129 --> 01:57:16.139 align:start position:0%
subsequently adopted to the dismay of
 
01:57:18.649 --> 01:57:18.659 align:start position:0%
the town's already disadvantaged by the
 
01:57:18.659 --> 01:57:19.910 align:start position:0%
the town's already disadvantaged by the
formula

01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
formula
 
01:57:23.390 --> 01:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
although a similar sentiment exists in
 
01:57:25.370 --> 01:57:25.380 align:start position:0%
the smaller towns of my school district
 
01:57:27.890 --> 01:57:27.900 align:start position:0%
regarding the cost distribution formula
 
01:57:31.129 --> 01:57:31.139 align:start position:0%
no one dares submit a petition worn
 
01:57:34.070 --> 01:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
article for fear of a similar reversal
 
01:57:36.589 --> 01:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
of intent via Amendment from the
 
01:57:38.330 --> 01:57:38.340 align:start position:0%
majority at the deliberative session
 
01:57:40.850 --> 01:57:40.860 align:start position:0%
held in Wolfeboro
 
01:57:43.450 --> 01:57:43.460 align:start position:0%
the current statutes and case law
 
01:57:46.189 --> 01:57:46.199 align:start position:0%
regarding citizen petition warrant
 
01:57:49.310 --> 01:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
articles poses notable disadvantage in
 
01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
disincentive to voter influence on local
 
01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:52.790 align:start position:0%
disincentive to voter influence on local
government

01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:57:55.189 --> 01:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
when I realized the futility of
 
01:57:57.770 --> 01:57:57.780 align:start position:0%
affecting change in my school district I
 
01:58:00.530 --> 01:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
stopped all my involvement in advocacy
 
01:58:04.010 --> 01:58:04.020 align:start position:0%
and I now just pay my taxes in the
 
01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
current environment institutions win and
 
01:58:09.290 --> 01:58:09.300 align:start position:0%
democracy loses
 
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
I would prefer legislation that
 
01:58:14.390 --> 01:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
disallows any amendments to Citizens
 
01:58:16.609 --> 01:58:16.619 align:start position:0%
petition warrant articles
 
01:58:21.290 --> 01:58:21.300 align:start position:0%
nonetheless I heartily endorse HP 67 as
 
01:58:23.930 --> 01:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
an excellent compromise that will allow
 
01:58:26.629 --> 01:58:26.639 align:start position:0%
voters the choice to support either the
 
01:58:29.149 --> 01:58:29.159 align:start position:0%
original or the amended petition warrant
 
01:58:31.609 --> 01:58:31.619 align:start position:0%
article I respectfully urge this
 
01:58:33.950 --> 01:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
committee to support this bill and to
 
01:58:37.729 --> 01:58:37.739 align:start position:0%
recommend hb67 as ought to pass
 
01:58:43.089 --> 01:58:43.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:46.070 --> 01:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
can you stay to take a question
 
01:58:47.870 --> 01:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
yes certainly
 
01:58:54.229 --> 01:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:57.290 --> 01:58:57.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I do have a question
 
01:58:57.300 --> 01:58:58.850 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I do have a question
um

01:58:58.850 --> 01:58:58.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:02.629 --> 01:59:02.639 align:start position:0%
my understanding is and sb2 was passed
 
01:59:04.910 --> 01:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
before my tenure in the legislature even
 
01:59:07.490 --> 01:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
though I'm old it's been around for a
 
01:59:09.770 --> 01:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
while and the reason that it was favored
 
01:59:12.410 --> 01:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
by communities I understand is because
 
01:59:15.290 --> 01:59:15.300 align:start position:0%
they felt under the town meeting the old
 
01:59:16.430 --> 01:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
town meeting
 
01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:17.330 align:start position:0%
town meeting
um

01:59:17.330 --> 01:59:17.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:17.340 --> 01:59:19.030 align:start position:0%
um
Provisions

01:59:19.030 --> 01:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
Provisions
 
01:59:22.490 --> 01:59:22.500 align:start position:0%
not everybody was able to vote on the
 
01:59:24.290 --> 01:59:24.300 align:start position:0%
budget to get to the meeting to vote on
 
01:59:26.750 --> 01:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
the budget and by establishing an sb2
 
01:59:30.290 --> 01:59:30.300 align:start position:0%
process this would be brought forth to
 
01:59:32.810 --> 01:59:32.820 align:start position:0%
all the voters and they could all vote
 
01:59:34.430 --> 01:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
in the voting booth for the for the
 
01:59:34.440 --> 01:59:35.810 align:start position:0%
in the voting booth for the for the
budget

01:59:35.810 --> 01:59:35.820 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:59:37.910 --> 01:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
um and in order to do that they set up
 
01:59:40.430 --> 01:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
this deliberative session where Warren
 
01:59:42.589 --> 01:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
articles could be proposed and changed
 
01:59:44.410 --> 01:59:44.420 align:start position:0%
before they were brought to the voters
 
01:59:47.149 --> 01:59:47.159 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like in your school
 
01:59:49.970 --> 01:59:49.980 align:start position:0%
district in my school district as well
 
01:59:52.910 --> 01:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
adopted this sb2 because they felt it
 
01:59:56.089 --> 01:59:56.099 align:start position:0%
was more beneficial to the voters to be
 
01:59:58.550 --> 01:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
able to vote in the voting booth for a
 
01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
budget that was going to change their
 
02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:01.970 align:start position:0%
budget that was going to change their
taxes

02:00:01.970 --> 02:00:01.980 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
02:00:04.250 --> 02:00:04.260 align:start position:0%
possible in your if
 
02:00:07.609 --> 02:00:07.619 align:start position:0%
your District to get
 
02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
and go back to a different method so
 
02:00:12.530 --> 02:00:12.540 align:start position:0%
that this I mean if you have such a long
 
02:00:15.290 --> 02:00:15.300 align:start position:0%
drive to get to Wolfeboro and and that
 
02:00:16.550 --> 02:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
sort of thing it obviously a
 
02:00:19.669 --> 02:00:19.679 align:start position:0%
disadvantage to you have you considered
 
02:00:22.189 --> 02:00:22.199 align:start position:0%
um changing the method that the district
 
02:00:25.550 --> 02:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
uses just curious It's a curious thing
 
02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:31.550 --> 02:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
so I I
 
02:00:34.129 --> 02:00:34.139 align:start position:0%
but can you hear me I can hear you yes
 
02:00:36.970 --> 02:00:36.980 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you um I I I
 
02:00:39.649 --> 02:00:39.659 align:start position:0%
appreciate your suggestion
 
02:00:42.229 --> 02:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
um I
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
given my experience with the school
 
02:00:47.629 --> 02:00:47.639 align:start position:0%
district and the the
 
02:00:47.639 --> 02:00:48.530 align:start position:0%
district and the the
um

02:00:48.530 --> 02:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:48.540 --> 02:00:49.330 align:start position:0%
um
the

02:00:49.330 --> 02:00:49.340 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:00:51.169 --> 02:00:51.179 align:start position:0%
institutional strength that it
 
02:00:53.629 --> 02:00:53.639 align:start position:0%
represents uh
 
02:00:56.209 --> 02:00:56.219 align:start position:0%
and and the the
 
02:00:56.219 --> 02:00:58.370 align:start position:0%
and and the the
incredible

02:00:58.370 --> 02:00:58.380 align:start position:0%
incredible
 
02:01:00.410 --> 02:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
um I I don't
 
02:01:03.649 --> 02:01:03.659 align:start position:0%
as a as a citizen I have absolutely no
 
02:01:06.830 --> 02:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
influence whatsoever frankly and you
 
02:01:10.609 --> 02:01:10.619 align:start position:0%
know that given the the ability for any
 
02:01:10.619 --> 02:01:11.930 align:start position:0%
know that given the the ability for any
change

02:01:11.930 --> 02:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:01:16.129 --> 02:01:16.139 align:start position:0%
with the school board members uh or the
 
02:01:19.189 --> 02:01:19.199 align:start position:0%
that represent allegedly represent the
 
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
communities that are on the school board
 
02:01:26.990 --> 02:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
um who have uh I I don't I don't I think
 
02:01:30.109 --> 02:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
that it's it's not plausible the way
 
02:01:32.930 --> 02:01:32.940 align:start position:0%
that that the current system works to
 
02:01:35.330 --> 02:01:35.340 align:start position:0%
affect any change that is my personal
 
02:01:38.570 --> 02:01:38.580 align:start position:0%
experience I don't have a history of it
 
02:01:41.270 --> 02:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
operating under any other scenario
 
02:01:42.709 --> 02:01:42.719 align:start position:0%
um because when I
 
02:01:45.229 --> 02:01:45.239 align:start position:0%
um for as long as I I've been familiar
 
02:01:47.089 --> 02:01:47.099 align:start position:0%
with the school district it's been sb2
 
02:01:50.050 --> 02:01:50.060 align:start position:0%
so I don't know how it would be possible
 
02:01:54.169 --> 02:01:54.179 align:start position:0%
or to go even go back
 
02:02:03.050 --> 02:02:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:06.290 --> 02:02:06.300 align:start position:0%
okay thank you welcome to uh continue to
 
02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
listen in on the reading but uh next
 
02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to bring up
 
02:02:20.450 --> 02:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:22.370 --> 02:02:22.380 align:start position:0%
uh can you hear me
 
02:02:24.770 --> 02:02:24.780 align:start position:0%
we're right ahead okay thank you Mr
 
02:02:26.450 --> 02:02:26.460 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you committee members
 
02:02:29.030 --> 02:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
Cordell Johnston representing the New
 
02:02:31.189 --> 02:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association and we
 
02:02:32.990 --> 02:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
are opposed to
 
02:02:35.209 --> 02:02:35.219 align:start position:0%
House Bill 67
 
02:02:37.850 --> 02:02:37.860 align:start position:0%
I have sent a letter uh this morning to
 
02:02:39.890 --> 02:02:39.900 align:start position:0%
the committee explaining in more detail
 
02:02:43.550 --> 02:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
our concerns with the bill the basic
 
02:02:45.770 --> 02:02:45.780 align:start position:0%
problem with the bill is that it would
 
02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
introduce into the town meeting process
 
02:02:51.109 --> 02:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
something that is really unheard of in
 
02:02:53.629 --> 02:02:53.639 align:start position:0%
any as far as I know any legislative
 
02:02:58.430 --> 02:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
body anywhere uh that that once a
 
02:03:01.609 --> 02:03:01.619 align:start position:0%
emotion has been amended you would then
 
02:03:05.570 --> 02:03:05.580 align:start position:0%
still vote on the original motion and by
 
02:03:08.990 --> 02:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
analogy if you think about the New
 
02:03:11.450 --> 02:03:11.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire House of Representatives if a
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
bill is filed and then uh there's a
 
02:03:17.089 --> 02:03:17.099 align:start position:0%
motion to amend the bill and and that
 
02:03:18.950 --> 02:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
motion passes
 
02:03:21.109 --> 02:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
the house then votes on the amended bill
 
02:03:23.330 --> 02:03:23.340 align:start position:0%
you would never go back and vote on the
 
02:03:27.530 --> 02:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
original unamended bill that that just
 
02:03:29.870 --> 02:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense
 
02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:30.589 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense
um

02:03:30.589 --> 02:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:34.129 --> 02:03:34.139 align:start position:0%
the the argument here
 
02:03:34.139 --> 02:03:35.450 align:start position:0%
the the argument here
um

02:03:35.450 --> 02:03:35.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:37.669 --> 02:03:37.679 align:start position:0%
uh first of all there's a suggestion
 
02:03:40.669 --> 02:03:40.679 align:start position:0%
that that the process is there's that
 
02:03:42.189 --> 02:03:42.199 align:start position:0%
there's a big difference between
 
02:03:46.070 --> 02:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
traditional Town meetings and sb2 town
 
02:03:49.370 --> 02:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
meetings the only difference is that in
 
02:03:53.629 --> 02:03:53.639 align:start position:0%
sb2 it's a two-step process
 
02:03:58.070 --> 02:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
um under RSA 39 3 it is true that
 
02:04:00.050 --> 02:04:00.060 align:start position:0%
whether it's a traditional meeting town
 
02:04:03.709 --> 02:04:03.719 align:start position:0%
or an sb2 town a petitioned Warren
 
02:04:06.890 --> 02:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
article goes on the warrant without any
 
02:04:06.900 --> 02:04:08.750 align:start position:0%
article goes on the warrant without any
changes

02:04:08.750 --> 02:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
changes
 
02:04:11.149 --> 02:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
and in an sb2 town
 
02:04:14.570 --> 02:04:14.580 align:start position:0%
the the petitioned article as submitted
 
02:04:17.209 --> 02:04:17.219 align:start position:0%
it goes on the warrant and then at the
 
02:04:20.510 --> 02:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
deliberative session it can be amended
 
02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
just as
 
02:04:25.250 --> 02:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
in a traditional town meeting
 
02:04:28.189 --> 02:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
it can be amended at the town meeting
 
02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
so there is no difference there
 
02:04:34.910 --> 02:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
the the complaint that I'm hearing is
 
02:04:36.770 --> 02:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
um the wrong people are showing up and
 
02:04:38.990 --> 02:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
voting at the deliberative session
 
02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:40.250 align:start position:0%
voting at the deliberative session
and

02:04:40.250 --> 02:04:40.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:42.729 --> 02:04:42.739 align:start position:0%
therefore we want the legislature to
 
02:04:46.550 --> 02:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
essentially uh prevent
 
02:04:48.109 --> 02:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
um what happens
 
02:04:50.629 --> 02:04:50.639 align:start position:0%
by a majority vote
 
02:04:54.290 --> 02:04:54.300 align:start position:0%
if the if the petitioners don't want
 
02:04:56.689 --> 02:04:56.699 align:start position:0%
their amendments don't want their
 
02:04:59.209 --> 02:04:59.219 align:start position:0%
article to be amended at the
 
02:05:01.370 --> 02:05:01.380 align:start position:0%
deliberative session they have a way to
 
02:05:04.250 --> 02:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
manage that which is by getting the
 
02:05:07.550 --> 02:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
right people to show up and vote that
 
02:05:11.209 --> 02:05:11.219 align:start position:0%
that is how the Democratic process works
 
02:05:11.219 --> 02:05:12.229 align:start position:0%
that is how the Democratic process works
um

02:05:12.229 --> 02:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
and this seems to be a local problem
 
02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:18.830 align:start position:0%
and this seems to be a local problem
that

02:05:18.830 --> 02:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:05:22.430 --> 02:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
um that uh people are asking the
 
02:05:24.890 --> 02:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
legislature to solve essentially they're
 
02:05:26.750 --> 02:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
not happy with how the process has
 
02:05:28.189 --> 02:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
worked in their town
 
02:05:30.709 --> 02:05:30.719 align:start position:0%
the problem is not the process the
 
02:05:32.450 --> 02:05:32.460 align:start position:0%
problem is
 
02:05:34.310 --> 02:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
um that some people don't like the
 
02:05:36.350 --> 02:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
results and unfortunately that's that's
 
02:05:40.310 --> 02:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:42.410 --> 02:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
um apart from that
 
02:05:45.830 --> 02:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
obviously I think the idea of having two
 
02:05:48.109 --> 02:05:48.119 align:start position:0%
different questions
 
02:05:51.050 --> 02:05:51.060 align:start position:0%
on the same issue on the on the ballot
 
02:05:52.910 --> 02:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
that people ultimately vote on is going
 
02:05:55.189 --> 02:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
to cause significant confusion
 
02:05:57.229 --> 02:05:57.239 align:start position:0%
you're gonna put the original article
 
02:06:00.350 --> 02:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
and then the amended article both on the
 
02:06:02.510 --> 02:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
ballot and ask people to vote to vote on
 
02:06:03.709 --> 02:06:03.719 align:start position:0%
both of them
 
02:06:07.010 --> 02:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
that that is really a formula for for
 
02:06:09.470 --> 02:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
major confusion I've put a couple of
 
02:06:12.530 --> 02:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
examples in my letter to the committee
 
02:06:12.540 --> 02:06:13.189 align:start position:0%
examples in my letter to the committee
um

02:06:13.189 --> 02:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:15.470 --> 02:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
explaining not only how it could lead to
 
02:06:18.050 --> 02:06:18.060 align:start position:0%
confusion but how it could lead to
 
02:06:21.649 --> 02:06:21.659 align:start position:0%
adverse consequences that would be
 
02:06:24.589 --> 02:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
unacceptable to the original petitioners
 
02:06:24.599 --> 02:06:26.030 align:start position:0%
unacceptable to the original petitioners
so

02:06:26.030 --> 02:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:27.709 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:06:27.709 --> 02:06:27.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:31.129 --> 02:06:31.139 align:start position:0%
as I say the problem can be solved by
 
02:06:33.950 --> 02:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
the petitioners getting their people to
 
02:06:37.490 --> 02:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
go to the deliberative session and uh
 
02:06:40.430 --> 02:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
and prevent any amendment to their
 
02:06:40.440 --> 02:06:41.390 align:start position:0%
and prevent any amendment to their
article

02:06:41.390 --> 02:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
article
 
02:06:43.850 --> 02:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
and if they can do that the problem goes
 
02:06:43.860 --> 02:06:44.750 align:start position:0%
and if they can do that the problem goes
away

02:06:44.750 --> 02:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
away
 
02:06:47.450 --> 02:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
I would be happy to answer any questions
 
02:06:51.050 --> 02:06:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:53.510 --> 02:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you we have a hand raised by a
 
02:07:00.830 --> 02:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:02.810 --> 02:07:02.820 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair
 
02:07:05.930 --> 02:07:05.940 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Johnson I have a question about uh
 
02:07:08.209 --> 02:07:08.219 align:start position:0%
uh I seem to remember
 
02:07:11.570 --> 02:07:11.580 align:start position:0%
that uh petition Warren articles well
 
02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
they are amendable
 
02:07:18.470 --> 02:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
they cannot be amended to nullify
 
02:07:20.149 --> 02:07:20.159 align:start position:0%
or uh
 
02:07:23.689 --> 02:07:23.699 align:start position:0%
uh the original intent is
 
02:07:26.089 --> 02:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
I don't remember where that is in the uh
 
02:07:29.750 --> 02:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
the statutes but uh I I seem to remember
 
02:07:32.089 --> 02:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
that is is that correct
 
02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh that is not exactly correct they what
 
02:07:38.030 --> 02:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
the statute says is that they cannot be
 
02:07:41.089 --> 02:07:41.099 align:start position:0%
amended to delete the subject matter
 
02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
though they they can be amended just as
 
02:07:45.830 --> 02:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
any worn article could be amended to
 
02:07:47.629 --> 02:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
change the intent
 
02:07:51.470 --> 02:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
uh for example at my my hometown meeting
 
02:07:53.270 --> 02:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
last year which is a traditional town
 
02:07:53.280 --> 02:07:54.229 align:start position:0%
last year which is a traditional town
meeting

02:07:54.229 --> 02:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
02:07:57.290 --> 02:07:57.300 align:start position:0%
there was an article a petitioned
 
02:08:00.229 --> 02:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
article that says shall the town
 
02:08:03.770 --> 02:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
continue to allow the use of ATVs on
 
02:08:06.290 --> 02:08:06.300 align:start position:0%
class six roads
 
02:08:09.470 --> 02:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
and that was amended or it was attempted
 
02:08:13.910 --> 02:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
to amend it to say shall the town no
 
02:08:17.390 --> 02:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
longer allow ATVs on class six roads
 
02:08:20.570 --> 02:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
completely flipped the intent
 
02:08:23.450 --> 02:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
that amendment is allowed because it
 
02:08:26.089 --> 02:08:26.099 align:start position:0%
doesn't it doesn't eliminate the subject
 
02:08:26.099 --> 02:08:27.189 align:start position:0%
doesn't it doesn't eliminate the subject
matter

02:08:27.189 --> 02:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
matter
 
02:08:30.490 --> 02:08:30.500 align:start position:0%
it keeps the same subject matter
 
02:08:33.229 --> 02:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
but it does change the intent it
 
02:08:37.370 --> 02:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:40.550 --> 02:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
oh all right well uh
 
02:08:43.430 --> 02:08:43.440 align:start position:0%

um interested in maintaining the uh
intent

intent
 
02:08:59.629 --> 02:08:59.639 align:start position:0%
then that's the only question I have
 
02:09:04.669 --> 02:09:04.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:06.169 --> 02:09:06.179 align:start position:0%
from the public
 
02:09:08.570 --> 02:09:08.580 align:start position:0%

I do not see any of the hands raised
 
02:09:20.570 --> 02:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
hands raised in the public Mr chair
 
02:09:22.850 --> 02:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
it was with that being said that I'm
 
02:09:24.950 --> 02:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
going to close the hearing on House Bill

and
 
02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill 132
 
02:09:37.609 --> 02:09:37.619 align:start position:0%
and the sign-in sheets
 
02:09:40.189 --> 02:09:40.199 align:start position:0%

02:09:44.750 --> 02:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
in neutral
 
02:09:47.629 --> 02:09:47.639 align:start position:0%
and I also wanted to add that the
 
02:09:49.669 --> 02:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
representative band wanted to introduce
 
02:09:50.990 --> 02:09:51.000 align:start position:0%

or I'm sorry I didn't did I get that
 
02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:56.510 align:start position:0%
or I'm sorry I didn't did I get that
wrong

02:09:56.510 --> 02:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
02:10:00.770 --> 02:10:00.780 align:start position:0%
yeah I think so I think that uh the

want to speak in favor of the bill
 
02:10:10.370 --> 02:10:10.380 align:start position:0%

for the record my name is representative
 
02:10:38.030 --> 02:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
Josh okella from Rockingham uh 33 from
 
02:10:41.629 --> 02:10:41.639 align:start position:0%
Fremont Danville and Brentwood
 
02:10:44.830 --> 02:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
I'm here introducing HP
 
02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
132 relative
 
02:10:50.229 --> 02:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
to the acreage requirements for
 
02:10:53.030 --> 02:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
single-family housing
 
02:10:56.990 --> 02:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
and uh to give a little bit of history
 
02:10:59.629 --> 02:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
on this I
 
02:11:04.430 --> 02:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
work or I volunteer as on uh Zoning
 
02:11:08.030 --> 02:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
Board of adjustment in my town and I
 
02:11:14.209 --> 02:11:14.219 align:start position:0%
live on uh property that is less than a
 
02:11:17.930 --> 02:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
quarter acre in a town that now requires
 
02:11:19.790 --> 02:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
a two acre
 
02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:21.169 align:start position:0%
a two acre
uh

02:11:21.169 --> 02:11:21.179 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:11:25.430 --> 02:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
minimum lot size for residential housing
 
02:11:30.950 --> 02:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
and also I have a lot of concern with
 
02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:31.550 align:start position:0%
and also I have a lot of concern with
um

02:11:31.550 --> 02:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:34.970 --> 02:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
the cost of housing in New Hampshire
 
02:11:34.980 --> 02:11:37.209 align:start position:0%
the cost of housing in New Hampshire
and

02:11:37.209 --> 02:11:37.219 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:11:42.169 --> 02:11:42.179 align:start position:0%
I think that one of the significant
 
02:11:46.010 --> 02:11:46.020 align:start position:0%
um reasons for that cost is
 
02:11:49.490 --> 02:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
because of some regulations that
 
02:11:53.990 --> 02:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:54.970 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:11:54.970 --> 02:11:54.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:58.070 --> 02:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
buildings are in large lots to be
 
02:12:02.810 --> 02:12:02.820 align:start position:0%
utilized and that my goal is essentially
 
02:12:07.850 --> 02:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
to to create the opportunity for smaller
 
02:12:10.970 --> 02:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
um lots and and even smaller houses
 
02:12:13.850 --> 02:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
where people could be able to afford
 
02:12:15.589 --> 02:12:15.599 align:start position:0%
them on
 
02:12:19.310 --> 02:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
just normal normal wages my my home I
 
02:12:20.930 --> 02:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
bought for
 
02:12:20.940 --> 02:12:23.750 align:start position:0%
bought for
um

02:12:23.750 --> 02:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:26.930 --> 02:12:26.940 align:start position:0%
for an amount that you know we
 
02:12:29.629 --> 02:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
would would mean that you would have a
 
02:12:32.089 --> 02:12:32.099 align:start position:0%
mortgage of less than uh you know a
 
02:12:34.490 --> 02:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a month and that is
 
02:12:37.149 --> 02:12:37.159 align:start position:0%
something that I think is relative
 
02:12:40.850 --> 02:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
relatively rare because of the
 
02:12:44.689 --> 02:12:44.699 align:start position:0%
um so many lot sizes are so large that
 
02:12:48.050 --> 02:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
the the cost of the land and the cost of
 
02:12:48.060 --> 02:12:49.069 align:start position:0%
the the cost of the land and the cost of
that

02:12:49.069 --> 02:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:12:49.079 --> 02:12:50.390 align:start position:0%
that
um house

02:12:50.390 --> 02:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
um house
 
02:12:55.010 --> 02:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
on that land brings the the mortgages of
 
02:12:57.770 --> 02:12:57.780 align:start position:0%
and the cost of ownership outside of the
 
02:13:00.770 --> 02:13:00.780 align:start position:0%
reach of a lot of people
 
02:13:02.750 --> 02:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
and so that's why I think a lot of
 
02:13:04.270 --> 02:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
people are you know
 
02:13:06.709 --> 02:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
especially younger people are finding it
 
02:13:11.209 --> 02:13:11.219 align:start position:0%
hard to get out of and and start on
 
02:13:13.850 --> 02:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
their own uh living living with their
 
02:13:16.669 --> 02:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
their family for longer and longer
 
02:13:20.089 --> 02:13:20.099 align:start position:0%
um trying to save up to be able to uh
 
02:13:21.770 --> 02:13:21.780 align:start position:0%
live on their own
 
02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:13:27.050 --> 02:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
one of the ways that I want uh
 
02:13:29.450 --> 02:13:29.460 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why I believe that we
 
02:13:32.870 --> 02:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
are moving towards one and two acre lot
 
02:13:36.950 --> 02:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
size requirements in towns is especially
 
02:13:40.010 --> 02:13:40.020 align:start position:0%
in in rural towns is
 
02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
to not over tax the resources
 
02:13:46.189 --> 02:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
in the ground
 
02:13:49.609 --> 02:13:49.619 align:start position:0%
and so there's a lot of concern of you
 
02:13:52.069 --> 02:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
know over
 
02:13:52.079 --> 02:13:53.510 align:start position:0%
know over
um

02:13:53.510 --> 02:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:57.109 --> 02:13:57.119 align:start position:0%
over development making it so aquifers
 
02:14:00.950 --> 02:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
don't have the resources to to provide
 
02:14:03.050 --> 02:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
water for all of the people in that area
 
02:14:07.010 --> 02:14:07.020 align:start position:0%
or too many leech Fields will
 
02:14:07.020 --> 02:14:09.050 align:start position:0%
or too many leech Fields will
um

02:14:09.050 --> 02:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:10.850 --> 02:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
you know there's a lot of a lot of
 
02:14:13.189 --> 02:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
requirements for leech fields to have a
 
02:14:15.290 --> 02:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
decent amount of space and land to be
 
02:14:20.990 --> 02:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:24.169 --> 02:14:24.179 align:start position:0%
the liquid that's that's um
 
02:14:27.770 --> 02:14:27.780 align:start position:0%
put out by those those leech fields
 
02:14:31.069 --> 02:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
so the original intent was to allow and
 
02:14:34.250 --> 02:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
actually encourage uh
 
02:14:38.209 --> 02:14:38.219 align:start position:0%
people to not utilize these
 
02:14:42.410 --> 02:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
the ground resources in in these areas
 
02:14:46.970 --> 02:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
and to maybe uh allow people to
 
02:14:49.669 --> 02:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
build smaller homes and take advantage
 
02:14:49.679 --> 02:14:51.709 align:start position:0%
build smaller homes and take advantage
of

02:14:51.709 --> 02:14:51.719 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:14:54.770 --> 02:14:54.780 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to not utilize the
 
02:14:54.780 --> 02:14:55.569 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to not utilize the
ground

02:14:55.569 --> 02:14:55.579 align:start position:0%
ground
 
02:14:59.390 --> 02:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
and as their you know Waste Disposal
 
02:14:59.400 --> 02:14:59.700 align:start position:0%
and as their you know Waste Disposal
system

02:14:59.700 --> 02:14:59.710 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:14:59.710 --> 02:15:01.010 align:start position:0%
system
[Music]

02:15:01.010 --> 02:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:15:02.689 --> 02:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
in their area
 
02:15:04.729 --> 02:15:04.739 align:start position:0%
this would not
 
02:15:06.830 --> 02:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
um this would allow for people to you
 
02:15:09.229 --> 02:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
know uh have smaller
 
02:15:11.629 --> 02:15:11.639 align:start position:0%
lots and maybe have a homeowners
 
02:15:14.390 --> 02:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
association or town water
 
02:15:18.169 --> 02:15:18.179 align:start position:0%
as and and Sewer as their method of
 
02:15:20.030 --> 02:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
servicing those
 
02:15:23.149 --> 02:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
lots and
 
02:15:27.069 --> 02:15:27.079 align:start position:0%
the original goal was to also allow for
 
02:15:29.270 --> 02:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
alternative methods like rain water
 
02:15:32.030 --> 02:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
collection and great water systems and
 
02:15:36.109 --> 02:15:36.119 align:start position:0%
stuff like that and in my discussions
 
02:15:40.129 --> 02:15:40.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:41.990 --> 02:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
with the Department
 
02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:43.729 align:start position:0%
with the Department
uh

02:15:43.729 --> 02:15:43.739 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:15:46.930 --> 02:15:46.940 align:start position:0%
early earlier today you've seen an email
 
02:15:49.010 --> 02:15:49.020 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
02:15:53.689 --> 02:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
um changing this language and that would
 
02:15:56.390 --> 02:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
essentially eliminate the
 
02:16:00.770 --> 02:16:00.780 align:start position:0%
the other methods of disposal
 
02:16:00.780 --> 02:16:02.569 align:start position:0%
the other methods of disposal
and

02:16:02.569 --> 02:16:02.579 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
um I talked with them about this and I'm
 
02:16:07.490 --> 02:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
actually in agreement that you know it
 
02:16:10.010 --> 02:16:10.020 align:start position:0%
kind of opens up a can of worms that
 
02:16:13.250 --> 02:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
that we don't really need to uh discuss
 
02:16:17.450 --> 02:16:17.460 align:start position:0%
and so an amendment has been drafted
 
02:16:17.460 --> 02:16:18.290 align:start position:0%
and so an amendment has been drafted
um

02:16:18.290 --> 02:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:20.990 --> 02:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
to accept their their recommended
 
02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.050 align:start position:0%
to accept their their recommended
language

02:16:23.050 --> 02:16:23.060 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:16:28.430 --> 02:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
uh and I hope that uh
 
02:16:32.030 --> 02:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
the committee will will support the idea
 
02:16:32.040 --> 02:16:33.110 align:start position:0%
the committee will will support the idea
that

02:16:33.110 --> 02:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:16:36.230 --> 02:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
you know if the if these properties are
 
02:16:36.240 --> 02:16:37.070 align:start position:0%
you know if the if these properties are
not

02:16:37.070 --> 02:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:16:40.610 --> 02:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
utilizing the ground in
 
02:16:43.450 --> 02:16:43.460 align:start position:0%
such a way that we should be encouraging
 
02:16:47.270 --> 02:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
that uh not utilizing the ground as
 
02:16:49.429 --> 02:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
their Waste Disposal Systems and have it
 
02:16:51.110 --> 02:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
treated in such a way that we have more
 
02:16:54.469 --> 02:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
control of it in an off-site facility
 
02:16:57.950 --> 02:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
you know less room for
 
02:17:00.290 --> 02:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
um you know failure
 
02:17:04.009 --> 02:17:04.019 align:start position:0%
it's easier to regulate those and
 
02:17:04.019 --> 02:17:05.030 align:start position:0%
it's easier to regulate those and
um

02:17:05.030 --> 02:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:07.009 --> 02:17:07.019 align:start position:0%
manage them
 
02:17:09.469 --> 02:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
and so I hope that the the committee
 
02:17:11.089 --> 02:17:11.099 align:start position:0%
will be
 
02:17:14.450 --> 02:17:14.460 align:start position:0%
uh willing to support this this
 
02:17:16.849 --> 02:17:16.859 align:start position:0%
legislation and I'm happy to
 
02:17:19.450 --> 02:17:19.460 align:start position:0%
um take any questions thank you
 
02:17:26.389 --> 02:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:28.429 --> 02:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
Kevin yeah
 
02:17:31.370 --> 02:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry uh representative Guthrie
 
02:17:33.709 --> 02:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for checking my
 
02:17:35.870 --> 02:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for bringing the
 
02:17:40.730 --> 02:17:40.740 align:start position:0%
issue uh before the committee uh my only
 
02:17:42.290 --> 02:17:42.300 align:start position:0%
question would be
 
02:17:46.429 --> 02:17:46.439 align:start position:0%
uh shouldn't this issue be before the
 
02:17:50.150 --> 02:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
individual planning board instead of uh
 
02:17:53.690 --> 02:17:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:55.730 --> 02:17:55.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:17:58.790 --> 02:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
I think uh that
 
02:18:01.549 --> 02:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
it could be handled by the by the towns
 
02:18:03.070 --> 02:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
but I think that
 
02:18:06.169 --> 02:18:06.179 align:start position:0%
it's important that that the um
 
02:18:09.349 --> 02:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
legislature start recognizing that there
 
02:18:09.359 --> 02:18:10.429 align:start position:0%
legislature start recognizing that there
are

02:18:10.429 --> 02:18:10.439 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:18:14.509 --> 02:18:14.519 align:start position:0%
limits to what towns should be able to
 
02:18:14.519 --> 02:18:16.250 align:start position:0%
limits to what towns should be able to
require

02:18:16.250 --> 02:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
require
 
02:18:19.610 --> 02:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
uh of people's Pro and limiting of their
 
02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
property rights so I think that you know
 
02:18:25.429 --> 02:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
if they had a five acre or 100 Acre you
 
02:18:28.549 --> 02:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
know requirement those I think are
 
02:18:32.089 --> 02:18:32.099 align:start position:0%
unreasonable and I think that the
 
02:18:34.610 --> 02:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
legislature should start putting some
 
02:18:37.610 --> 02:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
guard rails to say what is and is not
 
02:18:37.620 --> 02:18:38.810 align:start position:0%
guard rails to say what is and is not
reasonable

02:18:38.810 --> 02:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
02:18:40.790 --> 02:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
and I think that
 
02:18:43.870 --> 02:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
for properties where
 
02:18:47.330 --> 02:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
they are not utilizing the ground as
 
02:18:51.770 --> 02:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
their water source and just and uh
 
02:18:54.770 --> 02:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
sewage Disposal system that it is
 
02:18:58.370 --> 02:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
unreasonable for the towns to
 
02:18:58.380 --> 02:19:01.129 align:start position:0%
unreasonable for the towns to
require

02:19:01.129 --> 02:19:01.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:05.330 --> 02:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
unusually large lot sizes and so this is
 
02:19:09.290 --> 02:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
uh not only a property rights issue and
 
02:19:11.810 --> 02:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
saying okay you guys you guys have a
 
02:19:14.450 --> 02:19:14.460 align:start position:0%
reasonable reason to require two acre
 
02:19:16.669 --> 02:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
lots when you're going to be using that
 
02:19:20.030 --> 02:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
as a Waste Disposal system or
 
02:19:23.030 --> 02:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
um for a well but
 
02:19:27.910 --> 02:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
there needs to be guidelines and also to
 
02:19:30.889 --> 02:19:30.899 align:start position:0%
encourage people to
 
02:19:34.790 --> 02:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh not to allow for
 
02:19:38.929 --> 02:19:38.939 align:start position:0%
uh properties to be
 
02:19:41.929 --> 02:19:41.939 align:start position:0%
cheaper and so that it's within the
 
02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:50.450 --> 02:19:50.460 align:start position:0%
it's it's attainable by people with you
 
02:19:53.330 --> 02:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
know modest to moderate incomes and not
 
02:19:55.550 --> 02:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
that home ownership is just for the
 
02:19:59.570 --> 02:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
wealthy because the the um
 
02:20:02.450 --> 02:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
zoning board can do or the planning
 
02:20:05.510 --> 02:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
board or the town can do whatever
 
02:20:07.730 --> 02:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
and put any hurdles that they so choose
 
02:20:09.170 --> 02:20:09.180 align:start position:0%
in the way
 
02:20:13.370 --> 02:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
of of home ownership and Home Building
 
02:20:15.770 --> 02:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
thank you my question representative
 
02:20:19.870 --> 02:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Gibbs representative Melvin
 
02:20:23.090 --> 02:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
in my community will be quiet to have
 
02:20:23.100 --> 02:20:29.950 align:start position:0%
in my community will be quiet to have
1.33

02:20:29.950 --> 02:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:33.190 --> 02:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
now if you do this
 
02:20:40.150 --> 02:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:40.160 --> 02:20:41.950 align:start position:0%
 
1.33

02:20:41.950 --> 02:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
1.33
 
02:20:44.110 --> 02:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
would you be
 
02:20:47.270 --> 02:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
taxing it differently because the tax on
 
02:20:50.050 --> 02:20:50.060 align:start position:0%
I I have a half a day
 
02:20:53.809 --> 02:20:53.819 align:start position:0%
and I my house is on it as well as my
 
02:20:57.410 --> 02:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
business is on it and I'm just 250 000
 
02:21:00.110 --> 02:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
to that handmade
 
02:21:00.120 --> 02:21:02.450 align:start position:0%
to that handmade
reduce

02:21:02.450 --> 02:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
02:21:04.010 --> 02:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
and taxes
 
02:21:06.050 --> 02:21:06.060 align:start position:0%
and how this is going to affect the
 
02:21:08.270 --> 02:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
community and around and have smaller
 
02:21:08.280 --> 02:21:09.230 align:start position:0%
community and around and have smaller
loss

02:21:09.230 --> 02:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
loss
 
02:21:12.670 --> 02:21:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
a commitment
 
02:21:15.120 --> 02:21:19.570 align:start position:0%
a commitment
[Music]

02:21:19.570 --> 02:21:19.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:22.250 --> 02:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I had a hard time hearing the
 
02:21:22.260 --> 02:21:23.270 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I had a hard time hearing the
question

02:21:23.270 --> 02:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:21:26.750 --> 02:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
but if if I was understanding correctly
 
02:21:30.770 --> 02:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
I think that that the person request the
 
02:21:30.780 --> 02:21:32.090 align:start position:0%
I think that that the person request the
questioner

02:21:32.090 --> 02:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
questioner
 
02:21:34.370 --> 02:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
um said a quarter acre but there's a
 
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
half acre in the bill
 
02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:37.490 align:start position:0%
half acre in the bill
and

02:21:37.490 --> 02:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:21:39.590 --> 02:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
um all of the
 
02:21:43.490 --> 02:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
the lots for tax purposes are based on
 
02:21:46.790 --> 02:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
the size of the lot and
 
02:21:46.800 --> 02:21:47.590 align:start position:0%
the size of the lot and
um

02:21:47.590 --> 02:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:50.330 --> 02:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
based on how much of value is there if
 
02:21:52.929 --> 02:21:52.939 align:start position:0%
the the lot are is smaller
 
02:21:57.170 --> 02:21:57.180 align:start position:0%
there will be a smaller amount for that
 
02:21:59.389 --> 02:21:59.399 align:start position:0%
given lot but that could mean also that
 
02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
there are more lots and more houses
 
02:22:05.510 --> 02:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
in uh you know a given acre so instead
 
02:22:08.210 --> 02:22:08.220 align:start position:0%
of having one uh
 
02:22:11.570 --> 02:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
let's say house in on two acres you
 
02:22:14.990 --> 02:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
would have four houses on two acres and
 
02:22:17.210 --> 02:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
so instead of the tax revenue coming
 
02:22:19.670 --> 02:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
from all one person it would be coming
 
02:22:21.710 --> 02:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
from four people
 
02:22:25.550 --> 02:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
or four households it and so it
 
02:22:28.010 --> 02:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily reduce the amount
 
02:22:32.270 --> 02:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
of taxes that a town receives
 
02:22:33.830 --> 02:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
if I'm understanding the question
 
02:22:36.230 --> 02:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
correctly but
 
02:22:39.290 --> 02:22:39.300 align:start position:0%
it was hard to hear so again correctly
 
02:22:43.550 --> 02:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
but uh where you have my I've looked at
 
02:22:46.510 --> 02:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
my property for 52 years
 
02:22:51.950 --> 02:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
since I was there previously now if this
 
02:22:54.710 --> 02:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
was enacted and it was in a town that
 
02:22:54.720 --> 02:22:55.550 align:start position:0%
was enacted and it was in a town that
had

02:22:55.550 --> 02:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
had
 
02:22:58.730 --> 02:22:58.740 align:start position:0%
a pound of water account service and it
 
02:23:01.849 --> 02:23:01.859 align:start position:0%
wants to see I I watched a minimum of
 
02:23:05.349 --> 02:23:05.359 align:start position:0%
135 000 if you have to pay I don't care
 
02:23:12.140 --> 02:23:12.150 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:12.150 --> 02:23:17.270 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:23:17.270 --> 02:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:19.309 --> 02:23:19.319 align:start position:0%
but how did this how would this affect
 
02:23:20.690 --> 02:23:20.700 align:start position:0%
some people
 
02:23:23.330 --> 02:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
I think the towns would be used in some
 
02:23:25.190 --> 02:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
sort of Revenue because they're going to
 
02:23:27.950 --> 02:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
be dropping the water sizes they have to
 
02:23:37.270 --> 02:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:39.290 --> 02:23:39.300 align:start position:0%
representative college did you hear the
 
02:23:39.300 --> 02:23:40.130 align:start position:0%
representative college did you hear the
question

02:23:40.130 --> 02:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:23:42.710 --> 02:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
thank you it's it was hard to hear
 
02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
um the question again sorry for
 
02:23:48.050 --> 02:23:48.060 align:start position:0%
for that um
 
02:23:52.490 --> 02:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
it it sounded like the that in the
 
02:23:56.090 --> 02:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
community that the questioner
 
02:23:58.969 --> 02:23:58.979 align:start position:0%
was talking about there was a flat fee
 
02:24:00.710 --> 02:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
per lot
 
02:24:04.730 --> 02:24:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:07.550 --> 02:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
and so if you had more Lots
 
02:24:09.590 --> 02:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
then you would have more
 
02:24:09.600 --> 02:24:12.410 align:start position:0%
then you would have more
Revenue

02:24:12.410 --> 02:24:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:15.110 --> 02:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
no if you if you have a half an acre a
 
02:24:17.270 --> 02:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
third of an acre or a quarter of an acre
 
02:24:18.950 --> 02:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
you're gonna pay
 
02:24:18.960 --> 02:24:25.010 align:start position:0%
you're gonna pay
1.33

02:24:25.010 --> 02:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:26.990 --> 02:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
did you hear that
 
02:24:29.270 --> 02:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you yes I can hear you much
 
02:24:29.280 --> 02:24:30.050 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you yes I can hear you much
better

02:24:30.050 --> 02:24:30.060 align:start position:0%
better
 
02:24:30.060 --> 02:24:30.770 align:start position:0%
better
um

02:24:30.770 --> 02:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:30.780 --> 02:24:32.210 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:24:32.210 --> 02:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:24:34.969 --> 02:24:34.979 align:start position:0%
so you're saying that if you no matter
 
02:24:37.969 --> 02:24:37.979 align:start position:0%
how how big the lot is that you get a
 
02:24:40.190 --> 02:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
flat fee and so if you have more Lots
 
02:24:42.410 --> 02:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
then you would be collecting more money
 
02:24:42.420 --> 02:24:43.910 align:start position:0%
then you would be collecting more money
no

02:24:43.910 --> 02:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:24:47.389 --> 02:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
no what I am saying is the lot size that
 
02:24:49.670 --> 02:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
I have is a half an acre the
 
02:24:53.170 --> 02:24:53.180 align:start position:0%
requirements in my town for a new lot is
 
02:24:56.870 --> 02:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
1.33 Acres which is an eight uh an acre
 
02:24:59.990 --> 02:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
and a third and they have a minimum tax
 
02:25:04.849 --> 02:25:04.859 align:start position:0%
of 125 000 per house lot
 
02:25:04.859 --> 02:25:05.750 align:start position:0%
of 125 000 per house lot
yeah

02:25:05.750 --> 02:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:25:07.490 --> 02:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
that's the way and then they evaluate
 
02:25:08.570 --> 02:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
the house
 
02:25:11.450 --> 02:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
and that's how they get the tax base
 
02:25:14.150 --> 02:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
for that piece of property so
 
02:25:16.429 --> 02:25:16.439 align:start position:0%
wouldn't wouldn't the municipalities be
 
02:25:21.770 --> 02:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:23.750 --> 02:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:25:28.550 --> 02:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
no they in your example if they have a
 
02:25:30.349 --> 02:25:30.359 align:start position:0%
hundred and twenty five thousand and
 
02:25:31.790 --> 02:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
they have
 
02:25:35.150 --> 02:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh as the minimum amount
 
02:25:37.790 --> 02:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
that is taxable
 
02:25:41.750 --> 02:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
than if you had more a lot smaller than
 
02:25:43.309 --> 02:25:43.319 align:start position:0%
that then they would essentially be
 
02:25:47.210 --> 02:25:47.220 align:start position:0%
getting more Revenue not less Revenue
 
02:25:49.910 --> 02:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
or they would have to change their
 
02:25:53.389 --> 02:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
the way that they set up their taxes
 
02:25:56.570 --> 02:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
that they're under your current
 
02:25:59.510 --> 02:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh example they would be making more
 
02:26:01.730 --> 02:26:01.740 align:start position:0%
money that the town would be making more
 
02:26:04.190 --> 02:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
money not less money so they would have
 
02:26:07.130 --> 02:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
to adjust their their tax structure for
 
02:26:08.690 --> 02:26:08.700 align:start position:0%
them to be making less money and that's
 
02:26:13.309 --> 02:26:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:14.750 --> 02:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:26:14.760 --> 02:26:16.309 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
absolutely

02:26:16.309 --> 02:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
02:26:20.210 --> 02:26:20.220 align:start position:0%
thank you uh we have
 
02:26:23.270 --> 02:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
next we have
 
02:26:25.370 --> 02:26:25.380 align:start position:0%
several hand trays we're going to
 
02:26:31.849 --> 02:26:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:34.490 --> 02:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
why would you want to take the zoning
 
02:26:37.429 --> 02:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
away from the towns and give it to the
 
02:26:37.439 --> 02:26:38.809 align:start position:0%
away from the towns and give it to the
state

02:26:38.809 --> 02:26:38.819 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:26:41.750 --> 02:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
all I see is a big mess
 
02:26:44.389 --> 02:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
and developers coming in instead of
 
02:26:47.030 --> 02:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
putting 30 houses in and putting 60
 
02:26:48.650 --> 02:26:48.660 align:start position:0%
houses in
 
02:26:51.410 --> 02:26:51.420 align:start position:0%
and our school is getting overrun
 
02:26:54.410 --> 02:26:54.420 align:start position:0%
we have more roads to plow
 
02:26:56.210 --> 02:26:56.220 align:start position:0%
and the taxes won't make up the
 
02:26:58.130 --> 02:26:58.140 align:start position:0%
difference because you're putting little
 
02:26:59.750 --> 02:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
small houses in
 
02:27:01.910 --> 02:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
you won't collect the taxes that you
 
02:27:04.370 --> 02:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
could with the two-way code every Town's
 
02:27:06.230 --> 02:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
different you know we don't have water
 
02:27:09.950 --> 02:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
and sewer the supply
 
02:27:12.590 --> 02:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
the land that you're talking about
 
02:27:15.710 --> 02:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
not here in Raymond anyway
 
02:27:18.469 --> 02:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
that's my question
 
02:27:20.570 --> 02:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:27:24.710 --> 02:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
you're not taking away zoning
 
02:27:27.530 --> 02:27:27.540 align:start position:0%
uh Power completely away from the town
 
02:27:31.309 --> 02:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
that is not the um
 
02:27:34.429 --> 02:27:34.439 align:start position:0%
the not the the purpose or even the
 
02:27:38.450 --> 02:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
language in this bill this would only
 
02:27:42.290 --> 02:27:42.300 align:start position:0%
set some guidelines for situations where
 
02:27:45.790 --> 02:27:45.800 align:start position:0%
you are providing well uh water sources
 
02:27:49.130 --> 02:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
and or off-site water and off-site
 
02:27:52.309 --> 02:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
septic so in the case that you gave an
 
02:27:54.710 --> 02:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
example that wouldn't this bill would
 
02:27:57.050 --> 02:27:57.060 align:start position:0%
not apply to that because they wouldn't
 
02:28:02.030 --> 02:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:05.870 --> 02:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
and um to address the the issue of
 
02:28:09.410 --> 02:28:09.420 align:start position:0%
taking taking the uh the guidelines and
 
02:28:12.590 --> 02:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
setting up some some guidelines for the
 
02:28:15.889 --> 02:28:15.899 align:start position:0%
towns to say okay you're allowed to set
 
02:28:18.469 --> 02:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
a limit but it can't be less than this
 
02:28:21.170 --> 02:28:21.180 align:start position:0%
that's all we're doing or it can't be
 
02:28:23.090 --> 02:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
greater than this in this specific
 
02:28:26.690 --> 02:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
situation where you have Town water and
 
02:28:28.790 --> 02:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
town sewer or
 
02:28:32.450 --> 02:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
a community Town water and uh Community
 
02:28:35.630 --> 02:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
sewer option you would not be able to
 
02:28:38.090 --> 02:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
acquire greater than a half acre and
 
02:28:40.670 --> 02:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
that actually will if you have smaller
 
02:28:44.450 --> 02:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
houses then it's it's uh
 
02:28:46.309 --> 02:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
harder to have
 
02:28:49.190 --> 02:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
large families and et cetera et cetera
 
02:28:51.710 --> 02:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
so that wouldn't necessarily increase
 
02:28:54.290 --> 02:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
the amount of people in your school
 
02:28:57.050 --> 02:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
system you might be having uh you know
 
02:28:59.870 --> 02:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
just starter homes for people that don't
 
02:29:03.610 --> 02:29:03.620 align:start position:0%
have kids yet or res um Elderly Homes
 
02:29:07.130 --> 02:29:07.140 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of options there that
 
02:29:11.090 --> 02:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily increase uh the
 
02:29:13.610 --> 02:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
burden on the schools and also if you
 
02:29:17.090 --> 02:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
have more dense population then
 
02:29:19.790 --> 02:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
uh there's less roadways that you have
 
02:29:21.710 --> 02:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
to plow because the people are all
 
02:29:23.809 --> 02:29:23.819 align:start position:0%
congregated in one area
 
02:29:26.030 --> 02:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
and so I just
 
02:29:26.040 --> 02:29:26.750 align:start position:0%
and so I just
um

02:29:26.750 --> 02:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:30.410 --> 02:29:30.420 align:start position:0%
I think that uh that this option is a
 
02:29:31.910 --> 02:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
great one that that we should definitely
 
02:29:31.920 --> 02:29:33.050 align:start position:0%
great one that that we should definitely
consider

02:29:33.050 --> 02:29:33.060 align:start position:0%
consider
 
02:29:33.060 --> 02:29:34.150 align:start position:0%
consider
okay

02:29:34.150 --> 02:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:29:36.469 --> 02:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
are you still tell them it's only about
 
02:29:37.849 --> 02:29:37.859 align:start position:0%
what they can do
 
02:29:40.070 --> 02:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
you're telling our town
 
02:29:42.650 --> 02:29:42.660 align:start position:0%
this is the size a lot you can build on
 
02:29:46.190 --> 02:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
this is what the state's saying so all I
 
02:29:48.770 --> 02:29:48.780 align:start position:0%
can see is a bunch of lawyers coming in
 
02:29:50.990 --> 02:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
and saying you've got to run sewer over
 
02:29:54.349 --> 02:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
here I mean we don't have a lot of town
 
02:29:57.230 --> 02:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
water time soon and we I'll tell you the
 
02:29:59.030 --> 02:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
truth we don't have the land
 
02:30:01.849 --> 02:30:01.859 align:start position:0%
you know where that sewered water is to
 
02:30:03.889 --> 02:30:03.899 align:start position:0%
build these small houses
 
02:30:05.510 --> 02:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
and uh I don't think it would be
 
02:30:10.190 --> 02:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:12.590 --> 02:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
well we're not forcing the town to build
 
02:30:16.190 --> 02:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
anything so that's definitely would not
 
02:30:18.590 --> 02:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
be required by this bill
 
02:30:20.929 --> 02:30:20.939 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:30:24.410 --> 02:30:24.420 align:start position:0%
yeah I want to remind folks that in
 
02:30:26.270 --> 02:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
order to help you manage the community I
 
02:30:27.950 --> 02:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
would ask you to have a follow-up and
 
02:30:29.690 --> 02:30:29.700 align:start position:0%
ask information to have the follow-up
 
02:30:32.990 --> 02:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
questions we don't get into a debate
 
02:30:34.969 --> 02:30:34.979 align:start position:0%
during this particular part of the of
 
02:30:39.889 --> 02:30:39.899 align:start position:0%
the hearings so next three questions
 
02:30:42.290 --> 02:30:42.300 align:start position:0%
will come from representative Davis
 
02:30:44.150 --> 02:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative Porter and representative
 
02:30:50.510 --> 02:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:52.370 --> 02:30:52.380 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative
 
02:30:55.490 --> 02:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
yokelo for taking my questions
 
02:30:55.500 --> 02:30:57.950 align:start position:0%
yokelo for taking my questions
um

02:30:57.950 --> 02:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:00.830 --> 02:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
question number one is in the in the
 
02:31:03.230 --> 02:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
wording of this bill
 
02:31:05.690 --> 02:31:05.700 align:start position:0%
why not just say
 
02:31:08.690 --> 02:31:08.700 align:start position:0%
that how housing that uses Municipal
 
02:31:12.230 --> 02:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
Water and Sewer as opposed to
 
02:31:15.410 --> 02:31:15.420 align:start position:0%
using the negative that does not use a
 
02:31:15.420 --> 02:31:16.550 align:start position:0%
using the negative that does not use a
well

02:31:16.550 --> 02:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:31:20.510 --> 02:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
what what can you tell me what the um
 
02:31:24.650 --> 02:31:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:27.170 --> 02:31:27.180 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question my the
 
02:31:30.230 --> 02:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
rationale is to allow for
 
02:31:30.240 --> 02:31:32.150 align:start position:0%
rationale is to allow for
community

02:31:32.150 --> 02:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:31:35.570 --> 02:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
uh well and septic also not just
 
02:31:40.309 --> 02:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities if it was run by an HOA
 
02:31:43.309 --> 02:31:43.319 align:start position:0%
uh where they own some
 
02:31:48.349 --> 02:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
private well and private sewer company
 
02:31:50.750 --> 02:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
and they were attached to that and it
 
02:31:52.490 --> 02:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
would it wouldn't necessarily be
 
02:31:54.429 --> 02:31:54.439 align:start position:0%
required to be
 
02:31:56.750 --> 02:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
provided by the town it could be
 
02:32:00.230 --> 02:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
provided by a private source
 
02:32:03.290 --> 02:32:03.300 align:start position:0%
except that it says that does not use a
 
02:32:05.210 --> 02:32:05.220 align:start position:0%
well it doesn't differentiate between
 
02:32:08.450 --> 02:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
public or privately owned Wells
 
02:32:11.929 --> 02:32:11.939 align:start position:0%
so how would a planning board
 
02:32:13.610 --> 02:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:32:17.090 --> 02:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:17.100 --> 02:32:18.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:32:18.830 --> 02:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:32:23.210 --> 02:32:23.220 align:start position:0%
the the lot would not use a well
 
02:32:27.050 --> 02:32:27.060 align:start position:0%
or septic so it so the placement of the
 
02:32:29.510 --> 02:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
well and septic obviously
 
02:32:32.990 --> 02:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
um even municipalities are
 
02:32:35.990 --> 02:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
getting that water from somewhere
 
02:32:39.290 --> 02:32:39.300 align:start position:0%
and so it would have to
 
02:32:42.290 --> 02:32:42.300 align:start position:0%
it's a differentiation between on-site
 
02:32:46.309 --> 02:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
versus uh off-site servicing is the
 
02:32:48.950 --> 02:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
intent no I do have a follow-up question
 
02:32:51.349 --> 02:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for that answer
 
02:32:53.630 --> 02:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair
 
02:32:55.969 --> 02:32:55.979 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:32:55.979 --> 02:32:58.309 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:32:58.309 --> 02:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:01.610 --> 02:33:01.620 align:start position:0%
at least I did oh yes I do so
 
02:33:05.630 --> 02:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
um as you may know there is no state law
 
02:33:08.690 --> 02:33:08.700 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire governing homeowners
 
02:33:08.700 --> 02:33:10.910 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire governing homeowners
associations

02:33:10.910 --> 02:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
associations
 
02:33:16.910 --> 02:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
so how how would you set up a privately
 
02:33:16.920 --> 02:33:19.969 align:start position:0%
so how how would you set up a privately
owned

02:33:19.969 --> 02:33:19.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:24.110 --> 02:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
system of well or provision of this
 
02:33:26.630 --> 02:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
these utilities
 
02:33:28.550 --> 02:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
under the structures of a homeowners
 
02:33:28.560 --> 02:33:30.110 align:start position:0%
under the structures of a homeowners
association

02:33:30.110 --> 02:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
association
 
02:33:33.170 --> 02:33:33.180 align:start position:0%
for which there is no legislative
 
02:33:33.180 --> 02:33:37.190 align:start position:0%
for which there is no legislative
oversight

02:33:37.190 --> 02:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:38.870 --> 02:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think it
 
02:33:41.510 --> 02:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
would just be a contractual one
 
02:33:41.520 --> 02:33:43.010 align:start position:0%
would just be a contractual one
through

02:33:43.010 --> 02:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:33:44.750 --> 02:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
when the
 
02:33:48.590 --> 02:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
when that development is set up it would
 
02:33:53.330 --> 02:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
be it in the example of a private
 
02:33:56.090 --> 02:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
Servicing Company it would be set up
 
02:33:58.250 --> 02:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
when the
 
02:34:00.530 --> 02:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
the development actually happens that
 
02:34:03.590 --> 02:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
these these you know these people and
 
02:34:06.349 --> 02:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
these homes are going to be uh you know
 
02:34:09.170 --> 02:34:09.180 align:start position:0%
paying to a homeowners association et
 
02:34:11.150 --> 02:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
cetera et cetera for the upkeep of that
 
02:34:11.160 --> 02:34:12.770 align:start position:0%
cetera et cetera for the upkeep of that
and

02:34:12.770 --> 02:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:34:16.130 --> 02:34:16.140 align:start position:0%
um pay for the off-site disposal and and
 
02:34:18.950 --> 02:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
Supply it it would be governed by
 
02:34:22.969 --> 02:34:22.979 align:start position:0%
private contracts not by the government
 
02:34:25.309 --> 02:34:25.319 align:start position:0%
um saying what those contracts should
 
02:34:30.230 --> 02:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
look like in the example of a private
 
02:34:33.110 --> 02:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
homeowners association or whether they
 
02:34:36.110 --> 02:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
should be continued indefinitely whether
 
02:34:38.570 --> 02:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
some board of directors of all an HOA
 
02:34:40.250 --> 02:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
might come in and say we're not going to
 
02:34:41.450 --> 02:34:41.460 align:start position:0%
do this anymore
 
02:34:43.610 --> 02:34:43.620 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to stop them from saying
 
02:34:43.620 --> 02:34:46.010 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to stop them from saying
that

02:34:46.010 --> 02:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:47.750 --> 02:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the thank you for the
 
02:34:50.330 --> 02:34:50.340 align:start position:0%
follow-up it would be required that it
 
02:34:51.830 --> 02:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
would be indefinite because otherwise
 
02:34:54.050 --> 02:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
you would you wouldn't be able to grow
 
02:34:57.590 --> 02:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:00.349 --> 02:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
right so it would have to be Perpetual
 
02:35:02.990 --> 02:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
for as long as this lot size is this
 
02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:04.309 align:start position:0%
for as long as this lot size is this
size

02:35:04.309 --> 02:35:04.319 align:start position:0%
size
 
02:35:07.490 --> 02:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
then unless you merge the Lots
 
02:35:09.410 --> 02:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
then then you would be having a
 
02:35:11.030 --> 02:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
different different deed and different
 
02:35:14.090 --> 02:35:14.100 align:start position:0%
restrictions but
 
02:35:16.849 --> 02:35:16.859 align:start position:0%
you would have to have it to to be
 
02:35:19.849 --> 02:35:19.859 align:start position:0%
granted this specific lot size let's say
 
02:35:22.429 --> 02:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
if you had a a one acre
 
02:35:25.370 --> 02:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
lot requirement normally and you wanted
 
02:35:27.410 --> 02:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
to build this development but it would
 
02:35:28.790 --> 02:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
be half acre
 
02:35:31.070 --> 02:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
uh Lots
 
02:35:34.250 --> 02:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
this role it would you would need to set
 
02:35:37.550 --> 02:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
up a system that guarantees that this
 
02:35:40.730 --> 02:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
these houses will not be used as Wells
 
02:35:43.790 --> 02:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
and and not use on-site water sources
 
02:35:47.389 --> 02:35:47.399 align:start position:0%
and Disposal so it would be need to be
 
02:35:50.090 --> 02:35:50.100 align:start position:0%
Perpetual not just you know for the
 
02:35:52.670 --> 02:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
first year and then they put a well on
 
02:35:56.750 --> 02:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
you know one year later kind of a thing
 
02:35:59.990 --> 02:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay the question will come
 
02:36:01.429 --> 02:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
from representative Porter and then
 
02:36:03.650 --> 02:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman
 
02:36:05.450 --> 02:36:05.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:36:07.730 --> 02:36:07.740 align:start position:0%
representative um for listening so I'm
 
02:36:10.490 --> 02:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
trying to get my head around this your
 
02:36:14.929 --> 02:36:14.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:17.570 --> 02:36:17.580 align:start position:0%
make it so
 
02:36:21.170 --> 02:36:21.180 align:start position:0%
that lot sizes could not be required to
 
02:36:24.050 --> 02:36:24.060 align:start position:0%
be half an egg more than half an acre if
 
02:36:27.590 --> 02:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
the law is serviced by Municipal Water
 
02:36:31.130 --> 02:36:31.140 align:start position:0%
and Sewer or another source of water and
 
02:36:35.330 --> 02:36:35.340 align:start position:0%
sewer which is off-site of the of the
 
02:36:38.150 --> 02:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
housing law is that correct
 
02:36:41.090 --> 02:36:41.100 align:start position:0%
yes okay and again I have a follow-up Mr
 
02:36:44.690 --> 02:36:44.700 align:start position:0%
chair please my understanding I live in
 
02:36:48.349 --> 02:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
the town of Hillsboro I once lived way
 
02:36:50.630 --> 02:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
outside of town on 50 acres I had my own
 
02:36:52.010 --> 02:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
well and Sewer
 
02:36:54.830 --> 02:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
now I live in town on a quarter acre lot
 
02:36:58.190 --> 02:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
with Town Water and Sewer the um area
 
02:37:00.170 --> 02:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
around where I live there's some still
 
02:37:02.570 --> 02:37:02.580 align:start position:0%
open land there but not an awful lot
 
02:37:04.670 --> 02:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
that would be serviced by the town Water
 
02:37:07.730 --> 02:37:07.740 align:start position:0%
and Sewer so under this bill
 
02:37:10.910 --> 02:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
somebody chose to build a house or the
 
02:37:13.190 --> 02:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
town could not say that you have to have
 
02:37:16.389 --> 02:37:16.399 align:start position:0%
more than half an acre to put a house on
 
02:37:19.010 --> 02:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
where the town Water and Sewer is
 
02:37:21.469 --> 02:37:21.479 align:start position:0%
provided but it would not impact the
 
02:37:24.650 --> 02:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
people outside of that
 
02:37:26.929 --> 02:37:26.939 align:start position:0%
area of town Water and Sewer is that
 
02:37:26.939 --> 02:37:28.070 align:start position:0%
area of town Water and Sewer is that
correct

02:37:28.070 --> 02:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:37:31.550 --> 02:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely if if there was no no
 
02:37:31.560 --> 02:37:32.690 align:start position:0%
absolutely if if there was no no
off-site

02:37:32.690 --> 02:37:32.700 align:start position:0%
off-site
 
02:37:35.389 --> 02:37:35.399 align:start position:0%
options then then they could require
 
02:37:38.450 --> 02:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
whatever the zoning or planning board
 
02:37:41.090 --> 02:37:41.100 align:start position:0%
decide yeah
 
02:37:44.030 --> 02:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
follow Mr chair I'm sorry
 
02:37:46.730 --> 02:37:46.740 align:start position:0%
so my understanding of the way things
 
02:37:49.070 --> 02:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
are in towns around the state although I
 
02:37:51.170 --> 02:37:51.180 align:start position:0%
might be wrong on this where there is
 
02:37:54.110 --> 02:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
more Town Water and Sewer provided it's
 
02:37:56.030 --> 02:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
most likely in the already pretty
 
02:37:59.990 --> 02:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
densely populated areas of the town uh
 
02:38:02.270 --> 02:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
rather than in the the boonies where I
 
02:38:03.290 --> 02:38:03.300 align:start position:0%
used to live
 
02:38:06.230 --> 02:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
so I I can see an objection to this bill
 
02:38:08.929 --> 02:38:08.939 align:start position:0%
being that you're going to have the
 
02:38:10.670 --> 02:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
beautiful Farmland is going to be over
 
02:38:13.370 --> 02:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
developed but am I right in assuming
 
02:38:16.610 --> 02:38:16.620 align:start position:0%
this the current situation in towns
 
02:38:18.050 --> 02:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
would most likely that would be
 
02:38:20.929 --> 02:38:20.939 align:start position:0%
unrealistic it would just be developing
 
02:38:22.910 --> 02:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
more into the areas of town that are
 
02:38:25.550 --> 02:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
already developed
 
02:38:28.309 --> 02:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yes I do
 
02:38:34.370 --> 02:38:34.380 align:start position:0%
agree that in the places that have uh
 
02:38:37.190 --> 02:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
are serviced by the sewer and septic are
 
02:38:40.190 --> 02:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
going to be the densely populated parts
 
02:38:43.070 --> 02:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
of town and it's going to encourage that
 
02:38:47.570 --> 02:38:47.580 align:start position:0%
and it won't affect the the places that
 
02:38:50.870 --> 02:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
are open space and not reasonable for
 
02:38:54.349 --> 02:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
you know to to put that uh sewer line
 
02:38:57.590 --> 02:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
out you know 10 acres or whatever for
 
02:38:59.450 --> 02:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
one house kind of a thing so yes it's
 
02:39:02.270 --> 02:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
going to be thank you thank you Mr chair
 
02:39:02.280 --> 02:39:06.710 align:start position:0%
going to be thank you thank you Mr chair
Gilman

02:39:06.710 --> 02:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:09.050 --> 02:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you uh
 
02:39:11.150 --> 02:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
representative yokila for taking my
 
02:39:14.389 --> 02:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
question mine is uh follow-up actually
 
02:39:17.389 --> 02:39:17.399 align:start position:0%
on representative Porter's questions
 
02:39:19.130 --> 02:39:19.140 align:start position:0%
um I understand what you're trying to do
 
02:39:22.490 --> 02:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
to infill Lots make more
 
02:39:26.389 --> 02:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
um uh taxable Lots so it would raise the
 
02:39:28.610 --> 02:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
revenues and lessen everybody's tax base
 
02:39:28.620 --> 02:39:31.190 align:start position:0%
revenues and lessen everybody's tax base
but

02:39:31.190 --> 02:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:39:34.550 --> 02:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
it would also require an extension or
 
02:39:38.210 --> 02:39:38.220 align:start position:0%
additional Water and Sewer services for
 
02:39:40.490 --> 02:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
the new new homes that would be on those
 
02:39:40.500 --> 02:39:41.570 align:start position:0%
the new new homes that would be on those
lots

02:39:41.570 --> 02:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
lots
 
02:39:44.570 --> 02:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
02:39:44.580 --> 02:39:45.290 align:start position:0%
so my question is
um

02:39:45.290 --> 02:39:45.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:47.690 --> 02:39:47.700 align:start position:0%
those are separate funds so yes your
 
02:39:50.330 --> 02:39:50.340 align:start position:0%
taxes will go down but your water and
 
02:39:53.389 --> 02:39:53.399 align:start position:0%
sewer rates may go up
 
02:39:55.849 --> 02:39:55.859 align:start position:0%
and so my my question is that set off
 
02:39:57.889 --> 02:39:57.899 align:start position:0%
you know depending on the town it may
 
02:40:00.790 --> 02:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:03.770 --> 02:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
02:40:09.050 --> 02:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
um so this this bill and and even in
 
02:40:12.910 --> 02:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
uh any town is not required to put
 
02:40:15.770 --> 02:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
the sewer or septic that would be a
 
02:40:15.780 --> 02:40:16.730 align:start position:0%
the sewer or septic that would be a
separate

02:40:16.730 --> 02:40:16.740 align:start position:0%
separate
 
02:40:20.870 --> 02:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh Warren article or a separate proposal
 
02:40:22.670 --> 02:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
by the town to say okay we're going to
 
02:40:24.889 --> 02:40:24.899 align:start position:0%
service this street with Town Water and
 
02:40:24.899 --> 02:40:26.270 align:start position:0%
service this street with Town Water and
Sewer

02:40:26.270 --> 02:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
Sewer
 
02:40:29.210 --> 02:40:29.220 align:start position:0%
um and so you know let's vote on that it
 
02:40:33.410 --> 02:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
wouldn't require any town to say yes to
 
02:40:41.710 --> 02:40:41.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:43.370 --> 02:40:43.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:40:45.650 --> 02:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you all right our next
 
02:40:46.969 --> 02:40:46.979 align:start position:0%

um I wonder if during your research for
 
02:41:01.090 --> 02:41:01.100 align:start position:0%
the bill that you discovered how many
 
02:41:04.130 --> 02:41:04.140 align:start position:0%
municipalities towns cities communities
 
02:41:08.270 --> 02:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
offer a public water service system
 
02:41:10.730 --> 02:41:10.740 align:start position:0%
water and sewer system in the state of
 
02:41:13.070 --> 02:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we have 234 municipalities
 
02:41:17.630 --> 02:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:21.530 --> 02:41:21.540 align:start position:0%

uh sewer and water but I'm happy to to
 
02:41:31.370 --> 02:41:31.380 align:start position:0%

um you bring out a very good point in
 
02:42:16.309 --> 02:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
terms of uh addressing the housing
 
02:42:20.510 --> 02:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
crunch crisis in our communities but
 
02:42:24.770 --> 02:42:24.780 align:start position:0%
also have you considered or looked at
 
02:42:27.469 --> 02:42:27.479 align:start position:0%
um communities that are self-sustaining
 
02:42:31.010 --> 02:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
not in New Hampshire but self-sustaining
 
02:42:36.349 --> 02:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
for infrastructure density and Net Zero
 
02:42:39.770 --> 02:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
communities how would that impact
 
02:42:42.530 --> 02:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
or what kind of impact that would have
 
02:42:52.969 --> 02:42:52.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:55.969 --> 02:42:55.979 align:start position:0%
um I'm not I'm not sure I understand the
 
02:42:58.010 --> 02:42:58.020 align:start position:0%
question but
 
02:42:58.020 --> 02:42:59.150 align:start position:0%
question but
um

02:42:59.150 --> 02:42:59.160 align:start position:0%

I will try thank you thank you for for
 
02:43:07.250 --> 02:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
asking I'm I'm very interested in
 
02:43:10.849 --> 02:43:10.859 align:start position:0%
alternative ways of living so I do I do
 
02:43:10.859 --> 02:43:11.990 align:start position:0%
alternative ways of living so I do I do
follow

02:43:11.990 --> 02:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
follow
 
02:43:16.969 --> 02:43:16.979 align:start position:0%
um as much as I can this uh this topic
 
02:43:16.979 --> 02:43:18.849 align:start position:0%
um as much as I can this uh this topic
and

02:43:18.849 --> 02:43:18.859 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:43:22.250 --> 02:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
I want to encourage the other
 
02:43:25.370 --> 02:43:25.380 align:start position:0%
with you know alternative ways of
 
02:43:28.990 --> 02:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
utilizing land and utilizing resources
 
02:43:32.570 --> 02:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
and I think that
 
02:43:35.510 --> 02:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
that this legislation would help
 
02:43:38.690 --> 02:43:38.700 align:start position:0%
encourage that uh
 
02:43:42.349 --> 02:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
and especially in the time of you know
 
02:43:44.030 --> 02:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
people wanting to use less and less
 
02:43:47.870 --> 02:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
resources that it would encourage that
 
02:43:51.530 --> 02:43:51.540 align:start position:0%
um and and Foster innovation of how that
 
02:43:53.330 --> 02:43:53.340 align:start position:0%
that could be
 
02:43:53.340 --> 02:43:54.250 align:start position:0%
that could be
um

02:43:54.250 --> 02:43:54.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:58.490 --> 02:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
attained in in a small area
 
02:44:00.410 --> 02:44:00.420 align:start position:0%
and I think that it that Innovation is
 
02:44:04.849 --> 02:44:04.859 align:start position:0%
ongoing as we speak and I think that uh
 
02:44:09.830 --> 02:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
it will help help you know communities
 
02:44:13.670 --> 02:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
in a myriad of ways and I would it would
 
02:44:16.130 --> 02:44:16.140 align:start position:0%
be presumptuous of me to to say all the
 
02:44:18.530 --> 02:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
ways in which it could be beneficial
 
02:44:19.910 --> 02:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
02:44:24.050 --> 02:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
next we have representative mattiore
 
02:44:25.730 --> 02:44:25.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:44:27.110 --> 02:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:44:28.849 --> 02:44:28.859 align:start position:0%
does your bill
 
02:44:32.870 --> 02:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
um still provide for the local planning
 
02:44:34.969 --> 02:44:34.979 align:start position:0%
board I I happen to sit on the planning
 
02:44:38.270 --> 02:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
board in my town uh still grant them the
 
02:44:42.110 --> 02:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
authority to set uh setbacks uh
 
02:44:43.730 --> 02:44:43.740 align:start position:0%
vegetative buffers and all the other
 
02:44:47.389 --> 02:44:47.399 align:start position:0%
buffers that that exist on a piece of
 
02:44:51.889 --> 02:44:51.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:54.290 --> 02:44:54.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question absolutely
 
02:44:56.210 --> 02:44:56.220 align:start position:0%
um those those
 
02:44:58.570 --> 02:44:58.580 align:start position:0%
um safeguards are generally
 
02:45:01.870 --> 02:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
accounted for when you're going to be uh
 
02:45:04.610 --> 02:45:04.620 align:start position:0%
setting up these lot size so that there
 
02:45:07.309 --> 02:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
would be a buildable area but obviously
 
02:45:09.530 --> 02:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
when you're going to a small area if
 
02:45:11.870 --> 02:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
you're if you're worried about setbacks
 
02:45:11.880 --> 02:45:13.429 align:start position:0%
you're if you're worried about setbacks
and

02:45:13.429 --> 02:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:45:17.030 --> 02:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
um if you have you know uh
 
02:45:20.450 --> 02:45:20.460 align:start position:0%
water resources on that property that
 
02:45:25.309 --> 02:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
can limit the buildable area and so this
 
02:45:27.849 --> 02:45:27.859 align:start position:0%
bill would not not limit those uh
 
02:45:31.070 --> 02:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
restrictions or the zoning or planning
 
02:45:34.910 --> 02:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
boards uh ability to to place those
 
02:45:37.370 --> 02:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
restrictions and safeguards on the land
 
02:45:41.270 --> 02:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:41.280 --> 02:45:43.429 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:45:43.429 --> 02:45:43.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:45:46.130 --> 02:45:46.140 align:start position:0%
next we have a representative van to
 
02:45:49.790 --> 02:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:51.710 --> 02:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:45:54.290 --> 02:45:54.300 align:start position:0%
letting me speak to this bill uh I'm
 
02:45:55.849 --> 02:45:55.859 align:start position:0%
actually grateful to be the second
 
02:45:58.910 --> 02:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
person because I think there are some
 
02:46:01.370 --> 02:46:01.380 align:start position:0%
things about this bill that I can help
 
02:46:03.830 --> 02:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
clear up uh
 
02:46:07.250 --> 02:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
for example the purpose of this bill is
 
02:46:12.170 --> 02:46:12.180 align:start position:0%
to address two issues one of them is the
 
02:46:14.389 --> 02:46:14.399 align:start position:0%
ability to create a smaller house on a
 
02:46:17.809 --> 02:46:17.819 align:start position:0%
smaller lot in a place that is served by
 
02:46:20.570 --> 02:46:20.580 align:start position:0%
either Municipal Water and Sewer or some
 
02:46:23.450 --> 02:46:23.460 align:start position:0%
kind of District water and sewer and
 
02:46:24.830 --> 02:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
those two things are important because
 
02:46:27.950 --> 02:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
as we know we have Des regulations about
 
02:46:29.410 --> 02:46:29.420 align:start position:0%
lot size
 
02:46:32.330 --> 02:46:32.340 align:start position:0%
for on-site Water and Sewer although I
 
02:46:34.730 --> 02:46:34.740 align:start position:0%
will tell you that on-site Water and
 
02:46:36.889 --> 02:46:36.899 align:start position:0%
Sewer on-site water and septic can be
 
02:46:39.770 --> 02:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
provided safely and effectively on a lot
 
02:46:41.929 --> 02:46:41.939 align:start position:0%
as small as a quarter acre according to
 
02:46:44.510 --> 02:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
02:46:47.389 --> 02:46:47.399 align:start position:0%
so first I'd like to talk about this for
 
02:46:50.750 --> 02:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
why this is good for a town this is good
 
02:46:53.750 --> 02:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
for a town because what it does is
 
02:46:57.050 --> 02:46:57.060 align:start position:0%
encourage smaller Lots with smaller
 
02:46:59.630 --> 02:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
frontages so why does that matter
 
02:47:03.290 --> 02:47:03.300 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about infill which in
 
02:47:05.210 --> 02:47:05.220 align:start position:0%
large part we are because as
 
02:47:07.550 --> 02:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
representative Porter pointed out the
 
02:47:09.410 --> 02:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
primary places that are already served
 
02:47:12.530 --> 02:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
by water and sewer are of course the
 
02:47:16.610 --> 02:47:16.620 align:start position:0%
existing Town centers so in lots of
 
02:47:19.370 --> 02:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
towns even though lots are served by
 
02:47:21.770 --> 02:47:21.780 align:start position:0%
Town Water and Sewer the minimum lot
 
02:47:25.330 --> 02:47:25.340 align:start position:0%
size in some zoning districts is an acre
 
02:47:29.030 --> 02:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
there's no sanitary reason for it to be
 
02:47:32.750 --> 02:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
an acre it's a Vestige I'm sorry to tell
 
02:47:35.710 --> 02:47:35.720 align:start position:0%
you of redlining in exclusionary zoning
 
02:47:38.630 --> 02:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
it makes the Lots unnecessarily
 
02:47:41.809 --> 02:47:41.819 align:start position:0%
expensive and from the point of view of
 
02:47:45.370 --> 02:47:45.380 align:start position:0%
the Town it makes the frontages too long
 
02:47:48.710 --> 02:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
and why does that matter because for
 
02:47:50.330 --> 02:47:50.340 align:start position:0%
every foot
 
02:47:54.830 --> 02:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
of paved Road in a New Hampshire town it
 
02:47:58.010 --> 02:47:58.020 align:start position:0%
costs approximately 4.65 cents per
 
02:47:59.630 --> 02:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
Center Line foot
 
02:48:02.990 --> 02:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
every year for annual maintenance that
 
02:48:05.630 --> 02:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
salt sand plow ditch and mow that's not
 
02:48:08.090 --> 02:48:08.100 align:start position:0%
Paving that's not repaving that might be
 
02:48:10.010 --> 02:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
patching a few potholes
 
02:48:14.929 --> 02:48:14.939 align:start position:0%
so when we have lots which are an acre
 
02:48:16.910 --> 02:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
then that's we'll call it a forty
 
02:48:18.830 --> 02:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
thousand foot lock that's a that's a
 
02:48:23.330 --> 02:48:23.340 align:start position:0%
builder's acre and most of those lots in
 
02:48:25.849 --> 02:48:25.859 align:start position:0%
those districts also require a hundred
 
02:48:28.490 --> 02:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
feet of Frontage or even 150 feet of
 
02:48:31.250 --> 02:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
Frontage so you can do the calculation
 
02:48:34.130 --> 02:48:34.140 align:start position:0%
as fast as I can for every one of those
 
02:48:36.050 --> 02:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
lots that has a hundred foot of Frontage
 
02:48:38.469 --> 02:48:38.479 align:start position:0%
the town is
 
02:48:41.090 --> 02:48:41.100 align:start position:0%
encumbered to
 
02:48:44.630 --> 02:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
spend 465 dollars so if you have a house
 
02:48:46.070 --> 02:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
across the street of course it's half
 
02:48:48.070 --> 02:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
that but that's still
 
02:48:51.889 --> 02:48:51.899 align:start position:0%
230 dollars a year to salt sand plow
 
02:48:56.690 --> 02:48:56.700 align:start position:0%
ditch and mo that foot of that hundred
 
02:48:59.510 --> 02:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
feet so and if you have 150 feet again
 
02:49:02.750 --> 02:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
you can do the math so by allowing
 
02:49:06.349 --> 02:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
smaller Lots on existing streets with
 
02:49:10.010 --> 02:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
water and sewer we reduce
 
02:49:13.309 --> 02:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
the per foot cost per house as it were
 
02:49:18.230 --> 02:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
so for example if I have a lot that is
 
02:49:20.570 --> 02:49:20.580 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's an acre lot and the house
 
02:49:22.790 --> 02:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
is placed on the lot in such a way that
 
02:49:24.950 --> 02:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
I could divide it and maintain the
 
02:49:27.889 --> 02:49:27.899 align:start position:0%
setbacks as noted by uh representative
 
02:49:30.889 --> 02:49:30.899 align:start position:0%
Maggiore so if my house is now worth
 
02:49:33.410 --> 02:49:33.420 align:start position:0%
four hundred thousand dollars and and I
 
02:49:33.420 --> 02:49:34.730 align:start position:0%
four hundred thousand dollars and and I
have

02:49:34.730 --> 02:49:34.740 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:49:36.590 --> 02:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
um a hundred feet of Frontage costing
 
02:49:40.190 --> 02:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
the town 230 dollars a year I can divide
 
02:49:43.610 --> 02:49:43.620 align:start position:0%
that and my house is still worth the
 
02:49:45.950 --> 02:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
same thing it was before I put another
 
02:49:49.250 --> 02:49:49.260 align:start position:0%
house on the lot next door to me the new
 
02:49:53.750 --> 02:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
lot that lot is now paying taxes too and
 
02:49:58.010 --> 02:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
there has there's more taxable house for
 
02:50:00.590 --> 02:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
Road Frontage so that's the really
 
02:50:03.349 --> 02:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
important reason to encourage infill in
 
02:50:05.630 --> 02:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
this way the other thing that this bill
 
02:50:05.640 --> 02:50:06.770 align:start position:0%
this way the other thing that this bill
does

02:50:06.770 --> 02:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
does
 
02:50:09.650 --> 02:50:09.660 align:start position:0%
from the point of view of uh
 
02:50:12.770 --> 02:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is some towns already
 
02:50:14.990 --> 02:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
have a mechanism to do this it's called
 
02:50:16.910 --> 02:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
The Open Space residential development
 
02:50:19.550 --> 02:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
it's allowed under the Innovative land
 
02:50:22.250 --> 02:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
use law which is I think it's 245 but
 
02:50:24.230 --> 02:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure about that
 
02:50:27.110 --> 02:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
so in those open space residential
 
02:50:30.410 --> 02:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
developments you actually can in the
 
02:50:33.469 --> 02:50:33.479 align:start position:0%
rural District reduce your lot size you
 
02:50:36.230 --> 02:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
can't reduce it uh different counts have
 
02:50:37.610 --> 02:50:37.620 align:start position:0%
different rules about how small those
 
02:50:40.550 --> 02:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
lots can be but again
 
02:50:44.330 --> 02:50:44.340 align:start position:0%
if they're served if you had a district
 
02:50:48.170 --> 02:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
a tract of land and you wanted to put a
 
02:50:49.849 --> 02:50:49.859 align:start position:0%
pocket neighborhood or a cluster
 
02:50:52.250 --> 02:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
development on it and you were going to
 
02:50:55.790 --> 02:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
provide District Water and Sewer you
 
02:50:57.469 --> 02:50:57.479 align:start position:0%
could build smaller you could have
 
02:51:00.349 --> 02:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
smaller Lots less Frontage less expense
 
02:51:02.330 --> 02:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
to build the road for those people
 
02:51:05.330 --> 02:51:05.340 align:start position:0%
making those houses cost less
 
02:51:07.790 --> 02:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
which brings me to the other side of the
 
02:51:10.730 --> 02:51:10.740 align:start position:0%
equation so that's the municipal side so
 
02:51:13.610 --> 02:51:13.620 align:start position:0%
on the other side you have the Builder's
 
02:51:13.620 --> 02:51:14.510 align:start position:0%
on the other side you have the Builder's
side

02:51:14.510 --> 02:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
side
 
02:51:18.230 --> 02:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
for a builder the raw land cost is about
 
02:51:21.290 --> 02:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
20 percent of the final sale price of a
 
02:51:24.950 --> 02:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
house so when you require a bigger lot
 
02:51:28.490 --> 02:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
than is necessary for sanitary reasons
 
02:51:31.490 --> 02:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
or you know whatever reasons you have
 
02:51:34.190 --> 02:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
if you require every time you make a lot
 
02:51:37.690 --> 02:51:37.700 align:start position:0%
bigger you make the house more expensive
 
02:51:40.969 --> 02:51:40.979 align:start position:0%
and since you can't
 
02:51:43.370 --> 02:51:43.380 align:start position:0%
if you spend a hundred thousand dollars
 
02:51:46.610 --> 02:51:46.620 align:start position:0%
on a lot you're not gonna put a two
 
02:51:48.530 --> 02:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollar house on that
 
02:51:51.650 --> 02:51:51.660 align:start position:0%
lot because it doesn't pencil it doesn't
 
02:51:53.630 --> 02:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
make sense financially
 
02:51:56.570 --> 02:51:56.580 align:start position:0%
So when you buy a lot that costs a lot
 
02:51:58.130 --> 02:51:58.140 align:start position:0%
of money you have to put an expensive
 
02:52:01.490 --> 02:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
house on it and it's a big house and we
 
02:52:04.010 --> 02:52:04.020 align:start position:0%
know that demographically across the
 
02:52:06.769 --> 02:52:06.779 align:start position:0%
United States only about 20 percent of
 
02:52:09.429 --> 02:52:09.439 align:start position:0%
all households are households that have
 
02:52:11.929 --> 02:52:11.939 align:start position:0%
school-aged children in them
 
02:52:14.510 --> 02:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
so I think the concern that oh my gosh
 
02:52:15.950 --> 02:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to get all these children in
 
02:52:18.469 --> 02:52:18.479 align:start position:0%
our schools if we allow smaller houses
 
02:52:22.070 --> 02:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
and smaller house Lots is Miss is a
 
02:52:23.809 --> 02:52:23.819 align:start position:0%
miscomprehension of what's actually
 
02:52:26.690 --> 02:52:26.700 align:start position:0%
likely to happen we figure
 
02:52:30.650 --> 02:52:30.660 align:start position:0%
um in my business that if you build uh
 
02:52:34.849 --> 02:52:34.859 align:start position:0%
20 20 small houses you might get four
 
02:52:37.550 --> 02:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
kids out of those 20 small houses you're
 
02:52:39.050 --> 02:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
not going to get
 
02:52:41.690 --> 02:52:41.700 align:start position:0%
uh you're not going to get 40 kids you
 
02:52:43.490 --> 02:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
know you're just not that's not how the
 
02:52:46.070 --> 02:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
demographics work anymore and in New
 
02:52:47.929 --> 02:52:47.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as in most places in the
 
02:52:50.630 --> 02:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
United States we have a mismatch between
 
02:52:54.950 --> 02:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
our housing stock and what people want
 
02:52:57.410 --> 02:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
um people want
 
02:52:59.510 --> 02:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
um both people as old as me and people
 
02:53:02.389 --> 02:53:02.399 align:start position:0%
as young as my kids and some of the
 
02:53:04.910 --> 02:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
people in between would like to live
 
02:53:07.309 --> 02:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
within what my daughter refers to as
 
02:53:09.530 --> 02:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
stumble home from the bar distance
 
02:53:12.710 --> 02:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
so that means we need but we're not
 
02:53:15.070 --> 02:53:15.080 align:start position:0%
building any more of that often because
 
02:53:19.010 --> 02:53:19.020 align:start position:0%
our zoning codes make it really hard to
 
02:53:21.769 --> 02:53:21.779 align:start position:0%
do that this is a step
 
02:53:24.230 --> 02:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
it's a little step by the way it's a
 
02:53:27.070 --> 02:53:27.080 align:start position:0%
little step in the direction
 
02:53:32.990 --> 02:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
of making it possible to do infill in an
 
02:53:35.269 --> 02:53:35.279 align:start position:0%
existing town and these are not little
 
02:53:38.870 --> 02:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
lots a half an acre is a big lot and I
 
02:53:41.750 --> 02:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
did a survey in the town I live in
 
02:53:44.030 --> 02:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
um a number of years ago and determined
 
02:53:45.950 --> 02:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
that in the historic area of
 
02:53:49.070 --> 02:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
Peterborough the average lot size was
 
02:53:49.080 --> 02:53:50.450 align:start position:0%
Peterborough the average lot size was
about

02:53:50.450 --> 02:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:53:53.809 --> 02:53:53.819 align:start position:0%
it was about a sixth of an acre
 
02:53:56.269 --> 02:53:56.279 align:start position:0%
um so that's pretty small
 
02:53:56.279 --> 02:53:57.050 align:start position:0%
um so that's pretty small
um

02:53:57.050 --> 02:53:57.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:59.269 --> 02:53:59.279 align:start position:0%
but you know people like Peterborough
 
02:54:01.190 --> 02:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
it's pretty cute
 
02:54:03.590 --> 02:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
um so this is a thing that would allow
 
02:54:05.750 --> 02:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
us to do some infill
 
02:54:08.210 --> 02:54:08.220 align:start position:0%
and it's also a thing that by doing
 
02:54:12.170 --> 02:54:12.180 align:start position:0%
infill we increase the tax base and in
 
02:54:14.870 --> 02:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
the rural District if a developer wanted
 
02:54:17.870 --> 02:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
to do a cluster and spend less on
 
02:54:19.849 --> 02:54:19.859 align:start position:0%
infrastructure therefore making those
 
02:54:22.550 --> 02:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
houses less expensive they could use
 
02:54:24.830 --> 02:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
this to do that I will tell you however
 
02:54:27.950 --> 02:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
that doing uh
 
02:54:31.490 --> 02:54:31.500 align:start position:0%
uh group District Water and Sewer is
 
02:54:33.530 --> 02:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
District sewer is pretty easy to do
 
02:54:36.230 --> 02:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
District water is more complicated so my
 
02:54:39.889 --> 02:54:39.899 align:start position:0%
my sense is and my observation is that
 
02:54:41.929 --> 02:54:41.939 align:start position:0%
it is unlikely that we're going to get a
 
02:54:45.769 --> 02:54:45.779 align:start position:0%
giant bunch of cluster developments
 
02:54:48.830 --> 02:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
in the rural district with District
 
02:54:50.510 --> 02:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
water because it's a much more
 
02:54:53.090 --> 02:54:53.100 align:start position:0%
complicated Affair and having said all
 
02:54:55.670 --> 02:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to take questions
 
02:54:58.150 --> 02:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
thank you and let me uh let me speak
 
02:55:02.030 --> 02:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
about the testimony you deserved
 
02:55:04.250 --> 02:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
facing some frustration are people who
 
02:55:05.750 --> 02:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
are confused about my earlier
 
02:55:05.760 --> 02:55:07.370 align:start position:0%
are confused about my earlier
admonishment

02:55:07.370 --> 02:55:07.380 align:start position:0%
admonishment
 
02:55:09.790 --> 02:55:09.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative van
 
02:55:12.710 --> 02:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
contacted me prior to the meeting and
 
02:55:14.690 --> 02:55:14.700 align:start position:0%
asked if she could have permission to
 
02:55:19.309 --> 02:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
speak uh to offer testimony as a
 
02:55:22.610 --> 02:55:22.620 align:start position:0%
very much like a co-sponsor so that's
 
02:55:24.950 --> 02:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
why if you were thinking earlier about
 
02:55:26.630 --> 02:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
what well is she going to get to a
 
02:55:29.510 --> 02:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
question no she asked for permission to
 
02:55:31.849 --> 02:55:31.859 align:start position:0%
speak like a co-sponsor so that's why
 
02:55:34.370 --> 02:55:34.380 align:start position:0%
you heard her offer testimony in that
 
02:55:37.130 --> 02:55:37.140 align:start position:0%
light so at this point I'll offer it to
 
02:55:38.769 --> 02:55:38.779 align:start position:0%
the committee if you want to ask
 
02:55:40.670 --> 02:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
representative van to have questions
 
02:55:42.429 --> 02:55:42.439 align:start position:0%
about the emergency
 
02:55:45.469 --> 02:55:45.479 align:start position:0%
just getting testimony
 
02:55:45.479 --> 02:55:47.030 align:start position:0%
just getting testimony
okay

02:55:47.030 --> 02:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:55:51.710 --> 02:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:54.650 --> 02:55:54.660 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the informations
 
02:55:57.349 --> 02:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
towards fabulous uh and thank you for
 
02:55:59.690 --> 02:55:59.700 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question is
 
02:56:01.550 --> 02:56:01.560 align:start position:0%
something like the first one I asked
 
02:56:04.790 --> 02:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
prior and that was don't you think or do
 
02:56:08.750 --> 02:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
you think that this kind of uh situation
 
02:56:13.010 --> 02:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
uh it is a zoning problem and there's
 
02:56:17.230 --> 02:56:17.240 align:start position:0%
more uh belongs in a at the local level
 
02:56:19.910 --> 02:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
instead of at the state level
 
02:56:21.830 --> 02:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
I'm actually
 
02:56:25.610 --> 02:56:25.620 align:start position:0%
I have that question because uh in my in
 
02:56:28.849 --> 02:56:28.859 align:start position:0%
my daily life I'm a certified urban
 
02:56:30.830 --> 02:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
planner I'm certified by the American
 
02:56:32.929 --> 02:56:32.939 align:start position:0%
Planning Association and by the Congress
 
02:56:35.090 --> 02:56:35.100 align:start position:0%
for the new urbanism and this is what I
 
02:56:38.330 --> 02:56:38.340 align:start position:0%
think about all the time and what we've
 
02:56:41.090 --> 02:56:41.100 align:start position:0%
seen across the United States is that
 
02:56:44.210 --> 02:56:44.220 align:start position:0%
when we leave decisions like this
 
02:56:47.269 --> 02:56:47.279 align:start position:0%
in the hands of individual neighborhoods
 
02:56:50.210 --> 02:56:50.220 align:start position:0%
and individual jurisdictions there is no
 
02:56:53.150 --> 02:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
incentive to make changes that will
 
02:56:56.090 --> 02:56:56.100 align:start position:0%
allow for more housing why would you
 
02:56:58.910 --> 02:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
because you think well this might be
 
02:57:01.130 --> 02:57:01.140 align:start position:0%
moderately inconvenient for me or maybe
 
02:57:04.490 --> 02:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
I won't like it so why should I do this
 
02:57:07.610 --> 02:57:07.620 align:start position:0%
if the town next door to me is not doing
 
02:57:11.269 --> 02:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
it why should I make my town different
 
02:57:13.490 --> 02:57:13.500 align:start position:0%
um in a way that you know makes me
 
02:57:16.370 --> 02:57:16.380 align:start position:0%
nervous when other towns don't have to
 
02:57:20.330 --> 02:57:20.340 align:start position:0%
so what we have seen is that when
 
02:57:24.170 --> 02:57:24.180 align:start position:0%
particularly about issues like this
 
02:57:27.349 --> 02:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
um it's it's actually better to do it on
 
02:57:29.450 --> 02:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
a bigger space you don't have to do it
 
02:57:31.429 --> 02:57:31.439 align:start position:0%
at the state level in New Hampshire we
 
02:57:33.230 --> 02:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
have to because we're at Dylan's rule
 
02:57:35.630 --> 02:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
state other places have done it on the
 
02:57:38.510 --> 02:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
county level but it turns out that it's
 
02:57:43.309 --> 02:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
more it's fairer more transparent and
 
02:57:46.370 --> 02:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
more accessible if you do it over a
 
02:57:49.490 --> 02:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
bigger area so that's why I advocate for
 
02:57:50.630 --> 02:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
doing it
 
02:57:53.150 --> 02:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
in a bigger area rather than at the
 
02:57:54.290 --> 02:57:54.300 align:start position:0%
local level
 
02:57:56.630 --> 02:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your answer very
 
02:58:01.670 --> 02:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:04.250 --> 02:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
of manduri
 
02:58:05.690 --> 02:58:05.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:58:07.010 --> 02:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
representative van for taking my
 
02:58:10.190 --> 02:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
question if I heard you correctly
 
02:58:12.410 --> 02:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
um one of if I heard you correctly what
 
02:58:14.750 --> 02:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
I heard was that this type of
 
02:58:18.290 --> 02:58:18.300 align:start position:0%
development is not going to drive
 
02:58:20.630 --> 02:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
school-age kids from moving into these
 
02:58:22.130 --> 02:58:22.140 align:start position:0%
kind of communities and going to school
 
02:58:24.170 --> 02:58:24.180 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
02:58:27.349 --> 02:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
who's going to be moving in well
 
02:58:29.450 --> 02:58:29.460 align:start position:0%
according to the demographic of
 
02:58:31.849 --> 02:58:31.859 align:start position:0%
information that's available to all of
 
02:58:34.670 --> 02:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
us right now about 20 percent of all
 
02:58:37.010 --> 02:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
households are households that have
 
02:58:40.130 --> 02:58:40.140 align:start position:0%
school-aged children so it's all the
 
02:58:42.050 --> 02:58:42.060 align:start position:0%
rest of them also maybe some with
 
02:58:43.849 --> 02:58:43.859 align:start position:0%
school-aged children but not by any
 
02:58:46.070 --> 02:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
means all of them some of them are
 
02:58:48.290 --> 02:58:48.300 align:start position:0%
younger people that want to live as I
 
02:58:49.910 --> 02:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
said within stumble home to the bar
 
02:58:52.250 --> 02:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
distance some of them are older people
 
02:58:56.090 --> 02:58:56.100 align:start position:0%
who want to live
 
02:58:59.330 --> 02:58:59.340 align:start position:0%
uh within walking distance of the corner
 
02:59:01.250 --> 02:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
store so that every trip doesn't require
 
02:59:04.490 --> 02:59:04.500 align:start position:0%
a car particularly as they get older and
 
02:59:07.429 --> 02:59:07.439 align:start position:0%
maybe don't drive anymore so there are
 
02:59:10.250 --> 02:59:10.260 align:start position:0%
all of the people that we have are all
 
02:59:11.809 --> 02:59:11.819 align:start position:0%
of the spectrum
 
02:59:14.030 --> 02:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
are Desiring these places and that's
 
02:59:16.490 --> 02:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
actually one of the reasons that housing
 
02:59:18.950 --> 02:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
costs are going up is the thing that
 
02:59:21.769 --> 02:59:21.779 align:start position:0%
more people want we're not building
 
02:59:24.290 --> 02:59:24.300 align:start position:0%
enough of we haven't built enough of it
 
02:59:26.990 --> 02:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
in a long time
 
02:59:31.910 --> 02:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:33.710 --> 02:59:33.720 align:start position:0%
let me let me say that we are
 
02:59:35.990 --> 02:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
significantly behind schedule we will be
 
02:59:40.490 --> 02:59:40.500 align:start position:0%
going to House Bill 154 next
 
02:59:42.469 --> 02:59:42.479 align:start position:0%
uh and then
 
02:59:45.530 --> 02:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
I'll spell 189 so those of you who may
 
02:59:48.889 --> 02:59:48.899 align:start position:0%
be online are a few uh waiting for those
 
02:59:50.809 --> 02:59:50.819 align:start position:0%
bills please be patient we will get to
 
02:59:53.450 --> 02:59:53.460 align:start position:0%
them and we have some more testimony to
 
02:59:56.929 --> 02:59:56.939 align:start position:0%
to here and those that I'm gonna
 
02:59:59.809 --> 02:59:59.819 align:start position:0%
try to highlight your testimony and be
 
03:00:02.150 --> 03:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
as brief as you can without without
 
03:00:03.950 --> 03:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
losing the points that you really need
 
03:00:04.969 --> 03:00:04.979 align:start position:0%
to make
 
03:00:06.950 --> 03:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
so next I'd like to call on
 
03:00:09.889 --> 03:00:09.899 align:start position:0%
Representatives McWilliams who's also a
 
03:00:15.230 --> 03:00:15.240 align:start position:0%

03:01:01.849 --> 03:01:01.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:04.190 --> 03:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman again Cordell
 
03:01:06.590 --> 03:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
Johnston representative mature Municipal
 
03:01:10.010 --> 03:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
Association and we are very much opposed
 
03:01:15.290 --> 03:01:15.300 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 132 uh just to be clear we
 
03:01:17.210 --> 03:01:17.220 align:start position:0%
have nothing against
 
03:01:19.730 --> 03:01:19.740 align:start position:0%
um half acre zoning we think it's a good
 
03:01:23.510 --> 03:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
idea a small lot zoning more dense
 
03:01:27.050 --> 03:01:27.060 align:start position:0%
development is a good idea but towns are
 
03:01:28.570 --> 03:01:28.580 align:start position:0%
not all the same
 
03:01:32.389 --> 03:01:32.399 align:start position:0%
uh towns are towns vary dramatically in
 
03:01:34.550 --> 03:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and that's why we have 200
 
03:01:38.690 --> 03:01:38.700 align:start position:0%
plus zoning ordinances not a single for
 
03:01:40.269 --> 03:01:40.279 align:start position:0%
the entire State
 
03:01:43.130 --> 03:01:43.140 align:start position:0%
we are very concerned Whenever there is
 
03:01:45.170 --> 03:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
an effort to mandate
 
03:01:48.110 --> 03:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
uh zoning requirements I hate to use
 
03:01:52.790 --> 03:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
terms like slippery slope but if uh if
 
03:01:56.330 --> 03:01:56.340 align:start position:0%
today it's lot size limits tomorrow it's
 
03:01:58.490 --> 03:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
youth restrictions and house sizes and
 
03:02:01.070 --> 03:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
and who knows what else
 
03:02:01.080 --> 03:02:02.450 align:start position:0%
and who knows what else
um

03:02:02.450 --> 03:02:02.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:04.010 --> 03:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
there are
 
03:02:04.020 --> 03:02:04.670 align:start position:0%
there are
um

03:02:04.670 --> 03:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:08.210 --> 03:02:08.220 align:start position:0%
there are other efforts on going uh to
 
03:02:10.370 --> 03:02:10.380 align:start position:0%
encourage denser and more affordable
 
03:02:10.380 --> 03:02:12.290 align:start position:0%
encourage denser and more affordable
housing

03:02:12.290 --> 03:02:12.300 align:start position:0%
housing
 
03:02:16.610 --> 03:02:16.620 align:start position:0%
um and uh I think through education and
 
03:02:19.849 --> 03:02:19.859 align:start position:0%
incentives similar to what are in uh I
 
03:02:22.969 --> 03:02:22.979 align:start position:0%
think it's House Bill 586
 
03:02:25.610 --> 03:02:25.620 align:start position:0%
um there's there's a long long way to go
 
03:02:28.010 --> 03:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
uh and New Hampshire is not by any means
 
03:02:30.410 --> 03:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
the only state that has a housing
 
03:02:32.030 --> 03:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
shortage or an affordable housing
 
03:02:32.040 --> 03:02:33.530 align:start position:0%
shortage or an affordable housing
shortage

03:02:33.530 --> 03:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
shortage
 
03:02:33.540 --> 03:02:34.130 align:start position:0%
shortage
um

03:02:34.130 --> 03:02:34.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:37.130 --> 03:02:37.140 align:start position:0%
and and so you know there's no Silver
 
03:02:38.630 --> 03:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
Bullet that's going to solve this
 
03:02:41.269 --> 03:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
problem and I don't think I don't think
 
03:02:45.590 --> 03:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
this is going to do it uh the uh both of
 
03:02:47.330 --> 03:02:47.340 align:start position:0%
the sponsors I think talked about why
 
03:02:50.330 --> 03:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
this is good for towns
 
03:02:54.349 --> 03:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
um and I agree that smaller lock zoning
 
03:02:56.269 --> 03:02:56.279 align:start position:0%
is good for towns but if it's good for
 
03:02:56.279 --> 03:02:57.889 align:start position:0%
is good for towns but if it's good for
towns

03:02:57.889 --> 03:02:57.899 align:start position:0%
towns
 
03:02:57.899 --> 03:02:58.670 align:start position:0%
towns
um

03:02:58.670 --> 03:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:00.889 --> 03:03:00.899 align:start position:0%
the state shouldn't have to require the
 
03:03:02.330 --> 03:03:02.340 align:start position:0%
towns to do it
 
03:03:04.790 --> 03:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh if the towns understand that it's
 
03:03:08.570 --> 03:03:08.580 align:start position:0%
good for them they'll do it on their own
 
03:03:08.580 --> 03:03:09.950 align:start position:0%
good for them they'll do it on their own
um

03:03:09.950 --> 03:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:12.950 --> 03:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
there's a discussion about how
 
03:03:15.469 --> 03:03:15.479 align:start position:0%
um smaller lot zoning will lead to
 
03:03:17.090 --> 03:03:17.100 align:start position:0%
smaller houses
 
03:03:19.429 --> 03:03:19.439 align:start position:0%
that that may or may not be true I think
 
03:03:23.510 --> 03:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
you've probably all seen areas around uh
 
03:03:26.030 --> 03:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
Lake uh Lake Winnipesaukee other lakes
 
03:03:29.690 --> 03:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
in the state and other areas where
 
03:03:29.700 --> 03:03:30.349 align:start position:0%
in the state and other areas where
um

03:03:30.349 --> 03:03:30.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:33.950 --> 03:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
developers are buying small houses on
 
03:03:35.870 --> 03:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
small Lots tearing them down and
 
03:03:35.880 --> 03:03:36.730 align:start position:0%
small Lots tearing them down and
building

03:03:36.730 --> 03:03:36.740 align:start position:0%
building
 
03:03:40.070 --> 03:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
mcmansions that take up pretty much the
 
03:03:45.950 --> 03:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
entire size of the lot so I I think
 
03:03:47.510 --> 03:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
um you should be careful about assuming
 
03:03:49.309 --> 03:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
that this is going to
 
03:03:51.769 --> 03:03:51.779 align:start position:0%
result in a significant change in
 
03:03:54.790 --> 03:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
Behavior but basically our concern is
 
03:03:59.090 --> 03:03:59.100 align:start position:0%
that zoning it is and has always been a
 
03:04:03.010 --> 03:04:03.020 align:start position:0%
man a matter for local control
 
03:04:06.170 --> 03:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
and once we start going down this road
 
03:04:09.469 --> 03:04:09.479 align:start position:0%
it's a question of where we stopped with
 
03:04:13.070 --> 03:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
with State mandates we already have the
 
03:04:15.530 --> 03:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
requirement that towns allow uh
 
03:04:17.690 --> 03:04:17.700 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing we have a requirement
 
03:04:19.570 --> 03:04:19.580 align:start position:0%
that they allow manufactured housing
 
03:04:21.889 --> 03:04:21.899 align:start position:0%
requirement that they allow accessory
 
03:04:23.690 --> 03:04:23.700 align:start position:0%
dwelling units
 
03:04:23.700 --> 03:04:24.530 align:start position:0%
dwelling units
um

03:04:24.530 --> 03:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:28.210 --> 03:04:28.220 align:start position:0%
and none of those have solved the
 
03:04:32.030 --> 03:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
affordable housing issue I doubt very
 
03:04:34.429 --> 03:04:34.439 align:start position:0%
much that one more Statewide mandate
 
03:04:36.969 --> 03:04:36.979 align:start position:0%
will solve it so we
 
03:04:40.370 --> 03:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
believe that this should best be left to
 
03:04:42.469 --> 03:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
the discretion of municipalities to
 
03:04:44.269 --> 03:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
figure it out on their own and do the
 
03:04:45.530 --> 03:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
best that they can
 
03:04:47.570 --> 03:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'd be happy to try to
 
03:04:49.790 --> 03:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
03:04:51.530 --> 03:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
thank you enough questions at this time
 
03:04:53.150 --> 03:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
to thank you for your testimony Mr
 
03:04:54.650 --> 03:04:54.660 align:start position:0%
Johnson I'm going to go to now
 
03:04:59.809 --> 03:04:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:05.809 --> 03:05:05.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:08.750 --> 03:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
yes hi um good afternoon chairman Dolan
 
03:05:10.250 --> 03:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee for the
 
03:05:12.950 --> 03:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
record my name is Philip Trowbridge I'm
 
03:05:14.510 --> 03:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
the manager of the land resource
 
03:05:16.969 --> 03:05:16.979 align:start position:0%
management program at DES representing
 
03:05:19.790 --> 03:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
the commissioner Robert Scott thank you
 
03:05:21.710 --> 03:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to testify on House
 
03:05:24.050 --> 03:05:24.060 align:start position:0%
Bill 132
 
03:05:25.309 --> 03:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
um in the interest of time I'll go very
 
03:05:27.590 --> 03:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
quickly the department has reviewed the
 
03:05:29.809 --> 03:05:29.819 align:start position:0%
bill and takes no position on it with
 
03:05:31.870 --> 03:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
regard to lot sizes
 
03:05:33.889 --> 03:05:33.899 align:start position:0%
however should the committee choose to
 
03:05:36.230 --> 03:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
move forward we've suggested some
 
03:05:38.870 --> 03:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
language uh some suggested edits to the
 
03:05:40.730 --> 03:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
language regarding septic tanks in order
 
03:05:42.370 --> 03:05:42.380 align:start position:0%
to bring it into
 
03:05:45.590 --> 03:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
compliance or to match what's in our
 
03:05:47.710 --> 03:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
regulations and statutes
 
03:05:51.170 --> 03:05:51.180 align:start position:0%
so I believe representative yukela has
 
03:05:52.790 --> 03:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
drafted an amendment to accept our
 
03:05:54.650 --> 03:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
recommended language we had a short
 
03:05:57.590 --> 03:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
conversation with him earlier today
 
03:06:01.070 --> 03:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
so uh briefly you have the letter in
 
03:06:02.450 --> 03:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
front of you
 
03:06:06.650 --> 03:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
um the the language that refers to uh
 
03:06:09.469 --> 03:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
dispensing of liquid from a Blackwater
 
03:06:12.530 --> 03:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
septic tank right into the ground of the
 
03:06:12.540 --> 03:06:13.969 align:start position:0%
septic tank right into the ground of the
lot

03:06:13.969 --> 03:06:13.979 align:start position:0%
lot
 
03:06:16.730 --> 03:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
um does not is not defined in our
 
03:06:19.309 --> 03:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
regulations or our statutes and we've
 
03:06:22.010 --> 03:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
suggested just to use language that says
 
03:06:24.410 --> 03:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
does not use a subsurface sewage system
 
03:06:28.550 --> 03:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
sewage Disposal system which does
 
03:06:31.849 --> 03:06:31.859 align:start position:0%
um so it again we take no position on
 
03:06:31.859 --> 03:06:32.870 align:start position:0%
um so it again we take no position on
the

03:06:32.870 --> 03:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:06:34.790 --> 03:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
um the lot size issue
 
03:06:37.370 --> 03:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
but we would suggest this different
 
03:06:38.929 --> 03:06:38.939 align:start position:0%
language if you move forward with the
 
03:06:38.939 --> 03:06:40.130 align:start position:0%
language if you move forward with the
bill

03:06:40.130 --> 03:06:40.140 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:06:42.950 --> 03:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there any
 
03:06:46.969 --> 03:06:46.979 align:start position:0%
questions for Des or nhma
 
03:06:51.230 --> 03:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
seeing that is do we have uh Mr Firth in
 
03:06:53.630 --> 03:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
queue a member of the public
 
03:07:05.870 --> 03:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:08.630 --> 03:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
hello this is uh doctor there we go
 
03:07:10.010 --> 03:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
03:07:10.020 --> 03:07:11.330 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
yes

03:07:11.330 --> 03:07:11.340 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:07:13.309 --> 03:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your time uh chair
 
03:07:15.230 --> 03:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
Dolan Vice chairpy Monte and members of
 
03:07:16.910 --> 03:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you for inviting me
 
03:07:19.250 --> 03:07:19.260 align:start position:0%
to comment I study land use regulation
 
03:07:21.170 --> 03:07:21.180 align:start position:0%
and housing markets as co-director of
 
03:07:22.910 --> 03:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
the urbanity project the mercatus center
 
03:07:25.490 --> 03:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
at George Mason University uh I study
 
03:07:27.830 --> 03:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
minimum lot sizes especially
 
03:07:29.510 --> 03:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
um you have my my written remarks and
 
03:07:31.670 --> 03:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
I'll try to go through those quickly so
 
03:07:34.309 --> 03:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
as to respect everyone's time
 
03:07:36.110 --> 03:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
um to get a sense of the reach of this
 
03:07:36.120 --> 03:07:36.950 align:start position:0%
um to get a sense of the reach of this
bill

03:07:36.950 --> 03:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:07:39.830 --> 03:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
I audited zoning Water and Sewer maps of
 
03:07:42.230 --> 03:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
six New Hampshire municipalities Dover
 
03:07:44.750 --> 03:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
Exeter Keene Manchester Meredith and
 
03:07:47.570 --> 03:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
Nashua in all six municipalities I found
 
03:07:50.210 --> 03:07:50.220 align:start position:0%
areas that are served by Municipal Water
 
03:07:52.070 --> 03:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
and Sewer but that are zoned for an acre
 
03:07:53.510 --> 03:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
or more
 
03:07:55.190 --> 03:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
however all of those areas were modest
 
03:07:57.950 --> 03:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
in size often consisting of one or two
 
03:08:01.130 --> 03:08:01.140 align:start position:0%
subdivisions and curiously most house
 
03:08:03.170 --> 03:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
Lots in those districts were already a
 
03:08:05.330 --> 03:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
half acre or less
 
03:08:08.030 --> 03:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
so I therefore believe that hb132 would
 
03:08:10.490 --> 03:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
have modest and Scattered effects
 
03:08:12.950 --> 03:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
nevertheless those effects would largely
 
03:08:14.690 --> 03:08:14.700 align:start position:0%
be positive for New Hampshire residents
 
03:08:16.910 --> 03:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
governments and those seeking to for
 
03:08:19.429 --> 03:08:19.439 align:start position:0%
conserve forest and agricultural land
 
03:08:22.010 --> 03:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
I'll give you four quick reasons uh
 
03:08:24.290 --> 03:08:24.300 align:start position:0%
first as uh as has been discussed
 
03:08:26.570 --> 03:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
smaller Lots promote affordability they
 
03:08:28.370 --> 03:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
require less land
 
03:08:30.530 --> 03:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
um and they tend to have smaller homes
 
03:08:32.510 --> 03:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
on them there are exceptions
 
03:08:34.429 --> 03:08:34.439 align:start position:0%
smaller Lots use fewer Municipal
 
03:08:37.070 --> 03:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
resources uh representative van gave a
 
03:08:39.530 --> 03:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
tremendous example of this and uh you
 
03:08:41.990 --> 03:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
know in most utility districts you're
 
03:08:44.750 --> 03:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
billed by the gallon used say rather
 
03:08:48.050 --> 03:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
than the foot of pipe but the foot of
 
03:08:50.630 --> 03:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
pipe still costs to install and maintain
 
03:08:53.570 --> 03:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
and replace at the end of its useful one
 
03:08:55.490 --> 03:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
um when you do infill development using
 
03:08:57.349 --> 03:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
the same water mains
 
03:08:59.690 --> 03:08:59.700 align:start position:0%
typically everyone's taxes and utility
 
03:09:02.990 --> 03:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
rates will fall because there are more
 
03:09:05.030 --> 03:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
users paying for the same amount of
 
03:09:07.010 --> 03:09:07.020 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and then everyone pays
 
03:09:10.730 --> 03:09:10.740 align:start position:0%
for their own gallons kilowatt hours Etc
 
03:09:12.950 --> 03:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh the third reason that smaller lots
 
03:09:14.210 --> 03:09:14.220 align:start position:0%
are good is that they have less impact
 
03:09:16.429 --> 03:09:16.439 align:start position:0%
on the environment they can serve forest
 
03:09:19.190 --> 03:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
and agricultural land by using lesson
 
03:09:21.230 --> 03:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
and finally and I think most importantly
 
03:09:24.170 --> 03:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
lower minimum lot sizes expand private
 
03:09:26.510 --> 03:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
property rights there are legitimate
 
03:09:29.750 --> 03:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
limits on those but in general a just
 
03:09:32.389 --> 03:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
and limited government
 
03:09:34.910 --> 03:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
will come up with a very good and clear
 
03:09:37.849 --> 03:09:37.859 align:start position:0%
reasons to limit private property rights
 
03:09:39.889 --> 03:09:39.899 align:start position:0%
before doing so the default should be to
 
03:09:41.389 --> 03:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
allow people to use their land as they
 
03:09:44.330 --> 03:09:44.340 align:start position:0%
want in this case most of the public
 
03:09:46.849 --> 03:09:46.859 align:start position:0%
interest runs in favor of smaller laws
 
03:09:49.309 --> 03:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
not in favor of larger ones and
 
03:09:51.710 --> 03:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
therefore I don't see this as a case
 
03:09:53.809 --> 03:09:53.819 align:start position:0%
where there's a good reason to limit
 
03:09:55.910 --> 03:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
those private populations
 
03:09:58.190 --> 03:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
finally there's an issue of fairness
 
03:10:00.530 --> 03:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
as I noted most of the lots that would
 
03:10:02.870 --> 03:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
be affected by this bill are already a
 
03:10:04.550 --> 03:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
half acre or small
 
03:10:07.610 --> 03:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
so this bill would extend or write some
 
03:10:09.889 --> 03:10:09.899 align:start position:0%
Property Owners already enjoy the right
 
03:10:11.750 --> 03:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
to have a house on a half acre to
 
03:10:13.730 --> 03:10:13.740 align:start position:0%
neighbors of theirs on similarly
 
03:10:15.769 --> 03:10:15.779 align:start position:0%
situated land
 
03:10:16.849 --> 03:10:16.859 align:start position:0%
um and you know when I speak about
 
03:10:18.530 --> 03:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
deregulation I often get someone
 
03:10:20.990 --> 03:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
objecting that uh changing their
 
03:10:22.370 --> 03:10:22.380 align:start position:0%
neighbor's zoning violates their
 
03:10:23.809 --> 03:10:23.819 align:start position:0%
property rights
 
03:10:25.250 --> 03:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
um I think that's backwards if you want
 
03:10:27.170 --> 03:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
to control your neighbor's property you
 
03:10:28.490 --> 03:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
can buy it and then it's your property
 
03:10:31.070 --> 03:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
right but until then it's theirs
 
03:10:31.080 --> 03:10:31.910 align:start position:0%
right but until then it's theirs
um

03:10:31.910 --> 03:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:33.590 --> 03:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
and uh yeah so I believe New Hampshire
 
03:10:35.030 --> 03:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
Property Owners current and future would
 
03:10:36.650 --> 03:10:36.660 align:start position:0%
benefit from less regulation of minimum
 
03:10:38.870 --> 03:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
lot sizes more young families would be
 
03:10:41.090 --> 03:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
able to start at home future taxes and
 
03:10:43.010 --> 03:10:43.020 align:start position:0%
utility rates would be lower be more
 
03:10:44.990 --> 03:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
woods and farms and property rights will
 
03:10:46.610 --> 03:10:46.620 align:start position:0%
be stronger and fairer thank you for
 
03:10:48.889 --> 03:10:48.899 align:start position:0%
your time everybody happy to answer any
 
03:10:52.250 --> 03:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
questions either now or by email you can

thank you we've got considerable
 
03:10:56.570 --> 03:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
testimony in this bill and it's been
 
03:10:58.610 --> 03:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
very educational so thank you I don't
 
03:11:00.170 --> 03:11:00.180 align:start position:0%
have any questions cued up from the
 
03:11:00.180 --> 03:11:01.130 align:start position:0%
have any questions cued up from the
committee

03:11:01.130 --> 03:11:01.140 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:11:04.250 --> 03:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
so I thank you from those those who have
 
03:11:06.830 --> 03:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
offered testimony and have uh endured
 
03:11:09.590 --> 03:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
the uh the calendar stretch here so uh
 
03:11:10.969 --> 03:11:10.979 align:start position:0%
at this point I'm going to close the
 
03:11:16.670 --> 03:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:18.889 --> 03:11:18.899 align:start position:0%
next we're going to move to
 
03:11:22.849 --> 03:11:22.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:24.910 --> 03:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
which is
 
03:11:28.010 --> 03:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
dealing with Community revitalization to
 
03:11:34.250 --> 03:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:37.130 --> 03:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
and do we have a representative grassy
 
03:11:41.090 --> 03:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:44.210 --> 03:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
yes and there we go
 
03:11:47.750 --> 03:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:47.760 --> 03:11:51.290 align:start position:0%
 
ahead

03:11:51.290 --> 03:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:54.290 --> 03:11:54.300 align:start position:0%
you need to unmute them
 
03:11:58.370 --> 03:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
I have requested that he unmute
 
03:12:01.730 --> 03:12:01.740 align:start position:0%

I'm I'm here as a prime as a co-sponsor
 
03:12:15.469 --> 03:12:15.479 align:start position:0%
of hb154
 
03:12:18.170 --> 03:12:18.180 align:start position:0%
and I just did a little bit of History
 
03:12:20.090 --> 03:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
I was a city councilman here in
 
03:12:21.590 --> 03:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
Rochester New Hampshire
 
03:12:24.230 --> 03:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh for about 25 years served on the
 
03:12:26.150 --> 03:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
planning board here in Rochester for
 
03:12:27.469 --> 03:12:27.479 align:start position:0%
about 12 years
 
03:12:29.750 --> 03:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
also was the town planner in the towns
 
03:12:30.889 --> 03:12:30.899 align:start position:0%
of Alton
 
03:12:34.790 --> 03:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
Raymond and stratum for a total of
 
03:12:37.670 --> 03:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
almost 20 years
 
03:12:37.680 --> 03:12:38.450 align:start position:0%
almost 20 years
um

03:12:38.450 --> 03:12:38.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:41.389 --> 03:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
I I look at this bill as being part of a
 
03:12:41.399 --> 03:12:42.590 align:start position:0%
I I look at this bill as being part of a
toolbox

03:12:42.590 --> 03:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
toolbox
 
03:12:45.050 --> 03:12:45.060 align:start position:0%
that communities can use
 
03:12:47.389 --> 03:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
to develop their communities uh here in
 
03:12:47.399 --> 03:12:48.769 align:start position:0%
to develop their communities uh here in
Rochester

03:12:48.769 --> 03:12:48.779 align:start position:0%
Rochester
 
03:12:52.010 --> 03:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
we have a uh We've we've used these
 
03:12:53.510 --> 03:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
tools in the past
 
03:12:54.950 --> 03:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
particularly when you take a look at
 
03:12:56.809 --> 03:12:56.819 align:start position:0%
community revitalization tax relief
 
03:13:00.170 --> 03:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
incentives we have 97e which this bill
 
03:13:02.510 --> 03:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
address this is and we also have Tif
 
03:13:04.550 --> 03:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
districts which we've used here in the
 
03:13:06.170 --> 03:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
city of Rochester
 
03:13:09.349 --> 03:13:09.359 align:start position:0%
I set in negotiations with a company
 
03:13:11.510 --> 03:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
saffron Aerospace
 
03:13:14.269 --> 03:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
saffron ge when we brought them here to
 
03:13:16.490 --> 03:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
Rochester and we were competing with the
 
03:13:19.010 --> 03:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
state of North Carolina at the time
 
03:13:21.170 --> 03:13:21.180 align:start position:0%
by the utilization of the shift District
 
03:13:24.110 --> 03:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
we were able to win over saffron and
 
03:13:26.330 --> 03:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
bring them to the city of Rochester at
 
03:13:28.070 --> 03:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
the same time we also brought the
 
03:13:29.510 --> 03:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
corporate headquarters for Albany
 
03:13:31.610 --> 03:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
International to the city of Rochester
 
03:13:34.730 --> 03:13:34.740 align:start position:0%
and we have the very successful Ridge
 
03:13:37.130 --> 03:13:37.140 align:start position:0%
commercial District in the northern part
 
03:13:39.290 --> 03:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
of our city this is just one of the
 
03:13:41.269 --> 03:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
tools we used
 
03:13:44.889 --> 03:13:44.899 align:start position:0%
right now we're looking at bringing
 
03:13:47.150 --> 03:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
1979e and utilizing for the downtown
 
03:13:51.170 --> 03:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
Redevelopment of a former theater in the
 
03:13:52.790 --> 03:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
downtown that's been sitting vacant for
 
03:13:55.610 --> 03:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
oh God I would say 30 plus years
 
03:13:58.130 --> 03:13:58.140 align:start position:0%
that no one's in 40 years that no one's
 
03:13:59.690 --> 03:13:59.700 align:start position:0%
been able to do anything with
 
03:14:03.170 --> 03:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
what this bill does what 154 does is it
 
03:14:06.889 --> 03:14:06.899 align:start position:0%
expands the ability to use to use tax
 
03:14:09.050 --> 03:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
financing incentives or tax incentives
 
03:14:11.809 --> 03:14:11.819 align:start position:0%
in the local community for redevelopment
 
03:14:13.309 --> 03:14:13.319 align:start position:0%
of these structures for housing
 
03:14:15.590 --> 03:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
something that downtown districts
 
03:14:17.170 --> 03:14:17.180 align:start position:0%
significantly need
 
03:14:20.030 --> 03:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
it also allows us to
 
03:14:20.040 --> 03:14:20.870 align:start position:0%
it also allows us to
um

03:14:20.870 --> 03:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:22.670 --> 03:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
expand the amount of people the number
 
03:14:24.889 --> 03:14:24.899 align:start position:0%
of people that are eligible
 
03:14:27.889 --> 03:14:27.899 align:start position:0%
these uh for these benefits as well with
 
03:14:30.710 --> 03:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
these these housing units it helps us we
 
03:14:32.809 --> 03:14:32.819 align:start position:0%
did one project the first project we did
 
03:14:34.429 --> 03:14:34.439 align:start position:0%
when I was on the city council here in
 
03:14:35.750 --> 03:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
Rochester I'm not currently a council
 
03:14:38.150 --> 03:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
member but one of the first projects we
 
03:14:40.490 --> 03:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
did was a very unique building right on
 
03:14:42.469 --> 03:14:42.479 align:start position:0%
the edge of our downtown district
 
03:14:45.469 --> 03:14:45.479 align:start position:0%
uh it's basically an old castle it had
 
03:14:47.990 --> 03:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
set vacant for a number of years we're
 
03:14:50.389 --> 03:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
able to provide tax incentives to allow
 
03:14:53.750 --> 03:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
them to redevelop and redevelop it as a
 
03:14:56.570 --> 03:14:56.580 align:start position:0%
restaurant and events center
 
03:14:58.910 --> 03:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh and and unfortunately due to the
 
03:15:00.710 --> 03:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
pandemic it's been a little bit of a
 
03:15:03.050 --> 03:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
struggle recently but prior to that it
 
03:15:06.530 --> 03:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
was a relatively uh successful uh
 
03:15:06.540 --> 03:15:07.790 align:start position:0%
was a relatively uh successful uh
facility

03:15:07.790 --> 03:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
facility
 
03:15:11.030 --> 03:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
this is a tool it's something that is
 
03:15:14.030 --> 03:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
optional it's enabling legislation it's
 
03:15:16.849 --> 03:15:16.859 align:start position:0%
not required of any Community to do that
 
03:15:18.830 --> 03:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
but as someone who has worked at the
 
03:15:22.429 --> 03:15:22.439 align:start position:0%
local level for 25 plus years I find the
 
03:15:25.190 --> 03:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
more tools we have in our box the more
 
03:15:27.230 --> 03:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
competitive we can be we can be when
 
03:15:29.389 --> 03:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
we're attracting out of state
 
03:15:32.210 --> 03:15:32.220 align:start position:0%
the investors in our communities and
 
03:15:33.830 --> 03:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
also the more competitive and the more
 
03:15:35.570 --> 03:15:35.580 align:start position:0%
Innovative we can be when we're dealing
 
03:15:37.969 --> 03:15:37.979 align:start position:0%
with local small businesses who want to
 
03:15:40.790 --> 03:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
do something new and Innovative in our
 
03:15:40.800 --> 03:15:41.809 align:start position:0%
do something new and Innovative in our
communities

03:15:41.809 --> 03:15:41.819 align:start position:0%
communities
 
03:15:44.210 --> 03:15:44.220 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to attempt to answer any
 
03:15:44.220 --> 03:15:45.830 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to attempt to answer any
questions

03:15:45.830 --> 03:15:45.840 align:start position:0%

chair thank you representative gasly for
 
03:17:03.950 --> 03:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:17:08.990 --> 03:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
um does this also include the historic
 
03:17:12.769 --> 03:17:12.779 align:start position:0%
tax credits that is available both
 
03:17:16.910 --> 03:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
Federal as well as very underutilized in
 
03:17:21.370 --> 03:17:21.380 align:start position:0%
our state to revitalize or renovate
 
03:17:26.630 --> 03:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
historic buildings old dilapidated or
 
03:17:29.450 --> 03:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
falling apart buildings in the middle of
 
03:17:33.349 --> 03:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
our main street or in our cities and
 
03:17:33.359 --> 03:17:34.309 align:start position:0%
our main street or in our cities and
towns

03:17:34.309 --> 03:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
towns
 
03:17:36.830 --> 03:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
it's it certainly does and I think that
 
03:17:39.170 --> 03:17:39.180 align:start position:0%
what you're looking at here is that as I
 
03:17:41.510 --> 03:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
said before the more tools we have in
 
03:17:42.469 --> 03:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
our bag
 
03:17:44.630 --> 03:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
to be able to help the revitalization of
 
03:17:46.910 --> 03:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
downtown or to attract
 
03:17:48.469 --> 03:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
people from out of our community to
 
03:17:50.809 --> 03:17:50.819 align:start position:0%
invest in our communities the better it
 
03:17:53.230 --> 03:17:53.240 align:start position:0%
is I've said in these negotiations
 
03:17:56.030 --> 03:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
anytime you can pull you know pull
 
03:17:58.070 --> 03:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
something out of your hat to put onto
 
03:18:00.469 --> 03:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
the table it's a benefit
 
03:18:03.650 --> 03:18:03.660 align:start position:0%
uh it's optional you you use it as a
 
03:18:06.590 --> 03:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
negotiating tool and it works uh I found
 
03:18:07.670 --> 03:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
that they've been we've been very
 
03:18:09.170 --> 03:18:09.180 align:start position:0%
successful particularly here in
 
03:18:10.910 --> 03:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
Rochester and we've got a long long way
 
03:18:14.030 --> 03:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
to go but and and we've we're trying to
 
03:18:17.210 --> 03:18:17.220 align:start position:0%
do more for our downtown districts and
 
03:18:19.550 --> 03:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things and is certainly
 
03:18:22.730 --> 03:18:22.740 align:start position:0%
providing more quality housing in your
 
03:18:25.969 --> 03:18:25.979 align:start position:0%
downtowns uh we've had too much of the
 
03:18:28.910 --> 03:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
apartment structures with the uh studio
 
03:18:31.130 --> 03:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
apartments that that tend to be very run
 
03:18:32.630 --> 03:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
down and this is something which has
 
03:18:35.389 --> 03:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
allowed us to to attract investment to
 
03:18:37.490 --> 03:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
try to rehabilitate and Revitalize some
 
03:18:39.650 --> 03:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
of these downtown buildings
 
03:18:44.090 --> 03:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chair so would this also
 
03:18:47.150 --> 03:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
this gives another tool like the
 
03:18:50.590 --> 03:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
um opportunity Zone historic tax credits
 
03:18:54.530 --> 03:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
and uh historic renovation
 
03:18:59.150 --> 03:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
um uh opportunities so this very well
 
03:19:02.630 --> 03:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
says about it how what is the time frame
 
03:19:04.389 --> 03:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
you're looking at that's the big
 
03:19:08.210 --> 03:19:08.220 align:start position:0%
incentive to bring new investors into
 
03:19:11.030 --> 03:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
our state not the current one that hold
 
03:19:14.450 --> 03:19:14.460 align:start position:0%
on to it but I I will tell you that the
 
03:19:16.429 --> 03:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
work that we did with bringing saffron
 
03:19:18.830 --> 03:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
into the state of New Hampshire uh took
 
03:19:22.250 --> 03:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
us uh more well over a year uh sometimes
 
03:19:24.110 --> 03:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
and I think it was closer to two years
 
03:19:25.790 --> 03:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
that we were in negotiations with them
 
03:19:27.769 --> 03:19:27.779 align:start position:0%
and then there was probably negotiations
 
03:19:29.750 --> 03:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
prior to getting into the city council
 
03:19:32.510 --> 03:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
level uh but I know I sit in the in the
 
03:19:35.330 --> 03:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
room uh which were highly confidential
 
03:19:39.230 --> 03:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
negotiations and we were we were really
 
03:19:42.170 --> 03:19:42.180 align:start position:0%
um being very competitive with the state
 
03:19:43.610 --> 03:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
of North Carolina and their Raleigh
 
03:19:45.889 --> 03:19:45.899 align:start position:0%
Durham area particularly uh that's
 
03:19:47.330 --> 03:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
everyone almost went in that direction
 
03:19:49.250 --> 03:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
because of the technology I mean we work
 
03:19:50.929 --> 03:19:50.939 align:start position:0%
with every partner that we had in the
 
03:19:53.150 --> 03:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and what it was
 
03:19:55.070 --> 03:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
it was the Tiff District because it was
 
03:19:56.990 --> 03:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
structure that needed to be put in place
 
03:19:59.210 --> 03:19:59.220 align:start position:0%
that made it possible to get them for
 
03:20:00.830 --> 03:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
them to get real access as well as to
 
03:20:02.929 --> 03:20:02.939 align:start position:0%
get airport Access through skyhaven
 
03:20:04.490 --> 03:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
airport that brought them to the city of
 
03:20:06.110 --> 03:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
Rochester and that's just an example of
 
03:20:08.510 --> 03:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
one of the tools we had this is another
 
03:20:10.730 --> 03:20:10.740 align:start position:0%
tool with 79 years
 
03:20:13.670 --> 03:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
and purpose and a different reason but
 
03:20:15.950 --> 03:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
it's still something
 
03:20:18.790 --> 03:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
I want to use could be incur
 
03:20:20.690 --> 03:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
makeable for them to use it it's not
 
03:20:22.610 --> 03:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
going to be right for every Community it
 
03:20:24.469 --> 03:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
looks right for us and I would hope that
 
03:20:29.510 --> 03:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:32.510 --> 03:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh we have a question from
 
03:20:35.750 --> 03:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative Clayton
 
03:20:38.570 --> 03:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and um thank
 
03:20:39.830 --> 03:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
you representative grass if you take my
 
03:20:39.840 --> 03:20:41.030 align:start position:0%
you representative grass if you take my
question

03:20:41.030 --> 03:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:20:45.170 --> 03:20:45.180 align:start position:0%
um my question is is there a time limit
 
03:20:47.750 --> 03:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
it once they get this um
 
03:20:51.769 --> 03:20:51.779 align:start position:0%
the the tax credit or incentive is there
 
03:20:54.590 --> 03:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
a time limit that they have to keep the
 
03:20:56.090 --> 03:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
particular percentage of these homes
 
03:20:56.100 --> 03:20:57.410 align:start position:0%
particular percentage of these homes
affordable

03:20:57.410 --> 03:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
affordable
 
03:20:59.150 --> 03:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
um I noticed that it talked about at
 
03:21:00.710 --> 03:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
least 50 percent of units be affordable
 
03:21:02.690 --> 03:21:02.700 align:start position:0%
at least 40 percent of units affordable
 
03:21:04.730 --> 03:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
with low income and so on
 
03:21:06.769 --> 03:21:06.779 align:start position:0%
um does it have to remain that way
 
03:21:10.370 --> 03:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
forever I know in some instances they
 
03:21:12.349 --> 03:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
say they put a five-year moratorium on
 
03:21:13.969 --> 03:21:13.979 align:start position:0%
it or is this um
 
03:21:17.210 --> 03:21:17.220 align:start position:0%
in perpetuity uh no it and unfortunately
 
03:21:19.309 --> 03:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
it's not in perpetuity uh that's
 
03:21:21.230 --> 03:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
something that I've certainly looked at
 
03:21:23.690 --> 03:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
in the past as a town planner uh we had
 
03:21:25.250 --> 03:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
some instances where we wanted to take a
 
03:21:27.590 --> 03:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
look at how long he's in for and a lot
 
03:21:28.849 --> 03:21:28.859 align:start position:0%
of times that's a negotiated agreement
 
03:21:31.550 --> 03:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
you have with developers to how long
 
03:21:33.950 --> 03:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
they will stay in perpetuity uh we
 
03:21:35.150 --> 03:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
certainly need to take a look at
 
03:21:36.830 --> 03:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
something at the state level to see how
 
03:21:39.410 --> 03:21:39.420 align:start position:0%
we're going to do that uh to make them
 
03:21:42.230 --> 03:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
be affordable in perpetuity but as far
 
03:21:43.429 --> 03:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
as I'm aware
 
03:21:45.290 --> 03:21:45.300 align:start position:0%
I may be wrong
 
03:21:47.030 --> 03:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
um I've only been back this will be my
 
03:21:48.710 --> 03:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
third term back in the house I've served
 
03:21:52.130 --> 03:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
eight terms now in the house uh but um I
 
03:21:54.830 --> 03:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
don't think there's any any rsas that
 
03:21:57.530 --> 03:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
require would require a that it be in
 
03:21:58.969 --> 03:21:58.979 align:start position:0%
perpetuity but it's something we should
 
03:22:01.490 --> 03:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
definitely look at
 
03:22:02.929 --> 03:22:02.939 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking my
 
03:22:05.450 --> 03:22:05.460 align:start position:0%
question we appreciate that
 
03:22:09.050 --> 03:22:09.060 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I I apologize for butting in
 
03:22:10.969 --> 03:22:10.979 align:start position:0%
but the prime sponsor for this bill
 
03:22:13.250 --> 03:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
representative Casey Connolly is on the
 
03:22:16.510 --> 03:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
call and he's jumping up and down to uh
 
03:22:19.670 --> 03:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
to speak and I'm wondering if you might
 
03:22:21.889 --> 03:22:21.899 align:start position:0%
want to recognize him yeah
 
03:22:24.410 --> 03:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
representative Conley go right ahead
 
03:22:26.929 --> 03:22:26.939 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chairman committee
 
03:22:28.610 --> 03:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
members and thank you uh representative
 
03:22:32.210 --> 03:22:32.220 align:start position:0%
majority for uh for accurately depicting
 
03:22:33.889 --> 03:22:33.899 align:start position:0%
what's going on here
 
03:22:33.899 --> 03:22:35.570 align:start position:0%
what's going on here
um

03:22:35.570 --> 03:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:37.730 --> 03:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
um yes Casey Conley state representative
 
03:22:38.870 --> 03:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
from Dover
 
03:22:41.630 --> 03:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
um I will try not to repeat what has
 
03:22:44.929 --> 03:22:44.939 align:start position:0%
already been said about HP 154
 
03:22:46.610 --> 03:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
um so as we've heard it would it would
 
03:22:49.730 --> 03:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
broaden the existing statute around
 
03:22:52.190 --> 03:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
Community Development incentives uh
 
03:22:55.429 --> 03:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
under RSA 79e and the goal here is to
 
03:22:56.750 --> 03:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
promote new housing construction
 
03:22:58.670 --> 03:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
particularly affordable housing
 
03:23:00.590 --> 03:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
something we desperately need here in
 
03:23:02.330 --> 03:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:23:04.370 --> 03:23:04.380 align:start position:0%
um for those on committee who don't know
 
03:23:08.389 --> 03:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh the existing 79e statute already let
 
03:23:11.030 --> 03:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
cities and towns offer time limited and
 
03:23:13.490 --> 03:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
targeted property tax incentives
 
03:23:15.290 --> 03:23:15.300 align:start position:0%
uh for development
 
03:23:17.870 --> 03:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
within downtowns within Village centers
 
03:23:19.790 --> 03:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
and as representative
 
03:23:23.570 --> 03:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
um manipuri was discussing four historic
 
03:23:26.030 --> 03:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
Redevelopment that's already within the
 
03:23:26.040 --> 03:23:27.830 align:start position:0%
Redevelopment that's already within the
law

03:23:27.830 --> 03:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:23:29.870 --> 03:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
um so the bill before you does a few
 
03:23:33.110 --> 03:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
things to broaden that uh first um it
 
03:23:34.910 --> 03:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
would let municipalities use these
 
03:23:36.950 --> 03:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
incentives anywhere within their
 
03:23:38.990 --> 03:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
Municipal boundary not just the Village
 
03:23:41.389 --> 03:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
Center who are tied to a historic
 
03:23:41.399 --> 03:23:43.010 align:start position:0%
Center who are tied to a historic
Redevelopment

03:23:43.010 --> 03:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
Redevelopment
 
03:23:44.210 --> 03:23:44.220 align:start position:0%
um and the second thing is it would
 
03:23:46.309 --> 03:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
extend the maximum term of the tax
 
03:23:49.370 --> 03:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
incentive to 10 years
 
03:23:51.290 --> 03:23:51.300 align:start position:0%
um up from the current nine which is
 
03:23:53.809 --> 03:23:53.819 align:start position:0%
sort of the Max and that's with some
 
03:23:57.349 --> 03:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
um some escalating uh years for doing
 
03:23:59.170 --> 03:23:59.180 align:start position:0%
certain things but the the current
 
03:24:03.710 --> 03:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
Statute in general is five-year limit
 
03:24:03.720 --> 03:24:05.090 align:start position:0%
Statute in general is five-year limit
um

03:24:05.090 --> 03:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:07.670 --> 03:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
and then the way you would get these uh
 
03:24:10.210 --> 03:24:10.220 align:start position:0%
these broader incentives is if you
 
03:24:13.910 --> 03:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
maintain a third of the the units uh in
 
03:24:16.670 --> 03:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
any new development for moderate income
 
03:24:19.370 --> 03:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
residents that's the key piece here
 
03:24:22.250 --> 03:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
so again some context you know we know
 
03:24:24.830 --> 03:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
RSA 79e works we just heard that from
 
03:24:26.750 --> 03:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
the representative from Rochester we've
 
03:24:29.450 --> 03:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
seen it used well in Dover
 
03:24:31.729 --> 03:24:31.739 align:start position:0%
uh and just this week our city council
 
03:24:34.790 --> 03:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
will hear another 79 E project to rehab
 
03:24:37.610 --> 03:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
a vacant courthouse uh into something
 
03:24:40.130 --> 03:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
you know vibrant and and great and
 
03:24:43.610 --> 03:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
revenue producing for our downtown
 
03:24:43.620 --> 03:24:44.510 align:start position:0%
revenue producing for our downtown
um

03:24:44.510 --> 03:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:46.250 --> 03:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
and just to highlight a couple of the
 
03:24:48.410 --> 03:24:48.420 align:start position:0%
the sort of limitations in the current
 
03:24:50.690 --> 03:24:50.700 align:start position:0%
law again it's constrained to town and
 
03:24:52.610 --> 03:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
Village centers
 
03:24:54.710 --> 03:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
um that's where development costs are
 
03:24:56.809 --> 03:24:56.819 align:start position:0%
highest and that's also where there's
 
03:24:58.670 --> 03:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
the highest potential for market rate
 
03:25:01.370 --> 03:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
rents so not not necessarily a place
 
03:25:03.290 --> 03:25:03.300 align:start position:0%
where you'd see affordable housing
 
03:25:03.300 --> 03:25:04.610 align:start position:0%
where you'd see affordable housing
um

03:25:04.610 --> 03:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:07.550 --> 03:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
so you know again this was enabling
 
03:25:09.830 --> 03:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
legislation as has been noted many times
 
03:25:11.510 --> 03:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities could decide for
 
03:25:13.849 --> 03:25:13.859 align:start position:0%
themselves where they wanted to use
 
03:25:15.650 --> 03:25:15.660 align:start position:0%
these Provisions how they wanted to use
 
03:25:18.410 --> 03:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
these provisions and again the key being
 
03:25:20.150 --> 03:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
that they could do it anywhere so they
 
03:25:21.590 --> 03:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
could do it in places where development
 
03:25:23.450 --> 03:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
costs are much lower and that would
 
03:25:25.610 --> 03:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
hopefully translate into lower rental
 
03:25:25.620 --> 03:25:27.050 align:start position:0%
hopefully translate into lower rental
rates

03:25:27.050 --> 03:25:27.060 align:start position:0%
rates
 
03:25:29.870 --> 03:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
um committee members who were on the
 
03:25:32.090 --> 03:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
committee last term will remember this
 
03:25:34.729 --> 03:25:34.739 align:start position:0%
bill has come before you before uh and
 
03:25:35.990 --> 03:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
it passed the committee with an
 
03:25:38.269 --> 03:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
amendment then passed the house with
 
03:25:40.729 --> 03:25:40.739 align:start position:0%
broad bipartisan support went to Ways
 
03:25:42.229 --> 03:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
and Means as a second committee where it
 
03:25:45.590 --> 03:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
received a 20 to zero recommendation
 
03:25:47.690 --> 03:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
um so in closing I'll just reiterate
 
03:25:49.670 --> 03:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation doesn't require
 
03:25:51.849 --> 03:25:51.859 align:start position:0%
anyone to do anything
 
03:25:54.229 --> 03:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
designed to attract new market rate
 
03:25:56.330 --> 03:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
housing new affordable housing things we
 
03:25:58.190 --> 03:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
really need probably in every community
 
03:25:59.929 --> 03:25:59.939 align:start position:0%
in our state and it's designed in a way
 
03:26:01.790 --> 03:26:01.800 align:start position:0%
that lets municipalities
 
03:26:04.010 --> 03:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
uh decide for themselves where and under
 
03:26:06.110 --> 03:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
what terms they wish to use it and in
 
03:26:08.269 --> 03:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
partnership with private developers so
 
03:26:11.750 --> 03:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
with that I'll uh take any questions
 
03:26:13.849 --> 03:26:13.859 align:start position:0%
uh we have
 
03:26:17.110 --> 03:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
from representative major putio
 
03:26:19.309 --> 03:26:19.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
03:26:20.990 --> 03:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
um my question to you thank you
 
03:26:23.150 --> 03:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
representative Conley for taking my
 
03:26:27.889 --> 03:26:27.899 align:start position:0%
question uh how does this fit in with
 
03:26:30.769 --> 03:26:30.779 align:start position:0%
the last uh term I had introduced the
 
03:26:34.490 --> 03:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
pace legislation to enhance or bring in
 
03:26:38.389 --> 03:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
new investors how does this kind of work
 
03:26:40.849 --> 03:26:40.859 align:start position:0%
that into
 
03:26:40.859 --> 03:26:41.769 align:start position:0%
that into
um

03:26:41.769 --> 03:26:41.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:46.070 --> 03:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
attracting new uh investors as well as
 
03:26:50.269 --> 03:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
restoring and redeveloping old buildings
 
03:26:53.750 --> 03:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:55.910 --> 03:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative so
 
03:26:59.090 --> 03:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
this is a tool that our cities and towns
 
03:27:01.370 --> 03:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
certainly know about uh developers
 
03:27:03.889 --> 03:27:03.899 align:start position:0%
definitely know about it
 
03:27:06.110 --> 03:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
um so it would come down to I think the
 
03:27:08.510 --> 03:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances to determine whether a
 
03:27:10.370 --> 03:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
particular project fits within the
 
03:27:12.309 --> 03:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
guidelines of the existing law
 
03:27:14.450 --> 03:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
again the proposal before you would
 
03:27:17.090 --> 03:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
expand that and create a whole bunch of
 
03:27:19.250 --> 03:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
new scenarios that would work and that's
 
03:27:20.570 --> 03:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
the idea
 
03:27:22.969 --> 03:27:22.979 align:start position:0%
um so referring to Historic properties
 
03:27:25.370 --> 03:27:25.380 align:start position:0%
again that's already part of the bill or
 
03:27:26.870 --> 03:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's already part of the law so that
 
03:27:28.309 --> 03:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change
 
03:27:28.319 --> 03:27:29.330 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change
um

03:27:29.330 --> 03:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:32.330 --> 03:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
at all uh and and as far as attracting
 
03:27:33.769 --> 03:27:33.779 align:start position:0%
developers um
 
03:27:36.170 --> 03:27:36.180 align:start position:0%
I would hope that this would further uh
 
03:27:38.090 --> 03:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
entice developers to invest in our
 
03:27:38.100 --> 03:27:38.990 align:start position:0%
entice developers to invest in our
communities

03:27:38.990 --> 03:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
communities
 
03:27:42.229 --> 03:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:44.450 --> 03:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh we have a question from
 
03:27:46.429 --> 03:27:46.439 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
03:27:48.530 --> 03:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Dolan and thank you
 
03:27:51.050 --> 03:27:51.060 align:start position:0%
representative Conley I apologize I was
 
03:27:54.110 --> 03:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
taking copious notes and I missed the
 
03:27:56.450 --> 03:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
part you had explained the history of a
 
03:27:56.460 --> 03:27:57.410 align:start position:0%
part you had explained the history of a
prior

03:27:57.410 --> 03:27:57.420 align:start position:0%
prior
 
03:28:00.290 --> 03:28:00.300 align:start position:0%
um bill that was similar to this and you
 
03:28:02.929 --> 03:28:02.939 align:start position:0%
noted that it passed this um committee
 
03:28:04.910 --> 03:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
that you're in front of was that with an
 
03:28:04.920 --> 03:28:07.130 align:start position:0%
that you're in front of was that with an
amendment

03:28:07.130 --> 03:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:28:09.830 --> 03:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative yes it uh it left the
 
03:28:11.389 --> 03:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
committee with Amendment
 
03:28:13.550 --> 03:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
um and the language is still in the bill
 
03:28:16.250 --> 03:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
from that amendment that adds some
 
03:28:17.870 --> 03:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
definitions around
 
03:28:20.809 --> 03:28:20.819 align:start position:0%
um affordability it's updating a
 
03:28:23.030 --> 03:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
different section of law around
 
03:28:26.090 --> 03:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
um standards for uh low income and that
 
03:28:28.370 --> 03:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
kind of thing and there's others who I
 
03:28:29.870 --> 03:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
believe are planning to testify who can
 
03:28:31.190 --> 03:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
better speak to that because that was
 
03:28:32.750 --> 03:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
not an amendment I brought forward but
 
03:28:35.389 --> 03:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
that uh yes that is the the background
 
03:28:36.590 --> 03:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
03:28:38.690 --> 03:28:38.700 align:start position:0%
and then follow up
 
03:28:41.990 --> 03:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
go ahead so and then you explain that it
 
03:28:44.210 --> 03:28:44.220 align:start position:0%
passed the house with bipartisan support
 
03:28:46.429 --> 03:28:46.439 align:start position:0%
and I missed the part of what happened
 
03:28:49.130 --> 03:28:49.140 align:start position:0%
to the bill ultimately where did it die
 
03:28:51.830 --> 03:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
oh yes I did neglect to tell you that so
 
03:28:56.030 --> 03:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
it it ran into the covid related uh
 
03:28:57.889 --> 03:28:57.899 align:start position:0%
shutdown of legislative activity last
 
03:28:57.899 --> 03:29:00.170 align:start position:0%
shutdown of legislative activity last
year

03:29:00.170 --> 03:29:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:03.410 --> 03:29:03.420 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you uh next uh testimony
 
03:29:05.450 --> 03:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
would be offered by Mr Ben Frost from
 
03:29:12.370 --> 03:29:12.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:15.110 --> 03:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:29:17.929 --> 03:29:17.939 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to testify uh my
 
03:29:19.610 --> 03:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
name is Ben Frost I'm the managing
 
03:29:21.590 --> 03:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
director of policy and public affairs
 
03:29:22.969 --> 03:29:22.979 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Housing Finance
 
03:29:25.130 --> 03:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
Authority and I'm here to express New
 
03:29:26.809 --> 03:29:26.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing's strong support for
 
03:29:29.330 --> 03:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
this legislation and our gratitude to
 
03:29:31.130 --> 03:29:31.140 align:start position:0%
representative Conley for introducing it
 
03:29:31.140 --> 03:29:32.630 align:start position:0%
representative Conley for introducing it
again

03:29:32.630 --> 03:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:29:35.830 --> 03:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
um this bill really should be seen as
 
03:29:38.809 --> 03:29:38.819 align:start position:0%
two separate independent but
 
03:29:41.450 --> 03:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
interrelated sections and they are
 
03:29:45.469 --> 03:29:45.479 align:start position:0%
sections one and uh one one two and then
 
03:29:47.630 --> 03:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
the second section is is three so two
 
03:29:50.510 --> 03:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
two uh independent Parts the first uh
 
03:29:52.969 --> 03:29:52.979 align:start position:0%
part of this is the the part that IT
 
03:29:56.389 --> 03:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
addresses RSA 79e and
 
03:29:58.610 --> 03:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
um this this statute has been around for
 
03:30:00.410 --> 03:30:00.420 align:start position:0%
a number of years it was uh enacted by
 
03:30:04.309 --> 03:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
the legislature in 2006 uh and I I can
 
03:30:07.849 --> 03:30:07.859 align:start position:0%
tell you that as of uh now as of 2020 at
 
03:30:11.269 --> 03:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
least 59 communities in New Hampshire
 
03:30:15.229 --> 03:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
are utilizing RSA 79e as a tax incentive
 
03:30:16.969 --> 03:30:16.979 align:start position:0%
for different kinds of development it's
 
03:30:19.670 --> 03:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
enormously flexible I was one of a small
 
03:30:22.190 --> 03:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
team back in 2005 that drafted the
 
03:30:24.830 --> 03:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
original legislation that became RSA 790
 
03:30:28.370 --> 03:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
and we we envisioned it as a as a tool
 
03:30:30.650 --> 03:30:30.660 align:start position:0%
that municipalities might use we try to
 
03:30:33.469 --> 03:30:33.479 align:start position:0%
make it flexible and it is very very
 
03:30:36.110 --> 03:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
flexible and I'm just kind of shocked
 
03:30:38.150 --> 03:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
and amazed to see how successful it's
 
03:30:41.030 --> 03:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
been so I'm really gratified this
 
03:30:43.070 --> 03:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
morning I was driving to to work and I
 
03:30:44.690 --> 03:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
was listening to exchange and Laura
 
03:30:46.610 --> 03:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
Canary was interviewing three Mayors in
 
03:30:49.969 --> 03:30:49.979 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire mayor Craig from
 
03:30:52.010 --> 03:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
Manchester mayor Hansel from Keene and
 
03:30:54.469 --> 03:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
mayor McCarley from Rochester and both
 
03:30:57.710 --> 03:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
Mayors Hansel and McCarley talked about
 
03:31:00.889 --> 03:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
RSA 79e as an important strategy for
 
03:31:03.650 --> 03:31:03.660 align:start position:0%
their communities uh as it's one of the
 
03:31:06.349 --> 03:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
few tax incentives that municipalities
 
03:31:09.290 --> 03:31:09.300 align:start position:0%
have to attract new new investment so
 
03:31:10.910 --> 03:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
representative mandaputi has talked
 
03:31:12.530 --> 03:31:12.540 align:start position:0%
about how do we attract investment to
 
03:31:16.550 --> 03:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire this is one thing that the
 
03:31:19.550 --> 03:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities can use to Market
 
03:31:22.250 --> 03:31:22.260 align:start position:0%
themselves to investors from from Beyond
 
03:31:23.750 --> 03:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as well as within New
 
03:31:23.760 --> 03:31:24.650 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as well as within New
Hampshire

03:31:24.650 --> 03:31:24.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:31:28.010 --> 03:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
it's really powerful and is highly
 
03:31:30.889 --> 03:31:30.899 align:start position:0%
discretionary so it's a purely enabling
 
03:31:32.809 --> 03:31:32.819 align:start position:0%
legislation municipalities can do it if
 
03:31:34.130 --> 03:31:34.140 align:start position:0%
they want to they don't have to if they
 
03:31:37.250 --> 03:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
don't want to uh and the the change to
 
03:31:38.929 --> 03:31:38.939 align:start position:0%
the statute that representative Conley
 
03:31:41.150 --> 03:31:41.160 align:start position:0%
is proposing in House Bill 154 is a very
 
03:31:44.870 --> 03:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
welcome change uh RSA 79e was originally
 
03:31:47.690 --> 03:31:47.700 align:start position:0%
conceived of as a tool to help with the
 
03:31:49.670 --> 03:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
Redevelopment of downtown areas and it
 
03:31:52.849 --> 03:31:52.859 align:start position:0%
does that and it still does that but
 
03:31:54.889 --> 03:31:54.899 align:start position:0%
what it doesn't do right now and what
 
03:31:56.630 --> 03:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
house bill 154 would allow
 
03:31:59.929 --> 03:31:59.939 align:start position:0%
municipalities to use it to do is to do
 
03:32:02.690 --> 03:32:02.700 align:start position:0%
new housing development in areas where
 
03:32:05.269 --> 03:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
the municipality wants to do have have
 
03:32:08.030 --> 03:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
new Housing Development done so it's
 
03:32:10.130 --> 03:32:10.140 align:start position:0%
totally up to the municipality to decide
 
03:32:12.710 --> 03:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
where it wants to do this and what the
 
03:32:14.210 --> 03:32:14.220 align:start position:0%
time period is
 
03:32:17.090 --> 03:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
um the the tax relief that would be
 
03:32:19.309 --> 03:32:19.319 align:start position:0%
offered under one houseboat 154 under
 
03:32:22.910 --> 03:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
RSA 79e would be for up to 10 years so
 
03:32:24.650 --> 03:32:24.660 align:start position:0%
it is discretionary for the men
 
03:32:26.510 --> 03:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
municipality to decide how long to make
 
03:32:29.030 --> 03:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
that up to 10 years
 
03:32:31.969 --> 03:32:31.979 align:start position:0%
um and there are there's a reference in
 
03:32:31.979 --> 03:32:32.750 align:start position:0%
um and there are there's a reference in
um

03:32:32.750 --> 03:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:35.929 --> 03:32:35.939 align:start position:0%
in section two of the bill to the
 
03:32:38.210 --> 03:32:38.220 align:start position:0%
questions of affordability and so it
 
03:32:40.610 --> 03:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
says shall be designated for uh
 
03:32:43.010 --> 03:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
households uh with an income no no less
 
03:32:44.750 --> 03:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
than a third of the housing units in one
 
03:32:46.070 --> 03:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
of these developments in a Housing
 
03:32:48.410 --> 03:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
Opportunity Zone would be uh allocated
 
03:32:51.590 --> 03:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
for people making up to 80 of the median
 
03:32:54.229 --> 03:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
income for the area or that would meet
 
03:32:57.410 --> 03:32:57.420 align:start position:0%
the income targeting standards nrsa 204
 
03:33:00.349 --> 03:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
C 54 comma four
 
03:33:02.870 --> 03:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
now that statute and that's where we get
 
03:33:04.969 --> 03:33:04.979 align:start position:0%
to the the second principal part of this
 
03:33:08.570 --> 03:33:08.580 align:start position:0%
legislation uh is um the the state's
 
03:33:10.250 --> 03:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund it is the
 
03:33:12.469 --> 03:33:12.479 align:start position:0%
state's affordable housing trust fund uh
 
03:33:14.210 --> 03:33:14.220 align:start position:0%
administered by New Hampshire Housing
 
03:33:17.389 --> 03:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
and it has existing income targeting in
 
03:33:19.309 --> 03:33:19.319 align:start position:0%
it that was designed by the legislature
 
03:33:22.969 --> 03:33:22.979 align:start position:0%
back in in 1988 and it was designed well
 
03:33:26.929 --> 03:33:26.939 align:start position:0%
at that time to meet the the needs of
 
03:33:29.450 --> 03:33:29.460 align:start position:0%
programs at that time but those needs
 
03:33:32.090 --> 03:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
have changed so new new federal programs
 
03:33:34.490 --> 03:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
have evolved over that time that have
 
03:33:36.769 --> 03:33:36.779 align:start position:0%
different income targeting standards so
 
03:33:39.769 --> 03:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
we last year approached representative
 
03:33:41.570 --> 03:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
Conley and asked him if he'd be willing
 
03:33:44.570 --> 03:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
to integrate this amendment into his
 
03:33:47.450 --> 03:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
legislation and he agreed to do that and
 
03:33:48.830 --> 03:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
so that's what you see before you know
 
03:33:49.990 --> 03:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
03:33:52.849 --> 03:33:52.859 align:start position:0%
changing the or refining the income
 
03:33:54.950 --> 03:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
targeting in the affordable housing fund
 
03:33:59.210 --> 03:33:59.220 align:start position:0%
to match up with uh Federal programs and
 
03:34:03.349 --> 03:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
then it ties back to RSA 79e in the
 
03:34:05.389 --> 03:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative Conley has
 
03:34:08.990 --> 03:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
proposed so that a developer will have
 
03:34:11.750 --> 03:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
some flexibility in what sort of income
 
03:34:13.309 --> 03:34:13.319 align:start position:0%
targeting should be done in that
 
03:34:15.710 --> 03:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
development uh if a municipality chooses
 
03:34:18.349 --> 03:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
to employ this measure I'd be happy to
 
03:34:20.590 --> 03:34:20.600 align:start position:0%
take any questions and thank you for
 
03:34:23.269 --> 03:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
listening to me this morning or this
 
03:34:23.279 --> 03:34:24.830 align:start position:0%
listening to me this morning or this
afternoon

03:34:24.830 --> 03:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
03:34:26.510 --> 03:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
thank you yes that schedule is
 
03:34:29.750 --> 03:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
stretching a bit I'd like to recognize
 
03:34:33.050 --> 03:34:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:35.510 --> 03:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr Frost
 
03:34:38.870 --> 03:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
for your testimony my question is you
 
03:34:43.370 --> 03:34:43.380 align:start position:0%
talk about RSA 73e how does this enable
 
03:34:48.530 --> 03:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
or enhance RSA 5380e
 
03:34:50.929 --> 03:34:50.939 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with the statute that
 
03:34:54.349 --> 03:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
you're referring to RSA 53 yeah that is
 
03:34:57.349 --> 03:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
the pace District
 
03:35:01.370 --> 03:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
case legislation it's kind of very the
 
03:35:04.790 --> 03:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
mushy area for New Hampshire I I had
 
03:35:06.950 --> 03:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
forgotten the um the statutory reference
 
03:35:09.229 --> 03:35:09.239 align:start position:0%
but I was actually involved in the
 
03:35:11.630 --> 03:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
drafting of that some years ago
 
03:35:14.269 --> 03:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
um with representative Beatrice pastor
 
03:35:18.550 --> 03:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
of Hanover uh so uh they're they're
 
03:35:21.170 --> 03:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
complementary they're overlapping they
 
03:35:22.790 --> 03:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily
 
03:35:25.570 --> 03:35:25.580 align:start position:0%
um rely on each other so you could have
 
03:35:29.870 --> 03:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
a a an RSA 79e Housing Opportunity Zone
 
03:35:32.090 --> 03:35:32.100 align:start position:0%
that would overlap with a a pace
 
03:35:35.090 --> 03:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
District but my recollection is that
 
03:35:38.450 --> 03:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
under current New Hampshire law uh pace
 
03:35:40.690 --> 03:35:40.700 align:start position:0%
is limited to commercial
 
03:35:43.309 --> 03:35:43.319 align:start position:0%

support for House Bill uh 154 as well as
 
03:37:03.050 --> 03:37:03.060 align:start position:0%
the house bill 189.
 
03:37:04.969 --> 03:37:04.979 align:start position:0%
um it's critically important for the
 
03:37:06.469 --> 03:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
legislature to take steps that will help
 
03:37:08.570 --> 03:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
attract and retain young people here in
 
03:37:09.830 --> 03:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:37:11.030 --> 03:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
um we're in the midst of an affordable
 
03:37:12.710 --> 03:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
housing crisis that requires our
 
03:37:14.870 --> 03:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
immediate attention these bills will
 
03:37:16.729 --> 03:37:16.739 align:start position:0%
help incentivize local communities to
 
03:37:18.590 --> 03:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
invest in affordable housing projects
 
03:37:20.570 --> 03:37:20.580 align:start position:0%
and we'll open up opportunities for
 
03:37:22.849 --> 03:37:22.859 align:start position:0%
Working Families to pursue affordable
 
03:37:25.309 --> 03:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
housing options New Hampshire's housing
 
03:37:27.290 --> 03:37:27.300 align:start position:0%
crisis is a five alarm fire that
 
03:37:29.690 --> 03:37:29.700 align:start position:0%
threatens our economic future I've
 
03:37:31.070 --> 03:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
personally witnessed many friends from
 
03:37:32.510 --> 03:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
high school and college leave our state
 
03:37:35.150 --> 03:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
and take their talents elsewhere May any
 
03:37:36.349 --> 03:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
of them would love to start a family
 
03:37:37.670 --> 03:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire but they can't
 
03:37:39.250 --> 03:37:39.260 align:start position:0%
afford it
 
03:37:41.510 --> 03:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
the lack of affordable housing options
 
03:37:43.190 --> 03:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
in our state has created an economy that
 
03:37:45.650 --> 03:37:45.660 align:start position:0%
is unsustainable but these bills are
 
03:37:47.030 --> 03:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
steps in the right direction that will
 
03:37:48.950 --> 03:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
help make New Hampshire a more viable
 
03:37:50.950 --> 03:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
option for young families so I
 
03:37:53.090 --> 03:37:53.100 align:start position:0%

03:37:54.410 --> 03:37:54.420 align:start position:0%

you my name is Kathy Staub and I'm part
 
03:39:05.389 --> 03:39:05.399 align:start position:0%
of the Manchester housing Alliance which
 
03:39:07.429 --> 03:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
is a group of tenants and ordinary folks
 
03:39:09.769 --> 03:39:09.779 align:start position:0%
in our city who are concerned about the
 
03:39:11.929 --> 03:39:11.939 align:start position:0%
lack of safe and affordable housing in
 
03:39:14.450 --> 03:39:14.460 align:start position:0%
Manchester and I'm here to support house
 
03:39:17.750 --> 03:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
bill 154. in particular I support the
 
03:39:19.550 --> 03:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
provisions that at least one third of
 
03:39:21.830 --> 03:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
any development in these Housing
 
03:39:23.750 --> 03:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
Opportunity zones
 
03:39:25.910 --> 03:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
um who receive this benefit
 
03:39:29.210 --> 03:39:29.220 align:start position:0%
um the affordable units according to the
 
03:39:30.769 --> 03:39:30.779 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority
 
03:39:32.929 --> 03:39:32.939 align:start position:0%
the average rent for two bedroom in
 
03:39:35.150 --> 03:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester is one thousand four hundred
 
03:39:36.950 --> 03:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
and eighty three dollars a month
 
03:39:38.870 --> 03:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester has a lot of restaurants
 
03:39:41.090 --> 03:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
retail and cultural amenities which
 
03:39:42.769 --> 03:39:42.779 align:start position:0%
means there are a lot of low-wage
 
03:39:45.050 --> 03:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
workers that are critical to making our
 
03:39:46.070 --> 03:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
city run
 
03:39:50.389 --> 03:39:50.399 align:start position:0%
for example Manchester area has 9 300
 
03:39:53.389 --> 03:39:53.399 align:start position:0%
Food Service workers with a median wage
 
03:39:56.090 --> 03:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
of twelve dollars an hour at that add to
 
03:39:58.010 --> 03:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
that essential workers like cashiers
 
03:40:00.410 --> 03:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
home health aides and janitors and you
 
03:40:02.510 --> 03:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
can see that many people struggle with
 
03:40:04.550 --> 03:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
the cost of local rents
 
03:40:06.769 --> 03:40:06.779 align:start position:0%
every week we hear about seniors and
 
03:40:08.630 --> 03:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
disabled people being evicted to make
 
03:40:11.750 --> 03:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
way for renovations and higher rents
 
03:40:13.910 --> 03:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
recently a development that received
 
03:40:16.010 --> 03:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
such a tax credit
 
03:40:18.490 --> 03:40:18.500 align:start position:0%
um as the 79e
 
03:40:22.610 --> 03:40:22.620 align:start position:0%
began offering units for rent at 1400 to
 
03:40:25.969 --> 03:40:25.979 align:start position:0%
2 000 a month which is Outreach for many
 
03:40:28.550 --> 03:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
working people in our community when
 
03:40:30.349 --> 03:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
wealthy developers receive tax
 
03:40:32.510 --> 03:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
deferments the roads still need to be
 
03:40:34.250 --> 03:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
maintained the trash still needs to be
 
03:40:35.929 --> 03:40:35.939 align:start position:0%
picked up and our teachers police
 
03:40:37.849 --> 03:40:37.859 align:start position:0%
officers and firefighters still need to
 
03:40:41.210 --> 03:40:41.220 align:start position:0%
be paid as a homeowner and a taxpayer I
 
03:40:43.070 --> 03:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
don't mind making up the difference to
 
03:40:45.650 --> 03:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
help people of modest means which is the
 
03:40:47.630 --> 03:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
change that this legislation will help
 
03:40:50.690 --> 03:40:50.700 align:start position:0%
to ensure so I really appreciate that I
 
03:40:52.729 --> 03:40:52.739 align:start position:0%
believe that when public resources are
 
03:40:54.469 --> 03:40:54.479 align:start position:0%
used everyone should have the
 
03:40:56.330 --> 03:40:56.340 align:start position:0%
opportunity to benefit including people
 
03:40:58.010 --> 03:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
of modest means
 
03:41:00.290 --> 03:41:00.300 align:start position:0%
well this is a good incentive I think
 
03:41:01.550 --> 03:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to need to be vigilant
 
03:41:04.250 --> 03:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
because um I have
 
03:41:07.849 --> 03:41:07.859 align:start position:0%
um concerns that maybe there are areas
 
03:41:10.130 --> 03:41:10.140 align:start position:0%
um in Manchester that are a hundred
 
03:41:11.990 --> 03:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
percent affordable housing which is not
 
03:41:13.790 --> 03:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
in very good condition but it's still
 
03:41:17.769 --> 03:41:17.779 align:start position:0%
affordable that might be displaced and
 
03:41:20.990 --> 03:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
instead replaced with areas where only
 
03:41:22.910 --> 03:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
one third of the housing is Affordable
 
03:41:26.570 --> 03:41:26.580 align:start position:0%
but I think that's on the Manchester uh
 
03:41:28.849 --> 03:41:28.859 align:start position:0%
housing Alliance to be vigilant on that
 
03:41:32.750 --> 03:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
and and keep our local Municipal uh
 
03:41:34.969 --> 03:41:34.979 align:start position:0%
decision makers
 
03:41:34.979 --> 03:41:35.590 align:start position:0%
decision makers
um

03:41:35.590 --> 03:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:39.290 --> 03:41:39.300 align:start position:0%
from making that kind of a decision so I
 
03:41:41.750 --> 03:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
I fully supported this bill
 
03:41:43.670 --> 03:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
um and I thank you for allowing me to
 
03:41:43.680 --> 03:41:45.410 align:start position:0%
um and I thank you for allowing me to
testify

03:41:45.410 --> 03:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
testify
 
03:41:47.210 --> 03:41:47.220 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and your
 
03:41:48.530 --> 03:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
interest in this
 
03:41:51.710 --> 03:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
uh seeing no further questions or a
 
03:41:54.290 --> 03:41:54.300 align:start position:0%
testimony uh and two we're going to
 
03:41:57.790 --> 03:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
conclude the public Nearing on the bill
 
03:42:02.690 --> 03:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
on tonight and move on to HB 189.
 
03:42:05.030 --> 03:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
which is our last bill public hearing
 
03:42:09.710 --> 03:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
now this this is a bill with a sponsor
 
03:42:12.229 --> 03:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
has indicated to me that
 
03:42:14.469 --> 03:42:14.479 align:start position:0%
the bill with uh
 
03:42:18.290 --> 03:42:18.300 align:start position:0%
that she would like to withdraw the bill
 
03:42:22.490 --> 03:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
is uh and she can explain why but we
 
03:42:24.650 --> 03:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
don't have a real clean mechanism to
 
03:42:26.809 --> 03:42:26.819 align:start position:0%
just withdraw our bill the technique
 
03:42:29.510 --> 03:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
would be to itl the bill and executive
 
03:42:32.150 --> 03:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
session so representative van would you
 
03:42:33.950 --> 03:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh Enlighten us
 
03:42:36.050 --> 03:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm happy to talk about this this
 
03:42:38.389 --> 03:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
is another case where I was doing the
 
03:42:40.849 --> 03:42:40.859 align:start position:0%
belt and suspenders thing but it turns
 
03:42:42.469 --> 03:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
out that we don't actually need the
 
03:42:45.170 --> 03:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
suspenders uh this bill is redundant to
 
03:42:46.849 --> 03:42:46.859 align:start position:0%
a bill that we'll hear later in the
 
03:42:50.389 --> 03:42:50.399 align:start position:0%
session H Bill 341 and since it's
 
03:42:54.110 --> 03:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
redundant and says the same thing uh I
 
03:42:56.510 --> 03:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
think we should just itl it and take up
 
03:42:58.370 --> 03:42:58.380 align:start position:0%
341 when it rolls around on the calendar
 
03:43:00.889 --> 03:43:00.899 align:start position:0%
and save us all some time and trouble
 
03:43:03.110 --> 03:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
and it is unless there's objection in
 
03:43:05.929 --> 03:43:05.939 align:start position:0%
the committee we'll do just that is
 
03:43:08.929 --> 03:43:08.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:11.389 --> 03:43:11.399 align:start position:0%
are seeing that uh we're going to
 
03:43:15.410 --> 03:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
conclude the public hearing on HP 189
 
03:43:17.769 --> 03:43:17.779 align:start position:0%
and move immediately to
 
03:43:20.269 --> 03:43:20.279 align:start position:0%
Executive session on that bill and then
 
03:43:22.370 --> 03:43:22.380 align:start position:0%
we will take a recess
 
03:43:25.490 --> 03:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
so we are now in executive session to
 
03:43:30.170 --> 03:43:30.180 align:start position:0%
consider HP 189 and other than that I
 
03:43:35.210 --> 03:43:35.220 align:start position:0%
would ask for a motion IPL
 
03:43:38.690 --> 03:43:38.700 align:start position:0%

ask if the
 
03:47:00.349 --> 03:47:00.359 align:start position:0%

Republicans will be meeting in room 300a
 
03:47:20.570 --> 03:47:20.580 align:start position:0%

03:47:27.769 --> 03:47:27.779 align:start position:0%
and then there is a zoom invite
 
03:47:29.450 --> 03:47:29.460 align:start position:0%
but if you're going to meet in person
 
03:47:31.550 --> 03:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
you know you don't need to be able to
 
03:47:33.769 --> 03:47:33.779 align:start position:0%
it's just everyone

question Mr chair is the zoom going to
 
03:47:40.010 --> 03:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
change are we stay on this to continue
 
03:47:42.290 --> 03:47:42.300 align:start position:0%
on the zoom
 
03:47:44.269 --> 03:47:44.279 align:start position:0%
going to defer to representative manager
 
03:47:45.710 --> 03:47:45.720 align:start position:0%
but I think we're going to stay right
 
03:47:48.050 --> 03:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
online we are
 
03:47:51.110 --> 03:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
um so as as the chair has stated thank
 
03:47:53.510 --> 03:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh as the chair has stated
 
03:47:56.150 --> 03:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
before the mics will still remain hot so
 
03:48:00.110 --> 03:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
so mute yourself uh go off screen but
 
03:48:02.870 --> 03:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
the recording does not stop if we stop
 
03:48:06.110 --> 03:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
the recording the live stream we we cut
 
03:48:08.150 --> 03:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
the meeting in its entirety so we don't
 
03:48:10.610 --> 03:48:10.620 align:start position:0%
want to do that so the meeting will
 
03:48:13.910 --> 03:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
continue to run and oh I really should
 
03:48:16.070 --> 03:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
have put up a little uh note there that
 
03:48:18.170 --> 03:48:18.180 align:start position:0%
says we're at lunch so I'll see if I can
 
03:48:20.150 --> 03:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
do that and let the public know that we
 
03:48:22.429 --> 03:48:22.439 align:start position:0%

uh until two o'clock two o'clock so I'll
 
03:48:29.570 --> 03:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
put up a little note there
 
03:48:29.580 --> 03:48:32.690 align:start position:0%
put up a little note there
okay

03:48:32.690 --> 03:48:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:35.590 --> 03:48:35.600 align:start position:0%

03:48:45.830 --> 03:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:45.840 --> 03:48:47.090 align:start position:0%

yeah
 
03:48:48.950 --> 03:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I moved that we uh I think we've
 
03:48:50.570 --> 03:48:50.580 align:start position:0%
waited long enough for the response from
 
03:48:53.690 --> 03:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
that okay I agree I I don't think we
 
03:48:55.309 --> 03:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
need emotion I think
 
03:48:57.769 --> 03:48:57.779 align:start position:0%
I think we've waited long enough so and
 
03:48:59.210 --> 03:48:59.220 align:start position:0%
I don't see anything
 
03:49:01.429 --> 03:49:01.439 align:start position:0%
so what is our vote at this point uh 18
 
03:49:05.870 --> 03:49:05.880 align:start position:0%

before you continue
 
03:51:07.610 --> 03:51:07.620 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that we have that expertise
 
03:51:10.309 --> 03:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
to know how to do that
 
03:51:10.319 --> 03:51:13.429 align:start position:0%
to know how to do that
okay

03:51:13.429 --> 03:51:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:16.150 --> 03:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
okay just wanted to double check
 
03:51:18.830 --> 03:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I can walk you through that if
 
03:51:21.490 --> 03:51:21.500 align:start position:0%
you if you just go over to the big TV
 
03:51:24.769 --> 03:51:24.779 align:start position:0%
directly across from you and use the
 
03:51:26.750 --> 03:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
mouse to go down to the lower left hand
 
03:51:29.330 --> 03:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
side all you have to do is hit mute
 
03:51:29.340 --> 03:51:30.370 align:start position:0%
side all you have to do is hit mute
okay

03:51:30.370 --> 03:51:30.380 align:start position:0%

03:51:32.990 --> 03:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
I'll mute it for you now but you'll have
 
03:51:35.510 --> 03:51:35.520 align:start position:0%

would do that you're I would say that
 
03:55:54.410 --> 03:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:54.420 --> 03:55:55.610 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:55:55.610 --> 03:55:55.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:55:58.130 --> 03:55:58.140 align:start position:0%
I I just want to um I just realized
 
03:56:01.910 --> 03:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:04.849 --> 03:56:04.859 align:start position:0%
um so you said that
 
03:56:08.210 --> 03:56:08.220 align:start position:0%
the this meeting was going to re you
 
03:56:10.370 --> 03:56:10.380 align:start position:0%
know stay put you weren't it wasn't
 
03:56:12.229 --> 03:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
going to end just the audio would be
 
03:56:14.150 --> 03:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
shut off
 
03:56:16.370 --> 03:56:16.380 align:start position:0%

meeting and it will be muted and I'll
 
03:56:20.630 --> 03:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
shut the video off so I guess the
 
03:56:23.929 --> 03:56:23.939 align:start position:0%
question is for the Republican caucus
 
03:56:26.990 --> 03:56:27.000 align:start position:0%

um and I don't know where to where to
 
04:56:31.610 --> 04:56:31.620 align:start position:0%
send this
 
04:56:33.770 --> 04:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
um but it seems like or actually ask the
 
04:56:36.050 --> 04:56:36.060 align:start position:0%
question it seems like people who sign
 
04:56:40.010 --> 04:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
up the day of to speak
 
04:56:42.110 --> 04:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
um are having trouble either it's not
 
04:56:43.850 --> 04:56:43.860 align:start position:0%
registering it's I could certainly
 
04:56:45.170 --> 04:56:45.180 align:start position:0%
understand where it wouldn't be put on
 
04:56:47.090 --> 04:56:47.100 align:start position:0%
the on the late lists is that something
 
04:56:50.448 --> 04:56:50.458 align:start position:0%
to follow up with or is you know is that
 
04:56:53.030 --> 04:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
something the system can improve upon or
 
04:56:55.368 --> 04:56:55.378 align:start position:0%
or be improved upon or just tell folks
 
04:56:56.990 --> 04:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
hey you got to sign up before you know
 
04:56:58.788 --> 04:56:58.798 align:start position:0%
five minutes before the meeting
 
04:57:01.670 --> 04:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
or should we talk about that offline oh
 
04:57:04.010 --> 04:57:04.020 align:start position:0%
no it's okay if people are signing up
 
04:57:06.350 --> 04:57:06.360 align:start position:0%
um after eight o'clock
 
04:57:08.270 --> 04:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
um it's not you're just not gonna get
 
04:57:10.788 --> 04:57:10.798 align:start position:0%
the the accurate record and then to
 
04:57:12.350 --> 04:57:12.360 align:start position:0%
raise their hand so even if they're
 
04:57:14.448 --> 04:57:14.458 align:start position:0%
registering it's just it's virtually
 
04:57:17.030 --> 04:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
impossible uh for me to go and get a new
 
04:57:19.190 --> 04:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
testimony list for every hearing Before
 
04:57:22.550 --> 04:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
the bill okay and communicate it in a in
 
04:57:25.250 --> 04:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
a not so in a not awkward way to the
 
04:57:26.570 --> 04:57:26.580 align:start position:0%
chair there are people who want to
 
04:57:29.510 --> 04:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
testify so um the expectation is if they
 
04:57:31.610 --> 04:57:31.620 align:start position:0%

04:57:52.250 --> 04:57:52.260 align:start position:0%

04:58:16.788 --> 04:58:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:16.798 --> 04:58:17.868 align:start position:0%

04:58:21.288 --> 04:58:21.298 align:start position:0%
um I sent around to those folks
 
04:58:26.208 --> 04:58:26.218 align:start position:0%
that I send things to to the Dems of
 
04:58:28.430 --> 04:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
Twitter thing
 
04:58:31.610 --> 04:58:31.620 align:start position:0%
that I just saw that cracked me up
 
04:58:33.890 --> 04:58:33.900 align:start position:0%
and it's about a zoom meeting and a cat
 
04:58:36.430 --> 04:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
so you might want to check your email
 
04:58:40.190 --> 04:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
and uh and and if you can deal with
 
04:58:42.170 --> 04:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
Twitter through your email it just
 
04:58:46.190 --> 04:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:50.150 --> 04:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:52.788 --> 04:58:52.798 align:start position:0%
I did not mean it as an insult to you I
 
04:58:56.208 --> 04:58:56.218 align:start position:0%
was I was praising you for your ability
 
04:58:58.250 --> 04:58:58.260 align:start position:0%
to do research on these things I've been
 
04:58:59.810 --> 04:58:59.820 align:start position:0%
impressed with how much knowledge you're
 
04:59:02.510 --> 04:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
bringing forward to us so I wasn't
 
04:59:05.090 --> 04:59:05.100 align:start position:0%
trying to be mean or anything when I
 
04:59:07.610 --> 04:59:07.620 align:start position:0%
said that to you representative Porter
 
04:59:09.050 --> 04:59:09.060 align:start position:0%
that's how I took it that you were
 
04:59:11.390 --> 04:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
complimenting me okay thank you thank
 
04:59:11.400 --> 04:59:12.890 align:start position:0%
complimenting me okay thank you thank
you

04:59:12.890 --> 04:59:12.900 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:59:16.190 --> 04:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
I I just want to say I am also very
 
04:59:18.410 --> 04:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
impressed with you representative powers
 
04:59:21.650 --> 04:59:21.660 align:start position:0%
to kind of focus on
 
04:59:24.050 --> 04:59:24.060 align:start position:0%
you know I'm a newbie on this committee
 
04:59:27.110 --> 04:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
so asking the questions that's all I've
 
04:59:29.448 --> 04:59:29.458 align:start position:0%
always learned right we just have a
 
04:59:32.208 --> 04:59:32.218 align:start position:0%
committee I have been on to learn and
 
04:59:34.730 --> 04:59:34.740 align:start position:0%
ask the questions and I'm really
 
04:59:37.910 --> 04:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
impressed thank you thank you
 
04:59:40.190 --> 04:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
representative man japoodi I observe
 
04:59:41.990 --> 04:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
everyone here and I'm learning from
 
04:59:42.000 --> 04:59:43.620 align:start position:0%
everyone here and I'm learning from
everyone

04:59:43.620 --> 04:59:43.630 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
04:59:43.630 --> 04:59:48.110 align:start position:0%
everyone
[Music]

04:59:48.110 --> 04:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:49.970 --> 04:59:49.980 align:start position:0%
it's one nice thing about this committee
 
04:59:51.708 --> 04:59:51.718 align:start position:0%
it's always been
 
04:59:54.110 --> 04:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
for the most part very non-partisan
 
04:59:58.070 --> 04:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
because the issues that we deal with are
 
05:00:00.110 --> 05:00:00.120 align:start position:0%
pretty Universal
 
05:00:02.150 --> 05:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
things that towns and cities have to
 
05:00:04.850 --> 05:00:04.860 align:start position:0%
deal with um so it's nice it's nice to
 
05:00:07.490 --> 05:00:07.500 align:start position:0%
get to know somebody
 
05:00:09.890 --> 05:00:09.900 align:start position:0%
in a nice way rather than a
 
05:00:12.230 --> 05:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
confrontational wearing
 
05:00:17.930 --> 05:00:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:20.448 --> 05:00:20.458 align:start position:0%
that's true the only reason I
 
05:00:27.288 --> 05:00:27.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:29.208 --> 05:00:29.218 align:start position:0%
I always thought one of the wisest
 
05:00:32.330 --> 05:00:32.340 align:start position:0%
things we did in the towns anyway was to
 
05:00:35.208 --> 05:00:35.218 align:start position:0%
not identify the political party of the
 
05:00:36.830 --> 05:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
people who were running for local
 
05:00:40.368 --> 05:00:40.378 align:start position:0%
offices because it really when you're in
 
05:00:41.930 --> 05:00:41.940 align:start position:0%
the local office and you have that
 
05:00:43.670 --> 05:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
experience it's a universal kind of
 
05:00:45.530 --> 05:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
thing and there's no I don't think
 
05:00:47.628 --> 05:00:47.638 align:start position:0%
there's a Democratic or a republican
 
05:00:49.850 --> 05:00:49.860 align:start position:0%
viewpoint on
 
05:00:52.250 --> 05:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
on certain issues that we all face as
 
05:00:54.708 --> 05:00:54.718 align:start position:0%
Town officers
 
05:00:57.830 --> 05:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
and I think we bring that neutrality
 
05:00:59.948 --> 05:00:59.958 align:start position:0%
with us into this committee
 
05:01:02.270 --> 05:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
and I think I think that's a really good
 
05:01:03.770 --> 05:01:03.780 align:start position:0%
thing personally
 
05:01:05.930 --> 05:01:05.940 align:start position:0%
I was just going to make that comment
 
05:01:08.750 --> 05:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
when I served on the school board and
 
05:01:11.390 --> 05:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
until I ran for State Rep I was an
 
05:01:15.490 --> 05:01:15.500 align:start position:0%
independent you know and no
 
05:01:20.990 --> 05:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
party affiliation or Dr and r so it was
 
05:01:21.000 --> 05:01:21.890 align:start position:0%
party affiliation or Dr and r so it was
um

05:01:21.890 --> 05:01:21.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:24.708 --> 05:01:24.718 align:start position:0%
I think governing has to be it like that
 
05:01:35.770 --> 05:01:35.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:38.930 --> 05:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
05:01:38.940 --> 05:01:43.788 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
oh

05:01:43.788 --> 05:01:43.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:45.470 --> 05:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
representative Dylan you'll just have to
 
05:01:47.810 --> 05:01:47.820 align:start position:0%
go to the computer
 
05:01:50.810 --> 05:01:50.820 align:start position:0%

uh in this Epic
 
05:02:01.910 --> 05:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
oh am I going to have to share my my
 
05:02:04.368 --> 05:02:04.378 align:start position:0%
considerable salary for doing this with
 
05:02:06.770 --> 05:02:06.780 align:start position:0%

I'm sorry I will say I have we have not
 
05:09:13.430 --> 05:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
I have not received a response from
 
05:09:15.350 --> 05:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative air to the invitation to
 
05:09:17.330 --> 05:09:17.340 align:start position:0%
rejoin the meeting and I see no messages
 
05:09:17.340 --> 05:09:18.410 align:start position:0%
rejoin the meeting and I see no messages
here

05:09:18.410 --> 05:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:09:20.750 --> 05:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
votes yes
 
05:09:24.170 --> 05:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
passes are 17-1 and will that go on the
 
05:09:26.868 --> 05:09:26.878 align:start position:0%
calendar and without objection I'll uh
 
05:09:30.830 --> 05:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:32.628 --> 05:09:32.638 align:start position:0%
remember the rules for the consent
 
05:09:35.628 --> 05:09:35.638 align:start position:0%
calendar it has to be unanimous or not
 
05:09:39.288 --> 05:09:39.298 align:start position:0%
have one more than one negative vote
 
05:09:41.990 --> 05:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
so if it was 162
 
05:09:44.448 --> 05:09:44.458 align:start position:0%
I would not be able to put it
 
05:09:46.368 --> 05:09:46.378 align:start position:0%
or if any of you object to it being
 
05:09:46.378 --> 05:09:47.628 align:start position:0%
or if any of you object to it being
there

05:09:47.628 --> 05:09:47.638 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:09:49.730 --> 05:09:49.740 align:start position:0%
uh disqualified as well
 
05:09:52.730 --> 05:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I have a question isn't it the
 
05:09:56.030 --> 05:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
practice if it has a FN attached to it
 
05:09:58.970 --> 05:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
it cannot go on
 
05:10:01.128 --> 05:10:01.138 align:start position:0%
and calendar is that the practice are
 
05:10:01.138 --> 05:10:01.850 align:start position:0%
and calendar is that the practice are
now

05:10:01.850 --> 05:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:10:04.190 --> 05:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
uh if it has FN it just means that it
 
05:10:07.610 --> 05:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:10.490 --> 05:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
no you I'm no representative mandaputi
 
05:10:12.410 --> 05:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
actually is correct we're not supposed
 
05:10:14.270 --> 05:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
to put any any bills on the consent
 
05:10:18.230 --> 05:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
calendar that are F and bills even if we
 
05:10:20.628 --> 05:10:20.638 align:start position:0%
have a unanimous vote
 
05:10:23.150 --> 05:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
I that's the rule that I used to have
 
05:10:25.430 --> 05:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
anyway we used to have then I wasn't
 
05:10:25.440 --> 05:10:30.530 align:start position:0%
anyway we used to have then I wasn't
aware

05:12:01.670 --> 05:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
responses so far we've been good like
 
05:12:04.030 --> 05:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
there's more support
 
05:12:08.270 --> 05:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:10.970 --> 05:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
yeah there's no reconciliation it's just
 
05:12:13.430 --> 05:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh it's just input for the committee to
 
05:12:16.430 --> 05:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
to consider when you're making you vote
 
05:12:18.050 --> 05:12:18.060 align:start position:0%

05:12:58.610 --> 05:12:58.620 align:start position:0%

05:13:03.310 --> 05:13:03.320 align:start position:0%

05:13:17.930 --> 05:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I I heard urge a whole
 
05:13:20.628 --> 05:13:20.638 align:start position:0%
question representative but my
 
05:13:23.930 --> 05:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
understanding is that there was just one
 
05:13:26.510 --> 05:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
person who was making the appointments
 
05:13:29.030 --> 05:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
for the police commission
 
05:13:32.930 --> 05:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
and they wanted to have the city council
 
05:13:34.970 --> 05:13:34.980 align:start position:0%
take that job back so that the city
 
05:13:38.150 --> 05:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
council was making the appointments
 
05:13:40.850 --> 05:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
not just one individual making all three
 
05:13:40.860 --> 05:13:41.990 align:start position:0%
not just one individual making all three
appointments

05:13:41.990 --> 05:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
appointments
 
05:13:48.110 --> 05:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:53.150 --> 05:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:53.160 --> 05:13:54.948 align:start position:0%
 
ideas

05:13:54.948 --> 05:13:54.958 align:start position:0%

05:13:56.810 --> 05:13:56.820 align:start position:0%

so I'm going to make a motion
 
05:17:14.390 --> 05:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
for an amendment
 
05:17:16.730 --> 05:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
like I told you about
 
05:17:23.288 --> 05:17:23.298 align:start position:0%

2021-0092h as in Hotel
 
05:17:29.810 --> 05:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
this amendment is a simple event changes
 
05:17:33.170 --> 05:17:33.180 align:start position:0%
the terms from Lemonade Stand to uh soft
 
05:17:35.510 --> 05:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
drink stand
 
05:17:38.330 --> 05:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
so that uh
 
05:17:40.310 --> 05:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
well let's leave it at that if you want
 
05:17:42.708 --> 05:17:42.718 align:start position:0%
to have discussion we can
 
05:17:44.750 --> 05:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
so I want to make a motion
 
05:17:49.070 --> 05:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
um to amend the bill as I just indicated
 
05:17:50.868 --> 05:17:50.878 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
05:17:53.410 --> 05:17:53.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:17:56.810 --> 05:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
any discussion on the amendment
 
05:17:56.820 --> 05:17:59.990 align:start position:0%
any discussion on the amendment
yes

05:17:59.990 --> 05:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:00.000 --> 05:18:00.650 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:18:00.650 --> 05:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:18:02.448 --> 05:18:02.458 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair thank you I think the
 
05:18:04.070 --> 05:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
amendment makes the bill better so I'm
 
05:18:06.170 --> 05:18:06.180 align:start position:0%
going to be supporting it
 
05:18:09.890 --> 05:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:11.990 --> 05:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
you just have a process question so
 
05:18:13.250 --> 05:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
first we're going to vote on the
 
05:18:15.410 --> 05:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
amendment and then we vote on the
 
05:18:16.730 --> 05:18:16.740 align:start position:0%
amended bill
 
05:18:22.788 --> 05:18:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:26.708 --> 05:18:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:30.770 --> 05:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:33.708 --> 05:18:33.718 align:start position:0%
what about Girl Scouts
 
05:18:37.250 --> 05:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
no there'll be no Girl Scouts I'm
 
05:18:37.260 --> 05:18:41.810 align:start position:0%
no there'll be no Girl Scouts I'm
serious

05:18:41.810 --> 05:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:45.770 --> 05:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
and it seems to single out one type of
 
05:18:45.780 --> 05:18:49.128 align:start position:0%
and it seems to single out one type of
activity

05:18:49.128 --> 05:18:49.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:51.410 --> 05:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
out of a range of activities that are
 
05:18:53.830 --> 05:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
similar in nature
 
05:18:57.890 --> 05:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
and carves out an exception for those
 
05:19:00.230 --> 05:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
for that one activity it just it seems
 
05:19:03.890 --> 05:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
it seems frivolous to me yes in the fact
 
05:19:06.708 --> 05:19:06.718 align:start position:0%
that it could be said this is a
 
05:19:09.530 --> 05:19:09.540 align:start position:0%
a solution looking for a problem uh I
 
05:19:10.970 --> 05:19:10.980 align:start position:0%
don't have any uh
 
05:19:13.788 --> 05:19:13.798 align:start position:0%
any indication that law enforcement has
 
05:19:13.798 --> 05:19:15.050 align:start position:0%
any indication that law enforcement has
been

05:19:15.050 --> 05:19:15.060 align:start position:0%
been
 
05:19:16.550 --> 05:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh I've seen any of our young people
 
05:19:19.368 --> 05:19:19.378 align:start position:0%
around this issue but this is this is a
 
05:19:23.628 --> 05:19:23.638 align:start position:0%
this is what it is uh I've amended it to
 
05:19:26.270 --> 05:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
try to clean it up a bit from just the
 
05:19:28.368 --> 05:19:28.378 align:start position:0%
lemonade stand because
 
05:19:32.150 --> 05:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
they want to sell water or Coke or
 
05:19:34.368 --> 05:19:34.378 align:start position:0%
Kool-Aid or whatever that fixes that
 
05:19:36.530 --> 05:19:36.540 align:start position:0%
part but I I understand I think we would
 
05:19:38.750 --> 05:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh if you want to uh
 
05:19:41.570 --> 05:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
submit a bill for bake sales for our
 
05:19:44.270 --> 05:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
next session I think that we could do
 
05:19:46.030 --> 05:19:46.040 align:start position:0%
that as well
 
05:19:46.040 --> 05:19:47.708 align:start position:0%
that as well
representative

05:19:47.708 --> 05:19:47.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:19:50.570 --> 05:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
comment yeah I just want to say this is
 
05:19:53.208 --> 05:19:53.218 align:start position:0%
uh basically for the kids
 
05:19:55.670 --> 05:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
um you know I I don't know
 
05:19:57.410 --> 05:19:57.420 align:start position:0%
see you guys except
 
05:20:00.110 --> 05:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
the Miss representative Guthrie is older
 
05:20:01.550 --> 05:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
than I but
 
05:20:04.250 --> 05:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
um when I was a kid they we just have a
 
05:20:06.530 --> 05:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
lemonade stand five cents a cup or
 
05:20:09.110 --> 05:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
whatever the thing was and uh that's all
 
05:20:11.570 --> 05:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
this is for it isn't for anything else
 
05:20:14.090 --> 05:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
it's giving them some recognition I know
 
05:20:16.070 --> 05:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
the Boy Scouts can do it the Girl Scouts
 
05:20:17.150 --> 05:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
can do it
 
05:20:19.610 --> 05:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
there's uh I haven't seen and I'm
 
05:20:21.190 --> 05:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
nothing against your big sales
 
05:20:24.110 --> 05:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
representative Stuyvesant but I haven't
 
05:20:27.430 --> 05:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:30.470 --> 05:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
so uh maybe it could be with another
 
05:20:32.330 --> 05:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
bill for next year and I would support
 
05:20:34.970 --> 05:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
that I'll let you know right now
 
05:20:37.070 --> 05:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
all right and I'll uh I'll use the front
 
05:20:39.170 --> 05:20:39.180 align:start position:0%
the French pronunciation uh for
 
05:20:47.090 --> 05:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:50.390 --> 05:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh I think this bill is frivolous I
 
05:20:52.070 --> 05:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
think it's a waste of our time it was a
 
05:20:53.868 --> 05:20:53.878 align:start position:0%
waste of our time last year it's a waste
 
05:20:56.390 --> 05:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
of our time this year to understand what
 
05:20:59.208 --> 05:20:59.218 align:start position:0%
representative Porter said Thoth drinks
 
05:21:01.850 --> 05:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
his broader than just lemonade stands
 
05:21:03.708 --> 05:21:03.718 align:start position:0%
but you know this is trying to take us
 
05:21:05.448 --> 05:21:05.458 align:start position:0%
back to an Era that we're not in anymore
 
05:21:07.910 --> 05:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
stop wasting my time I'll be quoting new
 
05:21:07.920 --> 05:21:09.288 align:start position:0%
stop wasting my time I'll be quoting new
things

05:21:09.288 --> 05:21:09.298 align:start position:0%
things
 
05:21:09.298 --> 05:21:10.550 align:start position:0%
things
okay

05:21:10.550 --> 05:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:21:13.070 --> 05:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative clay
 
05:21:14.990 --> 05:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:21:16.970 --> 05:21:16.980 align:start position:0%
um I I have similar
 
05:21:20.330 --> 05:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
um uh comments as as the last speaker
 
05:21:22.430 --> 05:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
um I I fear the unintended consequences
 
05:21:25.190 --> 05:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
I agree that this is for the children
 
05:21:28.128 --> 05:21:28.138 align:start position:0%
um I also agree with the with Mr
 
05:21:29.810 --> 05:21:29.820 align:start position:0%
chairman which you had mentioned a
 
05:21:33.350 --> 05:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
solution in search of a problem
 
05:21:35.570 --> 05:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
from what I've been able to investigate
 
05:21:37.250 --> 05:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
and so on I haven't seen anything that's
 
05:21:38.448 --> 05:21:38.458 align:start position:0%
happened throughout our country in
 
05:21:41.090 --> 05:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
almost 10 years I am afraid that what
 
05:21:43.010 --> 05:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
it'll do is it'll give license to those
 
05:21:46.550 --> 05:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
who want to put children in front of a
 
05:21:49.430 --> 05:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
um a professional lemonade stand and
 
05:21:51.530 --> 05:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
they're running it and then all the
 
05:21:53.750 --> 05:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
money becomes non-taxable and while I
 
05:21:55.490 --> 05:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
agree that we think well it'll only be
 
05:21:57.948 --> 05:21:57.958 align:start position:0%
50 cents or 25 cents that would be yes
 
05:22:00.288 --> 05:22:00.298 align:start position:0%
for children's Lemonade Stand but if
 
05:22:02.810 --> 05:22:02.820 align:start position:0%
they put it at a race or in front of a
 
05:22:05.810 --> 05:22:05.820 align:start position:0%
ballpark or something to that nature we
 
05:22:07.550 --> 05:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
really could be going down a slippery
 
05:22:07.560 --> 05:22:08.930 align:start position:0%
really could be going down a slippery
slope

05:22:08.930 --> 05:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
slope
 
05:22:11.570 --> 05:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
um and then people are going to turn
 
05:22:12.830 --> 05:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
around and say well but what is this
 
05:22:14.090 --> 05:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
what are that you know whether it's the
 
05:22:16.368 --> 05:22:16.378 align:start position:0%
bake sales okay so the children that
 
05:22:18.890 --> 05:22:18.900 align:start position:0%
made brownies to go with it and
 
05:22:21.530 --> 05:22:21.540 align:start position:0%
I I guess I'm just I'm starting to get a
 
05:22:23.510 --> 05:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
little concerned about it and while I'm
 
05:22:25.310 --> 05:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
still new on this committee I think I
 
05:22:27.948 --> 05:22:27.958 align:start position:0%
have to vote against this one slippery
 
05:22:30.770 --> 05:22:30.780 align:start position:0%
slope be greased by Lemonade hold on a
 
05:22:34.010 --> 05:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
second administratively we are now
 
05:22:35.868 --> 05:22:35.878 align:start position:0%
presented with a motion for the
 
05:22:37.910 --> 05:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
amendment when we're not we're not
 
05:22:40.368 --> 05:22:40.378 align:start position:0%
talking about the bill as amended yet
 
05:22:42.110 --> 05:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
which is just for the amendment to
 
05:22:44.810 --> 05:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
change lemonade to soft drinks at this
 
05:22:47.090 --> 05:22:47.100 align:start position:0%
point so if those of you have your hands
 
05:22:48.890 --> 05:22:48.900 align:start position:0%
up if you still want to talk just about
 
05:22:52.430 --> 05:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
the amendment then uh we'll go for that
 
05:22:54.708 --> 05:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
so uh representative Porter
 
05:22:57.170 --> 05:22:57.180 align:start position:0%
I just want to urge my colleagues here
 
05:23:00.590 --> 05:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
that the amendment makes the bill better
 
05:23:03.948 --> 05:23:03.958 align:start position:0%
and if the bill is to pass without the
 
05:23:03.958 --> 05:23:04.970 align:start position:0%
and if the bill is to pass without the
amendment

05:23:04.970 --> 05:23:04.980 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:23:09.470 --> 05:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
that's doing I think harm so that's why
 
05:23:12.288 --> 05:23:12.298 align:start position:0%
I would urge us to vote for the
 
05:23:13.850 --> 05:23:13.860 align:start position:0%
amendment and then deal with the bill
 
05:23:16.550 --> 05:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
separately as amended
 
05:23:20.930 --> 05:23:20.940 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Moody I will
 
05:23:25.910 --> 05:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
hold my comment for uh octopus amended
 
05:23:25.920 --> 05:23:27.230 align:start position:0%
hold my comment for uh octopus amended
okay

05:23:27.230 --> 05:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:23:30.470 --> 05:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh seeing no other hands up well we have
 
05:23:33.350 --> 05:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
a motion for an amendment with a second
 
05:23:36.288 --> 05:23:36.298 align:start position:0%
and that's the the clerk to take the
 
05:23:38.510 --> 05:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
role okay this is going to be roll-off
 
05:23:44.570 --> 05:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:48.770 --> 05:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:48.780 --> 05:23:50.690 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:23:50.690 --> 05:23:50.700 align:start position:0%

representative Gallagher

05:25:01.730 --> 05:25:01.740 align:start position:0%
motion passes 18-0 I like to make a
 
05:25:03.770 --> 05:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
motion the
 
05:25:03.780 --> 05:25:04.670 align:start position:0%
motion the
OTP

05:25:04.670 --> 05:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
OTP
 
05:25:07.550 --> 05:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
us Bill 183 as amended
 
05:25:10.368 --> 05:25:10.378 align:start position:0%
exactly Mr chairman
 
05:25:13.010 --> 05:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
was that representative McBride yes Mr
 
05:25:13.020 --> 05:25:15.830 align:start position:0%
was that representative McBride yes Mr
chairman

05:25:15.830 --> 05:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:18.708 --> 05:25:18.718 align:start position:0%
uh and asked the clerk is there any
 
05:25:23.810 --> 05:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
discussion as amended yes president yes
 
05:25:26.690 --> 05:25:26.700 align:start position:0%
um I think this is a bell that is
 
05:25:28.910 --> 05:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
looking uh solution looking for a
 
05:25:31.868 --> 05:25:31.878 align:start position:0%
problem so I really cannot support it
 
05:25:35.810 --> 05:25:35.820 align:start position:0%
and uh even though it uh your Amendment
 
05:25:39.110 --> 05:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
did make the bill a little better it's
 
05:25:41.448 --> 05:25:41.458 align:start position:0%
still you know my neighborhood kids sell
 
05:25:44.868 --> 05:25:44.878 align:start position:0%
lemonade and cookies in their front yard
 
05:25:47.270 --> 05:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
so now I have to go say no you can't
 
05:25:49.128 --> 05:25:49.138 align:start position:0%
sell the cookies you can only sell the
 
05:25:52.368 --> 05:25:52.378 align:start position:0%
lemonade or water so it just does not
 
05:25:55.368 --> 05:25:55.378 align:start position:0%
make sense so I will be voting again
 
05:25:57.530 --> 05:25:57.540 align:start position:0%
representative Porter
 
05:26:00.190 --> 05:26:00.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:26:03.770 --> 05:26:03.780 align:start position:0%
beside from the fact that with some of
 
05:26:05.510 --> 05:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
us think it's a frivolous bill I think
 
05:26:08.150 --> 05:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
it was uh Cordell Johnston's testimony
 
05:26:09.890 --> 05:26:09.900 align:start position:0%
that kind of struck me
 
05:26:14.510 --> 05:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
if a kid puts up his lemonade stand in a
 
05:26:16.850 --> 05:26:16.860 align:start position:0%
dangerous place
 
05:26:20.030 --> 05:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
this bill would prevent
 
05:26:23.150 --> 05:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
the authorities from interfering with
 
05:26:26.448 --> 05:26:26.458 align:start position:0%
him which means they would they can't go
 
05:26:28.368 --> 05:26:28.378 align:start position:0%
and tell them to please move or if they
 
05:26:30.470 --> 05:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
did they would be violating
 
05:26:33.230 --> 05:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
this this that we're passing I think
 
05:26:35.510 --> 05:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's a concern it's not just we don't
 
05:26:37.250 --> 05:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
want the selling the lemonade but if
 
05:26:39.050 --> 05:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
they're in a dangerous situation there's
 
05:26:40.610 --> 05:26:40.620 align:start position:0%
no adult supervision and the police
 
05:26:43.010 --> 05:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
officer's hands are tied because you
 
05:26:45.230 --> 05:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
can't go and help to move the child to a
 
05:26:48.350 --> 05:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
safer place that's a concern so just to
 
05:26:49.788 --> 05:26:49.798 align:start position:0%
throw that out there
 
05:26:52.730 --> 05:26:52.740 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mantiardi
 
05:26:54.410 --> 05:26:54.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:26:56.628 --> 05:26:56.638 align:start position:0%
um one of the members of uh former
 
05:26:58.190 --> 05:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
Selectmen here in Northampton and a
 
05:27:00.470 --> 05:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
member of the planning board said says
 
05:27:02.930 --> 05:27:02.940 align:start position:0%
continues to say so often after 15 years
 
05:27:04.730 --> 05:27:04.740 align:start position:0%
we don't understand the consequences of
 
05:27:07.070 --> 05:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
our actions until they're tested I just
 
05:27:09.230 --> 05:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
have to feel I I just feel and I've seen
 
05:27:11.390 --> 05:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
it time and time again the minute we put
 
05:27:14.090 --> 05:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
something down on paper people test the
 
05:27:16.310 --> 05:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
limits I and I'll repeat then
 
05:27:18.050 --> 05:27:18.060 align:start position:0%
unfortunately what I've heard I just
 
05:27:20.150 --> 05:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
think we're creating a solution for a
 
05:27:21.590 --> 05:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
problem that doesn't exist but then
 
05:27:23.810 --> 05:27:23.820 align:start position:0%
maybe May suddenly bubble up to the
 
05:27:25.550 --> 05:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
surface with all due respect to the
 
05:27:29.350 --> 05:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
positive things that this may may
 
05:27:32.628 --> 05:27:32.638 align:start position:0%
prevent or give us a way out of so
 
05:27:35.270 --> 05:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I'll be voting against
 
05:27:35.280 --> 05:27:38.330 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I'll be voting against
okay

05:27:38.330 --> 05:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:38.340 --> 05:27:41.270 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:27:41.270 --> 05:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:43.550 --> 05:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
you lowered your own hand it's so
 
05:27:46.030 --> 05:27:46.040 align:start position:0%
technically smart
 
05:27:51.170 --> 05:27:51.180 align:start position:0%
okay so we have a emotion
 
05:27:54.770 --> 05:27:54.780 align:start position:0%
to OTP as amended for House Bill 183 I
 
05:27:57.350 --> 05:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
asked the clerk to take the role
 
05:27:59.990 --> 05:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
KGB 183 you ought to pass uh
 
05:28:03.230 --> 05:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
representative Piemonte yes as amended
 
05:28:05.990 --> 05:28:06.000 align:start position:0%

05:33:53.690 --> 05:33:53.700 align:start position:0%

05:34:02.510 --> 05:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
recollection of retaining this bill in
 
05:34:04.610 --> 05:34:04.620 align:start position:0%

05:34:09.910 --> 05:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
I guess the answer is no
 
05:34:11.930 --> 05:34:11.940 align:start position:0%
representative Porter
 
05:34:14.030 --> 05:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
I do remember and I thank you Mr chair I
 
05:34:15.590 --> 05:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
do remember in our discussions however
 
05:34:20.090 --> 05:34:20.100 align:start position:0%
that the municipal Association uh had a
 
05:34:22.190 --> 05:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
came out against it and they wanted to
 
05:34:24.410 --> 05:34:24.420 align:start position:0%
just work with the um with the sponsor
 
05:34:26.628 --> 05:34:26.638 align:start position:0%
of the bill to fix the language that
 
05:34:28.670 --> 05:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
they had concerns about
 
05:34:30.590 --> 05:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
um and so I'm wondering if that
 
05:34:33.350 --> 05:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment came through
 
05:34:33.360 --> 05:34:34.368 align:start position:0%
Amendment came through
um

05:34:34.368 --> 05:34:34.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:38.090 --> 05:34:38.100 align:start position:0%
it would concern me if the if the
 
05:34:40.970 --> 05:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
municipal Association had a concern and
 
05:34:43.430 --> 05:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
hasn't been addressed
 
05:34:45.470 --> 05:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
okay now I'm not aware of an amendment
 
05:34:49.010 --> 05:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
coming through on on 332.
 
05:34:52.730 --> 05:34:52.740 align:start position:0%
thank you that was the thing that was
 
05:34:56.570 --> 05:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
stuck in my head there was something to
 
05:34:59.930 --> 05:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
yeah that was uh represent uh Mr Gray
 
05:35:02.510 --> 05:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
was the representative from nhma that
 
05:35:05.868 --> 05:35:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:09.590 --> 05:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I'm sorry to jump in and uh
 
05:35:14.030 --> 05:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
there is an email that we got yesterday
 
05:35:16.788 --> 05:35:16.798 align:start position:0%
about 3 32.
 
05:35:19.610 --> 05:35:19.620 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
05:35:22.910 --> 05:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't it it doesn't seem to say
 
05:35:22.920 --> 05:35:24.230 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't it it doesn't seem to say
that

05:35:24.230 --> 05:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:35:27.110 --> 05:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
an amendment is going to be forthcoming
 
05:35:30.170 --> 05:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
now my reading of that excuse me sorry
 
05:35:33.110 --> 05:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
my reading of that email was that in
 
05:35:36.110 --> 05:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
fact the sponsor believed that the bill
 
05:35:39.170 --> 05:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
as written really did answer the
 
05:35:43.730 --> 05:35:43.740 align:start position:0%
question brought up by the person who
 
05:35:45.890 --> 05:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
um the new the municipal Association
 
05:35:48.410 --> 05:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
person right
 
05:35:50.628 --> 05:35:50.638 align:start position:0%
so I think their plan is that we should
 
05:35:53.448 --> 05:35:53.458 align:start position:0%
vote on the bill as proposed
 
05:35:58.070 --> 05:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:00.050 --> 05:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
um so just uh
 
05:36:03.590 --> 05:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
um lend or con contribute to what the
 
05:36:06.410 --> 05:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
discussion here my notes say that natch
 
05:36:08.810 --> 05:36:08.820 align:start position:0%

05:36:08.820 --> 05:36:10.670 align:start position:0%

05:36:10.670 --> 05:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
Association
 
05:36:13.250 --> 05:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
um opposed the bill as written and he
 
05:36:16.010 --> 05:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
offered to work with the sponsor but
 
05:36:17.750 --> 05:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
he's willing to do
 
05:36:19.970 --> 05:36:19.980 align:start position:0%
um whatever the sponsor wants to do as
 
05:36:23.090 --> 05:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
far as an amendment so that's what my
 
05:36:24.230 --> 05:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
notes say
 
05:36:28.430 --> 05:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh Porter but
 
05:36:29.868 --> 05:36:29.878 align:start position:0%
the sponsor
 
05:36:33.470 --> 05:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
refuse the offer yes I believe that's
 
05:36:35.270 --> 05:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
correct I mean that's how I read the
 
05:36:37.670 --> 05:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
email so
 
05:36:41.090 --> 05:36:41.100 align:start position:0%
I guess that's my concern if I if I had
 
05:36:42.530 --> 05:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
her if we had heard from the municipal
 
05:36:44.930 --> 05:36:44.940 align:start position:0%
Association that they had conferred with
 
05:36:47.270 --> 05:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
the sponsor and agreed with the sponsor
 
05:36:50.208 --> 05:36:50.218 align:start position:0%
that they had Mis misunderstood I would
 
05:36:52.368 --> 05:36:52.378 align:start position:0%
feel a little more comfortable but that
 
05:36:54.530 --> 05:36:54.540 align:start position:0%
that's not how I read the email
 
05:36:58.310 --> 05:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
representative yeah that my my reading
 
05:37:02.208 --> 05:37:02.218 align:start position:0%
was also similar there is the prime
 
05:37:02.218 --> 05:37:03.708 align:start position:0%
was also similar there is the prime
sponsor

05:37:03.708 --> 05:37:03.718 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
05:37:08.890 --> 05:37:08.900 align:start position:0%
was offered uh collaboration from nhma
 
05:37:12.890 --> 05:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
and that was not received so to me it
 
05:37:19.910 --> 05:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:22.730 --> 05:37:22.740 align:start position:0%
uh is that representative McBride yeah
 
05:37:25.430 --> 05:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Mr chairman I spoke without
 
05:37:26.930 --> 05:37:26.940 align:start position:0%
planning director specifically about
 
05:37:29.208 --> 05:37:29.218 align:start position:0%
this bill and he specifically told me he
 
05:37:31.310 --> 05:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
had no problems at all with it
 
05:37:34.788 --> 05:37:34.798 align:start position:0%
okay representative maggiori
 
05:37:36.650 --> 05:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
oh thank you I was just going to
 
05:37:38.510 --> 05:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
reiterate what everybody what
 
05:37:40.128 --> 05:37:40.138 align:start position:0%
everybody's saying and by quoting what's
 
05:37:41.868 --> 05:37:41.878 align:start position:0%
in the email it says I feel that the
 
05:37:43.310 --> 05:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
requested changes to the bill are
 
05:37:45.350 --> 05:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
addressing a different intent that what
 
05:37:47.510 --> 05:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
was then what is in this bill as
 
05:37:50.090 --> 05:37:50.100 align:start position:0%
submitted that seems an indication that
 
05:37:52.368 --> 05:37:52.378 align:start position:0%
we won't be receiving an amendment thank
 
05:37:55.730 --> 05:37:55.740 align:start position:0%

Municipal Association something
 
05:38:53.700 --> 05:38:55.490 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association something
different

representative majority
 
05:39:09.410 --> 05:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
no for the same reasons that I heard
 
05:39:11.570 --> 05:39:11.580 align:start position:0%
from representative Porter
 
05:39:13.730 --> 05:39:13.740 align:start position:0%
Representatives Davis

representative mangaputi no for the same
 
05:39:20.040 --> 05:39:21.770 align:start position:0%
representative mangaputi no for the same
reason

05:39:21.770 --> 05:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
reason
 
05:39:28.550 --> 05:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:34.670 --> 05:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:36.770 --> 05:39:36.780 align:start position:0%
representative Klee
 
05:39:36.780 --> 05:39:40.010 align:start position:0%
representative Klee
no

05:39:40.010 --> 05:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:43.910 --> 05:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:43.920 --> 05:39:47.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:39:47.150 --> 05:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:47.160 --> 05:39:51.288 align:start position:0%
 
no

05:39:51.288 --> 05:39:51.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:02.208 --> 05:40:02.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:07.010 --> 05:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:11.390 --> 05:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair when when a motion is tied like
 
05:40:15.948 --> 05:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:19.070 --> 05:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
and that means that the floor the house
 
05:40:23.270 --> 05:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
is full body makes the determination
 
05:40:25.730 --> 05:40:25.740 align:start position:0%
um we could have another vote on a
 
05:40:27.890 --> 05:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
different motion maybe and it might
 
05:40:32.270 --> 05:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
change the vote you are correct
 
05:40:34.670 --> 05:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
what is the feeling of the uh of the
 
05:40:36.110 --> 05:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
community do you want to
 
05:40:38.810 --> 05:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
try a different motion or do you want to
 
05:40:44.150 --> 05:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:46.550 --> 05:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
you could do a motion to ICL you could
 
05:40:48.590 --> 05:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
do a motion to retain
 
05:40:51.770 --> 05:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
should we not could we not retain in
 
05:40:53.690 --> 05:40:53.700 align:start position:0%
some fashion
 
05:40:58.550 --> 05:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
and seek more clarity from nhma
 
05:41:00.708 --> 05:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
we can but the bill won't come back up
 
05:41:03.948 --> 05:41:03.958 align:start position:0%
until uh the next year
 
05:41:07.910 --> 05:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair could we ask Christina perhaps
 
05:41:12.470 --> 05:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
she has a knowledge of procedure that we
 
05:41:15.230 --> 05:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
don't have maybe oh you said it
 
05:41:15.240 --> 05:41:16.250 align:start position:0%
don't have maybe oh you said it
correctly

05:41:16.250 --> 05:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
05:41:19.430 --> 05:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
um if you can either take a motion
 
05:41:21.470 --> 05:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
um another motion
 
05:41:23.750 --> 05:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
um if you'd like
 
05:41:27.170 --> 05:41:27.180 align:start position:0%
are you asking about retaining what was
 
05:41:29.810 --> 05:41:29.820 align:start position:0%
your question the question is can we
 
05:41:31.788 --> 05:41:31.798 align:start position:0%
take another motion if if you're saying
 
05:41:35.150 --> 05:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
we can then that might be a wise way to
 
05:41:38.390 --> 05:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
go or put it up for the house to vote
 
05:41:40.970 --> 05:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
okay that's my opinion I'm sorry
 
05:41:44.628 --> 05:41:44.638 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Guthrie uh if we do
 
05:41:47.150 --> 05:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
take no action just refer to our whole
 
05:41:49.850 --> 05:41:49.860 align:start position:0%
body without a recommendation between
 
05:41:52.190 --> 05:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
now and when it comes before the house
 
05:41:54.230 --> 05:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
we may have something right now more
 
05:41:54.240 --> 05:41:55.570 align:start position:0%
we may have something right now more
yeah

05:41:55.570 --> 05:41:55.580 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:41:58.190 --> 05:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
and explain that
 
05:42:01.570 --> 05:42:01.580 align:start position:0%
and let the House vote yeah that's true
 
05:42:05.448 --> 05:42:05.458 align:start position:0%
retain and that's right I believe that
 
05:42:07.788 --> 05:42:07.798 align:start position:0%
um if if we keep the nine to nine vote
 
05:42:09.770 --> 05:42:09.780 align:start position:0%
and refer it to the house without a
 
05:42:09.780 --> 05:42:11.030 align:start position:0%
and refer it to the house without a
recommendation

05:42:11.030 --> 05:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
05:42:13.250 --> 05:42:13.260 align:start position:0%
uh we can
 
05:42:14.868 --> 05:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
during the debate
 
05:42:19.070 --> 05:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
in the we can talk talk to it but we
 
05:42:21.350 --> 05:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
can't change the vote I understand that
 
05:42:23.470 --> 05:42:23.480 align:start position:0%
but the house the house
 
05:42:27.128 --> 05:42:27.138 align:start position:0%
right so it'll give them an opportunity
 
05:42:30.530 --> 05:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
concern seems like the concern of most
 
05:42:35.930 --> 05:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
of the members that voted no was that
 
05:42:38.690 --> 05:42:38.700 align:start position:0%
they were not clear about what was
 
05:42:41.990 --> 05:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
coming from a municipal government uh
 
05:42:44.868 --> 05:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association and I think that
 
05:42:48.410 --> 05:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
that way we could uh at least not moves
 
05:42:51.470 --> 05:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
the bill if in fact this does do what I
 
05:42:54.590 --> 05:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
think it does uh it's a housekeeping
 
05:42:57.050 --> 05:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
bill it happens to be one of the close
 
05:42:59.930 --> 05:42:59.940 align:start position:0%
points is my senator
 
05:43:03.050 --> 05:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair I do have a question or uh
 
05:43:03.060 --> 05:43:04.368 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair I do have a question or uh
Christina

05:43:04.368 --> 05:43:04.378 align:start position:0%
Christina
 
05:43:08.090 --> 05:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
could we recess this executive session
 
05:43:10.190 --> 05:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
05:43:12.410 --> 05:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
and bring it back the next time we meet
 
05:43:14.990 --> 05:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
and maybe someone reach out and see
 
05:43:17.208 --> 05:43:17.218 align:start position:0%
what's happening from the municipal
 
05:43:21.288 --> 05:43:21.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:23.330 --> 05:43:23.340 align:start position:0%
I don't believe we can because we've
 
05:43:25.070 --> 05:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
already taken a vote
 
05:43:29.090 --> 05:43:29.100 align:start position:0%
okay I don't know that's why I asked
 
05:43:32.690 --> 05:43:32.700 align:start position:0%
you choose to keep it without a
 
05:43:34.250 --> 05:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
recommendation you'll just have to write
 
05:43:36.770 --> 05:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
two reports one for the motion or one
 
05:43:42.010 --> 05:43:42.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:44.690 --> 05:43:44.700 align:start position:0%
for writing those up
 
05:43:44.700 --> 05:43:46.070 align:start position:0%
for writing those up
yeah

05:43:46.070 --> 05:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:43:48.590 --> 05:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
representative you want to write up why
 
05:43:50.990 --> 05:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't uh no no no I'm just trying
 
05:43:53.150 --> 05:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
to say you know considering that we are
 
05:43:55.368 --> 05:43:55.378 align:start position:0%
in the middle of a pandemic and we are
 
05:43:58.670 --> 05:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
trying to conserve the time and effort
 
05:44:04.030 --> 05:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
that we put in as a full member and
 
05:44:07.548 --> 05:44:07.558 align:start position:0%
in a session I'm thinking you know if we
 
05:44:11.930 --> 05:44:11.940 align:start position:0%
retain and work it at least it's much
 
05:44:15.708 --> 05:44:15.718 align:start position:0%
clearer the reason I voted no was it it
 
05:44:19.490 --> 05:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
didn't feel complete we hadn't done it
 
05:44:22.250 --> 05:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
one of my options is to retain
 
05:44:24.770 --> 05:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
if we take a new vote we can take a new
 
05:44:27.530 --> 05:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
vote to itl or a vote to retain yeah
 
05:44:30.110 --> 05:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
that was I was thinking uh take a new
 
05:44:32.208 --> 05:44:32.218 align:start position:0%
vote that's my thing
 
05:44:34.128 --> 05:44:34.138 align:start position:0%
uh representative clay you have a
 
05:44:34.138 --> 05:44:36.890 align:start position:0%
uh representative clay you have a
recommendation

05:44:36.890 --> 05:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:38.810 --> 05:44:38.820 align:start position:0%
I'm not so sure about a recommendation
 
05:44:42.170 --> 05:44:42.180 align:start position:0%
in um maybe I'm just not quite
 
05:44:45.350 --> 05:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
understanding is retain the only option
 
05:44:47.570 --> 05:44:47.580 align:start position:0%
is there a way of just um
 
05:44:49.788 --> 05:44:49.798 align:start position:0%
I know we've taken a vote in it and it's
 
05:44:52.610 --> 05:44:52.620 align:start position:0%
tied so is itl or retained the only
 
05:44:55.730 --> 05:44:55.740 align:start position:0%
option that we have is there a way of
 
05:44:55.740 --> 05:44:57.230 align:start position:0%
option that we have is there a way of
um

05:44:57.230 --> 05:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:59.330 --> 05:44:59.340 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to use the word table but
 
05:45:01.250 --> 05:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
I guess that is kind of what I am
 
05:45:03.770 --> 05:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
basically hold it not for next year but
 
05:45:06.590 --> 05:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
hold it for as as representative Porter
 
05:45:09.410 --> 05:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
said maybe our next meeting or something
 
05:45:12.350 --> 05:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
to that nature that's just I want to
 
05:45:13.868 --> 05:45:13.878 align:start position:0%
know that ability
 
05:45:16.368 --> 05:45:16.378 align:start position:0%
then a motion to table would not be in
 
05:45:16.378 --> 05:45:17.570 align:start position:0%
then a motion to table would not be in
order

05:45:17.570 --> 05:45:17.580 align:start position:0%
order
 
05:45:20.990 --> 05:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:25.850 --> 05:45:25.860 align:start position:0%
yes are either itl retain or no
 
05:45:25.860 --> 05:45:27.788 align:start position:0%
yes are either itl retain or no
recommendation

05:45:27.788 --> 05:45:27.798 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
05:45:31.368 --> 05:45:31.378 align:start position:0%
was that Christina yes can you repeat
 
05:45:36.230 --> 05:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
that so your options are itl retain or
 
05:45:38.990 --> 05:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:40.610 --> 05:45:40.620 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald
 
05:45:42.890 --> 05:45:42.900 align:start position:0%
I'll do a motion to itl
 
05:45:45.770 --> 05:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
well before I accept that motion I have
 
05:45:47.510 --> 05:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
some additional discussion that I think
 
05:45:50.470 --> 05:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
I want to take first uh
 
05:45:53.810 --> 05:45:53.820 align:start position:0%
no I was just going to say send it on
 
05:45:55.910 --> 05:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
with no recommendation okay uh
 
05:45:57.948 --> 05:45:57.958 align:start position:0%
representative Maggiore
 
05:45:59.628 --> 05:45:59.638 align:start position:0%
and I was just going to say at this
 
05:46:02.270 --> 05:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
point it's our bill so I I don't want
 
05:46:04.850 --> 05:46:04.860 align:start position:0%
this to sound disrespectful but
 
05:46:08.930 --> 05:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
um but the sponsor now his intent of the
 
05:46:10.788 --> 05:46:10.798 align:start position:0%
bill may be different but we have been
 
05:46:12.708 --> 05:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
presented with an opportunity to
 
05:46:15.530 --> 05:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
actually take his bill have it comport
 
05:46:18.948 --> 05:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
with the law with the help of of nhma so
 
05:46:21.530 --> 05:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
either that be done by I I would say if
 
05:46:23.390 --> 05:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
we can do that through retaining it or
 
05:46:25.850 --> 05:46:25.860 align:start position:0%
through an amendment on the floor I
 
05:46:27.830 --> 05:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
would be good that way but otherwise we
 
05:46:30.708 --> 05:46:30.718 align:start position:0%
we've shown the unwillingness from the
 
05:46:33.110 --> 05:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
sponsor to to change it because he has a
 
05:46:35.930 --> 05:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
different direction for the bill so uh
 
05:46:38.770 --> 05:46:38.780 align:start position:0%
right I think I just see an opportunity
 
05:46:42.610 --> 05:46:42.620 align:start position:0%
Echoes of Representative Guthrie's uh
 
05:46:45.650 --> 05:46:45.660 align:start position:0%
a recommendation which is to send it
 
05:46:47.510 --> 05:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
without send it to the floor nine to
 
05:46:48.948 --> 05:46:48.958 align:start position:0%
nine and then it can be resolved on the
 
05:46:50.628 --> 05:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
floor either with an amendment there or
 
05:46:53.690 --> 05:46:53.700 align:start position:0%
with an explanation
 
05:46:57.110 --> 05:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative van yeah I was just
 
05:46:59.690 --> 05:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
going to say that I I do think that what
 
05:47:01.070 --> 05:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
we should do is send it without a
 
05:47:03.948 --> 05:47:03.958 align:start position:0%
recommendation and if we determine after
 
05:47:05.990 --> 05:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
a conversation with nhma that a floor
 
05:47:08.330 --> 05:47:08.340 align:start position:0%
amendment is in order file a floor
 
05:47:08.340 --> 05:47:09.530 align:start position:0%
amendment is in order file a floor
Amendment

05:47:09.530 --> 05:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
05:47:11.448 --> 05:47:11.458 align:start position:0%
um and deal with it that way I I don't
 
05:47:13.548 --> 05:47:13.558 align:start position:0%
think I think that's our best choice at
 
05:47:14.628 --> 05:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
this point
 
05:47:16.250 --> 05:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
okay do you have one more comment
 
05:47:19.670 --> 05:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:22.850 --> 05:47:22.860 align:start position:0%
I I'm just trying to think about the
 
05:47:25.610 --> 05:47:25.620 align:start position:0%
time and effort that's needed in in a
 
05:47:27.350 --> 05:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
full session and we don't even know
 
05:47:29.750 --> 05:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
where we're going to meet and that kind
 
05:47:32.570 --> 05:47:32.580 align:start position:0%
of stuff so it's just in the interest of
 
05:47:36.708 --> 05:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
time and efficiency I feel like uh this
 
05:47:40.010 --> 05:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
can wait till next time or that's just
 
05:47:41.810 --> 05:47:41.820 align:start position:0%
my my personal
 
05:47:41.820 --> 05:47:44.150 align:start position:0%
my my personal
reporter

05:47:44.150 --> 05:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
reporter
 
05:47:46.610 --> 05:47:46.620 align:start position:0%
if we send it without a motion without a
 
05:47:48.770 --> 05:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
recommendation and come to the house
 
05:47:51.948 --> 05:47:51.958 align:start position:0%
with a floor Amendment then whoever is
 
05:47:55.190 --> 05:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
presenting first which I think the first
 
05:47:58.730 --> 05:47:58.740 align:start position:0%
speaker is the negative you know the itl
 
05:48:01.128 --> 05:48:01.138 align:start position:0%
speaker would be the first speaker
 
05:48:03.708 --> 05:48:03.718 align:start position:0%
um could say we have an amendment and
 
05:48:05.750 --> 05:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
now we're we're recommending that this
 
05:48:08.208 --> 05:48:08.218 align:start position:0%
pass with this amendment or not I think
 
05:48:10.490 --> 05:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
it's an option I think it's a wise
 
05:48:10.500 --> 05:48:12.470 align:start position:0%
it's an option I think it's a wise
option

05:48:12.470 --> 05:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
option
 
05:48:14.270 --> 05:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
it looks like there's no additional
 
05:48:16.670 --> 05:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
comments so I'm inclined to send this
 
05:48:19.190 --> 05:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
forward with a nine to nine vote and if
 
05:48:22.610 --> 05:48:22.620 align:start position:0%
I look for two volunteers one two uh to
 
05:48:24.350 --> 05:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
write up a report
 
05:48:26.868 --> 05:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
that it should be passed and one right
 
05:48:29.030 --> 05:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
upper report it should be itl you have
 
05:48:29.040 --> 05:48:32.030 align:start position:0%
upper report it should be itl you have
volunteers

05:48:32.030 --> 05:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:34.610 --> 05:48:34.620 align:start position:0%
wants to volunteer that it should be itl
 
05:48:38.930 --> 05:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:40.970 --> 05:48:40.980 align:start position:0%

05:48:47.150 --> 05:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
somebody else want to take it
 
05:48:50.628 --> 05:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
I'm sure if I'm going to be there at the
 
05:48:53.150 --> 05:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
full session or not so I don't want to
 
05:48:56.448 --> 05:48:56.458 align:start position:0%
volunteer I would otherwise
 
05:49:00.170 --> 05:49:00.180 align:start position:0%

um
 
05:49:48.230 --> 05:49:48.240 align:start position:0%

05:49:52.368 --> 05:49:52.378 align:start position:0%
looking for that Amendment
 
05:49:55.788 --> 05:49:55.798 align:start position:0%
should that just be a decision among
 
05:49:59.448 --> 05:49:59.458 align:start position:0%
those who voted against that that we'll
 
05:50:01.368 --> 05:50:01.378 align:start position:0%
just assign somebody to go look for that
 
05:50:01.378 --> 05:50:02.530 align:start position:0%
just assign somebody to go look for that
Amendment

05:50:02.530 --> 05:50:02.540 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
05:50:06.770 --> 05:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
those who voted to against it
 
05:50:08.270 --> 05:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
ought to get together and say how do we
 
05:50:10.548 --> 05:50:10.558 align:start position:0%
make this bill better with an amendment
 
05:50:13.310 --> 05:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
and then produce that Amendment and you
 
05:50:17.090 --> 05:50:17.100 align:start position:0%

05:50:18.830 --> 05:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
is enough
 
05:50:21.708 --> 05:50:21.718 align:start position:0%

history and historic perspective and
 
05:55:59.990 --> 05:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
tradition well and alive in New
 
05:56:00.000 --> 05:56:00.708 align:start position:0%

05:56:05.890 --> 05:56:05.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:07.770 --> 05:56:07.780 align:start position:0%

05:56:07.780 --> 05:56:08.990 align:start position:0%
nah forget it
[Music]

05:56:08.990 --> 05:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:56:11.150 --> 05:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna be the only one who votes for
 
05:56:13.250 --> 05:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
it because I think if it's important you
 
05:56:15.350 --> 05:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
do it you do it once you get it right
 
05:56:17.510 --> 05:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
and then you have a bearing to go from
 
05:56:19.910 --> 05:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
and I've been out there in the woods and
 
05:56:21.770 --> 05:56:21.780 align:start position:0%
I've gotten eaten by the mosquitoes and
 
05:56:23.990 --> 05:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna vote for it and there you go
 
05:56:27.230 --> 05:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
darn it give me some lemonade
 
05:56:29.090 --> 05:56:29.100 align:start position:0%
can I jump in there Mr chairman for a
 
05:56:30.890 --> 05:56:30.900 align:start position:0%
minute I think what you need is probably
 
05:56:33.048 --> 05:56:33.058 align:start position:0%
some some off
 
05:56:41.890 --> 05:56:41.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:44.330 --> 05:56:44.340 align:start position:0%
I can't find my raised my hand so I
 
05:56:45.830 --> 05:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
apologize Mr chairman but I agree with
 
05:56:49.490 --> 05:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
with Jim representative uh absolutely I
 
05:56:51.110 --> 05:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
did it I'm the last selectman in the
 
05:56:54.230 --> 05:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
town of Salem in 2007 to walk the bounds
 
05:56:56.570 --> 05:56:56.580 align:start position:0%
and the markers are clear they're there
 
05:56:58.490 --> 05:56:58.500 align:start position:0%
they've never moved some of them they're
 
05:57:02.510 --> 05:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
big Granite markers stamped 1890 and I'm
 
05:57:04.910 --> 05:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
telling you they don't move and the fact
 
05:57:07.128 --> 05:57:07.138 align:start position:0%
is if there is a border dispute then yes
 
05:57:09.350 --> 05:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
you will send somebody out to verify
 
05:57:12.288 --> 05:57:12.298 align:start position:0%
beyond that it's a waste of time and I'm
 
05:57:14.270 --> 05:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
the last election to do it in 2007 we
 
05:57:16.310 --> 05:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
walked the whole town we submitted it
 
05:57:18.410 --> 05:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
it's done and we we pray we did it with
 
05:57:19.910 --> 05:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
the GPS system so that it's all
 
05:57:22.490 --> 05:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
documented in a complete GPS system so
 
05:57:25.670 --> 05:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
again uh we need to go from the 1920s to
 
05:57:27.650 --> 05:57:27.660 align:start position:0%
the 2020s
 
05:57:31.548 --> 05:57:31.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:31.558 --> 05:57:33.350 align:start position:0%
 
I

05:57:33.350 --> 05:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:57:35.090 --> 05:57:35.100 align:start position:0%
guess I would um
 
05:57:37.548 --> 05:57:37.558 align:start position:0%
submit that we should listen to the
 
05:57:37.558 --> 05:57:39.048 align:start position:0%
submit that we should listen to the
licensed

05:57:39.048 --> 05:57:39.058 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
05:57:42.490 --> 05:57:42.500 align:start position:0%
um surveyors they overwhelmingly
 
05:57:46.850 --> 05:57:46.860 align:start position:0%
advocated for this per ambulation it's
 
05:57:51.288 --> 05:57:51.298 align:start position:0%
clearly no substitute for technology and
 
05:57:53.628 --> 05:57:53.638 align:start position:0%
um I think that we should defer to to
 
05:57:55.850 --> 05:57:55.860 align:start position:0%
their advice so
 
05:58:06.128 --> 05:58:06.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:09.590 --> 05:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr uh rep thank you uh Mr
 
05:58:11.750 --> 05:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
chair I couldn't hear you
 
05:58:11.760 --> 05:58:13.190 align:start position:0%
chair I couldn't hear you
um

05:58:13.190 --> 05:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:15.170 --> 05:58:15.180 align:start position:0%
first of all I think we need to all chip
 
05:58:17.868 --> 05:58:17.878 align:start position:0%
in for lemonade to put into king
 
05:58:19.850 --> 05:58:19.860 align:start position:0%
maggiori's crown
 
05:58:22.010 --> 05:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
so he can take lemonade out with him
 
05:58:24.288 --> 05:58:24.298 align:start position:0%
when he prenabulates
 
05:58:26.570 --> 05:58:26.580 align:start position:0%
in his town
 
05:58:28.910 --> 05:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
um I hear you representative McBride
 
05:58:31.250 --> 05:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
loud and clear I know it's a pain in the
 
05:58:32.810 --> 05:58:32.820 align:start position:0%
tush to do it although I've never done
 
05:58:36.048 --> 05:58:36.058 align:start position:0%
it I've just heard uh yet I will not be
 
05:58:37.670 --> 05:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill
 
05:58:40.128 --> 05:58:40.138 align:start position:0%
mainly because one person said in
 
05:58:42.470 --> 05:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
another person echoed it
 
05:58:44.510 --> 05:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
if there's something that you're told
 
05:58:46.788 --> 05:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
you should do but there's nothing that
 
05:58:50.330 --> 05:58:50.340 align:start position:0%
makes you do it then you don't do it so
 
05:58:52.610 --> 05:58:52.620 align:start position:0%
I think we need to say to our cities and
 
05:58:55.010 --> 05:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
towns you best be paying attention to
 
05:58:56.810 --> 05:58:56.820 align:start position:0%
the boundaries every seven years or so
 
05:58:59.930 --> 05:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
it's good for you like lemonade thank
 
05:58:59.940 --> 05:59:04.850 align:start position:0%

hand thing
 
06:09:03.600 --> 06:09:05.090 align:start position:0%
hand thing
um

06:09:05.090 --> 06:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:08.390 --> 06:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
I will be voting against this bill
 
06:09:08.400 --> 06:09:09.288 align:start position:0%
I will be voting against this bill
um

06:09:09.288 --> 06:09:09.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:12.288 --> 06:09:12.298 align:start position:0%
as I vote for against any bill that
 
06:09:16.128 --> 06:09:16.138 align:start position:0%
seeks to be punitive against a local
 
06:09:19.670 --> 06:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
official who's a volunteer and force
 
06:09:22.490 --> 06:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
them to face Court charges that they
 
06:09:24.350 --> 06:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
themselves have to pay for because
 
06:09:25.970 --> 06:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
somebody believes they have done
 
06:09:25.980 --> 06:09:27.110 align:start position:0%
somebody believes they have done
something

06:09:27.110 --> 06:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
something
 
06:09:28.970 --> 06:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
that they don't like
 
06:09:32.868 --> 06:09:32.878 align:start position:0%
um I think it's I think it's a chilling
 
06:09:36.230 --> 06:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
um action to take especially in small
 
06:09:38.510 --> 06:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
towns where we have a hard time finding
 
06:09:41.448 --> 06:09:41.458 align:start position:0%
volunteers for the zero salary positions
 
06:09:43.730 --> 06:09:43.740 align:start position:0%
to know you might be in a position where
 
06:09:45.410 --> 06:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
if you do something someone doesn't like
 
06:09:47.150 --> 06:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
you'll be brought to court and you have
 
06:09:49.208 --> 06:09:49.218 align:start position:0%
to pay for it yourself
 
06:09:52.190 --> 06:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
I also believe because I've served on
 
06:09:55.310 --> 06:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
boards my husband served on boards
 
06:09:57.590 --> 06:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
most of us in this room have served on
 
06:09:59.690 --> 06:09:59.700 align:start position:0%
boards that we don't do things on
 
06:09:59.700 --> 06:10:01.070 align:start position:0%
boards that we don't do things on
purpose

06:10:01.070 --> 06:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
06:10:03.590 --> 06:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
um to be evil and do things against the
 
06:10:05.448 --> 06:10:05.458 align:start position:0%
taxpayers because we're all taxpayers
 
06:10:09.470 --> 06:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
and I think this is just a slap in the
 
06:10:12.590 --> 06:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
face to those people who volunteer their
 
06:10:14.930 --> 06:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
job their time to make their communities
 
06:10:16.850 --> 06:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
better so for that reason I'll be voting
 
06:10:21.948 --> 06:10:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:25.430 --> 06:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
okay I have one question I have to take
 
06:10:28.368 --> 06:10:28.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:31.070 --> 06:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
uh we're in a voting mode for this
 
06:10:31.080 --> 06:10:33.708 align:start position:0%
uh we're in a voting mode for this
executive

06:10:33.708 --> 06:10:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:36.288 --> 06:10:36.298 align:start position:0%
it's my interpretation we cannot pause
 
06:10:36.298 --> 06:10:37.788 align:start position:0%
it's my interpretation we cannot pause
this

06:10:37.788 --> 06:10:37.798 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:10:42.590 --> 06:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:45.830 --> 06:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
Madre I'm putting that to you or anybody
 
06:10:48.288 --> 06:10:48.298 align:start position:0%
I think we're in the voting mode
 
06:10:51.590 --> 06:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
so we cannot pause voting at this time
 
06:10:55.010 --> 06:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:55.020 --> 06:10:56.690 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:10:56.690 --> 06:10:56.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:11:00.230 --> 06:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any comments
 
06:11:03.890 --> 06:11:03.900 align:start position:0%
I do uh Mr chair representative
 
06:11:05.810 --> 06:11:05.820 align:start position:0%
trelelevin here
 
06:11:08.270 --> 06:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm with representative Porter and
 
06:11:10.310 --> 06:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
the part of this bill that gets me the
 
06:11:13.610 --> 06:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
most is the sentence that says upon a
 
06:11:15.288 --> 06:11:15.298 align:start position:0%
good faith belief
 
06:11:19.010 --> 06:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
that a County City town or other local
 
06:11:20.628 --> 06:11:20.638 align:start position:0%
government entity
 
06:11:25.430 --> 06:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
has violated well who's to say what my
 
06:11:28.090 --> 06:11:28.100 align:start position:0%
good faith belief is versus
 
06:11:31.010 --> 06:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
your good faith belief or representative
 
06:11:33.948 --> 06:11:33.958 align:start position:0%
trips good Faithfully for anyone else's
 
06:11:35.690 --> 06:11:35.700 align:start position:0%
good faith belief I think this is a
 
06:11:38.330 --> 06:11:38.340 align:start position:0%
pretty poorly written Bill the amendment
 
06:11:41.030 --> 06:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
May improve it and it may have been well
 
06:11:44.208 --> 06:11:44.218 align:start position:0%
intentioned but it's
 
06:11:46.070 --> 06:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
not a good bill it's long it's
 
06:11:48.470 --> 06:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
complicated and it it does attack
 
06:11:51.770 --> 06:11:51.780 align:start position:0%
individuals unnecessarily who who are
 
06:11:56.330 --> 06:11:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:58.128 --> 06:11:58.138 align:start position:0%
does anybody else want to speak on this
 
06:12:01.070 --> 06:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
I I just want to second that the
 
06:12:04.910 --> 06:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
comments that made by my previous
 
06:12:09.230 --> 06:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:12.770 --> 06:12:12.780 align:start position:0%
um and I think it is very punitive and
 
06:12:15.850 --> 06:12:15.860 align:start position:0%
at times when we need citizen
 
06:12:19.910 --> 06:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
legislators good citizens uh working at
 
06:12:22.270 --> 06:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
all levels of government
 
06:12:26.570 --> 06:12:26.580 align:start position:0%
who live in that fear of being taken to
 
06:12:26.580 --> 06:12:27.530 align:start position:0%
who live in that fear of being taken to
court

06:12:27.530 --> 06:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
court
 
06:12:30.350 --> 06:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
because somebody else's good faith is
 
06:12:34.490 --> 06:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
not my good thing so that is hitting one
 
06:12:38.270 --> 06:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
against the other and um that's not this
 
06:12:40.910 --> 06:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
is not the time for it and I would not
 
06:12:44.868 --> 06:12:44.878 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative plee
 
06:12:48.110 --> 06:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair um my I guess my
 
06:12:50.570 --> 06:12:50.580 align:start position:0%
comment is I I'm almost just saying
 
06:12:52.910 --> 06:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
ditto but I can say that as being an
 
06:12:54.948 --> 06:12:54.958 align:start position:0%
alderman in Nashville we have a hard
 
06:12:58.430 --> 06:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
time getting uh volunteers to sit on the
 
06:13:00.590 --> 06:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
zoning board or various other boards we
 
06:13:02.330 --> 06:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
literally beat sometimes we have to beat
 
06:13:04.670 --> 06:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
the bushes to get volunteers and I'm
 
06:13:06.288 --> 06:13:06.298 align:start position:0%
sure all the towns especially small
 
06:13:08.208 --> 06:13:08.218 align:start position:0%
towns have the same thing and if anybody
 
06:13:10.430 --> 06:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
has this anxiety that something is going
 
06:13:12.650 --> 06:13:12.660 align:start position:0%
over there hanging over their head I
 
06:13:14.448 --> 06:13:14.458 align:start position:0%
know our zoning board already has a
 
06:13:16.010 --> 06:13:16.020 align:start position:0%
little anxiety about different types of
 
06:13:18.948 --> 06:13:18.958 align:start position:0%
things so uh for those reasons I do
 
06:13:21.530 --> 06:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
agree I think this is well intentioned
 
06:13:25.730 --> 06:13:25.740 align:start position:0%
but I I I fear that we're going to just
 
06:13:27.048 --> 06:13:27.058 align:start position:0%
push um
 
06:13:29.208 --> 06:13:29.218 align:start position:0%
volunteers away and I don't want to see
 
06:13:30.948 --> 06:13:30.958 align:start position:0%
that happen we need more people in
 
06:13:30.958 --> 06:13:32.090 align:start position:0%
that happen we need more people in
government

06:13:32.090 --> 06:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
government
 
06:13:34.850 --> 06:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:13:41.510 --> 06:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:43.190 --> 06:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
spirited bill
 
06:13:45.708 --> 06:13:45.718 align:start position:0%
I feel that it is a bill that
 
06:13:45.718 --> 06:13:46.690 align:start position:0%
I feel that it is a bill that
that

06:13:46.690 --> 06:13:46.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:13:49.128 --> 06:13:49.138 align:start position:0%
assumes wrongdoing
 
06:13:52.310 --> 06:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
on the part of volunteers for public
 
06:13:55.190 --> 06:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
office when there may be no wrongdoing
 
06:13:59.150 --> 06:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
but the burden of proof would rest
 
06:14:01.910 --> 06:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
on those who are charged as opposed to
 
06:14:05.570 --> 06:14:05.580 align:start position:0%
those who charge them and that to me is
 
06:14:08.090 --> 06:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
contrary to everything that I understand
 
06:14:10.670 --> 06:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
about our justice system and about good
 
06:14:12.708 --> 06:14:12.718 align:start position:0%
government so I will not support this
 
06:14:12.718 --> 06:14:14.510 align:start position:0%
government so I will not support this
bill

06:14:14.510 --> 06:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:14:17.110 --> 06:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
hey representative Maggiore
 
06:14:19.490 --> 06:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
have you already spoke
 
06:14:27.650 --> 06:14:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:31.010 --> 06:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry that's that's quite all
 
06:14:32.750 --> 06:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
right I'll be very brief first of all
 
06:14:34.430 --> 06:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
this game is a shock to me this bill
 
06:14:36.110 --> 06:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
because the town of Northampton is
 
06:14:38.090 --> 06:14:38.100 align:start position:0%
always has never transferred something
 
06:14:40.190 --> 06:14:40.200 align:start position:0%
into a line that had that was zeroed out
 
06:14:42.470 --> 06:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
we had a legal opinion on that because
 
06:14:43.970 --> 06:14:43.980 align:start position:0%
of a question raised by the budget
 
06:14:47.208 --> 06:14:47.218 align:start position:0%
committee so had this if this bill ended
 
06:14:51.590 --> 06:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
before Roman 2 under the under the new
 
06:14:54.650 --> 06:14:54.660 align:start position:0%
section I I probably would be okay with
 
06:14:56.990 --> 06:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
it but now cannot vote for this for the
 
06:14:58.430 --> 06:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
same reason that representative true
 
06:15:01.548 --> 06:15:01.558 align:start position:0%
Levin has pointed out and would add any
 
06:15:04.090 --> 06:15:04.100 align:start position:0%
citizen of the state
 
06:15:06.948 --> 06:15:06.958 align:start position:0%
aggrieved not of your town not of your
 
06:15:09.288 --> 06:15:09.298 align:start position:0%
county any citizen of the state
 
06:15:09.298 --> 06:15:11.868 align:start position:0%
county any citizen of the state
aggrieved

06:15:11.868 --> 06:15:11.878 align:start position:0%
aggrieved
 
06:15:16.730 --> 06:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
um this this is an overreach and is uh
 
06:15:18.708 --> 06:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
uh I will Echo what Representatives
 
06:15:20.990 --> 06:15:21.000 align:start position:0%

06:15:23.628 --> 06:15:23.638 align:start position:0%

that means that house bill 459
 
06:20:10.190 --> 06:20:10.200 align:start position:0%

06:20:13.788 --> 06:20:13.798 align:start position:0%
11-7 do we have a uh someone to

06:20:42.650 --> 06:20:42.660 align:start position:0%

06:20:46.910 --> 06:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
think we're gonna now take up Bill 586
 
06:20:49.670 --> 06:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
which is the um
 
06:20:52.310 --> 06:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
if you remember it is the bill that has
 
06:20:55.010 --> 06:20:55.020 align:start position:0%

early bills so it can't be put on
 
06:21:07.670 --> 06:21:07.680 align:start position:0%

06:21:48.890 --> 06:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
sure can
 
06:21:51.470 --> 06:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
I uh feel that there's no representation
 
06:21:55.070 --> 06:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
for uh the actual citizen involved in
 
06:21:58.490 --> 06:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
this it's geared strictly towards the
 
06:22:03.350 --> 06:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
um developers and uh they have no uh
 
06:22:06.048 --> 06:22:06.058 align:start position:0%
no representation for the smaller towns
 
06:22:08.628 --> 06:22:08.638 align:start position:0%
and I was inundated
 
06:22:12.770 --> 06:22:12.780 align:start position:0%
uh from the small towns and they said
 
06:22:14.448 --> 06:22:14.458 align:start position:0%
that they don't want their landscape
 
06:22:16.368 --> 06:22:16.378 align:start position:0%
changed they would like to decide to do
 
06:22:16.378 --> 06:22:17.930 align:start position:0%
changed they would like to decide to do
that

06:22:17.930 --> 06:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:22:17.940 --> 06:22:18.770 align:start position:0%
that
um

06:22:18.770 --> 06:22:18.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:18.780 --> 06:22:20.628 align:start position:0%
um
I

06:22:20.628 --> 06:22:20.638 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:22:23.030 --> 06:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
a little deeper and I saw that I felt
 
06:22:26.270 --> 06:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
that you had to have both uh components
 
06:22:28.670 --> 06:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
here for it to work
 
06:22:28.680 --> 06:22:29.510 align:start position:0%
here for it to work
um

06:22:29.510 --> 06:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:34.128 --> 06:22:34.138 align:start position:0%
the workforce housing and the elderly
 
06:22:37.368 --> 06:22:37.378 align:start position:0%
um if you have one it does it fails to
 
06:22:37.378 --> 06:22:38.330 align:start position:0%
um if you have one it does it fails to
work

06:22:38.330 --> 06:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
work
 
06:22:41.930 --> 06:22:41.940 align:start position:0%
so uh what would be the solution to that
 
06:22:45.708 --> 06:22:45.718 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure maybe an ordinance stating
 
06:22:50.570 --> 06:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
that uh the town may have enough workout
 
06:22:52.670 --> 06:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
for US housing court you have a
 
06:22:54.830 --> 06:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
statement of fact
 
06:22:57.770 --> 06:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
and it creates a situation where the
 
06:23:01.368 --> 06:23:01.378 align:start position:0%
development cannot accept the uh
 
06:23:04.070 --> 06:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
statement of fact and he takes to court
 
06:23:06.830 --> 06:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
it takes account of Court uh that can be
 
06:23:09.730 --> 06:23:09.740 align:start position:0%
done done a number of times and create a
 
06:23:13.310 --> 06:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
a big problem with your budget you know
 
06:23:16.310 --> 06:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
just to pay for it so I think there's a
 
06:23:17.750 --> 06:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
little bit of work needs to be done on
 
06:23:20.868 --> 06:23:20.878 align:start position:0%
this yet uh along those lines so that's
 
06:23:23.030 --> 06:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
why I asked to retain it okay
 
06:23:27.310 --> 06:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:29.628 --> 06:23:29.638 align:start position:0%
I definitely think that we should not
 
06:23:31.548 --> 06:23:31.558 align:start position:0%
retain this bill my understanding of
 
06:23:33.650 --> 06:23:33.660 align:start position:0%
this the history of this bill is that
 
06:23:35.270 --> 06:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
this committee looked at it last year
 
06:23:38.030 --> 06:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
and has made the appropriate fixes and
 
06:23:40.368 --> 06:23:40.378 align:start position:0%
I'd also like to remark that those
 
06:23:43.250 --> 06:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
letters from the small towns came from
 
06:23:48.110 --> 06:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
one town primarily I did not find in my
 
06:23:52.270 --> 06:23:52.280 align:start position:0%
inbox an overwhelming uh
 
06:23:55.730 --> 06:23:55.740 align:start position:0%
cross-section of disapproval of this and
 
06:23:57.830 --> 06:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
speaking professionally as a person who
 
06:24:00.170 --> 06:24:00.180 align:start position:0%
does this for a living I think this bill
 
06:24:03.730 --> 06:24:03.740 align:start position:0%
goes a long way towards
 
06:24:06.770 --> 06:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
stepping Us in the right direction to
 
06:24:09.590 --> 06:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
solve the problem of our missing 25 000
 
06:24:11.628 --> 06:24:11.638 align:start position:0%
housing units
 
06:24:13.850 --> 06:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
um of course the towns still have a vote
 
06:24:15.890 --> 06:24:15.900 align:start position:0%
they still have a planning board they
 
06:24:18.650 --> 06:24:18.660 align:start position:0%
still get to weigh in and I think that
 
06:24:21.230 --> 06:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
any town that is offering a density
 
06:24:23.330 --> 06:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
bonus for housing for the elderly should
 
06:24:23.340 --> 06:24:24.830 align:start position:0%
bonus for housing for the elderly should
definitely

06:24:24.830 --> 06:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
06:24:27.470 --> 06:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
um provide that same density bonus for
 
06:24:29.208 --> 06:24:29.218 align:start position:0%
other kinds of housing otherwise we're
 
06:24:31.910 --> 06:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
privileging uh
 
06:24:34.310 --> 06:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
we're not privileging the people that we
 
06:24:36.530 --> 06:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
need as well as the people as the
 
06:24:38.810 --> 06:24:38.820 align:start position:0%
elderly I'm not for punishing the
 
06:24:41.270 --> 06:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
elderly but I think it's wrong to
 
06:24:44.570 --> 06:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
privilege them above
 
06:24:46.730 --> 06:24:46.740 align:start position:0%
you know people who are starting out in
 
06:24:48.350 --> 06:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
life people in middle age who got
 
06:24:50.628 --> 06:24:50.638 align:start position:0%
divorced and need some place to live I
 
06:24:52.368 --> 06:24:52.378 align:start position:0%
think that as I said earlier this
 
06:24:55.190 --> 06:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
morning in my earlier testimony only 20
 
06:24:57.730 --> 06:24:57.740 align:start position:0%
of our
 
06:25:01.368 --> 06:25:01.378 align:start position:0%
of our housing units our households our
 
06:25:03.830 --> 06:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
families with children and there are
 
06:25:06.170 --> 06:25:06.180 align:start position:0%
lots of people who could be benefited by
 
06:25:09.470 --> 06:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
the housing that this bill steps Us in
 
06:25:12.650 --> 06:25:12.660 align:start position:0%
the direction that we need to go so I am
 
06:25:15.288 --> 06:25:15.298 align:start position:0%
definitely opposed to the itl thank you
 
06:25:18.470 --> 06:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh yeah please help my memory who who
 
06:25:20.270 --> 06:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
seconded the motion
 
06:25:23.208 --> 06:25:23.218 align:start position:0%
I did Melvin okay thank you well Melvin
 
06:25:23.218 --> 06:25:24.110 align:start position:0%
I did Melvin okay thank you well Melvin
yeah

06:25:24.110 --> 06:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:25:26.510 --> 06:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
actually we both did and representative
 
06:25:31.490 --> 06:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:33.470 --> 06:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
06:25:36.708 --> 06:25:36.718 align:start position:0%
I yeah I got those same emails too since
 
06:25:39.590 --> 06:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
they came to all of us and
 
06:25:42.470 --> 06:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
my reaction to them was it they actually
 
06:25:42.480 --> 06:25:43.850 align:start position:0%
my reaction to them was it they actually
their

06:25:43.850 --> 06:25:43.860 align:start position:0%
their
 
06:25:46.490 --> 06:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
um opposition to them actually hardened
 
06:25:50.208 --> 06:25:50.218 align:start position:0%
my resolve to support them because a lot
 
06:25:52.490 --> 06:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
of the arguments they're making against
 
06:25:52.500 --> 06:25:54.110 align:start position:0%
of the arguments they're making against
it

06:25:54.110 --> 06:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:25:57.110 --> 06:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
seemed to me uh
 
06:25:59.470 --> 06:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
if they're they they were expressing
 
06:26:03.470 --> 06:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
disdain for my district so
 
06:26:06.890 --> 06:26:06.900 align:start position:0%
I I represent Concord Ward 6 which is a
 
06:26:09.170 --> 06:26:09.180 align:start position:0%
downtown area very high density I live
 
06:26:12.708 --> 06:26:12.718 align:start position:0%
in a public housing apartment a 10th
 
06:26:16.610 --> 06:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
floor a 10-story building the JFK
 
06:26:18.110 --> 06:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
building and
 
06:26:20.750 --> 06:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
which is all low-income housing and for
 
06:26:21.890 --> 06:26:21.900 align:start position:0%
them to
 
06:26:24.410 --> 06:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
for all these opponents of it to
 
06:26:26.448 --> 06:26:26.458 align:start position:0%
complain about low-income people I I
 
06:26:27.948 --> 06:26:27.958 align:start position:0%
just felt that was like a personal
 
06:26:30.170 --> 06:26:30.180 align:start position:0%
attack on me and
 
06:26:34.250 --> 06:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
it just strengthened my resolve to
 
06:26:36.410 --> 06:26:36.420 align:start position:0%
provide housing for people despite their
 
06:26:36.420 --> 06:26:38.090 align:start position:0%
provide housing for people despite their
objections

06:26:38.090 --> 06:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
objections
 
06:26:40.310 --> 06:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative Porter
 
06:26:42.530 --> 06:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
06:26:44.868 --> 06:26:44.878 align:start position:0%
um I felt when we were hearing the
 
06:26:47.868 --> 06:26:47.878 align:start position:0%
testimony this time that we really
 
06:26:49.910 --> 06:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
it was unfortunate that we didn't give
 
06:26:52.010 --> 06:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
more of the history of this bill and
 
06:26:55.430 --> 06:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
serving on the subcommittee with you on
 
06:26:59.270 --> 06:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
this bill last term I want to give some
 
06:27:01.368 --> 06:27:01.378 align:start position:0%
information to the new people on the
 
06:27:04.010 --> 06:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
committee the first thing was that this
 
06:27:04.020 --> 06:27:04.730 align:start position:0%
committee the first thing was that this
bill

06:27:04.730 --> 06:27:04.740 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:27:07.010 --> 06:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
the original two bills that we dealt
 
06:27:09.230 --> 06:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
with last year came from the governor's
 
06:27:11.690 --> 06:27:11.700 align:start position:0%
task force on housing
 
06:27:14.090 --> 06:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
and it came they came to us and they had
 
06:27:16.850 --> 06:27:16.860 align:start position:0%
a lot of problems
 
06:27:19.970 --> 06:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
we had a hearing we listened to the same
 
06:27:22.788 --> 06:27:22.798 align:start position:0%
kinds of problems identified in the
 
06:27:26.448 --> 06:27:26.458 align:start position:0%
emails that you you all got as well as
 
06:27:29.330 --> 06:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
other issues that are concerns about
 
06:27:31.190 --> 06:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
zoning boards and planning boards and
 
06:27:31.200 --> 06:27:32.330 align:start position:0%
zoning boards and planning boards and
and

06:27:32.330 --> 06:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:27:35.510 --> 06:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
um a myriad of things and we had all
 
06:27:38.330 --> 06:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
those complaints in front of us when we
 
06:27:41.150 --> 06:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
met as a subcommittee and in that
 
06:27:43.430 --> 06:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we had all the stakeholders
 
06:27:46.610 --> 06:27:46.620 align:start position:0%
participating we had this office of
 
06:27:48.890 --> 06:27:48.900 align:start position:0%
strategic initiatives we had uh Ben
 
06:27:50.750 --> 06:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
Frost with the Housing Finance Authority
 
06:27:52.368 --> 06:27:52.378 align:start position:0%
we had
 
06:27:54.410 --> 06:27:54.420 align:start position:0%
um Alyssa miracle and who works with
 
06:27:56.990 --> 06:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
housing action New Hampshire we had
 
06:27:59.090 --> 06:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
Cordell Johnston to make sure that we
 
06:28:01.788 --> 06:28:01.798 align:start position:0%
weren't stepping on uh toes up and
 
06:28:03.948 --> 06:28:03.958 align:start position:0%
taking away Authority from local
 
06:28:03.958 --> 06:28:05.208 align:start position:0%
taking away Authority from local
communities

06:28:05.208 --> 06:28:05.218 align:start position:0%
communities
 
06:28:06.948 --> 06:28:06.958 align:start position:0%
and there were other people in the room
 
06:28:09.170 --> 06:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
and as we worked we identified the
 
06:28:11.448 --> 06:28:11.458 align:start position:0%
problems that people had brought up and
 
06:28:13.970 --> 06:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
that group of people worked together to
 
06:28:16.190 --> 06:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
provide to
 
06:28:18.288 --> 06:28:18.298 align:start position:0%
structure the language of the bill so
 
06:28:20.628 --> 06:28:20.638 align:start position:0%
that nothing in the bill everything that
 
06:28:22.128 --> 06:28:22.138 align:start position:0%
had been brought up to us as a problem
 
06:28:24.530 --> 06:28:24.540 align:start position:0%
was addressed in the bill and every
 
06:28:26.090 --> 06:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
single person that was part of that
 
06:28:29.150 --> 06:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
stakeholder group approved of the final
 
06:28:32.330 --> 06:28:32.340 align:start position:0%
bill as amended we brought it forth to
 
06:28:34.310 --> 06:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
our committee and it passed the
 
06:28:34.320 --> 06:28:35.390 align:start position:0%
our committee and it passed the
committee

06:28:35.390 --> 06:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:28:38.390 --> 06:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
and it it went on and passed the house
 
06:28:42.948 --> 06:28:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:45.230 --> 06:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
we worked so hard
 
06:28:47.448 --> 06:28:47.458 align:start position:0%
and I feel that those emails that came
 
06:28:49.610 --> 06:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
from I know two communities
 
06:28:52.070 --> 06:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
that were there that get all those
 
06:28:54.230 --> 06:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
emails and I I've driven photos lovely
 
06:28:56.330 --> 06:28:56.340 align:start position:0%
Farm communities and I understand what
 
06:28:58.788 --> 06:28:58.798 align:start position:0%
they're saying but this bill does not
 
06:29:02.090 --> 06:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
prevent them from or force them to do
 
06:29:04.730 --> 06:29:04.740 align:start position:0%
anything they everything that's in the
 
06:29:06.590 --> 06:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
bill is incentivized if a community
 
06:29:08.990 --> 06:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
chooses to do this they can do it and
 
06:29:10.850 --> 06:29:10.860 align:start position:0%
here's a tool and a way that you can do
 
06:29:12.830 --> 06:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
it if your community does not want to do
 
06:29:14.868 --> 06:29:14.878 align:start position:0%
it your community does not have to do it
 
06:29:17.510 --> 06:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
and the only restriction on that was the
 
06:29:19.810 --> 06:29:19.820 align:start position:0%
housing for the elderly the density
 
06:29:22.128 --> 06:29:22.138 align:start position:0%
benefits for the housing of the elderly
 
06:29:24.350 --> 06:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
if you gave that in your community then
 
06:29:26.150 --> 06:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
you had to do it for affordable housing
 
06:29:28.310 --> 06:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
and if you didn't want to do that then
 
06:29:30.048 --> 06:29:30.058 align:start position:0%
just rescind it for the housing for the
 
06:29:32.270 --> 06:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
elderly there was nothing in this bill
 
06:29:34.850 --> 06:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
that forces any Community to do anything
 
06:29:37.850 --> 06:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
that they don't want to do so I I
 
06:29:40.310 --> 06:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
understand that we got a lot of emails
 
06:29:41.810 --> 06:29:41.820 align:start position:0%
but I think those people were
 
06:29:44.448 --> 06:29:44.458 align:start position:0%
misinformed about the true nature of
 
06:29:47.330 --> 06:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
this bill and so I'm asking you to think
 
06:29:49.548 --> 06:29:49.558 align:start position:0%
about what you're doing the governor
 
06:29:52.430 --> 06:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
supports this bill this is a bipartisan
 
06:29:54.590 --> 06:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
effort it's not a democratic thing it's
 
06:29:56.930 --> 06:29:56.940 align:start position:0%
not a republican thing it's a state of
 
06:29:59.208 --> 06:29:59.218 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we're in a crisis and we
 
06:30:01.010 --> 06:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
need to have something
 
06:30:03.650 --> 06:30:03.660 align:start position:0%
to help our communities who want to to
 
06:30:06.110 --> 06:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
make good choices for the kinds of
 
06:30:07.850 --> 06:30:07.860 align:start position:0%
housing that they develop in their
 
06:30:10.490 --> 06:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
communities and this bill does that and
 
06:30:12.948 --> 06:30:12.958 align:start position:0%
so now that I'm all red in the face and
 
06:30:15.650 --> 06:30:15.660 align:start position:0%
my blood pressure is Sky High I'm gonna
 
06:30:18.410 --> 06:30:18.420 align:start position:0%
shut up and let you take your vote thank
 
06:30:20.090 --> 06:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
you for your comments uh representative
 
06:30:22.368 --> 06:30:22.378 align:start position:0%
lasalles had a comment
 
06:30:27.830 --> 06:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
yes I'm a co-sponsor of this bill and I
 
06:30:30.830 --> 06:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
support the bill for all the reasons
 
06:30:32.810 --> 06:30:32.820 align:start position:0%
that representative Porter just
 
06:30:32.820 --> 06:30:34.128 align:start position:0%
that representative Porter just
mentioned

06:30:34.128 --> 06:30:34.138 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
06:30:36.470 --> 06:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
I live in the beautiful town of
 
06:30:36.480 --> 06:30:37.548 align:start position:0%
I live in the beautiful town of
Litchfield

06:30:37.548 --> 06:30:37.558 align:start position:0%
Litchfield
 
06:30:40.250 --> 06:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
uh those of you who do not know
 
06:30:43.070 --> 06:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
Litchfield know that at one point it was
 
06:30:45.590 --> 06:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
a farming Community but it has become a
 
06:30:47.030 --> 06:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
bedroom community
 
06:30:49.310 --> 06:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
and it has become a bedroom community
 
06:30:54.350 --> 06:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
for wealthy people and people who are
 
06:30:59.150 --> 06:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
over 55. we have about a dozen over 55
 
06:31:01.910 --> 06:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
communities in the town of Litchfield
 
06:31:05.750 --> 06:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
and we have all of these Mansions as
 
06:31:10.490 --> 06:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
people call them uh at the same time a
 
06:31:12.770 --> 06:31:12.780 align:start position:0%
young person who was just starting out
 
06:31:16.788 --> 06:31:16.798 align:start position:0%
in life uh doesn't really have a chance
 
06:31:19.010 --> 06:31:19.020 align:start position:0%
to live in the town of Litchfield
 
06:31:21.048 --> 06:31:21.058 align:start position:0%
because there's nothing that's
 
06:31:23.448 --> 06:31:23.458 align:start position:0%
affordable for them
 
06:31:27.770 --> 06:31:27.780 align:start position:0%
I also am a selectman in town and I know
 
06:31:29.150 --> 06:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
that there is
 
06:31:31.368 --> 06:31:31.378 align:start position:0%
there is a need
 
06:31:31.378 --> 06:31:34.330 align:start position:0%
there is a need
for

06:31:34.330 --> 06:31:34.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:37.150 --> 06:31:37.160 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing I'm not going to say
 
06:31:39.650 --> 06:31:39.660 align:start position:0%
low-income housing I'm going to say
 
06:31:43.070 --> 06:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing so just as we have
 
06:31:47.090 --> 06:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
over 55 communities I would like to see
 
06:31:50.930 --> 06:31:50.940 align:start position:0%
us have under 35 communities or under 40
 
06:31:55.610 --> 06:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
communities I also work as a substitute
 
06:31:57.830 --> 06:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
teacher in the local high school
 
06:32:01.190 --> 06:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
and one day I had I was had a chat with
 
06:32:04.788 --> 06:32:04.798 align:start position:0%
one of the young teachers and I said uh
 
06:32:07.010 --> 06:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
you know where do you live she said
 
06:32:10.010 --> 06:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
Goffstown or something I said well why
 
06:32:11.868 --> 06:32:11.878 align:start position:0%
don't you move to Litchfield she said
 
06:32:14.570 --> 06:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
I'd love to live live in Litchfield but
 
06:32:17.270 --> 06:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
I can't afford to live in the gym
 
06:32:23.390 --> 06:32:23.400 align:start position:0%
so I I think it's time for the for the
 
06:32:26.930 --> 06:32:26.940 align:start position:0%
towns to step up to the plate we have a
 
06:32:30.530 --> 06:32:30.540 align:start position:0%
crisis here in New Hampshire
 
06:32:33.410 --> 06:32:33.420 align:start position:0%
I I have a friend who lives he's a
 
06:32:35.208 --> 06:32:35.218 align:start position:0%
neighbor of mine and he works for the
 
06:32:38.750 --> 06:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
state people who works to
 
06:32:38.760 --> 06:32:39.850 align:start position:0%
state people who works to
to

06:32:39.850 --> 06:32:39.860 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:32:43.910 --> 06:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
recruit companies from out of state to
 
06:32:45.830 --> 06:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
come to the answer
 
06:32:48.530 --> 06:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
one day I ask him what what are the
 
06:32:52.368 --> 06:32:52.378 align:start position:0%
issues that keep businesses from moving
 
06:32:55.208 --> 06:32:55.218 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire he says two things
 
06:32:58.490 --> 06:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly two things one is the
 
06:33:01.510 --> 06:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
cost of energy we all know that
 
06:33:05.448 --> 06:33:05.458 align:start position:0%
secondly is the availability of
 
06:33:09.230 --> 06:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
Workforce and when you break that down
 
06:33:13.430 --> 06:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
the availability of Workforce is really
 
06:33:16.250 --> 06:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
harmed by the fact that you can't get a
 
06:33:19.788 --> 06:33:19.798 align:start position:0%
decent place to live for under uh
 
06:33:22.970 --> 06:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
fifteen hundred dollars a month so yes
 
06:33:26.270 --> 06:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
I'm a co-sponsor of this bill I'm proud
 
06:33:29.510 --> 06:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
of being a co-sponsor of it and I'll
 
06:33:31.070 --> 06:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
support it
 
06:33:37.448 --> 06:33:37.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:40.430 --> 06:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I've been searching
 
06:33:42.590 --> 06:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
frantically for my copy of the bill and
 
06:33:45.170 --> 06:33:45.180 align:start position:0%
it seems to have vaporized
 
06:33:45.180 --> 06:33:45.770 align:start position:0%
it seems to have vaporized
um

06:33:45.770 --> 06:33:45.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:33:47.990 --> 06:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know where it's gone but I did
 
06:33:49.970 --> 06:33:49.980 align:start position:0%
have some notes on it and I've recalled
 
06:33:52.548 --> 06:33:52.558 align:start position:0%
a few of them one of them is I felt like
 
06:33:54.288 --> 06:33:54.298 align:start position:0%
a lot of those emails that came to us
 
06:33:55.730 --> 06:33:55.740 align:start position:0%
were from people who were very
 
06:33:58.430 --> 06:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
misinformed about what that bill was
 
06:33:59.868 --> 06:33:59.878 align:start position:0%
going to do for them what this bill is
 
06:34:02.208 --> 06:34:02.218 align:start position:0%
going to do for them or do to them or
 
06:34:04.010 --> 06:34:04.020 align:start position:0%
what they were going to have to do in
 
06:34:06.650 --> 06:34:06.660 align:start position:0%
regards to it and I think that that's
 
06:34:08.930 --> 06:34:08.940 align:start position:0%
unfortunate my understanding is that
 
06:34:11.030 --> 06:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's an enabling Bill and after
 
06:34:13.490 --> 06:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
listening to representative Porter and
 
06:34:13.500 --> 06:34:15.190 align:start position:0%
listening to representative Porter and
representative

06:34:15.190 --> 06:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:34:18.830 --> 06:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
lasalles um I I can't um
 
06:34:21.350 --> 06:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
I'll be supporting the Bill thank you
 
06:34:24.650 --> 06:34:24.660 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative mangaputi uh
 
06:34:28.610 --> 06:34:28.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair my recollection of uh
 
06:34:31.730 --> 06:34:31.740 align:start position:0%
the testimonies and um I was very
 
06:34:34.128 --> 06:34:34.138 align:start position:0%
encouraged with the fact that this is a
 
06:34:36.350 --> 06:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
very enabling bill and when we are in
 
06:34:38.750 --> 06:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
the middle of the crisis of housing
 
06:34:41.690 --> 06:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
shortage acute housing shortage and
 
06:34:44.448 --> 06:34:44.458 align:start position:0%
especially Workforce housing and
 
06:34:47.750 --> 06:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner Caswell said Governor uh
 
06:34:51.048 --> 06:34:51.058 align:start position:0%
sunun they all supported it and this is
 
06:34:54.770 --> 06:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
a critical need and uh you know knowing
 
06:34:57.230 --> 06:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
it is a critical need and it's the right
 
06:35:00.110 --> 06:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
Bill to bring in and I got a lot of
 
06:35:02.990 --> 06:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
emails too it just highlighted I moved
 
06:35:05.510 --> 06:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
into a bedroom community and I don't
 
06:35:07.788 --> 06:35:07.798 align:start position:0%
want the density to increase the reason
 
06:35:09.948 --> 06:35:09.958 align:start position:0%
I moved here I'm one at quaint little
 
06:35:12.110 --> 06:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
town so
 
06:35:15.948 --> 06:35:15.958 align:start position:0%
we I think I would strongly support and
 
06:35:19.430 --> 06:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
this is not the bill to be retained or
 
06:35:22.190 --> 06:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
itl this is the bill that needs to pass
 
06:35:25.610 --> 06:35:25.620 align:start position:0%
to give the tool that the
 
06:35:28.010 --> 06:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
communities need
 
06:35:32.090 --> 06:35:32.100 align:start position:0%
to enable the acute shortage so I
 
06:35:34.448 --> 06:35:34.458 align:start position:0%
request that we vote on it thank you
 
06:35:37.490 --> 06:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Maggiore
 
06:35:40.610 --> 06:35:40.620 align:start position:0%
oh whoops uh thank you Mr chair I've
 
06:35:42.470 --> 06:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
become a one-trick pony when it comes to
 
06:35:44.390 --> 06:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
discussing this bill because I refer
 
06:35:47.750 --> 06:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
back continuously to my first term when
 
06:35:51.708 --> 06:35:51.718 align:start position:0%
it was 1629 and 1632 and I was I don't
 
06:35:53.030 --> 06:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
know that I've ever taken that many
 
06:35:55.670 --> 06:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
notes and that made that many comments
 
06:35:58.368 --> 06:35:58.378 align:start position:0%
on a bill and was one of the
 
06:36:00.110 --> 06:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say at least from my own
 
06:36:01.610 --> 06:36:01.620 align:start position:0%
perspective one of the staunchest
 
06:36:04.788 --> 06:36:04.798 align:start position:0%
opponents of that bill as it was
 
06:36:06.770 --> 06:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
presented and and would have been
 
06:36:09.288 --> 06:36:09.298 align:start position:0%
probably as upset as representative
 
06:36:13.128 --> 06:36:13.138 align:start position:0%
Porter is now had that bill passed
 
06:36:15.770 --> 06:36:15.780 align:start position:0%
um but this bill as it has been
 
06:36:20.590 --> 06:36:20.600 align:start position:0%
presented and as and as it was amended
 
06:36:23.570 --> 06:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
satisfied the concerns that I have and
 
06:36:26.448 --> 06:36:26.458 align:start position:0%
it's why when it we every time the bill
 
06:36:28.788 --> 06:36:28.798 align:start position:0%
came up I voted against every comment I
 
06:36:31.850 --> 06:36:31.860 align:start position:0%
would I voted against this bill though
 
06:36:34.250 --> 06:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
fixed all of those concerns I have been
 
06:36:35.448 --> 06:36:35.458 align:start position:0%
a member of the select board in
 
06:36:37.490 --> 06:36:37.500 align:start position:0%
Northampton for four terms and remember
 
06:36:39.230 --> 06:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
and the representative to the planning
 
06:36:42.170 --> 06:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
board for eight of those years
 
06:36:44.810 --> 06:36:44.820 align:start position:0%
um this alleviates my concerns that I
 
06:36:48.410 --> 06:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
have so I can I support 586 I I wish we
 
06:36:51.230 --> 06:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
could take an up or down vote on it now
 
06:36:52.910 --> 06:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
06:36:55.310 --> 06:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
Senator clay
 
06:36:57.230 --> 06:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
06:36:59.090 --> 06:36:59.100 align:start position:0%
um one of the things I hear quite often
 
06:37:03.350 --> 06:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
is kicking the can down uh the road
 
06:37:05.810 --> 06:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
many of you worked on this bill over the
 
06:37:08.030 --> 06:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
over the years and I hear
 
06:37:09.470 --> 06:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
um representative majority and
 
06:37:12.230 --> 06:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
representative Porter talk about how how
 
06:37:15.470 --> 06:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
much work went into it to put in those
 
06:37:18.350 --> 06:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
changes and to do all that was needed to
 
06:37:21.048 --> 06:37:21.058 align:start position:0%
do I think if we kick this can down the
 
06:37:23.628 --> 06:37:23.638 align:start position:0%
road and retain it only to discuss it
 
06:37:26.150 --> 06:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
again after it's been discussed pardon
 
06:37:28.070 --> 06:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
my language here at nauseam
 
06:37:29.690 --> 06:37:29.700 align:start position:0%
um is really doing a disservice for all
 
06:37:31.490 --> 06:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
those that did so much work last year
 
06:37:34.390 --> 06:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
and this was basically just put on hold
 
06:37:37.310 --> 06:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic or we call it
 
06:37:39.170 --> 06:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
the death of the covid
 
06:37:39.180 --> 06:37:39.890 align:start position:0%
the death of the covid
um

06:37:39.890 --> 06:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:42.890 --> 06:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
this is my third term and I very rarely
 
06:37:46.850 --> 06:37:46.860 align:start position:0%
hear our governor come out and speak
 
06:37:50.090 --> 06:37:50.100 align:start position:0%
in favor or against a bill as as much as
 
06:37:53.628 --> 06:37:53.638 align:start position:0%
he seemed to on this particular one
 
06:37:55.368 --> 06:37:55.378 align:start position:0%
um the fact that it's got bipartisan
 
06:37:57.250 --> 06:37:57.260 align:start position:0%
support the fact that we've got
 
06:38:00.470 --> 06:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
governmental I mean Governor support Mr
 
06:38:03.170 --> 06:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
casual support I really think that we
 
06:38:05.868 --> 06:38:05.878 align:start position:0%
should take a vote I hope we take a vote
 
06:38:08.448 --> 06:38:08.458 align:start position:0%
on to pass but I think in all fairness
 
06:38:12.170 --> 06:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
we really need to take a vote on another
 
06:38:14.930 --> 06:38:14.940 align:start position:0%
note I did respond to some of those
 
06:38:17.150 --> 06:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
emails that we got and I asked them
 
06:38:19.730 --> 06:38:19.740 align:start position:0%
Point Blank did you know that this is
 
06:38:21.410 --> 06:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
not the original bill from the previous
 
06:38:24.288 --> 06:38:24.298 align:start position:0%
year that it was the um massage bill as
 
06:38:26.510 --> 06:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
I referred to it that changes had been
 
06:38:28.970 --> 06:38:28.980 align:start position:0%
made and changes had been put in
 
06:38:32.270 --> 06:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
without failure none of them knew that
 
06:38:34.128 --> 06:38:34.138 align:start position:0%
they only knew of the bill that had hit
 
06:38:35.510 --> 06:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
last year and they said that they were
 
06:38:37.970 --> 06:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
opposed to it so I think much like what
 
06:38:40.970 --> 06:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
representative majority had said you
 
06:38:43.010 --> 06:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
know it was not a good bill it was a bad
 
06:38:46.250 --> 06:38:46.260 align:start position:0%
Bill you all fixed it and I think one of
 
06:38:48.110 --> 06:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
the questions and clarifications that
 
06:38:49.970 --> 06:38:49.980 align:start position:0%
representative Porter brought forward
 
06:38:52.788 --> 06:38:52.798 align:start position:0%
during the question is is this the
 
06:38:54.470 --> 06:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
change bill is this the modified bill
 
06:38:56.628 --> 06:38:56.638 align:start position:0%
and the answer was yes which kind of
 
06:38:58.310 --> 06:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
sealed the deal for me
 
06:39:00.530 --> 06:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
um I think you all did the work and I
 
06:39:03.048 --> 06:39:03.058 align:start position:0%
think we should pass this bill thank you
 
06:39:06.770 --> 06:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:10.368 --> 06:39:10.378 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I also was on the committee
 
06:39:14.030 --> 06:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
when this bill originally came to us and
 
06:39:14.040 --> 06:39:15.430 align:start position:0%
when this bill originally came to us and
was

06:39:15.430 --> 06:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:39:18.770 --> 06:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
very firmly against it in the form that
 
06:39:22.010 --> 06:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
we received it uh and but it became
 
06:39:23.868 --> 06:39:23.878 align:start position:0%
convinced after the work the
 
06:39:26.810 --> 06:39:26.820 align:start position:0%
subcommittee did on it that it that it
 
06:39:29.930 --> 06:39:29.940 align:start position:0%
in fact epitomized the way things are
 
06:39:31.430 --> 06:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
done in New Hampshire and shouldn't be
 
06:39:34.910 --> 06:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
done in New Hampshire which is namely if
 
06:39:37.010 --> 06:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
your community doesn't wish to do this
 
06:39:39.650 --> 06:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to do this if your
 
06:39:42.170 --> 06:39:42.180 align:start position:0%
community wishes to do this we now
 
06:39:44.570 --> 06:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
provide you with a tool and a mechanism
 
06:39:47.628 --> 06:39:47.638 align:start position:0%
to be able to do it better and more
 
06:39:50.330 --> 06:39:50.340 align:start position:0%
efficiently here in Lebanon where I live
 
06:39:53.330 --> 06:39:53.340 align:start position:0%
an affordable housing situation is
 
06:39:56.330 --> 06:39:56.340 align:start position:0%
upwards of two thousand dollars a month
 
06:40:00.530 --> 06:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
uh there are nurses and LPNs at
 
06:40:02.510 --> 06:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center who
 
06:40:05.270 --> 06:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
cannot afford to live here it is a
 
06:40:07.970 --> 06:40:07.980 align:start position:0%
travesty it is a shame and it has a
 
06:40:10.548 --> 06:40:10.558 align:start position:0%
negative impact on all of us I strongly
 
06:40:12.590 --> 06:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
support this bill
 
06:40:15.288 --> 06:40:15.298 align:start position:0%
thank you uh last comment of
 
06:40:18.110 --> 06:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
Representative mangaputi yeah you know
 
06:40:21.288 --> 06:40:21.298 align:start position:0%
how I go back to the blue sheet yes this
 
06:40:25.730 --> 06:40:25.740 align:start position:0%
has 36 support and 11 of those and two
 
06:40:29.410 --> 06:40:29.420 align:start position:0%
neutral so that strengthens my
 
06:40:32.690 --> 06:40:32.700 align:start position:0%
of support to this bill knowing that
 
06:40:34.850 --> 06:40:34.860 align:start position:0%
there were 36 people who supported this
 
06:40:37.430 --> 06:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
bill and it's a good bill
 
06:40:39.590 --> 06:40:39.600 align:start position:0%

I understand
 
06:42:49.010 --> 06:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
bills like this are very emotional can
 
06:42:50.868 --> 06:42:50.878 align:start position:0%

06:47:09.650 --> 06:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
A.M which is different than what we've
 
06:47:10.910 --> 06:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
been doing
 
06:47:14.090 --> 06:47:14.100 align:start position:0%
just so people take note of that is that
 
06:47:14.100 --> 06:47:17.270 align:start position:0%
just so people take note of that is that
correct

06:47:17.270 --> 06:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:18.890 --> 06:47:18.900 align:start position:0%

06:48:18.948 --> 06:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
so I would
 
06:48:21.110 --> 06:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
talk to him and get a copy of what he
 
06:48:23.208 --> 06:48:23.218 align:start position:0%
wrote and then get his opinion and then
 
06:48:26.628 --> 06:48:26.638 align:start position:0%
the intent would be to meet with them uh
 
06:48:31.430 --> 06:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
a legal advisor in OLS and have uh have
 
06:48:35.750 --> 06:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
that legal question opposed to see if uh
 
06:48:38.448 --> 06:48:38.458 align:start position:0%
again if there is an illegality in it
 
06:48:41.690 --> 06:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
and if it does need to be fixed or is is
 
06:48:41.700 --> 06:48:43.850 align:start position:0%
and if it does need to be fixed or is is
uh

06:48:43.850 --> 06:48:43.860 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:48:47.270 --> 06:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
um uh is that being misread by him and
 
06:48:49.430 --> 06:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
is there is there a fix that needs an
 
06:48:52.430 --> 06:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
amendment uh to change the bill and
 
06:48:54.590 --> 06:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
what's the time frame within which I
 
06:48:55.990 --> 06:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
need to get it done
 
06:49:00.110 --> 06:49:00.120 align:start position:0%

06:49:33.540 --> 06:49:34.310 align:start position:0%
by May
um

06:49:34.310 --> 06:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:36.708 --> 06:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
and also a comment that this is the best
 
06:49:37.788 --> 06:49:37.798 align:start position:0%
Committee in the House of
 
06:49:37.798 --> 06:49:44.448 align:start position:0%
Committee in the House of
Representatives

06:49:44.448 --> 06:49:44.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:46.670 --> 06:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
pardon me that's because of all of you
 
06:49:50.270 --> 06:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
uh well who knows maybe it's magical
 
06:49:53.030 --> 06:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
powers but it is the best one
 
06:49:55.548 --> 06:49:55.558 align:start position:0%
um could Christina repeat what she said
 
06:49:57.650 --> 06:49:57.660 align:start position:0%
just a few minutes ago about meeting
 
06:49:57.660 --> 06:50:00.010 align:start position:0%
just a few minutes ago about meeting
times

06:50:00.010 --> 06:50:00.020 align:start position:0%
times
 
06:50:02.628 --> 06:50:02.638 align:start position:0%
about what was the question meeting
 
06:50:05.570 --> 06:50:05.580 align:start position:0%
times or our next meetings there was
 
06:50:07.310 --> 06:50:07.320 align:start position:0%
some logistical information that I
 
06:50:09.110 --> 06:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
missed I think I had said
 
06:50:11.628 --> 06:50:11.638 align:start position:0%
Representatives Davis that I had noticed
 
06:50:13.490 --> 06:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
on the public hearing notice for
 
06:50:16.968 --> 06:50:16.978 align:start position:0%
Thursday February 18th that we are to
 
06:50:20.690 --> 06:50:20.700 align:start position:0%
commence at 8 A.M and not at 9 00 a.m as
 
06:50:22.670 --> 06:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
we have been doing in the past
 
06:50:24.830 --> 06:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
so just for committee members to to
 
06:50:28.850 --> 06:50:28.860 align:start position:0%
notice that and that was that um was
 
06:50:30.530 --> 06:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
that anticipated or was that an
 
06:50:30.540 --> 06:50:31.850 align:start position:0%
that anticipated or was that an
oversight

06:50:31.850 --> 06:50:31.860 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
06:50:34.788 --> 06:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
uh it hasn't technically been noticed in
 
06:50:36.410 --> 06:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
the calendar yet so if you want to
 
06:50:38.208 --> 06:50:38.218 align:start position:0%
change that I think we probably could
 
06:50:41.330 --> 06:50:41.340 align:start position:0%
yes uh Christina could you change it to
 
06:50:43.128 --> 06:50:43.138 align:start position:0%
9 A.M
 
06:50:47.448 --> 06:50:47.458 align:start position:0%
okay I received something that said 8am
 
06:50:50.030 --> 06:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
um and it went it didn't get scheduled
 
06:50:52.368 --> 06:50:52.378 align:start position:0%
um but I just looked in the calendar and
 
06:50:54.468 --> 06:50:54.478 align:start position:0%
um it hasn't been noticed yet it'll go
 
06:50:56.750 --> 06:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
in this week's calendar and because it's
 
06:50:58.548 --> 06:50:58.558 align:start position:0%
only Tuesday I think we have some time
 
06:50:59.930 --> 06:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
but I'll let you know if something
 
06:51:01.490 --> 06:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
happens but I think it shouldn't be a

to two Okay uh let me just double check
 
06:52:02.750 --> 06:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
