Mr chair if I make yes ma'am thank you I
 
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
have a concern because representative
 
00:16:05.329 --> 00:16:05.339 align:start position:0%
McGuire is not present here today
 
00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:07.550 align:start position:0%
McGuire is not present here today
um so

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
um do you want to know if she would
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.790 align:start position:0%
 
don't

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
think anybody should
 
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
or her other than herself because
 
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot of work
 
00:16:22.129 --> 00:16:22.139 align:start position:0%
involved in this commission and I would
 
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
rather have her be here to accept the
 
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
nomination than somebody else
 
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
so I I just questioned that I don't
 
00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
think that's good procedure thank you
 
00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
it's true I would be willing to withdraw
 
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I'd like to be a black lives
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I would really like the commission
 
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
to reconsider that uh because in the
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
past we have been able to nominate
 
00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
somebody who are not attending the other
 
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
thing is we heard from the
 
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative that she has a special
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
appointment other than that this is not
 
00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:01.079 align:start position:0%
something that would preclude her from
 
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:02.220 align:start position:0%
being here
 
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:04.860 align:start position:0%

um I don't know who's running the
 
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
meeting at this point because my duties
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
ended with the election of the chair
 
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
that that's my problem you know
 
00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
parliamentarily may I be recognized
 
00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
I can't recognize you I'm not the chair
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
who's standing for representative
 
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
McGuire right there
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry I you know again you know
 
00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
the statute says that the first order of
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
business is to elect a chair
 
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:09.900 align:start position:0%
okay you have elected a chair
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
okay therefore my duties as the caller
 
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.350 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:28.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:33.380 align:start position:0%
