00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.189 align:start position:0%
people at the very end of our meetings
or

00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
losing uh at least two of the people
 
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
that are here today
 
00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:41.699 align:start position:0%
Senator Morse and representative
 
00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:42.770 align:start position:0%
Senator Morse and representative
umberger

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
umberger
 
00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:44.759 align:start position:0%
and I don't know which one to start
 
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
first and either praise or but I'll
 
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
start with Senator Morris I became
 
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
friendly with Senator Morris when he was
 
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
a chair of Senate Finance
 
00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
and I was chair of division one
 
00:07:59.629 --> 00:07:59.639 align:start position:0%
and he called me up on the phone and he
 
00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:01.139 align:start position:0%
said you know we need to speak about
 
00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:03.539 align:start position:0%
what division one has done
 
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
so I I guess was a little timid at the
 
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
time because I heard a lot of tough
 
00:08:09.409 --> 00:08:09.419 align:start position:0%
things about Chuck Morris but I ventured
 
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
over to his office and
 
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
I guess you could say that he knows how
 
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
many pencils
 
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:18.180 align:start position:0%
are purchased every year in the state
 
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
his knowledge of the budget is
 
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.189 align:start position:0%
his knowledge of the budget is
incredible

00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
incredible
 
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:24.660 align:start position:0%
um well he went through ours uh in
 
00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:26.099 align:start position:0%
division one and he I guess he didn't
 
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
find any problems so I thought I guess I
 
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:30.780 align:start position:0%
passed his grade but over the years we
 
00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:33.959 align:start position:0%
become friends and uh on a personal note
 
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
I lost my son
 
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:37.740 align:start position:0%
and I received a call from Senator
 
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
Morris and he said
 
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
I've got this beautiful
 
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
dogwood tree and I'm going to send a
 
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:45.300 align:start position:0%
group of people over and plant it so you
 
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
better find a place and my family and I
 
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
would like to honor you and your son
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
with the tree and that just speaks to
 
00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
the gentleman sitting over there and I
 
00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:57.300 align:start position:0%
I'm going to miss him because oftentimes
 
00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:00.180 align:start position:0%
but not often but occasion will disagree
 
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:03.300 align:start position:0%
and I'll get that look even got the look
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
in the hall this morning because he saw
 
00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
something I'd said in the newspaper so
 
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
I'm going to miss him and his State's
 
00:09:11.329 --> 00:09:11.339 align:start position:0%
going to really lose an incredible
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
public servant but I'm sure somebody
 
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
will find a place for him but he's
 
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:18.180 align:start position:0%
certainly going to be missed and I thank
 
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
him for everything he's done for me in
 
00:09:23.389 --> 00:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
the state and I'd like to move now to
 
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
Karen umberger who I met years ago she
 
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
came over to division one
 
00:09:32.329 --> 00:09:32.339 align:start position:0%
and she was a rock as soon as she got
 
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
there I learned that she had been a
 
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
colonel in the Air Force and she often
 
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:38.820 align:start position:0%
kept me in line and some of the other
 
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:41.700 align:start position:0%
members of the division but Karen losing
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
thorough individuals I've ever had the
 
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%

um as I'm sure you're where I am pose
 
00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
the question about parental consent as
 
00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
it relates to this
 
00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.389 align:start position:0%
it relates to this
um

00:13:59.389 --> 00:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
physical mode and I have a question and
 
00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for your responses to that um
 
00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to go a little deeper in
 
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
that so given that Federal Essa law
 
00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
which is the every student that succeeds
 
00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:14.700 align:start position:0%
act requires and this is a quote from
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
that one very long document informed
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
consent from the parent of each child
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
who is under 18 years of age to
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
participate in any mental health
 
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
assessment or service
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
end quote wouldn't the more proactive
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
approach on the part of DHHS be to
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
actively encourage encourage the people
 
00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
being trained to first get parental
 
00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
consent when there's any concern on the
 
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
mental health of a child
 
00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
I think that that's accurate and that
 
00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
certainly can be if it is not currently
 
00:14:42.889 --> 00:14:42.899 align:start position:0%
part of that training we can ensure that
 
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:50.279 align:start position:0%

sorry I didn't catch your name
 
00:16:28.009 --> 00:16:28.019 align:start position:0%
Point oop
 
00:16:31.069 --> 00:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
if I recall the tanks were supposed to
 
00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:33.959 align:start position:0%
be removed some time ago and now it's
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
being put off again uh is your thoughts
 
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:39.959 align:start position:0%
that you will be bringing a request
 
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
through the budget to remove these tanks
 
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
again I guess yes yes that would be our
 
00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:49.079 align:start position:0%
plan going forward
 
00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
and a follow-up question certainly so
 
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
I'm taking it not to ever assume but
 
00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:56.759 align:start position:0%
there's no environmental Risk by leaving
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
those tanks in the ground that's not an
 
00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:01.259 align:start position:0%
issue it's just the abandoned tanks need
 
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
to be removed correct yes no
 
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
environmental risk associated with the
 
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
tanks okay uh thanks so much thanks

okay I have a motion
 
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:19.860 align:start position:0%

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:25.789 align:start position:0%

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:31.980 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry thank you madam chair could
 
00:17:35.169 --> 00:17:35.179 align:start position:0%
you just so this was as I recall
 
00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
approved in the
 
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:40.740 align:start position:0%
previous term not the current term
 
00:17:42.529 --> 00:17:42.539 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering why the two plus year
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
delay in even getting to the process
 
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
given that
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't wasn't like you had to plan
 
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
anything or you know do a design or
 
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
anything you're basically just taking
 
00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:58.370 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
I think so forgive me I I think that um
 
00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:04.980 align:start position:0%
it was more recent that we got the
 
00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:07.740 align:start position:0%
approval for the tanks
 
00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
yeah so in um in in the attached to the
 
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
item in front of you
 
00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:15.299 align:start position:0%
um we are actually this request is to
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
amend a prior item uh 22 162 that came
 
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
before the committee this past spring I
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
think I believe it was at the May
 
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
meeting where we were accepting uh what
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
was it about 5.6 million dollars of dish
 
00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
funding and we had allocated uh funds to
 
00:18:33.289 --> 00:18:33.299 align:start position:0%
specific projects and and the
 
00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:34.740 align:start position:0%
underground oil tanks was one of those
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
projects and so here we're seeking to
 
00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
repurpose those funds to cover the
 
00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
additional inquiries construction costs
 
00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
did I answer your question a follower
 
00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:43.909 align:start position:0%

general Court's ethics uh booklet part
 
00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
one section seven uh and I do this not
 
00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
because I believe that I really have a
 
00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:32.940 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest but nonetheless out
 
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:35.220 align:start position:0%
of an abundance of caution I know that
 
00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
yesterday I filed a declaration of
 
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:38.289 align:start position:0%
yesterday I filed a declaration of
intent

00:21:38.289 --> 00:21:38.299 align:start position:0%
intent
 
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
with respect to this matter it arises
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
out of the fact that there has uh there
 
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
apparently is a dispute between some
 
00:21:49.789 --> 00:21:49.799 align:start position:0%
parties relating to the matter one of
 
00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
the parties being Comcast and I note for
 
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
the record that I own and have owned for
 
00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:57.900 align:start position:0%
many years uh shares of Comcast uh
 
00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
common stock of approximately uh as of
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
checking as of yesterday was 243 shares
 
00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:06.980 align:start position:0%
those shares represent
 
00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
a small percentage of the assets held by
 
00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:13.020 align:start position:0%
my myself and my wife and I do not
 
00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
believe that um
 
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
I have no question that it would not
 
00:22:18.529 --> 00:22:18.539 align:start position:0%
affect in any way my ability to fairly
 
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
and impartially consider the matters in
 
00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
related to this issue nor do I believe
 
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
that any person any objective person
 
00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:28.740 align:start position:0%
fully informed of the facts could
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
conclude otherwise for those reasons I
 
00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
do not intend uh I intend to participate

representative Lynn yes uh to either the
 
00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:23.220 align:start position:0%
Chief Justice or Justice King am I
 
00:31:27.049 --> 00:31:27.059 align:start position:0%
understanding that you are submitting
 
00:31:30.049 --> 00:31:30.059 align:start position:0%
this for the purpose of of us being
 
00:31:33.649 --> 00:31:33.659 align:start position:0%
aware of it not not to sort of bless it
 
00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
so to speak
 
00:31:35.399 --> 00:31:36.230 align:start position:0%
so to speak
um

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:39.169 --> 00:31:39.179 align:start position:0%
and I think I mean personally the reason
 
00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:41.700 align:start position:0%
for that is I we really haven't had a
 
00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
chance to look at it in any in the
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
underlying we got the underlying report
 
00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
um yesterday uh and I haven't had a
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
chance to really look at it
 
00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:52.610 align:start position:0%
chance to really look at it
um

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
and the one thing that I I say candidly
 
00:31:57.769 --> 00:31:57.779 align:start position:0%
the one thing that at least raises a
 
00:32:00.529 --> 00:32:00.539 align:start position:0%
question in my mind is um the with
 
00:32:03.649 --> 00:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
regard to the Circuit Court the need for
 
00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
21 additional judicial officers that I
 
00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
mean I I don't have any question that
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
you may need some additional Circuit
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
Court judges I don't have any question
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
about that 21
 
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
is I guess I'd like to
 
00:32:18.409 --> 00:32:18.419 align:start position:0%
if you're asking us to sort of say we
 
00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:19.980 align:start position:0%
agree with that I think I wouldn't be
 
00:32:24.529 --> 00:32:24.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:26.640 align:start position:0%

the findings of the study but it is
 
00:33:21.409 --> 00:33:21.419 align:start position:0%
something that we undertook in
 
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:23.220 align:start position:0%
consultation with the national group
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
that is done
 
00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.029 align:start position:0%
that is done
um

00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
many of these studies and um
 
00:33:34.009 --> 00:33:34.019 align:start position:0%
uh in in the conclusions are what they
 
00:33:34.019 --> 00:33:35.930 align:start position:0%
uh in in the conclusions are what they
are

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:35.940 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
did you have a follow-up yeah I guess
 
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
what I'm I I guess all I'm sort of
 
00:33:42.289 --> 00:33:42.299 align:start position:0%
saying is I'm not at least personally
 
00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:43.559 align:start position:0%
I'm not
 
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not prepared to to sort of accept it
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
at this point I'm not yeah it may very
 
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
well be able to be you know be entirely
 
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate to accept it all I'm saying
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
is I don't think I've had enough time
 
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure if any of the other
 
00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
members of the fiscal committee have
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
really had enough time to digest the UN
 
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
you know the the full report to make a
 
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
decision on it now that's that's all I'm

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
terms of the availability of resources
 
00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
under era and the uh the diminishing
 
00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:42.900 align:start position:0%
amounts that are available to that is
 
00:42:47.089 --> 00:42:47.099 align:start position:0%
not of our is not of our preference we
 
00:42:50.109 --> 00:42:50.119 align:start position:0%
have over the last couple of months made
 
00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:53.460 align:start position:0%
requests from U.S treasury in excess of
 
00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:54.900 align:start position:0%
100 million dollars worth of
 
00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:57.180 align:start position:0%
reallocation reallocated funds under the
 
00:42:59.809 --> 00:42:59.819 align:start position:0%
era program to continue funding the full
 
00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:02.300 align:start position:0%
program but to date we have received
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
somewhere just above four million
 
00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of funds for them for that
 
00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:07.970 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of funds for them for that
reallocation

00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:07.980 align:start position:0%
reallocation
 
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
um so this is uh this is an opportunity
 
00:43:14.569 --> 00:43:14.579 align:start position:0%
for us to take care of the people that
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
are in the most needy situation as we go
 
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
into the winter months keep them in a
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
housing situation we will continue to
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
work with those individuals through New
 
00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:26.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing in the caps
 
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
with the services that will be provided
 
00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
to them to help them transition a more
 
00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:34.380 align:start position:0%
permanent housing situation and also get
 
00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:36.660 align:start position:0%
them access to other services that are
 
00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:38.660 align:start position:0%
available at the state and federal level
 
00:43:41.089 --> 00:43:41.099 align:start position:0%
those have been underway since the
 
00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
Inception of this program and we'll
 
00:43:48.109 --> 00:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
continue so a combination of 20 million
 
00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:51.180 align:start position:0%
dollars for that purpose in addition I
 
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
believe there's a separate item for
 
00:43:56.089 --> 00:43:56.099 align:start position:0%
um for the services that will go with
 
00:43:58.609 --> 00:43:58.619 align:start position:0%
does with those programs so that's I
 
00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
guess the quick overview Madam chair
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
uh represent leishman thanks Madam chair
 
00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
thanks for your presentation
 
00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:08.450 align:start position:0%
thanks for your presentation
commissioner

00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:08.460 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:44:11.329 --> 00:44:11.339 align:start position:0%
so I believe we've got about 7 500
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
families I don't know what that equates
 
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
to as far as individuals and clearly I
 
00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:17.460 align:start position:0%
support keeping them out of the winter
 
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
cold but what concerns me I understand
 
00:44:23.329 --> 00:44:23.339 align:start position:0%
that we're paying as much as 350 or more
 
00:44:26.809 --> 00:44:26.819 align:start position:0%
dollars to hotels for rooms or are you
 
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
able to control some of those costs
 
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
paying those higher rates would
 
00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
certainly eat into your funding
 
00:44:35.569 --> 00:44:35.579 align:start position:0%
absolutely and and thank you
 
00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
representative our goal with this round
 
00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
of funding that we are asking for now
 
00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
the 200 the 20 million we are going to
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh set sort of a uh an overall goal of
 
00:44:52.849 --> 00:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
200 as a cap for uh the per night cost
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
of of these of this type of housing I
 
00:44:59.750 --> 00:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
think though uh having said that we are
 
00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
going to have some instances where we
 
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
might see in the upper in the Mount
 
00:45:07.069 --> 00:45:07.079 align:start position:0%
Washington Valley for instance where the
 
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
cost of a hotel room during February
 
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
vacation week is a higher amount and we
 
00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to put anyone in the position
 
00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
of going in and out of a housing
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
situation and so we're going to build in
 
00:45:22.609 --> 00:45:22.619 align:start position:0%
an ability to have some flexibility but
 
00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:24.420 align:start position:0%
then again when we get into the March
 
00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:26.460 align:start position:0%
and April shoulder season we would
 
00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:28.940 align:start position:0%
expect to see that number decrease
 
00:45:31.609 --> 00:45:31.619 align:start position:0%
as you know in in terms of the
 
00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
availability of hotel rooms for other
 
00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
people than the ones that we're housing
 
00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
under the program follow-up yes thanks
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
Madam chair
 
00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me if you're filling up
 
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
these hotels and motels during the off
 
00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
season that that rate should carry
 
00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:49.450 align:start position:0%
season that that rate should carry
forward

00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:49.460 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
consistently because you're providing
 
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
that funding to keep those rooms full
 
00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
even though there may be a week you know
 
00:45:58.370 --> 00:45:58.380 align:start position:0%
in the February school vacation I would
 
00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:00.020 align:start position:0%
think would be advantageous for those
 
00:46:02.809 --> 00:46:02.819 align:start position:0%
facilities to have their rooms full for
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
the entire winter yep and keep the rate
 
00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
pretty constant that would be certainly
 
00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
my hope I absolutely agree with that but
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
I think you know we we can't foresee
 
00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
that there would not be a situation
 
00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
where we would have to have
 
00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:19.140 align:start position:0%
um you know a hotel that is
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
willing to switch people out I don't
 
00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:23.700 align:start position:0%
necessarily want to put ourselves in
 
00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:25.380 align:start position:0%
that position I want to be able to
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
continue to have them house those
 
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
individuals for a period of time where
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
there goes above a a loose cap let's say
 
00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:34.140 align:start position:0%
a flexible cap
 
00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:36.780 align:start position:0%
um but overall yes we our our goal is to
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
keep the overall spend rate on the
 
00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:41.460 align:start position:0%
program at 200 or less thank you thank
 
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
you madam chair are there any further uh
 
00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Senator Khan thank you
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
madam chair and uh following on the same
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh tangent the
 
00:46:56.109 --> 00:46:56.119 align:start position:0%
who is going to set that rate
 
00:46:59.569 --> 00:46:59.579 align:start position:0%
and is that the Caps that are going to
 
00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:03.980 align:start position:0%
be responsible for whatever rate cap
 
00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:07.500 align:start position:0%
the Gopher sets for reimbursement yes
 
00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
Center so that's what's happening right
 
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
now so bear in mind that this is not
 
00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily a whole new thing there are
 
00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
people who are currently in hotels and
 
00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
they're being paid for under the the era
 
00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.730 align:start position:0%
they're being paid for under the the era

rate under 200 dollars
 
00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:36.780 align:start position:0%

also from the governor's office for

emergency relief and Recovery
 
00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair this final item uh
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
is around 2.2 million dollars this is a
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
a reallocation under the era2 program so
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
as you heard me mention before we've
 
00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
received a total reallocations around
 
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
4.4 million dollars this is 2.2 of that
 
00:51:11.809 --> 00:51:11.819 align:start position:0%
that U.S treasury has provided this
 
00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:14.220 align:start position:0%
funding will go directly into the
 
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
existing era program it is not exclusive
 
00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:20.700 align:start position:0%
to the hotel motel uh funding that that
 
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
we just discussed so this is just merely
 
00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:25.020 align:start position:0%
a reallocation there were two items that
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
you passed under one or two items that
 
00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:28.980 align:start position:0%
you passed under consent that do the
 
00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
same thing for era and era2 this one
 
00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
just came in just late so we wanted to
 
00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
make sure that we got it through
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
so this will go into the total pot of
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
funding that's available under the
 
00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:41.460 align:start position:0%
existing era program
 
00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:43.980 align:start position:0%
are there questions
 
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
I do have one yes ma'am
 
00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
um with this additional funding will the
 
00:51:54.589 --> 00:51:54.599 align:start position:0%
rental assistance go beyond 29 December
 
00:51:58.490 --> 00:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
or 31 December whatever that date is I
 
00:52:00.589 --> 00:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
think what this does really is it gives
 
00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
us much more of a cushion uh in that
 
00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
time period
 
00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
um I I I don't recall the the weekly
 
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
amount that that is being spent at this
 
00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
point but two million dollars is going
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:17.329 --> 00:52:17.339 align:start position:0%
we're doing about five million dollars a
 
00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
what what happens to the families that
 
00:52:30.109 --> 00:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
we're providing rental assistance to so
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
for so as we've just discussed the
 
00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
people that are in that situation in
 
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
hotels and motels and I'm not talking
 
00:52:38.089 --> 00:52:38.099 align:start position:0%
about the hotels and motels I'm talking
 
00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:40.020 align:start position:0%
people that are in other programs where
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
they're in the lease department or
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
there's some other situation uh there
 
00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:45.660 align:start position:0%
we've been rotating people on and off
 
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
that program since the Inception of this
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
program uh so people have either time
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
limitations as to how much time they can
 
00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
actually are eligible for under the
 
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
program or uh they uh they'll cycle in
 
00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
and out of a given apartment
 
00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:03.180 align:start position:0%
um so in all of those cases it is a bit
 
00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:05.940 align:start position:0%
of a constant transition uh and but also
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
in each of these cases the caps and New
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing are continuing to
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
provide these services to help people
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
find housing and in a lot of cases
 
00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
that's why they're leaving the program
 
00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:19.380 align:start position:0%
is because they are able to find a
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
location somewhere in the state
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
and uh and and not have to be on the
 
00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
subsidy program but but I think the fact
 
00:53:30.349 --> 00:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
is is that at this stage the rental
 
00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
subsidy program not related to hotels
 
00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:41.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:43.740 align:start position:0%
so if I might
 
00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:46.250 align:start position:0%
so if I might
um

00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
rental assistance side of it
 
00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:51.470 align:start position:0%
rental assistance side of it
um

00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
are the Caps expecting
 
00:53:57.049 --> 00:53:57.059 align:start position:0%
people to have to move out of apartments
 
00:54:00.790 --> 00:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
and into hotels and motels
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
that that is we we're not gonna I don't
 
00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
think we'll see a lot of that type of
 
00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:07.500 align:start position:0%
activity uh we have other programs that
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
we have in place for individuals and
 
00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
families that are caught in a situation
 
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
where they have uh either
 
00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
um uh eviction issues or other mental
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
issues uh whether it's through funding
 
00:54:20.809 --> 00:54:20.819 align:start position:0%
that we have provided and you've
 
00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:22.980 align:start position:0%
approved through the court system uh to
 
00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:25.380 align:start position:0%
mediate those situations uh in
 
00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
combination with the support services uh
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
you know I think given the resources
 
00:54:32.329 --> 00:54:32.339 align:start position:0%
that we have available to us to continue
 
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
to assist these families
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
um that's uh really at the at the peak
 
00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
of the activity right now is uh
 
00:54:41.530 --> 00:54:41.540 align:start position:0%
continuing to provide those Services
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you are there any further
 
00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:46.549 align:start position:0%
okay thank you are there any further
questions

00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:49.140 align:start position:0%
uh representative Leachman
 
00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
so I just have one I hope simple
 
00:54:57.410 --> 00:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
question your explanation is a little
 
00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
lean and how many people are involved in
 
00:55:02.809 --> 00:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
these programs like your supportive
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
staff and what's the cost of supporting
 
00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
these programs on the state or on the
 
00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
Federal Grant
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
so this program is administered by New
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing and uh and then they
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
work with the cap agencies in terms of
 
00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:20.220 align:start position:0%
the specifics on the administrative
 
00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:22.380 align:start position:0%
costs I might ask Chase to to give you
 
00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:23.450 align:start position:0%
costs I might ask Chase to to give you
that

00:55:23.450 --> 00:55:23.460 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
sure uh Chase Hageman deputy director at
 
00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:27.230 align:start position:0%
sure uh Chase Hageman deputy director at
gopher

00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
gopher
 
00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
um that's a good question representative
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
the contract overall for rental
 
00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:33.500 align:start position:0%
assistance has effectively a cap on
 
00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:35.460 align:start position:0%
administrative costs I believe it's
 
00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:37.380 align:start position:0%
eight and a half percent total split
 
00:55:38.569 --> 00:55:38.579 align:start position:0%
between New Hampshire Housing and the
 
00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
caps and then when it comes to the
 
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
support of services there's a similar
 
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
administrative cost that goes that's
 
00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:46.980 align:start position:0%
built into those contracts but as you
 
00:55:49.609 --> 00:55:49.619 align:start position:0%
might expect a lot of the con those kind
 
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
of services are very Personnel intensive
 
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
so a lot of it is Staff costs to work in
 
00:55:56.450 --> 00:55:56.460 align:start position:0%
the case management setting specifically
 
00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:59.089 align:start position:0%
the case management setting specifically
thanks

00:55:59.089 --> 00:55:59.099 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:56:01.730 --> 00:56:01.740 align:start position:0%
are there any uh Senator Khan yeah thank
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
you madam chair just
 
00:56:06.109 --> 00:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
how many families are currently being
 
00:56:08.089 --> 00:56:08.099 align:start position:0%
served by this program I mean with one
 
00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
month left to go I
 
00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
I I'm sure they're going to be working
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
hard but uh to to make sure that they
 
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
don't hit the cliff but how many people
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
are we talking about how many families
 
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
so Sandra it's also a good question
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
overall the program has served over 25
 
00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
000 households from what I recall of the
 
00:56:29.329 --> 00:56:29.339 align:start position:0%
numbers that's typically around I think
 
00:56:31.609 --> 00:56:31.619 align:start position:0%
2500 families a week benefiting from
 
00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
this program uh and then there are
 
00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
several hundred that are also in house
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
or in hotels and motels at this point
 
00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
which is why this funding is coming
 
00:56:42.589 --> 00:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
before you today uh in terms of a
 
00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
specific set number every week it
 
00:56:47.329 --> 00:56:47.339 align:start position:0%
depends especially as New Hampshire
 
00:56:49.069 --> 00:56:49.079 align:start position:0%
Housing and the Caps continue to process
 
00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:51.300 align:start position:0%
the applications that have come in as of
 
00:56:53.450 --> 00:56:53.460 align:start position:0%
the application pause on October 21st so

the
 
00:58:34.559 --> 00:58:36.349 align:start position:0%
the
okay

00:58:36.349 --> 00:58:36.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh would you mind going through and just
 
00:58:40.730 --> 00:58:40.740 align:start position:0%
explaining what this what you're asking
 
00:58:44.329 --> 00:58:44.339 align:start position:0%
for absolutely Madam chair so uh the the
 
00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
request before the committee is to use
 
00:58:48.349 --> 00:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
two and a half million dollars
 
00:58:51.049 --> 00:58:51.059 align:start position:0%
approximately of State fiscal recovery
 
00:58:54.370 --> 00:58:54.380 align:start position:0%
funds for a targeted Workforce
 
00:58:58.569 --> 00:58:58.579 align:start position:0%
recruitment program for our emergency
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
transportation providers in the state so
 
00:59:05.089 --> 00:59:05.099 align:start position:0%
the providers we're talking about are
 
00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:07.140 align:start position:0%
all licensed with the Department of
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
Safety and includes it includes your
 
00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
your ambulance providers it includes
 
00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
your your public fire departments it
 
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
includes some Emergency
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
Medical Service units that are in the
 
00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:26.700 align:start position:0%
the private sector as well so are about
 
00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:29.460 align:start position:0%
300 employers Statewide that are
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
licensed to provide this service for
 
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
emergency and non-emergency
 
00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:35.220 align:start position:0%
transportation I mean what we're seeking
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
to do is to add additional emergency
 
00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
medical technicians to their ranks
 
00:59:44.089 --> 00:59:44.099 align:start position:0%
currently we have about 2 600 EMT
 
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
certified and licensed individuals in
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
the state the department of safety has
 
00:59:53.329 --> 00:59:53.339 align:start position:0%
identified a shortage in that field
 
00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:55.640 align:start position:0%
which then has a compounding effect
 
00:59:58.490 --> 00:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
throughout the health care delivery
 
01:00:01.849 --> 01:00:01.859 align:start position:0%
system so when we don't have enough EMTs
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
to be providing transportation for
 
01:00:06.829 --> 01:00:06.839 align:start position:0%
individuals not only to get to our
 
01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
health care facilities in an emergency
 
01:00:12.049 --> 01:00:12.059 align:start position:0%
situation that's a problem but it is
 
01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
also a problem when we don't have
 
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
sufficient EMTs to provide that
 
01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:19.380 align:start position:0%
transportation between facilities so
 
01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
from a hospital to a rehabilitation
 
01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:25.140 align:start position:0%
facility or long-term care facility so
 
01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
this program would address that
 
01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
Workforce issue in three ways very
 
01:00:31.809 --> 01:00:31.819 align:start position:0%
targeted way
 
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
it would first provide funding to those
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
licensed employers to to pay for the
 
01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
cost associated with EMT certification
 
01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
and licensure for individuals seeking
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
that basic level of EMT certification
 
01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
and that would also pay that cost
 
01:00:51.049 --> 01:00:51.059 align:start position:0%
associated with certification for
 
01:00:55.329 --> 01:00:55.339 align:start position:0%
advanced EMT as well we would also
 
01:00:59.329 --> 01:00:59.339 align:start position:0%
provide funding to those employers to
 
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
provide some relief on some of the wage
 
01:01:05.049 --> 01:01:05.059 align:start position:0%
pressures of current practice right now
 
01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:07.980 align:start position:0%
is that such an employer would be
 
01:01:11.089 --> 01:01:11.099 align:start position:0%
reluctant to hire an individual prior to
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
obtaining that basic level of EMT
 
01:01:16.849 --> 01:01:16.859 align:start position:0%
certification this program would provide
 
01:01:19.849 --> 01:01:19.859 align:start position:0%
a 50 percent wage reimbursement for
 
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
those licensed employers during the four
 
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
weeks of employment while they are
 
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
obtaining that basic level EMT
 
01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:33.660 align:start position:0%
certification and licensure and as a
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
third component this program would also
 
01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:39.900 align:start position:0%
provide a recruitment and retention
 
01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
incentive to individuals uh try to add
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
additional people again who will have
 
01:01:47.410 --> 01:01:47.420 align:start position:0%
that basic level of EMT certification
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
and provide them with a thousand dollar
 
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
payment upon completion of that EMT
 
01:01:56.329 --> 01:01:56.339 align:start position:0%
certification and uh sticking with that
 
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
employer for six months so we're trying
 
01:02:02.809 --> 01:02:02.819 align:start position:0%
to do this in a very targeted way with
 
01:02:05.089 --> 01:02:05.099 align:start position:0%
these two and a half million dollars of
 
01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
State fiscal recovery funds however we
 
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
do feel that targeting this particular
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
group within the health care delivery
 
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
system will provide some much needed
 
01:02:17.930 --> 01:02:17.940 align:start position:0%
relief for these emergency
 
01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
transportation services throughout the
 
01:02:22.370 --> 01:02:22.380 align:start position:0%
Health Care system
 
01:02:24.289 --> 01:02:24.299 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
01:02:24.299 --> 01:02:26.089 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
questions

01:02:26.089 --> 01:02:26.099 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:02:26.099 --> 01:02:28.069 align:start position:0%
questions
representative

01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
I thank you madam chair
 
01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:32.220 align:start position:0%
regarding the training time period for
 
01:02:35.089 --> 01:02:35.099 align:start position:0%
which you're paying the wages or half
 
01:02:36.829 --> 01:02:36.839 align:start position:0%
the wages my understanding is the
 
01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
training programs tend to run more like
 
01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
three months not not four weeks
 
01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
so we're we're being very
 
01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.109 align:start position:0%
so we're we're being very
um

01:02:44.109 --> 01:02:44.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
recognizing that we have a limited
 
01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
amount of dollars here
 
01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:48.609 align:start position:0%
amount of dollars here
um

01:02:48.609 --> 01:02:48.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:51.660 align:start position:0%
we're looking at uh providing that
 
01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
relief for the the four weeks
 
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:56.329 align:start position:0%
um and
um

01:02:56.329 --> 01:02:56.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
looking at what the current constraints
 
01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:02.700 align:start position:0%
are and talking with that employer
 
01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
Community we feel that will provide
 
01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
sufficient relief on the wage side to
 
01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
allow that that higher prior to what is
 
01:03:12.770 --> 01:03:12.780 align:start position:0%
current practice right now so it is
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
limited to that four weeks while that
 
01:03:17.809 --> 01:03:17.819 align:start position:0%
individual is engaged in training in
 
01:03:20.690 --> 01:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
terms of the customary length of that
 
01:03:23.329 --> 01:03:23.339 align:start position:0%
training I could turn over here to
 
01:03:25.309 --> 01:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
director cutting to talk a little bit
 
01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:26.940 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
thank you excuse me thank you
 
01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:31.160 align:start position:0%
representative so some employers will
 
01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:34.140 align:start position:0%
their intent is to go out recruit a
 
01:03:36.049 --> 01:03:36.059 align:start position:0%
group of individuals to receive this
 
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
training and then excuse me could you
 
01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I apologies certain employers
 
01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
intend to go out and recruit individuals
 
01:03:46.849 --> 01:03:46.859 align:start position:0%
to become employees and then they are
 
01:03:49.609 --> 01:03:49.619 align:start position:0%
going to sponsor a specific condensed
 
01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
class which puts it into that four or
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
five week time frame the typical time
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
frame is three to four months but that
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
is a nights and weekend type of program
 
01:04:02.569 --> 01:04:02.579 align:start position:0%
which I don't believe would
 
01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
fall under the wage reimbursement
 
01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
portion but would serve a lot of the
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
are there further questions

22 426 passes thank you thank you very
much

01:04:58.430 --> 01:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:05:02.349 --> 01:05:02.359 align:start position:0%
okay we now turn to FIS
 
01:05:05.809 --> 01:05:05.819 align:start position:0%
22427 from the Department of
 
01:05:10.730 --> 01:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:13.309 align:start position:0%
 
hi

01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
hi
 
01:05:15.890 --> 01:05:15.900 align:start position:0%
uh Charlie Arlington the commission of
 
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
administrative Services
 
01:05:19.789 --> 01:05:19.799 align:start position:0%
um I'll try to be brief uh first of all
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
sorry it's late
 
01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:23.700 align:start position:0%
um this came up uh kind of last minute
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
as you know we our function on
 
01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention is essentially
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
ministerial so
 
01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
a small number of people have these sort
 
01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
of uh payments throughout the state none
 
01:05:36.829 --> 01:05:36.839 align:start position:0%
of them work for me
 
01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:38.700 align:start position:0%
throw that out there
 
01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:40.030 align:start position:0%
throw that out there
um

01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
in looking at the implementation of this
 
01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:44.220 align:start position:0%
program a couple of the agencies who
 
01:05:46.130 --> 01:05:46.140 align:start position:0%
have the larger bonus programs found
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
anomalies and the urgency is dictated by
 
01:05:50.809 --> 01:05:50.819 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance as you may be aware
 
01:05:54.109 --> 01:05:54.119 align:start position:0%
winter is essentially upon us
 
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
um and we need people to plow there was
 
01:05:58.430 --> 01:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
a provision in the original language
 
01:06:00.530 --> 01:06:00.540 align:start position:0%
that excluded people who were out on
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
leave out on an extended leave it was
 
01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
determined uh operationally and the
 
01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
Departments will have details if you
 
01:06:09.890 --> 01:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
really need them but essentially you
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
know let's say you're out because you uh
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
because you sprained your ankle and
 
01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
you're off on workers comp for two weeks
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
do we really not want you do we not want
 
01:06:19.789 --> 01:06:19.799 align:start position:0%
to retain you plowing if you're just
 
01:06:21.530 --> 01:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
coming back from maternity leave and
 
01:06:23.809 --> 01:06:23.819 align:start position:0%
you're missing out on the first month or
 
01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
so we still want you on board a plowing
 
01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
a truck or whatever it is whatever it is
 
01:06:31.609 --> 01:06:31.619 align:start position:0%
that we need done and so in doing so
 
01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
this is essentially tweaking the
 
01:06:35.569 --> 01:06:35.579 align:start position:0%
language so there's not an automatic
 
01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:37.640 align:start position:0%
exclusion of a certain group of people
 
01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
who may have legitimate reasons for
 
01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
being out and it allows a proration of
 
01:06:45.049 --> 01:06:45.059 align:start position:0%
the uh of the amounts for those people
 
01:06:48.289 --> 01:06:48.299 align:start position:0%
and that in discussions with the other
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
agencies that are in this program safety
 
01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
and Corrections Etc
 
01:06:56.569 --> 01:06:56.579 align:start position:0%
um uh common language was identified and
 
01:06:56.579 --> 01:06:57.289 align:start position:0%
um uh common language was identified and
then

01:06:57.289 --> 01:06:57.299 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:06:57.299 --> 01:06:57.829 align:start position:0%
then
um

01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:00.890 --> 01:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
I know I got it Tuesday and
 
01:07:02.930 --> 01:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
um and you gratefully accepted it uh
 
01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
coming forward but it just makes the
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
program more operational and it
 
01:07:08.450 --> 01:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
eliminates a minor glitch and allows to
 
01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:12.410 align:start position:0%
eliminates a minor glitch and allows to
prorate

01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions or
 
01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner arlinghaus
 
01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:22.280 align:start position:0%
en is uh yeah refresh
 
01:07:25.309 --> 01:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
how how are the are the programs working
 
01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
are we retaining people is it seeming to
 
01:07:30.829 --> 01:07:30.839 align:start position:0%
work um I think we are I think the proof
 
01:07:33.289 --> 01:07:33.299 align:start position:0%
um I think it's too early to declare
 
01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
success because this is sort of the
 
01:07:36.349 --> 01:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
front end what we really want to do is
 
01:07:38.029 --> 01:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
keep people through the for example
 
01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance through the winter
 
01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
season and I can tell you the answer to
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
that when Winter's over and people
 
01:07:46.010 --> 01:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
didn't leave and so I think it's too
 
01:07:47.210 --> 01:07:47.220 align:start position:0%
early to say
 
01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:49.370 align:start position:0%
early to say
hmm

01:07:49.370 --> 01:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
01:07:51.349 --> 01:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions I
 
01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
noticed uh commissioner Shaheen nodding
 
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
her heads oh that's good
 
01:07:59.230 --> 01:07:59.240 align:start position:0%
I'm scared to Look Backwards oh okay
 
01:08:03.049 --> 01:08:03.059 align:start position:0%
only forward-looking today okay are
 
01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
there any further questions
 
01:08:07.730 --> 01:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
seeing none could I have a motion to
 
01:08:10.849 --> 01:08:10.859 align:start position:0%
accept Senator Gray
 
01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:16.500 align:start position:0%

inappropriate for a second
 
01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:49.620 align:start position:0%
um I'm seeking for myself but I suspect
 
01:08:51.530 --> 01:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
most agencies would agree with me on
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
this I was distressed to hear that you
 
01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
were taking a sabbatical
 
01:08:58.910 --> 01:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
um and uh uh from the standpoint of
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
those of us on this side of the table I
 
01:09:02.689 --> 01:09:02.699 align:start position:0%
would say that your unfailing

professionalism that your knowledge of
 
01:09:06.769 --> 01:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
operational details in your general good

01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
I just want to make a couple of comments
 
01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
before we get to the audits and this has
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
to do with the information items so that
 
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
folks understand that um
 
01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:34.140 align:start position:0%
at least I have gone through and read
 
01:09:36.289 --> 01:09:36.299 align:start position:0%
them and am
 
01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
you know recognize
 
01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
when something is good
 
01:09:44.269 --> 01:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
I was glad to see that our health
 
01:09:47.689 --> 01:09:47.699 align:start position:0%
insurance is still solvent and
 
01:09:51.370 --> 01:09:51.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
I also in
 
01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:57.719 align:start position:0%

LBA followed up with the agencies
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
and I would like to remind all of the
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
agencies that it's much better to
 
01:10:21.169 --> 01:10:21.179 align:start position:0%
provide the information up front than it
 
01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
is to
 
01:10:25.270 --> 01:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
provide the information on the back end
 
01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:30.060 align:start position:0%
but anyhow thank you for uh for that
 
01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:32.090 align:start position:0%
but anyhow thank you for uh for that
report

report
 
01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:32.689 align:start position:0%
report
um

01:10:32.689 --> 01:10:32.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:32.699 --> 01:10:36.970 align:start position:0%
um
okay

01:10:36.970 --> 01:10:36.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:40.729 --> 01:10:40.739 align:start position:0%
oh yeah probably
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
uh Madam chair I moved that today's
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
audits as well as any any additional FY
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
2022 annual Financial reports which
 
01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
become available prior to the end of the
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
calendar year be accepted placed on file
 
01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
and released to the public in the usual
 
01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:55.970 align:start position:0%
and released to the public in the usual
manner

01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
manner
 
01:10:57.729 --> 01:10:57.739 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:11:01.010 --> 01:11:01.020 align:start position:0%
seconded seconded by Senator Gray
 
01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:02.940 align:start position:0%
and we need to have
 
01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:04.310 align:start position:0%
and we need to have
a vote

01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
a vote
 
01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:07.790 align:start position:0%
a vote
okay

01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
this is the vote on accepting reports

someone on the Senate side to
 
01:15:52.209 --> 01:15:52.219 align:start position:0%
to get that
 
01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
moving forward so that we don't end up
 
01:15:59.390 --> 01:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:02.460 align:start position:0%

01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
we're not uh running into a
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
problem that can be blamed on the
 
01:16:15.229 --> 01:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
legislature okay thank you
 
01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:17.340 align:start position:0%

01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
weakness and it discusses risk
 
01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:20.270 align:start position:0%
weakness and it discusses risk
assessment

01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
which is one of the five recognized

components of internal control
 
01:16:26.930 --> 01:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
we recommended the department establish
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
and document a formal risk assessment
 
01:16:32.149 --> 01:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
process and review for indicators of

the department did not pay invoices in a
 
01:16:45.410 --> 01:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
timely manner resulting in
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
non-compliance with State policies and a
 
01:16:51.410 --> 01:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
1.2 million dollar expenditure posting
 
01:16:55.729 --> 01:16:55.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:58.130 --> 01:16:58.140 align:start position:0%

01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
discusses the need to perform and
 
01:17:02.830 --> 01:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
document a review and approval procedure
 
01:17:05.630 --> 01:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
for certain federal drawdowns processed
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%

in observation number four on page six
 
01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
we recommended the department strength
 
01:17:15.169 --> 01:17:15.179 align:start position:0%
and controls over the processing of
 
01:17:18.229 --> 01:17:18.239 align:start position:0%

recorded as a result of our audit
 
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
that concludes my presentation I'd like
 
01:21:24.169 --> 01:21:24.179 align:start position:0%
to thank commissioner Caswell and his
 
01:21:26.450 --> 01:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
staff for their cooperation and
 
01:21:28.490 --> 01:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
assistance during the audit
 
01:21:31.090 --> 01:21:31.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner Caswell do you have
 
01:21:37.250 --> 01:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
I'm so commissioner Taylor Caswell uh ba
 
01:21:42.830 --> 01:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
and with me is Rhonda Hensley who is our
 
01:21:45.410 --> 01:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
business office manager in her
 
01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
second second week on the job
 
01:21:51.410 --> 01:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
um so I I would just want to first of
 
01:21:54.410 --> 01:21:54.420 align:start position:0%
all thank the LBA for uh the period of
 
01:21:57.050 --> 01:21:57.060 align:start position:0%
time that they have spent with us as
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
Christine noted we are a new agency uh
 
01:22:02.930 --> 01:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
in the in the in the world of state
 
01:22:05.950 --> 01:22:05.960 align:start position:0%
government and we have had
 
01:22:09.290 --> 01:22:09.300 align:start position:0%
a series of individuals coming and going
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
through our administrative office and so
 
01:22:13.610 --> 01:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
we're sort of continuing to build a
 
01:22:17.570 --> 01:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
system uh to uh to move forward I would
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
say that the experience that we had with
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
the LBA was exceptionally helpful uh in
 
01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of finding where we need to
 
01:22:28.250 --> 01:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
improve and we're certainly already in
 
01:22:29.630 --> 01:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
many of these items I think we've
 
01:22:32.830 --> 01:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
already started or have addressed
 
01:22:36.649 --> 01:22:36.659 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate that when you uh and I
 
01:22:37.970 --> 01:22:37.980 align:start position:0%
know the department of energy has been
 
01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
through a similar situation where
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
legislative becomes uh and it becomes
 
01:22:47.330 --> 01:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
effective on July 1st of the new fiscal
 
01:22:49.390 --> 01:22:49.400 align:start position:0%
year to start a new depart government
 
01:22:52.130 --> 01:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
and a lot of those pieces are not fully
 
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
in place at that exact moment in time
 
01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
and we don't we don't really have a
 
01:22:58.850 --> 01:22:58.860 align:start position:0%
guidebook you know how to start a new
 
01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
state agency and so we we managed to uh
 
01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
those first couple of months really sort
 
01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
of get these pieces put together and
 
01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
build an administrative system to
 
01:23:09.470 --> 01:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
support the policy initiatives of the
 
01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
department so overall I just I mean I
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
would say thank you I think we were we
 
01:23:16.490 --> 01:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
were pleased with the outcome of a lot
 
01:23:19.490 --> 01:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
of these uh observations and as I said
 
01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
we're already working to implement
 
01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:23.410 align:start position:0%
we're already working to implement
changes

01:23:23.410 --> 01:23:23.420 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:23:26.630 --> 01:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
as we move forward
 
01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:28.850 align:start position:0%
as we move forward
that

01:23:28.850 --> 01:23:28.860 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:32.689 --> 01:23:32.699 align:start position:0%
okay are there questions
 
01:23:35.689 --> 01:23:35.699 align:start position:0%
yes Senator gray or sorry
 
01:23:35.699 --> 01:23:37.310 align:start position:0%
yes Senator gray or sorry
no

01:23:37.310 --> 01:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
Senator Khan will uh we'll ask a
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair okay no
 
01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
problem uh I do want to uh say something
 
01:23:47.630 --> 01:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
about The Graduate retention incentive
 
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
program uh it passed uh probably four
 
01:23:55.330 --> 01:23:55.340 align:start position:0%
years ago and
 
01:23:58.910 --> 01:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh it had the endorsement of the
 
01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
business industry Association of the
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
state it's a grow your own program
 
01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
essentially to try to retain New
 
01:24:10.669 --> 01:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire graduates from New Hampshire
 
01:24:13.729 --> 01:24:13.739 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities yeah in the
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
state for future Workforce Employment
 
01:24:19.189 --> 01:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
needs uh and it costs the state very
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
little uh in that it's an employer
 
01:24:23.570 --> 01:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
driven incentive with the administration
 
01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
through the department
 
01:24:28.970 --> 01:24:28.980 align:start position:0%
um I say that only as a refresher uh to
 
01:24:33.610 --> 01:24:33.620 align:start position:0%
that uh I I think there the the lack of
 
01:24:37.010 --> 01:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
application uh is because the it was
 
01:24:41.209 --> 01:24:41.219 align:start position:0%
never uh promoted uh as an active
 
01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
program so I I I'd encourage and I'd be
 
01:24:45.890 --> 01:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
glad to continue to work with the
 
01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
Department uh to to reignite the
 
01:24:52.250 --> 01:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
partnership that was established around
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
the passage of that legislation
 
01:24:56.209 --> 01:24:56.219 align:start position:0%
certainly Senator and and you know I
 
01:24:57.890 --> 01:24:57.900 align:start position:0%
would say you know we work together to
 
01:24:59.930 --> 01:24:59.940 align:start position:0%
get that legislation passed in the first
 
01:25:02.930 --> 01:25:02.940 align:start position:0%
place and we did do some initial
 
01:25:06.169 --> 01:25:06.179 align:start position:0%
promotional activity my recollection is
 
01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
that uh we all got covered uh sort of
 
01:25:13.490 --> 01:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
got in the way in the implementation of
 
01:25:15.890 --> 01:25:15.900 align:start position:0%
the promotional activities and at that
 
01:25:17.689 --> 01:25:17.699 align:start position:0%
point in time it was
 
01:25:19.850 --> 01:25:19.860 align:start position:0%
um I think pretty difficult to make it a
 
01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
huge priority given the response that
 
01:25:25.250 --> 01:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
our department was involved with with
 
01:25:27.410 --> 01:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
um with covid during those early months
 
01:25:30.290 --> 01:25:30.300 align:start position:0%
of 2020 and into 2021.
 
01:25:32.330 --> 01:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
um I think it is a good program I we
 
01:25:34.189 --> 01:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
have worked with the Bia and the Bia has
 
01:25:36.410 --> 01:25:36.420 align:start position:0%
new leadership in place
 
01:25:39.669 --> 01:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
um the program basically allows for
 
01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
businesses to provide a bonus to
 
01:25:46.689 --> 01:25:46.699 align:start position:0%
individuals who
 
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
graduated from New Hampshire colleges
 
01:25:53.390 --> 01:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
and to have them those businesses that
 
01:25:55.490 --> 01:25:55.500 align:start position:0%
agree to do that be promoted by the
 
01:25:57.530 --> 01:25:57.540 align:start position:0%
department on our website and and
 
01:26:00.290 --> 01:26:00.300 align:start position:0%
interactions with with uh with our staff
 
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
so it's not necessarily a huge lift to
 
01:26:06.410 --> 01:26:06.420 align:start position:0%
get that set up I think the challenge
 
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
continues to be getting the businesses
 
01:26:10.970 --> 01:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
to do that and we'll we'll be working to
 
01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:13.980 align:start position:0%
sort of continue to move that program
 
01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:16.860 align:start position:0%
okay thanks for the response thank you
 
01:26:20.149 --> 01:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
are there any further comments questions
 
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much excellent job and uh
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
we'll move forward
 
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:44.209 --> 01:26:44.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:44.219 --> 01:26:46.090 align:start position:0%

good morning for the record I am Steve

Grady the in charge auditor for the
 
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
Dental Board performance audit
 
01:27:38.810 --> 01:27:38.820 align:start position:0%
the audit assessed how efficiently and
 
01:27:40.250 --> 01:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
effectively the board administered the
 
01:27:41.629 --> 01:27:41.639 align:start position:0%
regulation of dentistry and dental
 
01:27:44.450 --> 01:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
hygiene in state fiscal years 2019 and
 
01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:46.129 align:start position:0%
hygiene in state fiscal years 2019 and
2020.

01:27:46.129 --> 01:27:46.139 align:start position:0%
2020.
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
when they directly affected board
 
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
operations we also examined matters
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
outside that period as well as oplc and
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
other agencies management controls I
 
01:27:56.570 --> 01:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
will be summarizing the report
 
01:28:00.050 --> 01:28:00.060 align:start position:0%
but thank you you're welcome ma'am
 
01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
the executive summary starts on page one
 
01:28:04.490 --> 01:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
there we conclude the board lacked
 
01:28:05.810 --> 01:28:05.820 align:start position:0%
adequate controls to ensure it
 
01:28:07.669 --> 01:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
consistently achieved expected outcomes
 
01:28:09.950 --> 01:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
and that it did so while complying with
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
laws rules and other requirements
 
01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
the board was to protect the public
 
01:28:15.530 --> 01:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
health safety and Welfare from
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
unqualified unscrupulous or impaired
 
01:28:19.850 --> 01:28:19.860 align:start position:0%
dentists and hygienists through three
 
01:28:22.010 --> 01:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
primary functions credentialing
 
01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
monitoring and enforcement
 
01:28:26.629 --> 01:28:26.639 align:start position:0%
however the board's regulatory program
 
01:28:28.490 --> 01:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
was largely subjective
 
01:28:30.530 --> 01:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
credentials that did not meet statutory
 
01:28:32.149 --> 01:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
or other requirements were nonetheless
 
01:28:32.159 --> 01:28:33.290 align:start position:0%
or other requirements were nonetheless
issued

01:28:33.290 --> 01:28:33.300 align:start position:0%
issued
 
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
ongoing credential holder qualification
 
01:28:37.129 --> 01:28:37.139 align:start position:0%
was ineffectively controlled and
 
01:28:37.139 --> 01:28:38.149 align:start position:0%
was ineffectively controlled and
monitored

01:28:38.149 --> 01:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
monitored
 
01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:40.260 align:start position:0%
some seemingly significant requirements
 
01:28:42.410 --> 01:28:42.420 align:start position:0%
were actually perfunctory
 
01:28:43.729 --> 01:28:43.739 align:start position:0%
and Enforcement cases were
 
01:28:46.370 --> 01:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
inconsistently managed and resolved
 
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
some matters were dismissed because of
 
01:28:49.970 --> 01:28:49.980 align:start position:0%
insufficient support not because the
 
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
board had objectively established
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
non-compliance did not occur
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
the board lacked controls over its own
 
01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
compliance with requirements it engaged
 
01:29:00.530 --> 01:29:00.540 align:start position:0%
in extra legal and extra jurisdictional
 
01:29:02.930 --> 01:29:02.940 align:start position:0%
activities including improperly
 
01:29:04.189 --> 01:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
delegating its discretionary
 
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
decision-making Authority
 
01:29:08.330 --> 01:29:08.340 align:start position:0%
creating credentials and subordinate
 
01:29:10.610 --> 01:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
entities without statutory Authority
 
01:29:13.490 --> 01:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
engaging in Broad ad hoc rulemaking and
 
01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
failing to implement State policy
 
01:29:18.169 --> 01:29:18.179 align:start position:0%
board ineffectiveness was underpinned in
 
01:29:19.970 --> 01:29:19.980 align:start position:0%
part by inconsistent support from other
 
01:29:23.450 --> 01:29:23.460 align:start position:0%
agencies notably the oplc
 
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
insufficient oplc management controls
 
01:29:27.649 --> 01:29:27.659 align:start position:0%
adversely affected board operations in
 
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
several ways
 
01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
there was no accountability framework to
 
01:29:33.709 --> 01:29:33.719 align:start position:0%
ensure oplc provided services that were
 
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
acceptable and that substandard Service
 
01:29:38.090 --> 01:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
delivery was remedied
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
records were poorly managed controls
 
01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
were poorly understood
 
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:44.639 align:start position:0%
many board actions were unauditable
 
01:29:46.129 --> 01:29:46.139 align:start position:0%
consequently we were compelled to
 
01:29:48.530 --> 01:29:48.540 align:start position:0%
qualify our use of and our conclusions
 
01:29:50.330 --> 01:29:50.340 align:start position:0%

legislative suggestions or elements that
 
01:30:47.810 --> 01:30:47.820 align:start position:0%
may require legislative action depending
 
01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
upon how the responsible agency
 
01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
remediates the identified defects
 
01:30:54.649 --> 01:30:54.659 align:start position:0%
legislative suggestions include
 
01:30:56.750 --> 01:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
increasing the number of public board
 
01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:58.189 align:start position:0%
increasing the number of public board

01:31:00.590 --> 01:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
further clarifying the oplc board
 
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%

structuring interagency accountability
 
01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:09.540 align:start position:0%
and determining whether a fundamental
 
01:31:11.090 --> 01:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
change to the state's approach to

01:31:18.110 --> 01:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
current board members and oplc
 
01:31:19.790 --> 01:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
management did not create all of the
 
01:31:21.770 --> 01:31:21.780 align:start position:0%
defective controls we identified many
 
01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
defects were long-standing
 
01:31:25.189 --> 01:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
nonetheless current members and
 
01:31:26.330 --> 01:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
management were responsible for
 
01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
efficiency and Effectiveness it will
 
01:31:30.110 --> 01:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
likely take the board several years to
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
address the oddest recommendations and
 
01:31:33.649 --> 01:31:33.659 align:start position:0%
develop and Implement an effective
 
01:31:35.810 --> 01:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
regulatory program objectively shown to
 
01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
efficiently achieve expected outcomes
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
integration aboard and oplc controls to
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
help remediate some defects and gain
 
01:31:45.169 --> 01:31:45.179 align:start position:0%
positive control over board operations
 
01:31:47.390 --> 01:31:47.400 align:start position:0%
has reportedly begun
 
01:31:49.610 --> 01:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
however whether how and when the board
 
01:31:51.110 --> 01:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
will remediate other defects is
 
01:31:52.610 --> 01:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
inconsistently clear
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
the board inconsistently recognized
 
01:31:56.330 --> 01:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
limitations on its Authority
 
01:31:58.250 --> 01:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
it disagreed with a need to follow some
 
01:32:00.530 --> 01:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
fundamental State policy requirements
 
01:32:02.270 --> 01:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
consequently we suggest the general
 
01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
court consider how expanded oversight
 
01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
could help ensure the board effectively
 
01:32:08.209 --> 01:32:08.219 align:start position:0%
carries out State policy and that it
 
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
complies with the limitations imposed
 
01:32:13.250 --> 01:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
upon it when it as it does so
 
01:32:14.810 --> 01:32:14.820 align:start position:0%
I would like to thank board members
 
01:32:17.570 --> 01:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
members of subordinate entities oplc
 
01:32:19.370 --> 01:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
management and staff and numerous
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
stakeholders for their assistance during
 
01:32:22.189 --> 01:32:22.199 align:start position:0%
the audit
 
01:32:23.810 --> 01:32:23.820 align:start position:0%
unless there are any questions with me
 
01:32:25.310 --> 01:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
I'll be followed by the board president
 
01:32:27.410 --> 01:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
Dr kocher and then by Lindsey Courtney
 
01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:38.030 --> 01:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:40.189 --> 01:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
uh good morning Madam chair and members
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm Dr Punit kocher
 
01:32:44.030 --> 01:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
president of the New Hampshire Board of
 
01:32:45.890 --> 01:32:45.900 align:start position:0%
dental examiners and I just want to
 
01:32:48.110 --> 01:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
thank you guys for letting me speak to
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
address the lb audit
 
01:32:52.189 --> 01:32:52.199 align:start position:0%
the board does take its responsibility
 
01:32:54.830 --> 01:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
to protect the public very seriously
 
01:32:57.770 --> 01:32:57.780 align:start position:0%
the the fact of the matter is that none
 
01:32:59.689 --> 01:32:59.699 align:start position:0%
of the board members are an attorney so
 
01:33:02.270 --> 01:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
you know we count on support legal
 
01:33:04.250 --> 01:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
counsel for any legislative changes that
 
01:33:05.090 --> 01:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
come up
 
01:33:08.209 --> 01:33:08.219 align:start position:0%
but that being said the board was
 
01:33:10.970 --> 01:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
working on the current rules in place
 
01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
the current legislative uh statues in
 
01:33:16.910 --> 01:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
place so the Committees the LBA
 
01:33:19.129 --> 01:33:19.139 align:start position:0%
committee's report was an eye-opener
 
01:33:20.930 --> 01:33:20.940 align:start position:0%
so we were working with heart we were
 
01:33:23.570 --> 01:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
working on what we had but since we've
 
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
had enough reading material here I think
 
01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:28.040 align:start position:0%
for a few weeks or months
 
01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
this is now that we realize okay now we
 
01:33:32.990 --> 01:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
know better so we gotta do better so
 
01:33:34.850 --> 01:33:34.860 align:start position:0%
like Steve pointed out the board is
 
01:33:37.010 --> 01:33:37.020 align:start position:0%
already working on figuring out how
 
01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to incorporate all these
 
01:33:40.970 --> 01:33:40.980 align:start position:0%
recommendations it will be a several
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
years project no no doubt and it will
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
require resources from oplc it will
 
01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
require legislative changes that the
 
01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
board would reach out to maybe the
 
01:33:52.910 --> 01:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
committee members or or other people who
 
01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
can who can give support for those
 
01:33:56.209 --> 01:33:56.219 align:start position:0%
legislative legislative changes to be
 
01:33:59.149 --> 01:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
made and then we'll go from there so I'm
 
01:34:01.010 --> 01:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
not going to address every observation
 
01:34:03.229 --> 01:34:03.239 align:start position:0%
because I don't want you guys to spend
 
01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
all your day here but if you have
 
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
questions I'll be happy to answer
 
01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
I would just like to say that uh
 
01:34:13.790 --> 01:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
don't feel that you were picked on
 
01:34:16.910 --> 01:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
um this is probably one of our first
 
01:34:19.550 --> 01:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
audits in oplc
 
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:27.530 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:34:27.530 --> 01:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:37.010 --> 01:34:37.020 align:start position:0%
can you can you hear me now yeah great
 
01:34:39.890 --> 01:34:39.900 align:start position:0%
we conducted several audits in 2017
 
01:34:42.590 --> 01:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
which was about two years after the OPC
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
was created in 2015 but since 2017 this
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
is the only performance audit we've
 
01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
conducted of an oplc assigned agency
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so and that had a lot of changes at
 
01:34:54.290 --> 01:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
oplc during that time
 
01:34:57.290 --> 01:34:57.300 align:start position:0%
and uh so
 
01:35:01.129 --> 01:35:01.139 align:start position:0%
you know they'll be uh there'll be other
 
01:35:04.669 --> 01:35:04.679 align:start position:0%
boards that will be looked at in the
 
01:35:04.679 --> 01:35:05.689 align:start position:0%
boards that will be looked at in the
future

01:35:05.689 --> 01:35:05.699 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:35:09.709 --> 01:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
okay so you're just coming up initially
 
01:35:14.030 --> 01:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
sure okay yes all right thank you thank
 
01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:20.530 align:start position:0%
sure okay yes all right thank you thank
you

01:35:20.530 --> 01:35:20.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
do you want to swap
 
01:35:28.370 --> 01:35:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:29.950 --> 01:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:35:31.729 --> 01:35:31.739 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:35:33.229 --> 01:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
um for the record Lindsey Courtney I'm
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
the executive director of The Office of
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
professional licensed lice Insurance
 
01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:39.229 align:start position:0%
professional licensed lice Insurance
certification

01:35:39.229 --> 01:35:39.239 align:start position:0%
certification
 
01:35:41.149 --> 01:35:41.159 align:start position:0%
um just wanted to start out briefly by
 
01:35:43.550 --> 01:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
thanking members of the auditing
 
01:35:48.250 --> 01:35:48.260 align:start position:0%
auditing team team for their work in
 
01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
assisting us and identifying a lot of
 
01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
the issues that we've been aware of or
 
01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
at least I've been aware of since
 
01:35:58.490 --> 01:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
starting in 2019 but articulating it in
 
01:36:00.649 --> 01:36:00.659 align:start position:0%
a fashion that I think will help us move
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
forward it was a long process so I I
 
01:36:06.530 --> 01:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
really appreciate the work as well as
 
01:36:08.990 --> 01:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
the work of the board and cooperating
 
01:36:12.830 --> 01:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
and collaborating with this process oplc
 
01:36:14.810 --> 01:36:14.820 align:start position:0%
completely concurs with all of the
 
01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
findings in the audit and I think the
 
01:36:18.649 --> 01:36:18.659 align:start position:0%
one thing that I would note is that
 
01:36:20.990 --> 01:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
while this audit is specific to the
 
01:36:23.149 --> 01:36:23.159 align:start position:0%
board of dental examiners the board of
 
01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
dental examiners is not unique and
 
01:36:27.890 --> 01:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
appeal in the concerns raised in the
 
01:36:30.110 --> 01:36:30.120 align:start position:0%
audit with respect to oplc
 
01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
support of the board of dental examiners
 
01:36:37.370 --> 01:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
it's also applicable to all of the other
 
01:36:40.970 --> 01:36:40.980 align:start position:0%
regulatory boards the experience at oplc
 
01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
has been quite interesting for me in the
 
01:36:46.090 --> 01:36:46.100 align:start position:0%
last two years three years almost three
 
01:36:48.649 --> 01:36:48.659 align:start position:0%
there are problems that we identify
 
01:36:50.709 --> 01:36:50.719 align:start position:0%
literally every day
 
01:36:53.330 --> 01:36:53.340 align:start position:0%
so I wanted the committee to be aware of
 
01:36:56.750 --> 01:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
that that this that while this we're
 
01:36:58.250 --> 01:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
looking at the audit through the lens of
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
the Dental Board it does you can really
 
01:37:03.709 --> 01:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
apply it to all of the support that oplc
 
01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:06.900 align:start position:0%
provides to all regulatory boards
 
01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
um I could go on for a long period of
 
01:37:11.450 --> 01:37:11.460 align:start position:0%
time as to what I think the causes of
 
01:37:13.610 --> 01:37:13.620 align:start position:0%
some of these issues are but I I will
 
01:37:15.890 --> 01:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
not do so but I will say that I think
 
01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
one of the primary issues as to why oplc
 
01:37:23.990 --> 01:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
has not rectified its primary problem of
 
01:37:25.970 --> 01:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
of having a lack of internal controls
 
01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
throughout the agency is that it was not
 
01:37:30.370 --> 01:37:30.380 align:start position:0%
a priority at the agency
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
at least for the first several years of
 
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
its Inception I can commit to you and
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
say to you that that is not the case
 
01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:41.350 align:start position:0%
say to you that that is not the case
today

01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:37:44.209 --> 01:37:44.219 align:start position:0%
we have made establishing internal
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
controls the number one priority at the
 
01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:48.310 align:start position:0%
controls the number one priority at the
agency

01:37:48.310 --> 01:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
agency
 
01:37:50.930 --> 01:37:50.940 align:start position:0%
we have put that as part of our
 
01:37:52.729 --> 01:37:52.739 align:start position:0%
strategic plan and I had hoped to have
 
01:37:54.590 --> 01:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
copies of our strategic plan for you
 
01:37:56.990 --> 01:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
today but unfortunately
 
01:37:59.149 --> 01:37:59.159 align:start position:0%
we had some printer problems
 
01:38:00.590 --> 01:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
um maybe that's an internal control
 
01:38:02.270 --> 01:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
tissue I don't know Mr Grady would you
 
01:38:03.590 --> 01:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
tell me
 
01:38:06.290 --> 01:38:06.300 align:start position:0%
um but in any event
 
01:38:08.270 --> 01:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
um I can commit to you that we are
 
01:38:10.370 --> 01:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
committed to resolving
 
01:38:14.570 --> 01:38:14.580 align:start position:0%
um the issues identified in the audit so
 
01:38:17.090 --> 01:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
that we can fully support the licensing
 
01:38:19.570 --> 01:38:19.580 align:start position:0%
boards the way we were designed to do so
 
01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
our implementation of our strategic plan
 
01:38:24.410 --> 01:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
which are is intended to remediate the
 
01:38:26.209 --> 01:38:26.219 align:start position:0%
audit findings will likely take several
 
01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
several years again as I noted while
 
01:38:31.490 --> 01:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
these issues are specific to the Dental
 
01:38:34.850 --> 01:38:34.860 align:start position:0%
Board they apply to all boards some of
 
01:38:36.290 --> 01:38:36.300 align:start position:0%
the initiatives that we're currently
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
undertaking right now is is just
 
01:38:39.709 --> 01:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
conducting an inventory of all of our
 
01:38:41.649 --> 01:38:41.659 align:start position:0%
statutory and regulatory requirements
 
01:38:44.209 --> 01:38:44.219 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it does not surprise most of
 
01:38:46.189 --> 01:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
you that if you put all of our statutes
 
01:38:48.290 --> 01:38:48.300 align:start position:0%
our practice acts in one word document
 
01:38:51.770 --> 01:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
it's well over 2000 Pages that's a lot
 
01:38:55.129 --> 01:38:55.139 align:start position:0%
for one agency to inventory in addition
 
01:38:56.689 --> 01:38:56.699 align:start position:0%
to all of the regulatory requirements
 
01:38:58.610 --> 01:38:58.620 align:start position:0%
that's just one aspect of one of the
 
01:39:01.610 --> 01:39:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:02.990 --> 01:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
I could go on for days about the other
 
01:39:05.810 --> 01:39:05.820 align:start position:0%
things that we're doing but I won't I'd
 
01:39:08.330 --> 01:39:08.340 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions you may
 
01:39:11.149 --> 01:39:11.159 align:start position:0%
have and I'm also happy to circulate our
 
01:39:13.850 --> 01:39:13.860 align:start position:0%
strategic plan to the committee after
 
01:39:17.629 --> 01:39:17.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:19.490 --> 01:39:19.500 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
01:39:22.610 --> 01:39:22.620 align:start position:0%
yes Senator Susie thank you
 
01:39:24.590 --> 01:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
I just wonder if you
 
01:39:27.709 --> 01:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
if you just identify what are the two or
 
01:39:31.070 --> 01:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
three key findings that might be acted
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
on Pawn most quickly
 
01:39:35.570 --> 01:39:35.580 align:start position:0%
or that were most troubling and need to
 
01:39:37.370 --> 01:39:37.380 align:start position:0%
be acted upon most quickly
 
01:39:38.990 --> 01:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
so I think the answer to that question
 
01:39:41.330 --> 01:39:41.340 align:start position:0%
is going to be different for oplc versus
 
01:39:44.330 --> 01:39:44.340 align:start position:0%
the Board I can say for the agency
 
01:39:44.340 --> 01:39:46.970 align:start position:0%
the Board I can say for the agency
um

01:39:46.970 --> 01:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:48.229 align:start position:0%
 
most

01:39:48.229 --> 01:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
most
 
01:39:51.229 --> 01:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
I the biggest challenge at the agency
 
01:39:53.689 --> 01:39:53.699 align:start position:0%
and I I don't know maybe Dr kotar will
 
01:39:55.310 --> 01:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
agree is the lack of clarification
 
01:39:57.590 --> 01:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
between board authority and
 
01:40:00.169 --> 01:40:00.179 align:start position:0%
responsibility versus oplc Authority and
 
01:40:00.179 --> 01:40:02.450 align:start position:0%
responsibility versus oplc Authority and
responsibility

01:40:02.450 --> 01:40:02.460 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
01:40:04.430 --> 01:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
um when oplc was created much like
 
01:40:06.770 --> 01:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
commissioner Caswell mentioned it was
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
created overnight and I actually think
 
01:40:10.970 --> 01:40:10.980 align:start position:0%
the budget was retroactive that year so
 
01:40:12.770 --> 01:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
it was in effect without actually being
 
01:40:14.510 --> 01:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
in effect
 
01:40:17.149 --> 01:40:17.159 align:start position:0%
um the culture surrounding occupational
 
01:40:20.270 --> 01:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
licensing was not really supportive of
 
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
the agency's creation and that's
 
01:40:25.610 --> 01:40:25.620 align:start position:0%
something that has really impacted its
 
01:40:29.629 --> 01:40:29.639 align:start position:0%
ability to effectively Implement its
 
01:40:31.850 --> 01:40:31.860 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements it's not just a
 
01:40:34.490 --> 01:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
legal change it's a cultural change that
 
01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
takes a long time
 
01:40:38.689 --> 01:40:38.699 align:start position:0%
that coupled with the fact that there
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
was probably some lack of management
 
01:40:43.610 --> 01:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
going on and maybe some decisions not
 
01:40:46.250 --> 01:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
made that you know to the best
 
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
um the best decisions that could have
 
01:40:50.750 --> 01:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
been made I think has contributed to
 
01:40:53.209 --> 01:40:53.219 align:start position:0%
um this issue but there certainly is a
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
lack of clarity in the legislation which
 
01:40:58.910 --> 01:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
is why oplc partnered
 
01:41:01.850 --> 01:41:01.860 align:start position:0%
um with I believe it was Senator Carson
 
01:41:04.729 --> 01:41:04.739 align:start position:0%
last year we sought a statutory change
 
01:41:09.169 --> 01:41:09.179 align:start position:0%
to or to create a study committee to
 
01:41:13.090 --> 01:41:13.100 align:start position:0%
study the issue that passed so thank you
 
01:41:15.770 --> 01:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 330 established a study
 
01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
committee the committee released its
 
01:41:21.850 --> 01:41:21.860 align:start position:0%
findings I went I believe two weeks ago
 
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
stating definitively that yes there
 
01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
needs to be clarification in providing a
 
01:41:27.950 --> 01:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
roadmap as to how we're going to do that
 
01:41:29.209 --> 01:41:29.219 align:start position:0%
so I do believe that's something the
 
01:41:31.310 --> 01:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
legislature or those committee members
 
01:41:32.810 --> 01:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
are interested in pursuing this
 
01:41:34.370 --> 01:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
legislative session it'll probably be
 
01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0%
the the fastest is still a solution to
 
01:41:39.950 --> 01:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
one of the larger challenges we have
 
01:41:43.609 --> 01:41:43.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:45.950 --> 01:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
so I guess we identify the issues
 
01:41:49.070 --> 01:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
differently one would be the functioning
 
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
like Lindsay's pointed out okay that's
 
01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
the internal functioning one would be on
 
01:41:56.090 --> 01:41:56.100 align:start position:0%
this on the board's performance where
 
01:41:58.189 --> 01:41:58.199 align:start position:0%
the board can adequately deliver the job
 
01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
it's been tasked to is is support in the
 
01:42:04.609 --> 01:42:04.619 align:start position:0%
past doj was not able to provide the
 
01:42:07.850 --> 01:42:07.860 align:start position:0%
board support so that was an issue oplc
 
01:42:09.709 --> 01:42:09.719 align:start position:0%
had a tremendous amount of staff
 
01:42:11.570 --> 01:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
turnover it was like we didn't know who
 
01:42:13.490 --> 01:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
was coming and who was going so that was
 
01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
an issue that has settled down because
 
01:42:17.870 --> 01:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
the enforcement division has been
 
01:42:20.030 --> 01:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
created by oplc we are not relying on
 
01:42:22.250 --> 01:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
Doha anymore so that's a better thing
 
01:42:24.530 --> 01:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
the board did not have an investigator
 
01:42:26.209 --> 01:42:26.219 align:start position:0%
for quite a while
 
01:42:28.850 --> 01:42:28.860 align:start position:0%
finally when we had an investigator
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
the agency prior to oplc had not floated
 
01:42:35.570 --> 01:42:35.580 align:start position:0%
an RFA so that was debunked we could not
 
01:42:37.189 --> 01:42:37.199 align:start position:0%
use that investigator anymore we had to
 
01:42:39.890 --> 01:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
start over again so that was the boards
 
01:42:42.169 --> 01:42:42.179 align:start position:0%
I would say the investigation side the
 
01:42:44.330 --> 01:42:44.340 align:start position:0%
complaint side now from a licenses
 
01:42:46.010 --> 01:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
perspective of the public protection
 
01:42:48.290 --> 01:42:48.300 align:start position:0%
perspective the biggest issue we're
 
01:42:50.990 --> 01:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
facing right now is is sedation that's
 
01:42:53.629 --> 01:42:53.639 align:start position:0%
the biggest issue because we that was
 
01:42:55.250 --> 01:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
one of the findings that came out from
 
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
the report and that was the first thing
 
01:42:59.510 --> 01:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
that the board acted on so again an RFA
 
01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679 align:start position:0%
was loaded we've identified the people
 
01:43:03.770 --> 01:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
but again they are still not ready in
 
01:43:05.330 --> 01:43:05.340 align:start position:0%
the pipeline to go out and do the
 
01:43:07.669 --> 01:43:07.679 align:start position:0%
investigations the board is trying to
 
01:43:09.709 --> 01:43:09.719 align:start position:0%
create a committee where which we would
 
01:43:11.149 --> 01:43:11.159 align:start position:0%
seek again legal legal support
 
01:43:13.609 --> 01:43:13.619 align:start position:0%
legislative support for it because
 
01:43:15.890 --> 01:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
the lb audit prefers everything be done
 
01:43:17.570 --> 01:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
legislatively which is going to take us
 
01:43:20.450 --> 01:43:20.460 align:start position:0%
even longer so we want that okay if
 
01:43:21.770 --> 01:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to go out and do a
 
01:43:23.689 --> 01:43:23.699 align:start position:0%
sedation evaluation or a sedation exam
 
01:43:26.030 --> 01:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
who is making up that exam what does
 
01:43:27.649 --> 01:43:27.659 align:start position:0%
that person being tested for it should
 
01:43:29.330 --> 01:43:29.340 align:start position:0%
be uniform everywhere it should not be
 
01:43:31.729 --> 01:43:31.739 align:start position:0%
left to The Examiner so the board is
 
01:43:33.770 --> 01:43:33.780 align:start position:0%
working on securing that and figuring
 
01:43:35.450 --> 01:43:35.460 align:start position:0%
that out so that is the perspective the
 
01:43:37.129 --> 01:43:37.139 align:start position:0%
board has from a licensee and a public
 
01:43:39.169 --> 01:43:39.179 align:start position:0%
standpoint so those are things we're
 
01:43:41.209 --> 01:43:41.219 align:start position:0%
working on so I think we're waiting for
 
01:43:42.590 --> 01:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
the sedation people to be in the
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
pipeline so they can go out and at least
 
01:43:45.649 --> 01:43:45.659 align:start position:0%
do that so that's those are the biggest
 
01:43:49.790 --> 01:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
requirements right now thank you Dr Q
 
01:43:52.669 --> 01:43:52.679 align:start position:0%
representative leishman
 
01:43:54.830 --> 01:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
I do appreciate thank you madam chair I
 
01:43:57.250 --> 01:43:57.260 align:start position:0%
do appreciate the doctors will do better
 
01:44:00.709 --> 01:44:00.719 align:start position:0%
comment but several hundred pages into
 
01:44:03.530 --> 01:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
the document and and the LBA folks you
 
01:44:06.649 --> 01:44:06.659 align:start position:0%
do an awesome job just but there was a
 
01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
note about criminal background checks
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
to me that seems kind of up should be up
 
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
there that hasn't been conducted on
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
hundreds of applicants is that something
 
01:44:17.810 --> 01:44:17.820 align:start position:0%
that you're going to focus on
 
01:44:20.030 --> 01:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
so the criminal background checks have
 
01:44:22.970 --> 01:44:22.980 align:start position:0%
been started when it was passed the
 
01:44:26.270 --> 01:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
board actually had asked oplc to help
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
support legislation to get criminal
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
background checks because when the board
 
01:44:31.010 --> 01:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
was doing their rules check we would say
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
if I as a parent has to escort my child
 
01:44:35.450 --> 01:44:35.460 align:start position:0%
for any field trip I need a criminal
 
01:44:36.830 --> 01:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
background check how can we have a
 
01:44:38.209 --> 01:44:38.219 align:start position:0%
provider in the state who doesn't get a
 
01:44:40.010 --> 01:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
criminal background check that was
 
01:44:42.590 --> 01:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
passed but every time the board reached
 
01:44:44.450 --> 01:44:44.460 align:start position:0%
out to oplc to see whether that had been
 
01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
set in place we were told that the ball
 
01:44:48.770 --> 01:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
is rolling the resources are not in
 
01:44:50.330 --> 01:44:50.340 align:start position:0%
there yet they're still working on it
 
01:44:52.010 --> 01:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
they have to work with the state so
 
01:44:55.070 --> 01:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
nothing happened and then covet hit
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
so everything was on pause but now it's
 
01:44:59.570 --> 01:44:59.580 align:start position:0%
it's in place it's it's the people who
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
who are now applying for licensure are
 
01:45:03.890 --> 01:45:03.900 align:start position:0%
going through criminal background checks
 
01:45:06.229 --> 01:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:14.149 --> 01:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
speaking to uh all the rsas to deployed
 
01:45:17.689 --> 01:45:17.699 align:start position:0%
oplc There's an opportunity because
 
01:45:19.850 --> 01:45:19.860 align:start position:0%
if I'm continuing in division one which
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
I have in the past and you've been
 
01:45:25.370 --> 01:45:25.380 align:start position:0%
we've met you have an opportunity in the
 
01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:28.639 align:start position:0%
budgeting process to suspend regulate
 
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
rsas in in hb2 so if you've got a
 
01:45:36.890 --> 01:45:36.900 align:start position:0%
burdensome level that you can't comply
 
01:45:39.290 --> 01:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
with all of them rather than get getting
 
01:45:41.330 --> 01:45:41.340 align:start position:0%
an audit to saying you're not complying
 
01:45:43.370 --> 01:45:43.380 align:start position:0%
you can
 
01:45:46.010 --> 01:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
request that these be suspended for two
 
01:45:49.129 --> 01:45:49.139 align:start position:0%
years as part of the budgeting process
 
01:45:51.770 --> 01:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
just to take some of the heat off
 
01:45:54.590 --> 01:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
thank you that's very helpful I I think
 
01:45:56.209 --> 01:45:56.219 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
um and that that may prove to be useful
 
01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges is that our board
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
practice acts with the exception of
 
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
criteria specific to a particular
 
01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
licensure they all kind of say the same
 
01:46:09.530 --> 01:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
thing but in different ways so you could
 
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
suspend it but you need to make sure
 
01:46:14.090 --> 01:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
that we have the authority elsewhere
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
um it's kind of like building a fla a
 
01:46:17.810 --> 01:46:17.820 align:start position:0%
plane while trying to fly it you know it
 
01:46:19.609 --> 01:46:19.619 align:start position:0%
would have if it would have been nice
 
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
you know if there was clear statutory
 
01:46:24.770 --> 01:46:24.780 align:start position:0%
Authority and one statute and then
 
01:46:27.770 --> 01:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
um that all of the practice acts refer
 
01:46:31.129 --> 01:46:31.139 align:start position:0%
to that statute instead discipline is a
 
01:46:33.649 --> 01:46:33.659 align:start position:0%
set forth in each Practice Act in a
 
01:46:35.629 --> 01:46:35.639 align:start position:0%
slightly different way and we're
 
01:46:37.729 --> 01:46:37.739 align:start position:0%
required to implement it in a slightly
 
01:46:39.890 --> 01:46:39.900 align:start position:0%
different way for all boards which is
 
01:46:42.410 --> 01:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
anything but efficient so that is that
 
01:46:43.609 --> 01:46:43.619 align:start position:0%
those are some of the issues that were
 
01:46:45.530 --> 01:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
identified with the committee on um
 
01:46:48.169 --> 01:46:48.179 align:start position:0%
established by 3 30 and we are going to
 
01:46:48.179 --> 01:46:49.010 align:start position:0%
established by 3 30 and we are going to
be

01:46:49.010 --> 01:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:46:50.930 --> 01:46:50.940 align:start position:0%

01:46:52.790 --> 01:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
pursuing legislative changes on that but
 
01:46:54.649 --> 01:46:54.659 align:start position:0%
but thank you that is something I wasn't
 
01:46:56.689 --> 01:46:56.699 align:start position:0%
aware of so um I will certainly keep
 
01:47:00.709 --> 01:47:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:04.490 --> 01:47:04.500 align:start position:0%

01:47:14.330 --> 01:47:14.340 align:start position:0%
getting out of here so early but that's
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
because I asked
 
01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
Mr Carver commissioner Caswell will be
 
01:47:25.090 --> 01:47:25.100 align:start position:0%
filling up some time on the second
 
01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:26.629 align:start position:0%
filling up some time on the second
anyhow

01:47:26.629 --> 01:47:26.639 align:start position:0%
anyhow
 
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
is there any further business I need to
 
01:47:32.030 --> 01:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
worry about all right then
 
01:47:38.590 --> 01:47:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:40.850 --> 01:47:40.860 align:start position:0%

01:47:43.669 --> 01:47:43.679 align:start position:0%
