00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh call the meeting back to order
 
00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:07.279 align:start position:0%
um and uh i see that mary you
 
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
you were asking some questions so um
 
00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 align:start position:0%
i would like you to ask the question
 
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
again so i can join in thank you i'm
 
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:17.590 align:start position:0%
again so i can join in thank you i'm
sorry

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
oh no i'd be happy to so um as i said
 
00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 align:start position:0%
um when the governor was here that when
 
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
i was at snoo
 
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
um the uh board of uh the executives
 
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
um they invested
 
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
multi multi-million dollars into
 
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
the design my concern right now
 
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
is that there is no line
 
00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
item for this merger and i think if
 
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
do something of this magnitude
 
00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 align:start position:0%
that we need to plan thoughtfully and
 
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
there need to
 
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
there really needs to be designated
 
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
dollars for this purpose
 
00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
i mean we have to run the ship two ships
 
00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
big ships
 
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
and we have to figure out how to build a
 
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
bigger ship
 
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
and to do that you need to invest in it
 
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
and be able to have people that can help
 
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
with the planning
 
00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 align:start position:0%
the redesign and that that's my big
 
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
concern i
 
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
i have not seen that any money has been
 
00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
invested in that
 
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh susan do you want to comment on that
 
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
yes i'd like to comment on that and and
 
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps one other thing if that's okay
 
00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
um we raised that question to the
 
00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 align:start position:0%
governor's office
 
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
and there was an indication that they
 
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
would look for funds
 
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
potentially from the you know money
 
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
coming with the pandemic but there's
 
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
been no
 
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
indication and i agree you know we have
 
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.910 align:start position:0%
indication and i agree you know we have
um

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
a synergies group that consists of i
 
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
co-chair with jackie eastwood
 
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
who's one of the university system
 
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
trustees and our whole purpose
 
00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
we've been meeting since early summer
 
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
has been to identify
 
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
synergies and so for example
 
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
we are all on the same learning
 
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
management system contract
 
00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 align:start position:0%
now and by doing that the community
 
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
college system was able to save two
 
00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars
 
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
and we're looking at insurance and and
 
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
transfer pathways and there's been a lot
 
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
of conversation but
 
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
to your immediate question we don't
 
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
really know where the money would come
 
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.430 align:start position:0%
really know where the money would come
from

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
and if i may yeah let me let me just
 
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
follow up on that if i could
 
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
um when you say
 
00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 align:start position:0%
uh looking for uh money
 
00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
what are you looking for to
 
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
employ or to um
 
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
come to grips with are you thinking
 
00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
about a consulting firm
 
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
or i i'm just you know yeah
 
00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of speculation perhaps it's a
 
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
consulting firm perhaps other people i
 
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
mean i was
 
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned for instance um
 
00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
are we going to have some educators that
 
00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 align:start position:0%
are involved in creating
 
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
this merger um there are financial
 
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
issues which people were talking about
 
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
but some of the other things that the
 
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
governor was talking about like
 
00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 align:start position:0%
transfer and i would raise accreditation
 
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh financial aid uh unions
 
00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
benefits and so on we probably will need
 
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
consultants and i guess the
 
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
the best comparison for me is you know
 
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
the bea
 
00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 align:start position:0%
wanted to look at their economic
 
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
development centers and a better model
 
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
and so the state gave money for that
 
00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
dhhs was reorganizing and there was
 
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
money that was devoted to that to
 
00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
you know potentially it is to bring in a
 
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
consulting firm i i don't have
 
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
the specific idea i mean we as we shared
 
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
with you this morning
 
00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 align:start position:0%
um did an examination of
 
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 align:start position:0%
the various mergers that have happened
 
00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 align:start position:0%
across 20 states
 
00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
and so it is going to take expertise
 
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 align:start position:0%
sorry go ahead with your other comment
 
00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 align:start position:0%
my other comment is i have a different
 
00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
uh recollection of the lpn program
 
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
and how that came to be um that i would
 
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
like to share and that is that
 
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
some of you may know i for the previous
 
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
governor chaired her governor's
 
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh work uh commission on
 
00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 align:start position:0%
the health care workforce and one of the
 
00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
things that came out of that
 
00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 align:start position:0%
loud and clear was the need for lpns
 
00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
we went out of the lpn business as a
 
00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.150 align:start position:0%
we went out of the lpn business as a
system

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
because they were not getting jobs and
 
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
in fact there was a
 
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
short period of time where even our rns
 
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
were having difficulty
 
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
when i talked to the various presidents
 
00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
about uh whether their
 
00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
students are getting hired they were
 
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
getting hired on a per diem
 
00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 align:start position:0%
situation which is not ideal if
 
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
somebody's graduating from college you
 
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
want them
 
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
sitting in a full and permanent uh
 
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.029 align:start position:0%
sitting in a full and permanent uh
position

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
that was short-lived and life is
 
00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
different now
 
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
but i bring this up because um we
 
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
started to listen to the healthcare
 
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
sector partnership initiative
 
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
specifically the monadnock region was
 
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.430 align:start position:0%
specifically the monadnock region was
really

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh leading the whole cry for the need
 
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
for lpns
 
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 align:start position:0%
and so as part of our budget proposal at
 
00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
that point
 
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
we asked for one-time funding and and my
 
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
recollection is when we asked for it
 
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
and we were asked how much money when we
 
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
went back and
 
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
and figured it out to the penny it was
 
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
641 000
 
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
something or other the governor's office
 
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
was was
 
00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
pleased and somewhat amused that that's
 
00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 align:start position:0%
what we thought because we figured it
 
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
out to the penny for us to get back into
 
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.870 align:start position:0%
out to the penny for us to get back into
that

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
business now there were lots of voices
 
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
so you know different recollections but
 
00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
but i see it as yes we got out of that
 
00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.189 align:start position:0%
but i see it as yes we got out of that
business

00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
because people weren't getting jobs uh
 
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
my nightmare as a president always was
 
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
when we started to work with another big
 
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
project in the state
 
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
we knew they were going to need
 
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
technicians but until we knew exactly
 
00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 align:start position:0%
what kind of technicians they needed
 
00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 align:start position:0%
it wasn't appropriate to create the
 
00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 align:start position:0%
program and and have students be in
 
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
it because you don't want people to get
 
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
to the end of a credential
 
00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
and not have a job um and so
 
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
this is kind of akin to that situation
 
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
and representative umbergo thank you for
 
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
letting me
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
speak about that uh no problem susan i
 
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.189 align:start position:0%
speak about that uh no problem susan i
was

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh i was surprised at the governor's
 
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
comments as well
 
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
but uh uh kathy would you like to say
 
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.150 align:start position:0%
but uh uh kathy would you like to say
something

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
about uh the suggestion on
 
00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
consultants um thank you representative
 
00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:50.230 align:start position:0%
consultants um thank you representative
umberger

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
umberger
 
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
um i'll put consultants aside for a
 
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
minute and
 
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
speak more about technology um the
 
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
the r in in my opinion
 
00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
a big part of this would be a common
 
00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:04.629 align:start position:0%
a big part of this would be a common
platform

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
platform
 
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
so first of all the university system is
 
00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
look if we're kind of in a discovery
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
phase if you will
 
00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
thinking about bringing our
 
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
enterprise-wide technology for
 
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
student facing all the student systems
 
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
the accounting systems the hr systems
 
00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
we're not using current technology and
 
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
it's disparate
 
00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
so a benefit would really be to have
 
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
everyone on the same platform the same
 
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
student system
 
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
the same and that will take money
 
00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
that will take an investment so you know
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
would you have to have a maybe a
 
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:43.830 align:start position:0%
would you have to have a maybe a
consultant

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
consultant
 
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:46.879 align:start position:0%
implementer with that probably
 
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
i don't um i'll be honest i don't know
 
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:49.990 align:start position:0%
i don't um i'll be honest i don't know
enough

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
enough
 
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
susan's much more knowledgeable in the
 
00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 align:start position:0%
areas of
 
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
accreditation and financial aid and that
 
00:07:57.909 --> 00:07:57.919 align:start position:0%
would definitely have to be addressed
 
00:07:57.919 --> 00:07:58.710 align:start position:0%
would definitely have to be addressed
but

00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
in in my thinking it would there would
 
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
be some
 
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
real technology needs that's how to make
 
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.230 align:start position:0%
real technology needs that's how to make
this

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
really smooth so a student is
 
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
having the same experience on their
 
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
their student
 
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
and the student system across
 
00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
go ahead i think
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
the canvas project right now is a great
 
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
example of exactly what kathy is talking
 
00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.270 align:start position:0%
example of exactly what kathy is talking
about

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
so because of the work of the university
 
00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:35.519 align:start position:0%
system and the community college system
 
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
and the department of education
 
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
we now have one platform that can be
 
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
used all the way from kindergarten
 
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:42.870 align:start position:0%
used all the way from kindergarten
through

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
graduate school and i frankly am really
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
excited about the opportunities because
 
00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:49.519 align:start position:0%
now we've created a platform
 
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
that's going to make it easy for you
 
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
know a first grade class to invite a
 
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.150 align:start position:0%
know a first grade class to invite a
professor

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
professor
 
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
from university of new hampshire to come
 
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
in and talk about something
 
00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
with the you know the great uh oceanic
 
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
work that they're doing
 
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
and so to kathy's point the technology
 
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
will cost money in the community college
 
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.150 align:start position:0%
will cost money in the community college
system

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
five years ago we went to one student
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
management system and it's one
 
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
instance of the student management
 
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.470 align:start position:0%
instance of the student management
system

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
the university system uh i'll let kathy
 
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
speak about that but that was a big
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
project for us so that
 
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
at this point we wanted to make it
 
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
easier for our students to transfer
 
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
within and among the community colleges
 
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:29.910 align:start position:0%
within and among the community colleges
so

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
long answer to say i support what
 
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
and the university system isn't there
 
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
with the one instance of student
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
we have multiple instances of student
 
00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
so that's why i'm saying we're now in
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
the discovery phase
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
of how do we you know migrate in that
 
00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:51.030 align:start position:0%
of how do we you know migrate in that
direction

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
direction
 
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
but again if you could have it across
 
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
if there's to be one public higher
 
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
education system in new hampshire
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
the platform has to be consistent in my
 
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.069 align:start position:0%
the platform has to be consistent in my
opinion

00:10:06.069 --> 00:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
i i certainly agree with that and i see
 
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of other
 
00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
heads shaking so um okay uh
 
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative petrie i'm not sure
 
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
whether you were
 
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
representative bucco or next but whoever
 
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
was go ahead
 
00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:25.670 align:start position:0%
was go ahead
please

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh represent petrie yeah you know
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
technical issues as usual uh thank you
 
00:10:34.069 --> 00:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh
 
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
well actually it's not a question that's
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
a comment uh
 
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
we built well we started with silos you
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
know the individual
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
colleges uh you know uh plymouth
 
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
university and then we came to the
 
00:10:46.949 --> 00:10:46.959 align:start position:0%
university system
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
and we built another bureaucracy and
 
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
then we had chancellor's office
 
00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:53.839 align:start position:0%
a few years ago we did a uh i believe
 
00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
robbie parsons uh representative
 
00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
probably 11 12 session
 
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh he did a he uh did his own study and
 
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.230 align:start position:0%
uh he did a he uh did his own study and
he

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
he
 
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
discovered that uh we could save about
 
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%
41 million dollars by eliminating the
 
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
chancellor's office
 
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
um and now keeping the financials
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
together that of all all the university
 
00:11:15.839 --> 00:11:16.310 align:start position:0%
together that of all all the university
uh

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
the whole what the university system is
 
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
now but is that what we're doing now is
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
building a
 
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
you know a bigger bureaucracy of putting
 
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
more people together
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
and more levels of bureaucracy
 
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
um so i would say
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
representative petry that
 
00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
the the chancellor's office budget is
 
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
nowhere near 41 million dollars
 
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
so i'm not i remember representative
 
00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:49.519 align:start position:0%
parsons well i worked with him for
 
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
many years when i was state treasurer
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
and then when i went to the university
 
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.750 align:start position:0%
and then when i went to the university
system

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
so um i don't know about
 
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
layers of bureaucracy um
 
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
is it i can tell you what we're doing in
 
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
the university system right now though
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
is what i mentioned earlier about part
 
00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:07.839 align:start position:0%
of this restructure
 
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
rather than having
 
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
folks all over the place at all of the
 
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.470 align:start position:0%
folks all over the place at all of the
campuses

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
campuses
 
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
processing invoices for example we're
 
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
going to do that
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
centrally and have one
 
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
process that's understood by everyone
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
rather than disparate processes
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
could this consolidate or combination of
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
the two systems
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
have consolidated work
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
centrally yes i suppose that's that's
 
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
likely i think that would reduce costs
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh i don't i don't know about added
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
uh susan you go ahead please thank you
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
um our system office
 
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
really does the work of the colleges so
 
00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
that we don't have duplication
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
um so we have our internal audit we have
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
our the
 
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
the system office has does all of the
 
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:09.990 align:start position:0%
the system office has does all of the
negotiating

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
negotiating
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh does all of the work on benefits you
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
know are there people on the campuses
 
00:13:14.639 --> 00:13:15.990 align:start position:0%
know are there people on the campuses
that

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
support and feed some of the information
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
of the chancellor's office yes but
 
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
the work that happens isn't
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
if we didn't do it at the system office
 
00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
it would have to happen on the campuses
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
on the colleges and that to me would
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
make it more expensive and
 
00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
would create situations where you know
 
00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
some of our colleges don't need much
 
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
legal assistance at any one time and
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes some of the colleges need more
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
legal assistance
 
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
the fact that that comes out of the the
 
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
chancellor's office makes it a more
 
00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
efficient use of
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
resources the cost for the
 
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
chancellor's office and the community
 
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
college system
 
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
salaries and everything in is less than
 
00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars not that i think
 
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
small number and i agree with kathy
 
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
there there are opportunities here
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh for bringing some functions together
 
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
i i support that um we're we are doing
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
some of that work already where for
 
00:14:11.279 --> 00:14:12.230 align:start position:0%
some of that work already where for
instance

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
instance
 
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
um white mountains and nhti share some
 
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
financial aid services so that
 
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
we're not uh you know bringing in more
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
people than we need
 
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
uh but you know there's opportunities
 
00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519 align:start position:0%
and i i
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
i think i would say we hear you loud and
 
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
clear that while we may be doing that
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
work we need to move a little faster at
 
00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.430 align:start position:0%
work we need to move a little faster at
it

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
and we're certainly willing to do that
 
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
and and we have a willing partner in the
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
university system
 
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
and and to follow up on on susan's
 
00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:39.350 align:start position:0%
and and to follow up on on susan's
comments

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
kind of work

00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative bucco would
 
00:15:07.839 --> 00:15:08.389 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative bucco would
you

00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
like to go ahead please um oh okay
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair am i i'm not muted
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
so so this question is for the vice
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
chancellor for finance at the university
 
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.670 align:start position:0%
chancellor for finance at the university
system

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm referring to this page that
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
you had highlighted
 
00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
for the for the two for the two years
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22 in fiscal 23
 
00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
um the governor's budget recommends 166
 
00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:40.470 align:start position:0%
um the governor's budget recommends 166
million

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh no that's not correct i'm i'm sorry
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
i'm getting that wrong
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
for the two for both the university and
 
00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:49.759 align:start position:0%
the community college it's 138 million
 
00:15:49.759 --> 00:15:50.629 align:start position:0%
the community college it's 138 million
right

00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to arrive at how much money
 
00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:02.959 align:start position:0%
is actually being taken out of this
 
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
education system to be or
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
not put someplace else but it in the
 
00:16:09.839 --> 00:16:10.310 align:start position:0%
not put someplace else but it in the
governor's

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
in the governor's budget um
 
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
the actual expense was for for fiscal
 
00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:19.759 align:start position:0%
year 2020 was 151.7 million
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
and if you subtract 138 million out of
 
00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:22.949 align:start position:0%
and if you subtract 138 million out of
that

00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
it's already 13.7 million less
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
am i am i getting that correct or i mean
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's about 23 million
 
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
dollars less
 
00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:35.759 align:start position:0%
for both of those things so so i would
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
just caution you that
 
00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:40.959 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 20
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
the university system was um
 
00:16:43.839 --> 00:16:44.790 align:start position:0%
the university system was um
appropriated

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
appropriated
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
one time dollars of nine million so if
 
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
you take that
 
00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
out of the mix because we recognize that
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
was one time
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
the the let's look at it this way let's
 
00:16:57.199 --> 00:16:58.870 align:start position:0%
the the let's look at it this way let's
say

00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
um i hate to look at it this way because
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
again if we're going to be one system
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
but let's just say the so the university
 
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
system is
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
uh is um there's a four and a half
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
million dollar reduction
 
00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.079 align:start position:0%
from the current level in year one
 
00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
and then there's a two million dollar
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
reduction in total
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
in year two right
 
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
in in total across the two systems okay
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
so um you know
 
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
comb i'm going back to fiscal 21
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
is it 88.5 million dollars and we
 
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
and the the university system requested
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
flat in 22 and 23.
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
yes but there's over over the two years
 
00:17:47.039 --> 00:17:47.350 align:start position:0%
yes but there's over over the two years
that's

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
a six a six and a half million dollar
 
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
reduction right if you allocated
 
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
the 2 million and 23
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
to the university system if if there
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
were two
 
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
systems still in existence i feel like
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
i'm confusing the issue
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i probably did but but i was i
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
was just trying to
 
00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:12.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
reduction there is
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
there is definitely a reduction
 
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
to public higher education
 
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
in house bill 1 compared to the last
 
00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.470 align:start position:0%
in house bill 1 compared to the last
biennium

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
would it be helpful representative or
 
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
kathy or madam chairman if we shared
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
screen quickly just to see the
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
governor's budget request
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
just to exactly see the lines or do you
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
yeah you can share it up matthew
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
i've got it right here oh this is just
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
that this is just the university system
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
actually i think
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
i can share kathy i have the budget uh
 
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
pulled up
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
if it would help
 
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
you'd see that right yeah that's what i
 
00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
was looking at
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
so to kathy's point about you know if we
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
pull out recognizing there was one time
 
00:19:03.919 --> 00:19:04.470 align:start position:0%
pull out recognizing there was one time
money

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
uh in fiscal 20 and look at just
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
where both systems were in fiscal 21
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
you see one 143 860
 
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
and and so so representative bucco
 
00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.070 align:start position:0%
and and so so representative bucco
without

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
the the nine million dollar one-time
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
money in fiscal
 
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
20 the university systems that was at
 
00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.830 align:start position:0%
20 the university systems that was at
85.5

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
85.5
 
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
right then then it went to 88.5 and 21.
 
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
to down to 84 in 22
 
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
and it will come down further in total
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
the total public higher ed appropriation
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
comes down
 
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
2 million in 23.
 
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
represent murray i know i see you have a
 
00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.310 align:start position:0%
represent murray i know i see you have a
question

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'll try to be quick
 
00:20:08.149 --> 00:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
before i head off for my coffee shop
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
um i had i guess two things one it's i
 
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:11.750 align:start position:0%
um i had i guess two things one it's i
do

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
agree with what i'm hearing a little bit
 
00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:14.799 align:start position:0%
in terms of there's
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
needing to be some direction and some
 
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
planning before
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
you know going ahead with this it's not
 
00:20:22.149 --> 00:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
like you take the two boards put them
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
together cut them in half and then
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
you're done
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
um i think there's an awful lot of back
 
00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%
story if you will
 
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
that we need to consider in terms of how
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
this affects how the university and the
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
college system runs and how it affects
 
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
the students
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
the other thing i'm concerned about
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
which i haven't heard us talk about yet
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's not financial
 
00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:41.919 align:start position:0%
but the optics involved with this i
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
remember the disaster the debacle when
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
the art institute first initially tried
 
00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
to merge with snoo
 
00:20:51.909 --> 00:20:51.919 align:start position:0%
and no one was prepared no one knew
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
anything was going on where i was
 
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
actually in
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
athens in greece at the time with the
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
group of the photography students
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
and it just popped up no one knew and it
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
was they had to back down it was an
 
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
absolute um public relations mess up
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
and so it seems to me that there's an
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
educational and a marketing component in
 
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
going forward this because i think
 
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
students are going to have
 
00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799 align:start position:0%
they're going to care they're going to
 
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
care about the school that they're at
 
00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
they're going to care about what that
 
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
means to what their degree is going to
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
look like what the thing is they're
 
00:21:21.909 --> 00:21:21.919 align:start position:0%
going to hang up on the
 
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
bathroom wall or wherever you put all
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
your degrees um and i think you know
 
00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
those human elements are also really
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
important to consider
 
00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
in doing this i think that there's
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity here
 
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
i agree with the governor that we
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
probably don't need to study for five
 
00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:35.590 align:start position:0%
probably don't need to study for five
years

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
but i think we need uh something a
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
little bit more than two line items in
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
the budget in order to plan this
 
00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:45.039 align:start position:0%
to be successful so i prefer i'd be
 
00:21:45.039 --> 00:21:46.070 align:start position:0%
to be successful so i prefer i'd be
interested

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
interested
 
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
with susan and catherine your comments
 
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
on that and then forgive me when i
 
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
bug off i'm going to be heading out for
 
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:59.830 --> 00:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
just a moment please matthew is your
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
comment related to what um
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
representative murray had to say or is
 
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
it something else
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative it is okay go ahead
 
00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.029 align:start position:0%
yes representative it is okay go ahead
then

00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
and representative murray certainly
 
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate you know those comments
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
because i agree that there is a human
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
impact that
 
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
that we need to make sure um you know as
 
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
part of these conversations but
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
i think a lot of that runway uh
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
is already happened right we've already
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
had these conversations
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
with both systems to identify what that
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
path forward looks like
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
and the next logical step really is
 
00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:39.039 align:start position:0%
to combine that governance structure and
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
then put empower
 
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
those decision makers to identify
 
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
what those next steps are and i think
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
you heard the governor speak to that
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
this morning that we we know
 
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.190 align:start position:0%
this morning that we we know
conceptually

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
conceptually
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
where the economic pressures are but
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
also where the opportunities are for the
 
00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.870 align:start position:0%
also where the opportunities are for the
students

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
and by bringing the boards together
 
00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.039 align:start position:0%
through this budget we see that as
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
again the the best path forward
 
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
for both of these systems and most
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
especially the students
 
00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
and it's also why we're not going full
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
bore um
 
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
in year one right we do understand there
 
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
are going to be
 
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
longer structural changes that need to
 
00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.110 align:start position:0%
longer structural changes that need to
happen

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
and that's why we've put this on a
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
two-year plan
 
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
as opposed to trying to make this all
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
happen here in the next
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
two or three months we certainly
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
a quick follow-up please go ahead
 
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
um in the spirit of all the stakeholders
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
being at the table
 
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
i i believe that those conversations
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
have been ongoing
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
as budget director i haven't been
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
directly involved in that component but
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
students understand that both from the
 
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
remote learning perspective that we've
 
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
had here
 
00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
because of coven there's also going to
 
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
need to be those challenges because as a
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
student first and foremost
 
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
they want to be able to get from point a
 
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
to point b um and if we find ourselves
 
00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
in a position where
 
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh we do suddenly appear to be in a
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
crisis you know five or ten years out
 
00:24:15.669 --> 00:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
because we haven't taken action today um
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
there might be far worse consequences
 
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
for students
 
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're trying to avoid
 
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
right we're trying to move now
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
seeing the tidal wave that's coming our
 
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
way to do this strategically and on
 
00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.350 align:start position:0%
way to do this strategically and on
purpose

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
as opposed to being forced into a
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
reactionary model
 
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
where we don't have time to get it right
 
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
we just need to avoid disaster
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
so that's the impetus behind having
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
these conversations now
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
looking at the data and we think that's
 
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
a better outcome for students than
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
cathy do you have anything you want to
 
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:59.350 align:start position:0%
cathy do you have anything you want to
add

00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
no only that i think you folks probably
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
have seen
 
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
um the university system board's
 
00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:05.990 align:start position:0%
um the university system board's
statement

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
that that our board is pretty unwavering
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
in their support
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
for moving forward recognizing that um
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
primarily because of the why recognizing
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
that there still needs to be work
 
00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
and thought um with both community
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
college system and university system
 
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
susan do you have a comment
 
00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.039 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i i ditto to everything
 
00:25:39.039 --> 00:25:39.590 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i i ditto to everything
kathy

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
kathy
 
00:25:41.669 --> 00:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
just said that there's work that needs
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
to be done
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
we haven't even talked about bringing in
 
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
not only student voices but also
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
faculty and and staff voices and
 
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh the voices of our business partners
 
00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
the the one thing that i will also add
 
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:25:59.350 --> 00:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
is you know not only is there a
 
00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.789 align:start position:0%
is you know not only is there a
declining

00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
declining
 
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
number of high school graduates but when
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
we look at the graduates that we
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
currently have
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
only 30 percent of them have a plan
 
00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:12.559 align:start position:0%
about going to college or to career and
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
so on
 
00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
so we do have an opportunity as a state
 
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
to serve
 
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
not only the 70 of recent high school
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
graduates but
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
uh you know i also think about the older
 
00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
students i mean
 
00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
about almost half of our student body is
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
in fact people over the age of 25 who
 
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
find that they need education
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
so creating something that gives people
 
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity is absolutely important
 
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i would go so far as the
 
00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
tidal wave i do think there's an urgency
 
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
but at the same time there are lots of
 
00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:45.919 align:start position:0%
pieces to this this is not
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
bringing two very simple organizations
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
together so i would
 
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
um you know urge a timeline that also
 
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
includes uh the ability to look at at
 
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:56.799 align:start position:0%
all of these
 
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
of features i mean as the governor said
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
other people have done it
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
so frankly let's learn from what other
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
people have done
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
and go on thank you representative
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much um ken were you
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
i think i had my hand up excuse me
 
00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:19.990 align:start position:0%
i think i had my hand up excuse me
before

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
joe so anyway um
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a progressive thing uh
 
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
20 odd years ago i was on the higher
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
education study committee
 
00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039 align:start position:0%
when we discovered that two students
 
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
could be sitting side by side in a
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
community college english class
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
one is going to study to be an
 
00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
engineering technician the other one's
 
00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:43.039 align:start position:0%
studying to be a registered nurse and
 
00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:44.799 align:start position:0%
the registered nurse could
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
credit that english class to getting an
 
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
rn in
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
unh but if the engineering tech
 
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
decided he wanted to go forward and get
 
00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
an engineering degree he couldn't
 
00:27:58.149 --> 00:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
credit the same class and we thought the
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
heck is going on and we did finally
 
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
straighten that out and got almost all
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
the courses transferable and i thought
 
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
that was a big deal
 
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
and we went forward with that but i'm
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
i'm worried about
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
corporate attitude if you will uh
 
00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
chancellor ward
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
made a statement that i thought was very
 
00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.430 align:start position:0%
made a statement that i thought was very
telling

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
telling
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to teach a course that's
 
00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:21.039 align:start position:0%
not going to give them a job
 
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
and i think that's a wonderful attitude
 
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
to take that
 
00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.039 align:start position:0%
you know well i didn't have lpn because
 
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
nobody was hiring lpns
 
00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:31.039 align:start position:0%
made a lot of sense and you're looking
 
00:28:31.039 --> 00:28:32.149 align:start position:0%
made a lot of sense and you're looking
forward

00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
for some of these students that can't
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
even look forward for themselves
 
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
but then i look at the unh system and
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
it's okay you can come here and
 
00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
you know one of my fellow pilots years
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
ago had
 
00:28:45.269 --> 00:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
graduated from unh with a degree in
 
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
irish history
 
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
fortunately he went in the marines and
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
learned to be a pilot and got him a good
 
00:28:49.919 --> 00:28:50.870 align:start position:0%
learned to be a pilot and got him a good
job

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
job
 
00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
and then he went to mit and got a phd in
 
00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.110 align:start position:0%
and then he went to mit and got a phd in
astrophysics

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
astrophysics
 
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
but you know at the unh
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's all all well and good to just study
 
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
education for the
 
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of learning something
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
but you're going to go out with a
 
00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.350 align:start position:0%
but you're going to go out with a
massive

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
massive
 
00:29:10.389 --> 00:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
debt load and a huge expense and if
 
00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
that's not going to help you
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
if that degree isn't going to help you
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
pay for it there ought to be more
 
00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
counseling within the unh to say so
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
really what do you want to do for a
 
00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:19.430 align:start position:0%
really what do you want to do for a
living

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
living
 
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
and you realize how little that pays or
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
you realize
 
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
you know that there are no jobs for that
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
kind of thing
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
so i appreciate what the community
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
college does and i
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
hope they don't lose it when if and when
 
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
they merge with
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
unh because unh needs to get i think
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
more along the line of
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
what are you what are you learning what
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
do you aim to do with your life
 
00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
and kind of give them a little more
 
00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
direction when when they're studying
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
stuff that
 
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
won't get them a job but they'll
 
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
graduate with a massive debt load and
 
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
then maybe they'll renege
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
anyway that's that's my thought thank
 
00:29:59.510 --> 00:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you representative weiler
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
excuse me i was eating a cookie and a
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
crumb went down my throat which is not
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
such a good idea representative petry go
 
00:30:07.679 --> 00:30:10.149 align:start position:0%
such a good idea representative petry go
ahead

00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh this is a
 
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
question for probably uh
 
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
ms preventure uh what is the total
 
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
budget of the university system that's
 
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
all revenue and all expenses
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
the total budget is about
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
800 million dollars
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
okay um are there any other questions
 
00:30:40.799 --> 00:30:42.630 align:start position:0%
okay um are there any other questions
from

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:49.039 align:start position:0%
i i have a couple of questions if i
 
00:30:49.039 --> 00:30:51.430 align:start position:0%
i i have a couple of questions if i
could

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
this is dealing with the capital budget
 
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
i realized that um you know we don't
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
we in division two don't really have a
 
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
lot to do with the capital budget
 
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
but what are your capital
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh budget requirements uh for the next
 
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
two years and
 
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
what are the prospects of them being
 
00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.350 align:start position:0%
what are the prospects of them being
funded

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
funded
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
and are we
 
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
looking at are we looking at any of the
 
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
capital budget
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
items that we could make
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
tweaks to that would help to satisfy
 
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
some of the issues of
 
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
combining the two systems
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
either one i don't care who goes first
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
i i can go first so so in the last
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
in the last budget cycle two years ago
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
um the university system
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
received appropriation for three
 
00:32:03.519 --> 00:32:05.269 align:start position:0%
received appropriation for three
biennium

00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
similar to the keep program and so
 
00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
and the governor has not changed that in
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
in house bill 25 is introduced so the
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
university system
 
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
has 15 million dollars over the two-year
 
00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.669 align:start position:0%
has 15 million dollars over the two-year
period

00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of that is to continue
 
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
to support
 
00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:27.039 align:start position:0%
the biological sciences pro the largest
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
project the university system has ever
 
00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.230 align:start position:0%
project the university system has ever
undertaken

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
undertaken
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
um and the the state is providing about
 
00:32:35.909 --> 00:32:35.919 align:start position:0%
a third of the total funding for that
 
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
project um i would guess that
 
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
it's highly unlikely that any of that
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
could be diverted
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
to dollars
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
for the proposed combination i can tell
 
00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
you also that
 
00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
that 15 million dollars super impactful
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
on the total university system capital
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
budget but our total capital budget each
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
well in normal times is about
 
00:33:06.149 --> 00:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
70 million dollars a year that's based
 
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
on our
 
00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
annual depreciation expense so that we
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
can keep our buildings up the way they
 
00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:12.640 align:start position:0%
should be kept up
 
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
we have had to we've cut that in half
 
00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.310 align:start position:0%
we have had to we've cut that in half
because

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
cash preservation in times of covid so
 
00:33:21.909 --> 00:33:21.919 align:start position:0%
um anyway i gave you more information
 
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
that you needed than you needed but we
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
have our capital appropriation
 
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
hb 25 is as was adopted two years ago
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
and i i think it's highly unlikely any
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
of that could be diverted toward
 
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.470 align:start position:0%
of that could be diverted toward
consolidation

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
consolidation
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
combination expense i didn't know if
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
there happened to be
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
any um uh technology
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
money in the capital budget for the
 
00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:46.870 align:start position:0%
money in the capital budget for the
university

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
university
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
that was no that was mostly the focus of
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
okay i'm going to ask
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
shannon to speak about the capital
 
00:33:59.830 --> 00:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
budget for the community college system
 
00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:00.630 align:start position:0%
budget for the community college system
please

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
sure so ccs says ccsnh is not on that
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
multi-biennium kind of funding plan
 
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
that usnh is the kathy just described so
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
we're talking about just the present
 
00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
biennium we had
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
initially requested 16.8 million dollars
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
in capital funds
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
in the governor's budget there's about
 
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
2.5 million there's
 
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
one project for 2.5 million which is
 
00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
actually the phase two continuation of a
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
project that was started
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
that was funded last in the last
 
00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.790 align:start position:0%
that was funded last in the last
biennium

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
so the the bulk of that capital request
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
is currently not
 
00:34:35.589 --> 00:34:35.599 align:start position:0%
funded our top priority
 
00:34:37.109 --> 00:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
in any capital budget is critical
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
maintenance and
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
um that is you know the things that we
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
have roofs and systems and boilers and
 
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
all the all that type of infrastructure
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
that needs to be
 
00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:49.599 align:start position:0%
needs to be upgraded or is is that ends
 
00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
of life or that sort of thing
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
that's not currently in the capital
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
budget we do have funds
 
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
requested for it but i don't think it's
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
a type of it projects that can
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
accomplish the kind of um kind of
 
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
bridging of the systems that kathy and
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
susan were talking about it's really
 
00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.589 align:start position:0%
susan were talking about it's really
again

00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
equipment that's at end of life um i i
 
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
don't see it necessarily translating
 
00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.510 align:start position:0%
don't see it necessarily translating
into

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
into the kind of um synergistic work
 
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
that we're doing um with the university
 
00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:18.470 align:start position:0%
that we're doing um with the university
system

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
and then there's some other requests
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
that have to do with renovating
 
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
and upgrading labs um and other spaces
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
to kind of
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
serve the needs of industry pathway
 
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
programs in the
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
in the sciences and technology um so we
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
working with the house public works
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
committee to try to get some of that
 
00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
funding built back in again
 
00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
i also know that there may be
 
00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities from
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
federal dollars coming into the state
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
that might be um
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
might be able to be used for the the
 
00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
type of one-time investment that capital
 
00:35:49.119 --> 00:35:49.829 align:start position:0%
type of one-time investment that capital
projects

00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
often are so we'll have our eye on that
 
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:59.190 --> 00:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh shannon on the uh the perkins grants
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
um what kind of money does
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
the community college system get from
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
perkins grant
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
i don't have i don't have that figure
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
susan is that something that you
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
you know or we could bring it back to
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
the committee if none of us here
 
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
we could bring it back to the committee
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a small amount of money
 
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh most of that money goes to the
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
ctes and so a lot of the activity that
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
we do is in support of the efforts that
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
the ctes are making
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh with those funds okay yeah just if
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
yeah if you would when you know it's uh
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
i just didn't know
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
whether or not there was uh specific
 
00:36:39.599 --> 00:36:40.150 align:start position:0%
whether or not there was uh specific
money

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
at the community college level for
 
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh perkins grants that you could be used
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
whatever you do there there
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
there is uh money um it's used in
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
the technical trade areas pretty heavily
 
00:36:57.599 --> 00:36:58.470 align:start position:0%
the technical trade areas pretty heavily
also

00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
in support of healthcare careers
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
and and it also provides money to do
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
professional development work between
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
the community college faculty and the
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
high school faculty
 
00:37:13.829 --> 00:37:13.839 align:start position:0%
and finally it helps to support we have
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
other funding as well
 
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
the women and technology days that we
 
00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
sponsor so that we get
 
00:37:21.829 --> 00:37:21.839 align:start position:0%
women into situations to you know try
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
their hand quite literally at things
 
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
that maybe they haven't contemplated
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
as career paths in automotive technology
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
in in welding
 
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh my next question is that um i
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
this conversation about merger has been
 
00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
occurring for a while
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
and i just wondered if um
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
you could tell us what your
 
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
two board of trustees have been
 
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
been doing in in that area
 
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
i can i can start um
 
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
i think our board started having a
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
conversation about this last
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
june and uh
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
adopted a resolution to have
 
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
a small group of trustees
 
00:38:23.829 --> 00:38:23.839 align:start position:0%
reach out to the community college some
 
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
trustees at the community college system
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
and start talking about more
 
00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.630 align:start position:0%
and start talking about more
collaboration

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
collaboration
 
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
and and that was the genesis of the
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
working group that susan mentioned
 
00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.270 align:start position:0%
working group that susan mentioned
earlier

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
the um i also serve on that working
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
group and we've been meeting
 
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
bi-weekly now we meet monthly i think
 
00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
it's since last june
 
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
and then our board had another
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
conversation in
 
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
october really supporting the concept of
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
consolidation and wrote a letter to the
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
governor to that effect
 
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
but then put it aside and said you know
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay this is our position
 
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
and we're not you know we have enough of
 
00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.349 align:start position:0%
and we're not you know we have enough of
our

00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
own university system work to do and
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
um so that's the
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
our board has been talking about this
 
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
and uh on the community college side
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
a little different story um
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
usnh board uh did send members and
 
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
approach members of our board
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
and um the conversation was very
 
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
cautious on our side as it continues to
 
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.190 align:start position:0%
cautious on our side as it continues to
be

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
and um our recommendation
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
by the time it took us a while frankly
 
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
to get to a place where
 
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
um we wanted to talk at length with the
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
university system about this and so our
 
00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:54.230 align:start position:0%
university system about this and so our
recommendation

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
to them was that we would like to engage
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
a study and the message that came back
 
00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:06.079 align:start position:0%
to the trustees was we've moved on
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
we're busy and so frankly at that point
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
the community
 
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
college system continued to do the work
 
00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
that it was doing and it's only been
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
since around christmas that this
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
conversation has intensified for us
 
00:40:23.109 --> 00:40:23.119 align:start position:0%
because when we've been
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
you know asked our opinion and and said
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
you know we need more information before
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
we can go forward
 
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
and that's based on not a desire not to
 
00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.589 align:start position:0%
and that's based on not a desire not to
change

00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
but because we can see what's happening
 
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
in other states
 
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
within my background when i came in 2010
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
i came out of 20 years in the
 
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
connecticut system
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
and if you follow any of this
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
information you know that
 
00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
that system has been trying to affect
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
emerges since 2011
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
and it's been painful and played out in
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
the papers in the legislature and so on
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
so you know does that color my personal
 
00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.069 align:start position:0%
so you know does that color my personal
view

00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
view
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
yes but we we did go ahead anyway at the
 
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
time that the conversation happened
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
and we asked for uh and champs the
 
00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
report was
 
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
you know that we gave you a link to to
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
to just fill us
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
in tell us about this that you know what
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
was it we need to
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
needed to be thinking about and how this
 
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
played out in other places
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
so we had taken that step but then it
 
00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:21.589 align:start position:0%
so we had taken that step but then it
appeared

00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
appeared
 
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
through informal conversations as if
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
because we hadn't expressed
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
the level of enthusiasm that others had
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
that the conversation had
 
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
stopped so um we were a bit surprised to
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
hear it come back
 
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
up it is still um a significant
 
00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.670 align:start position:0%
up it is still um a significant
conversation

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
within our board because we have so many
 
00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:43.270 align:start position:0%
within our board because we have so many
questions

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
about how this would happen and i i
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
applaud our board because we have people
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
who are
 
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
tremendously devoted to our students and
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
businesses and so on who you know we we
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
would just like
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
more information as this is going
 
00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:59.430 align:start position:0%
more information as this is going
forward

00:41:59.430 --> 00:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:42:02.309 --> 00:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
and you know a conversation a comment
 
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
i've made other places
 
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
when we look at the other merges that
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
have happened
 
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
the first voice that goes away is the
 
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
voice of the community colleges
 
00:42:13.109 --> 00:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
so you can understand why we have a
 
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
concern here
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
our work is necessary but it is not
 
00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:17.670 align:start position:0%
our work is necessary but it is not
glamorous

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
glamorous
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
work you know we are supporting people
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
who are leaving us
 
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
in in many cases going out to work and
 
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
that may be
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
a six-week program a 12-week program a
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
year and so on so our
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
you know i support the university system
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
i am not a product of this
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
state's university system but obviously
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
having gotten a phd i support
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
higher education and i appreciate the
 
00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:41.839 align:start position:0%
mission of the university system in the
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
four-year colleges
 
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
um we we understand that we want to give
 
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
our people opportunities
 
00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh in in in my land we want people to be
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
able to start off we want an lna
 
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to do you know the eight-week
 
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:56.870 align:start position:0%
to be able to do you know the eight-week
program

00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
and aspire to be an lpn and an rn and an
 
00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:01.109 align:start position:0%
and aspire to be an lpn and an rn and an
aprn

00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
aprn
 
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
and and you know in a d a dpn whatever
 
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
that pathway is that the student wants
 
00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
we want to
 
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh play a a role in it in an efficient
 
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
and effective way
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
connect so so um
 
00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
and i will say the university system
 
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
agrees a hundred percent and i think
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
the position of our board and i agree is
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
this is about the future of public
 
00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
higher education in the granite state
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
higher education is changing at a rate
 
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:36.630 align:start position:0%
higher education is changing at a rate
that

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
that we can't keep up with and we need
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
to be looking
 
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
forward not in my opinion not
 
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
backward and
 
00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
i will also say that we are a small
 
00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.069 align:start position:0%
i will also say that we are a small
state

00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
and so while this would be a big system
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
when you compare it to the size of other
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
systems in our country
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
it will still be a small system
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
and we should consider
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
lessons learned in the past in other
 
00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:10.069 align:start position:0%
lessons learned in the past in other
states

00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
but it is higher education is changing
 
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
at a rate that what happened in another
 
00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:15.990 align:start position:0%
at a rate that what happened in another
state

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:44:19.349 --> 00:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
10 years ago may not at all be relevant
 
00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
to how new hampshire could move forward
 
00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
improving public higher education for
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
all granite staters
 
00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
in the next decade or 20 years or 30
 
00:44:31.359 --> 00:44:32.950 align:start position:0%
in the next decade or 20 years or 30
years

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
so okay
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
um shannon i i have not had an
 
00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:41.190 align:start position:0%
um shannon i i have not had an
opportunity

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
to read your thing that you sent
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
us on was that on the merger business
 
00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:49.109 align:start position:0%
us on was that on the merger business
and

00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
what was going on there i sent you two
 
00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:52.309 align:start position:0%
what was going on there i sent you two
things

00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
um that i thought would be helpful one
 
00:44:55.349 --> 00:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
chronicle an article that was published
 
00:44:59.349 --> 00:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
in the chronicle of higher education
 
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
just this week that
 
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
reported on this merger proposal and
 
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
kind of give it give a little bit it was
 
00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
a short article a little bit of context
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
about the proposal and then a bit of
 
00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:09.910 align:start position:0%
about the proposal and then a bit of
national

00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
national
 
00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
context on on these same types of
 
00:45:14.069 --> 00:45:14.079 align:start position:0%
conversations elsewhere because for
 
00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
the very same reasons they're they're
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
coming up in other states two and a half
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
and then the second thing i said it was
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
much longer and that's the report
 
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
that chancellor heward referred to that
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
looked at a few other states did a kind
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
of a deep dive into the experiences a
 
00:45:28.079 --> 00:45:28.390 align:start position:0%
of a deep dive into the experiences a
few

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
few
 
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
of a few other states to outline you
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
know what were some of the initial goals
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
of those mergers or consolidations um
 
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
how what
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
what what drove those goals was it
 
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
demographics was it finance was it
 
00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
student pathways you know what kind of
 
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
combinations of things um
 
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
what were the some of the steps taken as
 
00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
these institutions looked at merging and
 
00:45:48.319 --> 00:45:49.349 align:start position:0%
these institutions looked at merging and
consolidating

00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
consolidating
 
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
how did they go what were some of the
 
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
major pain points
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
um in the in those processes what were
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
some of the successes
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
um that could you know early wins
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
longer-term wins you know
 
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
just kind of a a fairly thorough report
 
00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:02.950 align:start position:0%
just kind of a a fairly thorough report
on

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
those three examples that we just
 
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
thought would be useful that was the
 
00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:06.870 align:start position:0%
thought would be useful that was the
first

00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
piece of research that ccsnh really
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
looked at um
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
starting last fall when you know it
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
looked as if this conversation
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
you know was something that we all ought
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
to be having
 
00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
all right well i will uh i will read
 
00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:20.950 align:start position:0%
all right well i will uh i will read
those

00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
hopefully soon and um because i
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
i think it's important that all of us
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
take a look at um
 
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
the uh the study that was done
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
to to see what what was going on and
 
00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh and um you know
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
see if it you know as we go forward
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
hopefully to um prevent us from falling
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
down those same rabbit holes if that's
 
00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
the right term
 
00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
and i do agree that um
 
00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
it would be easy for the community
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
college system to get
 
00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
subsumed into the um
 
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
into the university system and
 
00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh i am a strong proponent of that not
 
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.349 align:start position:0%
uh i am a strong proponent of that not
happening

00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
happening
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
so this is
 
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
this is where i know the governor
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
is was talking about
 
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
legislative action and that it seemed to
 
00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.230 align:start position:0%
legislative action and that it seemed to
me

00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
he wanted the two
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
or he wanted the board to become
 
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
um fully engaged in
 
00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
that decision and
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
so i don't know um
 
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
adjusting some of the legislation in hb2
 
00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
or if we simply want to say
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh we anticipate
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
you know this information being provided
 
00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
to us
 
00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:09.839 align:start position:0%
by november um
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
and it you know i i think that that's a
 
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
that's a choice that i would like the
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
community college and the university
 
00:48:20.069 --> 00:48:20.079 align:start position:0%
system to make
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
because as you are as you are going
 
00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:24.870 align:start position:0%
because as you are as you are going
forward

00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
with the selection of the five people
 
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
for example each of you have
 
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
requirements for who can serve on your
 
00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:35.190 align:start position:0%
requirements for who can serve on your
board

00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
and so um and i think the governor
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
suggested that he expected the boards to
 
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
be fully engaged in this whole
 
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
i know that you know maybe maybe we
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
would make
 
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
the wrong decision but you can always
 
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:06.549 --> 00:49:06.559 align:start position:0%
if we have to change some people out i
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
mean that's that's
 
00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
that's okay um but i i would like
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
some feedback not not today on that but
 
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
in the next uh
 
00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
in the next couple of uh you know early
 
00:49:23.109 --> 00:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
sometime mid next week or whatever
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
because we're gonna be whatever we do
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have to
 
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
we don't have a lot of time so
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
kathy i see that you can i um i just
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
want to be super clear on what
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
you'd like feedback on the process that
 
00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:39.109 align:start position:0%
you'd like feedback on the process that
the

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:41.530 align:start position:0%
board would take to
 
00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:42.630 align:start position:0%
board would take to
[Music]

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
which i'm sorry that we just need to be
 
00:49:50.309 --> 00:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
clear on what
 
00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:53.839 align:start position:0%
we what you need from us by early next
 
00:49:53.839 --> 00:49:54.630 align:start position:0%
we what you need from us by early next
week

00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:49:58.790 --> 00:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
yeah what i'm what i'm looking for is if
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
you know thinking about the fact that
 
00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:01.839 align:start position:0%
this is going to go
 
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
forward how would we
 
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
take the current board with all of the
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
restrictions that you have
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
on your membership and we obviously
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
would have to change that in the
 
00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:17.190 align:start position:0%
would have to change that in the
legislation

00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
this year because or waive it
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
or something so that
 
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
the uh the new this new board
 
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
that supposedly will take effect uh
 
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
one july can operate
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
over the next however long you want it
 
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
to operate
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
i know that's probably very confusing
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
but does
 
00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 repeal
 
00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
the part of our law that that names
 
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
our existing board yeah that might be a
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
good question
 
00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
for matt if he could but i thought we
 
00:51:01.109 --> 00:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
were essentially the new board
 
00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
would take the place of both boards
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
effective july 1
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
based on our understanding of the
 
00:51:06.839 --> 00:51:08.390 align:start position:0%
based on our understanding of the
proposal

00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
that is correct tom the idea and this
 
00:51:13.349 --> 00:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
language is included in hb2
 
00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure once hb2 is released from
 
00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.150 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure once hb2 is released from
ols

00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
ols
 
00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
it'll be illustrated for the committee
 
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
um but the legacy boards if you would
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
would each appoint five members the
 
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
governor would appoint
 
00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
five members giving us a 15-member
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
new board that has governance over both
 
00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
systems as they exist today
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
and that is all language you'll see in
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
house bill 2.
 
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
and i believe it addresses the other
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
points of the existing
 
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
boards for the existing systems um
 
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
but again once hb2 is out i think that
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
would probably be the best time to
 
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
go into the finer details of that
 
00:51:58.400 --> 00:51:59.670 align:start position:0%
go into the finer details of that
process

00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
matt ma manager may i ask a question of
 
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:02.829 align:start position:0%
matt ma manager may i ask a question of
matt

00:52:02.829 --> 00:52:02.839 align:start position:0%
matt
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you um just to clarify
 
00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
the legacy boards would a point would
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
each appoint
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
five members and that would be those
 
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
would be the five or those five but then
 
00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
go through a different
 
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
um an additional process to be confirmed
 
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
i believe they are brought forward um
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
for i believe governor and
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
council approval but again i'd rather
 
00:52:29.589 --> 00:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
hp2 language
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
be published and then go into this
 
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
conversation if we can
 
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:38.309 align:start position:0%
conversation if we can
um

00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
of course we're just hopefully
 
00:52:49.349 --> 00:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
hopefully hb2 will be out very shortly
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
if uh
 
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
representative weiler signed off on it
 
00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:00.069 --> 00:53:00.079 align:start position:0%
okay so um anyhow
 
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
like i said i'm probably very confused
 
00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
about this
 
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh as to how you know how this
 
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
um appointment is going to go
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
because your both of your boards
 
00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:17.839 align:start position:0%
currently have um
 
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
restrictions for example uh
 
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
the unh board you have to appoint
 
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
somebody that's an alumni
 
00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
okay yeah or maybe maybe two or three
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
people that are alumni
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
that's right i don't remember what it is
 
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
and over
 
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
on the community college side you have
 
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
to appoint people that
 
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
are working in the fields that you are
 
00:53:40.559 --> 00:53:41.670 align:start position:0%
are working in the fields that you are
providing

00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
providing
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
degrees for uh technical things for
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.549 --> 00:53:54.559 align:start position:0%
there may be some things for this first
 
00:53:54.559 --> 00:53:55.589 align:start position:0%
there may be some things for this first
board

00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:53:58.309 --> 00:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
if that's the right term that don't
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily meet the requirements
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
of of what you currently have
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
but there may be people on your boards
 
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
that would be uh that would have
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
expertise to help with this
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
um all the things we've talked about
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
in in trying to unite but i certainly
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
would not want to lose off the
 
00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
off this combined board uh
 
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
at least one and maybe two people
 
00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
that are um with the technical side of
 
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
of um your current board
 
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
because i think that that is uh their
 
00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:45.829 align:start position:0%
because i think that that is uh their
voice

00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
voice
 
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
probably needs to be heard
 
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
very loud in in whatever whatever
 
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
occurs and i guess the final thing is is
 
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
that i
 
00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
and then i'll go to ken the final thing
 
00:54:58.640 --> 00:54:59.030 align:start position:0%
and then i'll go to ken the final thing
that

00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh i certainly understood from the
 
00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
governor today
 
00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
is he is expecting the boards
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
to be the lead the board to be the
 
00:55:09.839 --> 00:55:10.950 align:start position:0%
to be the lead the board to be the
leader

00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
leader
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
of this movement okay not the followers
 
00:55:18.789 --> 00:55:18.799 align:start position:0%
but rather the leaders and i think he
 
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
said he wants people to understand
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
that if they are appointed to this new
 
00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:26.789 align:start position:0%
that if they are appointed to this new
board

00:55:26.789 --> 00:55:26.799 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
that it is not once a month meeting but
 
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.750 align:start position:0%
that it is not once a month meeting but
rather

00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
rather
 
00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
the impetus for uh going forward so
 
00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
that i think needs to be fully
 
00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:39.990 align:start position:0%
that i think needs to be fully
understood

00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
understood
 
00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
by the boards so that um
 
00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
it will those are the kinds of people
 
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
that will initially
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
uh be on the board and we also could
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
think about
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
do we want currently the terms i think
 
00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:56.710 align:start position:0%
do we want currently the terms i think
are

00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
four years you know would we want to
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
um think about
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
maybe shortening the term
 
00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
you know because you can't have
 
00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
if i don't know if let's say that
 
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
somehow or other you appointed five
 
00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:16.630 align:start position:0%
somehow or other you appointed five
people

00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
that all their terms all expired the
 
00:56:20.549 --> 00:56:20.559 align:start position:0%
same year
 
00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
from the from the old board well that
 
00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
would not be a good idea
 
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand those may be
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
the five people that are most qualified
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
on the board and so
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's something i think that we would
 
00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
have to um
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
you know put in legislation that says
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
you know the this new board
 
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
will start out with fresh terms if
 
00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:50.230 align:start position:0%
will start out with fresh terms if
that's

00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
the right statement you know that so
 
00:56:56.069 --> 00:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
we're going to stagger them over
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
you know the time but again these are
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
things that that we need to
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
come to grips with as to what do we want
 
00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
to put
 
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
in hb2 what's there
 
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
um i won't comment on since matthew is
 
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
sitting on the
 
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
panel but uh no i'm just kidding i'm
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
just kidding
 
00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh ken you had a question i'm sorry to
 
00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
ramble on for so long
 
00:57:30.549 --> 00:57:30.559 align:start position:0%
yeah i just wanted to say that you know
 
00:57:32.069 --> 00:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
what we're what we're confronted with
 
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
now we have a budget that shows
 
00:57:37.349 --> 00:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
separate appropriations for both
 
00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
systems i support that i don't want to
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
combine them yet
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
and as i look at hp2 i think it's moving
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
a little fast
 
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
and i wouldn't want to lose these two
 
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
great chances we have now
 
00:57:53.829 --> 00:57:53.839 align:start position:0%
by doing something suddenly and then
 
00:57:53.839 --> 00:57:54.710 align:start position:0%
by doing something suddenly and then
suddenly

00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
suddenly
 
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
somebody that's that's done a good job
 
00:57:58.630 --> 00:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
of leading their system
 
00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
suddenly is is that position eliminated
 
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
i think it's too soon to
 
00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
see that i prefer my my real job
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative i know you do
 
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
being the vice chancellor finance and
 
00:58:13.589 --> 00:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
now you're really the real chancellor
 
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
i've seen you do great work so have a
 
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
lot of faith in you always have my
 
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
i always have your back so anyway
 
00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
and uh and i don't want to move too fast
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
yeah susan is trying to retire
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
in uh she's tried to retire before but
 
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
yeah but i know my success
 
00:58:32.549 --> 00:58:32.559 align:start position:0%
rate not so good in the retirement area
 
00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
but yeah
 
00:58:37.829 --> 00:58:37.839 align:start position:0%
and uh i've been uh needling her just a
 
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
little bit about
 
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh staying on and so anyhow but
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
you know those are the whatever
 
00:58:48.789 --> 00:58:48.799 align:start position:0%
yes someone else we could leave hb1
 
00:58:48.799 --> 00:58:49.670 align:start position:0%
yes someone else we could leave hb1
alone

00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
alone
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
and do something in hb2 to change make
 
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
it a little longer term
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
maybe make it six months or a year
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
before this joint board
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
shows up uh i think you'll get a lot of
 
00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
pushback on that
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
well um anyhow talk to the people that
 
00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:06.069 align:start position:0%
well um anyhow talk to the people that
are

00:59:06.069 --> 00:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
going to be affected yeah yeah did you
 
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am cheer thank you so much i
 
00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
really am
 
00:59:16.829 --> 00:59:16.839 align:start position:0%
my concerns are enormous about the
 
00:59:16.839 --> 00:59:18.150 align:start position:0%
my concerns are enormous about the
timeline

00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
timeline
 
00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
i agree that the university system and
 
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
community colleges
 
00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%
the potential there is huge but right
 
00:59:25.839 --> 00:59:26.549 align:start position:0%
the potential there is huge but right
now

00:59:26.549 --> 00:59:26.559 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
just listening to the conversation about
 
00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
the board
 
00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't even take into
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
consideration the major
 
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
major effort of combining these two
 
00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:37.990 align:start position:0%
major effort of combining these two
entities

00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
entities
 
00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
into a single moving healthy
 
00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:41.670 align:start position:0%
into a single moving healthy
organization

00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
and i too want to do it right and i too
 
00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:45.270 align:start position:0%
and i too want to do it right and i too
am

00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
am
 
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
completely committed to both agencies
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
but we can't mess around and we don't
 
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
want to do a bad
 
00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
job and muck up the good things we have
 
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
so i think we need to move cautiously
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
but most of all
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
if we're gonna do a system like this
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
then we have to invest
 
01:00:06.789 --> 01:00:06.799 align:start position:0%
some quality people and some quality
 
01:00:06.799 --> 01:00:07.510 align:start position:0%
some quality people and some quality
dollars

01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
so that people aren't trying to do this
 
01:00:10.319 --> 01:00:11.510 align:start position:0%
so that people aren't trying to do this
half-wittedly

01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
half-wittedly
 
01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
because i think it's important that it's
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
done right you know i watch snoo
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
and i watch what they developed you know
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
any one day they have about a hundred
 
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
and eighty thousand kids taking at least
 
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
one course
 
01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
online and i know the investment that
 
01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
they put in
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
i worked on part of it we've got to do
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
this and we've got to do it right
 
01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
otherwise we're going to do more harm
 
01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
than we're going to do good so that's
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
just a note of caution from me
 
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
um just you know formerly working in a
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
state system
 
01:00:41.829 --> 01:00:41.839 align:start position:0%
in a private system it takes a lot of
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
work and we want to do it right and
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
without doing that effort
 
01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
i think we'll do more harm than good so
 
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
i just really
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
i i listened to susan and i i've
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
listened to kathy
 
01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:56.079 align:start position:0%
and i respect both of you enormously
 
01:00:58.950 --> 01:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
but do you have time in your busy day to
 
01:00:58.960 --> 01:00:59.990 align:start position:0%
but do you have time in your busy day to
devote

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
devote
 
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
to making this system ready to go in a
 
01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:05.190 align:start position:0%
to making this system ready to go in a
year

01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
my question i guess it depends upon
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
whether i retire
 
01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
um i do think it's going to take a level
 
01:01:17.589 --> 01:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
of expertise i think one of the things
 
01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
that you can hear
 
01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
is that kathy's skills and my skills
 
01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
complement one another
 
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
i'm very fortunate to have both shannon
 
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
and scott
 
01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
on the legislative side and on the
 
01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
finance side
 
01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
my strengths are on the academic side on
 
01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
the student services side
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
on the transfer side and so on so it is
 
01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
we are going to need humans to to do the
 
01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:42.789 align:start position:0%
we are going to need humans to to do the
work

01:01:42.789 --> 01:01:42.799 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
um we're depending upon you to make a
 
01:01:45.839 --> 01:01:46.309 align:start position:0%
um we're depending upon you to make a
good

01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
decision for us you know you can hear
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
clearly that both systems
 
01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
here that something needs to happen um
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
and and we support that but we support
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
it in in different ways we
 
01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
we uh the community college wants to
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
continue to be nimble
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
through and through this is uh that's
 
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
our spirit i'm going to go off subject
 
01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:06.799 align:start position:0%
for a second and
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
and tell representative umberger that
 
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
the community college system receives 1
 
01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:11.430 align:start position:0%
the community college system receives 1
million

01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
or did last year in perkins funding
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives i would say
 
01:02:18.559 --> 01:02:18.950 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives i would say
that

01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
um at least
 
01:02:26.789 --> 01:02:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
there there is no way that all the
 
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
processes and everything else could be
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
accomplished in a year
 
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
um you know i i don't know that it would
 
01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
take 10 years
 
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
i think this this idea of the one year
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
is really about getting the legislation
 
01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:48.150 align:start position:0%
is really about getting the legislation
right

01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:02:53.029 --> 01:02:53.039 align:start position:0%
frankly because making one new board
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
effective this summer
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
still results in two separate systems in
 
01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
state law
 
01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
okay so then this board
 
01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:06.559 align:start position:0%
with legislative input i'm guessing
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
governors the input
 
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
then comes back and sees if there's a
 
01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.109 align:start position:0%
then comes back and sees if there's a
sponsor

01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
and then again just think it right
 
01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039 align:start position:0%
thinking through this then the
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
legislature has the next
 
01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
year to contemplate what the combined
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
system would look like in state statute
 
01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:31.029 align:start position:0%
system would look like in state statute
because

01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
combining the boards in and of itself
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't make one system
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
you still have rsa 187a and 188f
 
01:03:42.549 --> 01:03:42.559 align:start position:0%
so the legislature has another whole
 
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
session year to consider
 
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
getting this right okay then if you
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
think through the time
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
when you have in law one system
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
then we have to start thinking about
 
01:04:02.309 --> 01:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
okay what has to happen we have to
 
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
have technology we have to have faculty
 
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
and staff involved what's the financial
 
01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:07.109 align:start position:0%
and staff involved what's the financial
aid

01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
aid
 
01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
so i think the point
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
though is if we don't start now
 
01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
it will be 23 24 before we start really
 
01:04:20.309 --> 01:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
thinking about
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
what can what's possible for public
 
01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
uh let me just say this
 
01:04:38.829 --> 01:04:38.839 align:start position:0%
i had nothing to do one night last week
 
01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
and and so i decided to read
 
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
what the current law is for um
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
what is 187 and 180
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
whatever doesn't matter and
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
the the two
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
the two sections of the law
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
read very much the same
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
about the only thing that
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
confused me was it appeared in the law
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
that the trustees of the universe
 
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
university system
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
also have to run the water and sewer
 
01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
system for dover
 
01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
now i i i have no idea if that's
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
durham durham that's right i mean durham
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
is that a true statement um yes
 
01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
we share the cost but we have the water
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
treatment facility in
 
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
on the unh campus that serves the whole
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
town of durham
 
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i had no clue
 
01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
but maybe we can get rid of that
 
01:05:53.270 --> 01:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know um unless unless we have
 
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
some uh
 
01:05:59.750 --> 01:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh courses or a degree in uh
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
in uh whatever you call that sanitation
 
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
water and water water and sewer i mean
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
there's that
 
01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
i'm i don't mean to sound critical of it
 
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
they are very vital vital things as tom
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
knows but when i went through and looked
 
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
at them
 
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
they were almost identical
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
in in what the responsibilities
 
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
of the two systems were that's because
 
01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
when the community college system broke
 
01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:32.950 align:start position:0%
when the community college system broke
off

01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
from state government copy them the
 
01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:36.870 align:start position:0%
from state government copy them the
statute

01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
that the enabling legislation for the
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
university system was used as a model
 
01:06:44.789 --> 01:06:44.799 align:start position:0%
for the community college system the
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
other thing i would say
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
and as you can imagine i've been
 
01:06:49.349 --> 01:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
overthinking this for for
 
01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
a few weeks now and
 
01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
if if again i'm speaking for myself
 
01:06:59.349 --> 01:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
if if we as a state are going to take
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
that on
 
01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we start with rather than
 
01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:03.750 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we start with rather than
what's

01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
what's
 
01:07:05.829 --> 01:07:05.839 align:start position:0%
existing in state law that's been
 
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
amended for
 
01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know 100 years what should it
 
01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
look like
 
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
if i was going to build a system today
 
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
what does the law what should the law
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
look like rather than
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
so and and i think that
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
to try to do that in this budget session
 
01:07:35.349 --> 01:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
with a few months left will not
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
give it the thoughtfulness deliberative
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
process that it deserves
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't disagree with that um
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
but what i want to make sure is
 
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
that what hb2 says
 
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
allows the flexibility that's necessary
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
to override anything that is in current
 
01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:02.230 align:start position:0%
to override anything that is in current
law

01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge of what it says i'm not sure
 
01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
you got muted i'm sorry representative
 
01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
go ahead yeah you know one of the things
 
01:08:26.229 --> 01:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
i guess that i
 
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
that that strikes me is here is that
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
we have a we have a sort of a very basic
 
01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
fundamental decision to make and that is
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
do we want to do this or not and it
 
01:08:38.149 --> 01:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
seems to me that
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
that decision um we are in a position to
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
make relatively quickly for example
 
01:08:47.669 --> 01:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
we could say i would seem to me that we
 
01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
could easily say
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
this new board is created as of july 1
 
01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh 2021 and it will
 
01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
operate the university of new hampshire
 
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
system pursuant to rsa whatever it is
 
01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
and it will operate because the the uh
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
community college system pursuant to uh
 
01:09:12.789 --> 01:09:12.799 align:start position:0%
uh whatever the statute is for that and
 
01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
then you know i completely understand
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
that the details of getting
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
of of getting it all together is
 
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
is something that you're not going to
 
01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
accomplish by july 1. i have no
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
question about that but it does sort of
 
01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
seem to me that
 
01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
the most fundamental part of this is is
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
putting the people in charge
 
01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
of running the whole thing now it may
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
take them some time to make this into a
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
really integrated
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
system and i completely understand that
 
01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure there will be
 
01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
you know um problems along the way but i
 
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
i guess i i do tend to agree with miss
 
01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
provencher that
 
01:09:59.590 --> 01:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
we you know the we
 
01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
we ought to we ought to do this we ought
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
to make that first that basic decision
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
and once we've made it we ought to at
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
least take that
 
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
sort of initial step that that would be
 
01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
i yeah uh
 
01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
yes uh oh um um
 
01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
how does the how does the fact that the
 
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
university system was founded as a
 
01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
land-grant university gonna
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
gonna play into this
 
01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
or will it i i don't think it's going to
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
play into it at all it's still going to
 
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
be a land grant
 
01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
i mean the way the governor spoke about
 
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
we're still going to have ins in
 
01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:48.070 align:start position:0%
we're still going to have ins in
individual

01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
institutions in one system there are
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
we're a system now with four
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
with four in you know separate colleges
 
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
or universities
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
i i don't think it does affect the land
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
grant i i might be
 
01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
speaking out a term but i don't think it
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
does affect the land grant at all
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you as i told you
 
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
when i was uh wide awake reading all
 
01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
this stuff
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
um if i understood correctly
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
the current thompson school is
 
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
what uh continues to qualify
 
01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
the university system as a land-grant
 
01:11:32.159 --> 01:11:33.350 align:start position:0%
the university system as a land-grant
college

01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
college
 
01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
and that in the course offerings that
 
01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
they have there
 
01:11:41.189 --> 01:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
um but that's how i that's how i read
 
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
what was
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
in the uh rsas at this point
 
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
so um the thompson school
 
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
to the best of my knowledge isn't going
 
01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:52.630 align:start position:0%
to the best of my knowledge isn't going
anyplace

01:11:52.630 --> 01:11:52.640 align:start position:0%
anyplace
 
01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
and so um i i don't think that that's
 
01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh any kind of an issue at all tom
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
i just thought of something that
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
may play into this whole thing years ago
 
01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
we were
 
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
trying to get a prison psychiatrist
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
and they couldn't nobody could nobody
 
01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
would take the job
 
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
and we went into a contract with
 
01:12:23.669 --> 01:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
dartmouth college to provide for mental
 
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
health services and so
 
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
they got a psychiatrist to do the job
 
01:12:31.669 --> 01:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
but he wasn't he didn't have to put in
 
01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
his resume that he was a prison
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist he put in his resume that
 
01:12:36.149 --> 01:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
he was an
 
01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
adjunct professor for dartmouth college
 
01:12:38.719 --> 01:12:39.590 align:start position:0%
adjunct professor for dartmouth college
so

01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
maybe once this whole system comes
 
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.430 align:start position:0%
maybe once this whole system comes
together

01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
and the community college is having
 
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
trouble recruiting teachers
 
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
rather than be part-time teacher for new
 
01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:50.470 align:start position:0%
rather than be part-time teacher for new
hampshire

01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
technical institute they could be
 
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
adjunct professor
 
01:12:56.709 --> 01:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
of the university system in new
 
01:12:58.630 --> 01:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire it might it might
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
appeal to more people that you're
 
01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
looking to hire i don't know just
 
01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
something i thought might be one
 
01:13:04.719 --> 01:13:05.910 align:start position:0%
something i thought might be one
advantage

01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
that this whole thing could work out
 
01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further questions
 
01:13:12.719 --> 01:13:15.030 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further questions
today

01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
um yeah i know i know i've got
 
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
i've got a thousand but i'm not sure
 
01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
that i can articulate them
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
um very well but um
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
i ask you to think about this read the
 
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
two things that
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
um shannon put together
 
01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
and uh kathy if you have anything from
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
the university
 
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
that anybody can uh you know would be
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
find other research that's gone on about
 
01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
the combination
 
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
of uh the university systems
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
with the uh technical systems and see
 
01:13:55.199 --> 01:13:55.590 align:start position:0%
with the uh technical systems and see
what

01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh what that is um
 
01:14:04.709 --> 01:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
i i know in new york
 
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
that they have
 
01:14:11.910 --> 01:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
the college university system and they
 
01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:12.470 align:start position:0%
the college university system and they
have

01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
the i don't know if they call it
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
community colleges or
 
01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
what they're what they're calling it
 
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
today and i'm not sure
 
01:14:23.189 --> 01:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
whether that when they created
 
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh the suny business
 
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
if they in fact integrated those two
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
systems or if they are still
 
01:14:38.229 --> 01:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
completely separate systems but maybe
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
somebody knows
 
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
yes susan go ahead i was actually in the
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
suny system for 10 years
 
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
you can tell how old i am um i was at
 
01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:47.350 align:start position:0%
you can tell how old i am um i was at
the

01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
in the community colleges and the suny
 
01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:51.270 align:start position:0%
in the community colleges and the suny
system

01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
is 36 entities some of which are
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
community colleges
 
01:14:57.669 --> 01:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
some of which are two-year schools that
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
are the last two years and then the
 
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
university colleges in the university
 
01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:02.149 align:start position:0%
university colleges in the university
system

01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
and um they're
 
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
loosely connected i was very interested
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
in what i think was representative lynn
 
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
had to say because
 
01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
in that system there's a chancellor for
 
01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
the entire system but then there is a
 
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
a ceo if you will for the community
 
01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
colleges and then
 
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
and one for the university
 
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
parts so they do ultimately come
 
01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:25.430 align:start position:0%
parts so they do ultimately come
together

01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
and that has assisted with transfer
 
01:15:31.830 --> 01:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
issues for example um
 
01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
they didn't go the route that florida
 
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
has gone with is actually a legislative
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
office for transfer
 
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
but it it does create a vehicle so that
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
the two systems have an effective way of
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
talking to one another
 
01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
um but they're funded so very
 
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
differently the community colleges
 
01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
are 30 tuition 30 percent from the
 
01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:51.270 align:start position:0%
are 30 tuition 30 percent from the
county

01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
county
 
01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
and then 30 from what we then called
 
01:15:58.390 --> 01:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
so is there legislation
 
01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
that created this do you know or
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
did it just happen i oh by the way you
 
01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:15.510 --> 01:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
let me tell you i was uh i was part of
 
01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:15.990 align:start position:0%
let me tell you i was uh i was part of
the

01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
initial sunni uh
 
01:16:22.229 --> 01:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
integration i guess as a college student
 
01:16:22.239 --> 01:16:23.030 align:start position:0%
integration i guess as a college student
so

01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
wow um okay uh i'll cede my position to
 
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
you represent thank you
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
i have a degree from suny newport oh
 
01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
very good
 
01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
very good and i was at finger lakes um
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know about the legislation i'm
 
01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:39.990 align:start position:0%
i don't know about the legislation i'm
sorry

01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
sorry
