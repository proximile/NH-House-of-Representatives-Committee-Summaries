00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
that would be super okay perfect one
 
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.589 align:start position:0%
that would be super okay perfect one
second

00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
she'll be able to do that right good you
 
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.150 align:start position:0%
she'll be able to do that right good you
have

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
okay so everyone can see that
 
00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
perfect okay welcome
 
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
um so yes representative major as you
 
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
had said
 
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
today we are going to speak about
 
00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:39.919 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates that we have
 
00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
updated uh we did this present
 
00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
presentation to senate ways and means
 
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
may 10th um and had worked with them
 
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
as they just finalized their revenue
 
00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
estimates which are at the end of our
 
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
presentation for cons comparison
 
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.070 align:start position:0%
presentation for cons comparison
purposes

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh the layout is very similar to what
 
00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
you have seen in the past we will go
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
through all our major taxes
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
and show you the adjustments compared to
 
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
plan as well as letting you know that
 
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
this data is through
 
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
april as we are wrapping up may now but
 
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
i can speak to may some
 
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
and to let you know that we did take
 
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
into account obviously
 
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
the uh possible changes in recovery
 
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
effects of covid19
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
so below is the chart that you're
 
00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
typical typically used of seeing
 
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
we have our dra taxes we have plan for
 
00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:27.919 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
we have the anomalous receivable that
 
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
we've spoke about several times so i
 
00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519 align:start position:0%
won't go over that
 
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
um if you have questions feel free to
 
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
ask but i think you're pretty familiar
 
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
we have our low and high which is net of
 
00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
that anomalous receivable
 
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
which is again consistent with how we've
 
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
done it in the past
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
and then we have two columns we have our
 
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:48.870 align:start position:0%
and then we have two columns we have our
low

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
low
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
compared to plan and our high compared
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
to plan
 
00:08:53.829 --> 00:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
i do want to know a couple of the taxes
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
have not changed since we were back here
 
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
a month ago i think it was april 28th
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
that's meals and rentals cst and revenue
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me real estate transfer tax
 
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
those taxes performed as we had expected
 
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
so we did not update
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
our estimates for the year i also want
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
to note that
 
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
our growth ranges also have not changed
 
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.230 align:start position:0%
our growth ranges also have not changed
uh

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
for the taxes we hadn't had any
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
additional information since april 28th
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
to to make any modifications to those
 
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
and lastly as you're familiar with we i
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
did want to note that as you can see
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
in our revenue estimates on the far
 
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
right-hand side
 
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
covet has affected taxes very
 
00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.590 align:start position:0%
covet has affected taxes very
differently

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
differently
 
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
we do know some taxes have been
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
performing very well
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
like business taxes and tobacco taxes
 
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
where m r has been hit the hardest but
 
00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
if you've been following either
 
00:09:47.279 --> 00:09:48.470 align:start position:0%
if you've been following either
crochet's

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
crochet's
 
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
revenue updates or the revenue updates
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
that devin sends out you can see that m
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
r actually
 
00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
okay moving on to business taxes
 
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
i think when we came april 29th our
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
april 28th
 
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
last month we hadn't updated these yet
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
we wanted to see how april had performed
 
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
before we made
 
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
estimates for the remaining uh months
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
so i'm sure you have looked at the
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
information and have seen
 
00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
that april was a really healthy
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
april is a really healthy month um
 
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
business taxes
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
for the month of april were 47.5
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
or 73.8 million ahead of plan and that
 
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
was our largest
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
april looking back the last 10 years
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal year to date we're 174.5
 
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
million or 27.5
 
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
ahead of plan that does include that
 
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
18.3 million dollar anomalous receivable
 
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
and then we're 252 or 45.4
 
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
ahead of prior year uh as we know this
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
pandemic it's had different impacts on
 
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.030 align:start position:0%
pandemic it's had different impacts on
businesses

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
with some hurting while others were
 
00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:04.870 align:start position:0%
with some hurting while others were
thriving

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
thriving
 
00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
based on the revenue it does look like
 
00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
business activity for april
 
00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
performed much better than we
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
anticipated as well as i believe
 
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
businesses anticipated and i say that
 
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
because we do know
 
00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
businesses some businesses definitely
 
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
struggled and suffered through the
 
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.230 align:start position:0%
struggled and suffered through the
pandemic

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
however it appears that the majority of
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire business taxpayers
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
did fare better than they had expected
 
00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
and this is shown in part again to april
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
being up that 73.8 million
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
meaning um and it was driven by the
 
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
extension payments meaning that
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
taxpayers didn't
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
adjust their estimate payments through
 
00:11:49.269 --> 00:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
the year
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
and then when they had to true up their
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
payment come march and april
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh they ended up paying a lot more than
 
00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
they had anticipated paying
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
and we think this can be in part with
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
businesses and individuals receiving
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
more money from the state and federal
 
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
federally than they expected we've had
 
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
lots of talks about it and we know that
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
this was the largest stimulus package
 
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
the federal government has ever
 
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
infused in the economy with being a
 
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
little a little bit less than 25
 
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
of gdp and then this coupled with
 
00:12:25.509 --> 00:12:25.519 align:start position:0%
consumers having more money spending
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
more money to spend and a shift in the
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
economy had
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
businesses reporting higher profits than
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
so because of how much in april came
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
we revised our revenue estimates and
 
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
used a different modeling approach
 
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
what we did was look at historic
 
00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.230 align:start position:0%
what we did was look at historic
performance

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
performance
 
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
and how that was based on march and
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
april's performance
 
00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
so we modeled our low estimate
 
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 21 947.5 million
 
00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
was based on the low historical
 
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
performance of
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
may and june based on march and april
 
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
and then our high
 
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
revenue was 964.9 million
 
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
and that was modeled aft as the average
 
00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%
historic performance of revenue for may
 
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
and june
 
00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
based on march and april and then for
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
our fiscal year 22 and 23 growth rates
 
00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:26.959 align:start position:0%
you should be familiar with these at
 
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
this point
 
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
um we have a two to six percent
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
on predicted gdp for
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 and then for fiscal year
 
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
23 we have a three to five
 
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
percent um growth rate based on gdp as
 
00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:44.629 align:start position:0%
percent um growth rate based on gdp as
well

00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
well not so you didn't change the growth
 
00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.230 align:start position:0%
well not so you didn't change the growth
rates

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
rates
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
and so these are based upon which
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
growth rates that you would have seen
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:03.519 align:start position:0%
we adjusted these i think a couple
 
00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
months back
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
okay all right so soon enough
 
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:15.519 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions on
 
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
business taxes
 
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative romney followed by
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
representative and
 
00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chair rob
 
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
thanks melissa
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
so i just want to make sure i understand
 
00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
you didn't you didn't adjust 21. 21 is
 
00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:33.519 align:start position:0%
what it is even though we know some of
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
that money that's come in may have to be
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
given back next year correct
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
right so just just to inform the
 
00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:41.189 align:start position:0%
right so just just to inform the
committee

00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
the way the revenue estimates work is
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's based on current law
 
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%
and um if there are any dollars going
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
back based on bills for instance like
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
sb3 those come out in the surplus
 
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
statement item
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
so we don't adjust for those revenues
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
coming out of the taxes again it's based
 
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
on base
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
and then chris will do up the surplus
 
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
statement to get the net revenue
 
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
okay yes that's that's what i assume
 
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to do is that we'll uh
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
we'll do our but this is the base even
 
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
though we know the base is kind of
 
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
it could be potentially higher than it
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
but that's the only way we can show it
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh and then it's really us
 
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
up to us to determine how much anomalous
 
00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
revenue in the next two years uh
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
or uh that would we'd show in the uh
 
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
surplus statement
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
as a negative correct is that what we're
 
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
going to do
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you representative
 
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
and i had the same kind of question
 
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
i mean this this is really anomalous
 
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
this revenue
 
00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
increase but i guess we can't treat it
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
as anomalous until
 
00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
that's the first time we run into this
 
00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.230 align:start position:0%
that's the first time we run into this
problem

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um let's see if i can
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
inquire now you're you're low range
 
00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:17.839 align:start position:0%
in high range two to six does that take
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
into effect
 
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
the likely increase in federal taxes
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
that are being considered at least or is
 
00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
that just
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
strictly keeping things the way they are
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
so this is um keeping things the way
 
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
they are however and
 
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
caroline jump in here if i'm incorrect
 
00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839 align:start position:0%
in speaking
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
but i do know that if federal taxes
 
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
are increased i don't think that should
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
affect our revenue as it doesn't affect
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
the base of taxpayers
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
i think it only affects our revenue if
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:55.839 align:start position:0%
even though they would be spending more
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
money off the top and
 
00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
having less money for us
 
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
okay yeah that would come up in another
 
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
area okay yeah yeah
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um yeah i hear the same i'm
 
00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:17.839 align:start position:0%
puzzling over the same question that
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
representative abrami and representative
 
00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:20.870 align:start position:0%
representative abrami and representative
alan

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
alan
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
put to the fore and uh
 
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
um it seems to you built uh dra has
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
built its
 
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh its estimate for the
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
next fiscal year and the year just the
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
year after that
 
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
on this fiscal year's
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21's performance as i
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
understand it less
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
without the anomalies that we've been
 
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
with sb3
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
assuming that passes there'll be a
 
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
surplus statement that says
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
presumably you'd use your timing
 
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.470 align:start position:0%
presumably you'd use your timing
methodology

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
methodology
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the neighborhood of 45 or
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars
 
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
um which suggests that
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
in these figures that are for fy21
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
there's an anomalous amount
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be part of the growth
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
projection and
 
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
sure i will uh take a stab at that
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
question so i think
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
there's two different issues here we
 
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
have sb3
 
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
right that will be coming out on the
 
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
surplus statement
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
and then we just have ppp loans in
 
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
general and what they produce for
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
revenue so i think those are two
 
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
separate items so sb3
 
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
is revenue the 90 99.4 million spread
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
out over the years
 
00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039 align:start position:0%
is coming out because the ppp is not
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
included in the gross income
 
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
and then they still get the deduction so
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
they're essentially getting
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
those extra funds back or those extra
 
00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.630 align:start position:0%
those extra funds back or those extra
funds

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
as a deduction against non-ppp
 
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
so that revenue is accounted for in the
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
surplus statement
 
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
however if sb3 if we were just at
 
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
current law without
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
sp3 in i don't think we think ppp
 
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
would increase revenue a tremendous
 
00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:36.950 align:start position:0%
would increase revenue a tremendous
amount

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
amount
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
because as carolyn has has spoke to that
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
if ppp is in their income and then if
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
they use
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
that ppp as a deductible expense which
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
we assume most of them will
 
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
there is not a large revenue impact of
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you before we go to
 
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative alame
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%
uh there's one thing that nobody's
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned yet
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
besides the ppp there's
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
in these revenues that we're seeing now
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
that are higher than we was predicted
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
as a result of the other type of
 
00:20:20.559 --> 00:20:21.830 align:start position:0%
as a result of the other type of
stimuluses

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
stimuluses
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
that have been going on and
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
we haven't been able to identify those
 
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.029 align:start position:0%
we haven't been able to identify those
yet

00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.039 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
but has caused some of this
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
excess revenue and
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
that isn't going to continue
 
00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0%
so we need to be able to
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
if not now define how much of that
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
extra revenue is associated with those
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
other types of stimulus packages
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
have you done any of that yet melissa
 
00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
so i think as carolyn has spoke to and
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
we spoke to a couple of times the
 
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
challenge is is that when we get returns
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
i mean first off we know the issue is
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
that there's been an increase in
 
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
extensions so we don't have the data
 
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
there second the data that does come in
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
the money flows onto one line of the
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
return and it doesn't break out where
 
00:21:21.909 --> 00:21:21.919 align:start position:0%
those funds have come
 
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
from so it's near impossible for us to
 
00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:25.669 align:start position:0%
from so it's near impossible for us to
say

00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
what has increased those funds and if
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
that those trends will continue over
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
the years this has been a very dynamic
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
economy where
 
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
businesses have shifted in and
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
really have has a lot of them have done
 
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
well during this pandem
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic with the help of these stimulus
 
00:21:44.159 --> 00:21:45.110 align:start position:0%
pandemic with the help of these stimulus
funds

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
and maybe that bolstered their business
 
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
enough it's hard to say
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
whether that is going to be one time and
 
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
then you're going to see a drop
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
or if they've both these funds have
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
bolstered their business enough
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
and improved made improvements that
 
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
these revenues will continue
 
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
it's definitely an area that could use
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
some discussion
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think we have the data or
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
information to say where that has fallen
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
except looking at gdp and it doesn't
 
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
look like that's predicted to decline
 
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
so they're expecting the economy to
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
right and the gdp latest
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
information i heard for 2021
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to come out to be in the
 
00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:33.270 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to come out to be in the
six

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
so that gdp it would be nice if it could
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
stay at six percent but i doubt it
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
uh representative almighty followed by
 
00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
representative romney
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman it's uh
 
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
this is going to be really difficult but
 
00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.750 align:start position:0%
this is going to be really difficult but
on

00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
the first thing on i wanted to say
 
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
ask was on after we pass
 
00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:12.559 align:start position:0%
sb 3 on
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
if when we do another revenue estimate
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
the revenue that we can identify which i
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
guess isn't going to be at least until
 
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.470 align:start position:0%
guess isn't going to be at least until
after

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
after
 
00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
october on that is due to
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
sb3 be treated as anomalous
 
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
and even though it's in the surplus
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
statement for the budget
 
00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:48.559 align:start position:0%
on and
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
i'm the other thing talking about
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
the continued stimulus that
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
is going on uh a lot of it is supposed
 
00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
to be directed towards
 
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure kinds of things capital
 
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.350 align:start position:0%
infrastructure kinds of things capital
investment

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
investment
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
on but also they
 
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
fashioned that bill trying to help
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
the what they think of as smaller
 
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.870 align:start position:0%
the what they think of as smaller
businesses

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
and that's another problem for the
 
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
for us those are probably the large
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
businesses uh the top ones
 
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh to the extent that they send that
 
00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:26.630 align:start position:0%
uh to the extent that they send that
stimulus

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
stimulus
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
more to small real businesses we call
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
smaller medium on we haven't been
 
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that's going to reduce
 
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
the amount of revenue we get
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
or if they're going to thrive which
 
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
would be nice
 
00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
but this whole thing
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
your response melissa sure i tend to
 
00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
agree with you representative almi it is
 
00:24:59.440 --> 00:24:59.990 align:start position:0%
agree with you representative almi it is
murky

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
murky
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
for sure um obviously i've said it
 
00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
before we we haven't been through
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
anything like this so
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
modeling it out and and trying to see
 
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen
 
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
is an evolution for sure um
 
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
to go back to your original question
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
about sb3
 
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
and when that passes in revenue so i can
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
just give you some information on how
 
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
plan is built so when plan
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
is built it's based on the revenues that
 
00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.590 align:start position:0%
is built it's based on the revenues that
is

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
agreed upon the final revenues are done
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
and then surplus statement is subtracted
 
00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
out of those base revenues
 
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
and that would be the same for fiscal
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
year 22 and 23 so essentially revenue
 
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
estimates base which are agreed upon
 
00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:49.039 align:start position:0%
and finalized and then subtracting out
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
what's in the surplus statement so sb3
 
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
would be on that surplus statement for
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
22 and 23 and that would be the
 
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative romney i'm going to beat
 
00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
this to death here a bit
 
00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039 align:start position:0%
um so for us to try to figure out
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
you know we may need to do an adjustment
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
to the base year revenues
 
00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
just on paper as we project 22 and 23
 
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
and and to me it's not the full 99.4
 
00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.950 align:start position:0%
and and to me it's not the full 99.4
million

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
it's something less than that that was
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
i would consider anomalous because they
 
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.990 align:start position:0%
i would consider anomalous because they
paid

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
you know hoping sp3 would pass but
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
knowing that they were going to get
 
00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.549 align:start position:0%
knowing that they were going to get
refunds

00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
refunds
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
so but so i
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
do we have an idea of what for santa
 
00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:48.559 align:start position:0%
we've i think we've asked this we had
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
this discussion before
 
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
do we know or a good guess at
 
00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh what percentage of the 99.4 million
 
00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:57.510 align:start position:0%
uh what percentage of the 99.4 million
came

00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
came
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
in in that we're going to give back
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
came in in march and april as people
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
were filing
 
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
their taxes so
 
00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
we have looked at it and i i want to
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
again separate out sb3 and just say what
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
percentage of revenue came in
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
for taxpayers who paid or filed a
 
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
schedule for which is where the ppp data
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
is reported on
 
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
and that was about 5.4 million
 
00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
that came in in march and april so again
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
those taxpayers actually physically
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
filed the return and had the schedules
 
00:27:31.679 --> 00:27:32.230 align:start position:0%
filed the return and had the schedules
that

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
that reported the ppp data um
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
the loans were forgiven and all that
 
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
correct correct
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry keep on going um and again i'm
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
going to have carolyn has been the sp3
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
expert i'll speak to it but if i say
 
00:27:48.159 --> 00:27:48.950 align:start position:0%
expert i'll speak to it but if i say
anything

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
she could feel free to jump and
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
incorrect again i think
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
that 99 million is
 
00:27:59.909 --> 00:27:59.919 align:start position:0%
how do i want to term it it's funds that
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
would not have come in through the
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
revenue some portion
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
that their profit exceeded their
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
deduction would be paying revenue
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
but i think we believe for the majority
 
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
of taxpayers
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
in the ppp area if they paid
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
if their loan was forgiven for ppp and
 
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
they had
 
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
expenses if they expensed it out
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
there would be no tax revenue impact the
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
reason there is a revenue impact
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
for sb3 is because
 
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
you no longer have that ppp data
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
in the income line and you have extra
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
expenses now to offset
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
revenue without that ppp so it's a it's
 
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.510 align:start position:0%
revenue without that ppp so it's a it's
a

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
added benefit as to why
 
00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
there's a reef um a revenue expense of
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
the 99.4 million
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
because of that added benefit of the sb3
 
00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
or the pvp not being included in the
 
00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.750 align:start position:0%
or the pvp not being included in the
income

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
income
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
okay like others have said this is this
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
gets more confusing as we talk
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
so it's okay i think we'll come up with
 
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
something i'm sure
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
any further questions before melissa
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:24.789 --> 00:29:24.799 align:start position:0%
okay so moving on to meals and rentals
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
tax as i stated in the beginning
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
we haven't updated our projections for
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals tax because it has
 
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:31.669 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals tax because it has
fallen

00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
fallen
 
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
in line the last couple of months of how
 
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
we anticipated
 
00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal year to date we are 64.9
 
00:29:39.679 --> 00:29:40.149 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal year to date we are 64.9
million

00:29:40.149 --> 00:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
or 19.8 percent below plan
 
00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
that's through april um or 35.5 million
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
or 11.9 percent below prior year
 
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh we do know if again if those of you
 
00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:54.559 align:start position:0%
have been following the report that
 
00:29:59.510 --> 00:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
m r um so far is 2.9 percent below plan
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
which is a
 
00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
a pretty big increase and we know this
 
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:04.630 align:start position:0%
a pretty big increase and we know this
based

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
based
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
um partly of things opening back up more
 
00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:09.039 align:start position:0%
people being
 
00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
vaccinated higher consumer confidence
 
00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:14.559 align:start position:0%
and then just as this recovery rate
 
00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
continues to
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
to perform as we enter these warm months
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
i would suggest
 
00:30:21.669 --> 00:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
on meals and rentals tax when you're
 
00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
doing your revenue estimates we do have
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
this range of 315.4 million as our low
 
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
in 320 0.4 million as our high
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
to probably lean towards the higher end
 
00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
as may came in
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
towards our higher end of revenue
 
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
estimates and i don't think that's going
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
to fall backwards
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
so i think the 315.4 is probably low at
 
00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:43.919 align:start position:0%
this point and would
 
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
would recommend you guys going towards
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
our higher end
 
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
our higher end assumes a faster
 
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
improvement um
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
and that's that's exactly what we've
 
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
seen this month and then for fiscal year
 
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
22 and 23 we have the five to
 
00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
five to ten percent growth um
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
which is equal to 2018 revenues and the
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
highs equal to 2019 revenue sort of
 
00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:06.559 align:start position:0%
getting us
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
back to the normal range and then fiscal
 
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
year 23 is four to six percent
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
which is back to the historical um
 
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
growth that we've seen in the past for m
 
00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.029 align:start position:0%
growth that we've seen in the past for m
r

00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:19.039 align:start position:0%
r
 
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
any questions on meals and rentals tax
 
00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.909 align:start position:0%
any questions on meals and rentals tax
questions

00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative selfless
 
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you this has been an area i've
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
been thinking about for quite a while
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
and just two anecdotes i just want to
 
00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799 align:start position:0%
see if they fit in
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
my local everyday restaurant put 10
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
tables outside
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
but now the outside tables are full and
 
00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
they're full inside and they hired two
 
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
new weight people
 
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
also a gourmet restaurant that was very
 
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
hard to get into
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
and was losing funds um started letting
 
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
people do
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
ten parties could do gourmet takeout at
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
two o'clock
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
and they would stagger those now they're
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
fully open inside
 
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
they're still doing the ten party
 
00:32:05.509 --> 00:32:05.519 align:start position:0%
takeout and again
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
they're doing better than ever even
 
00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
though they're having to make up for the
 
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
past so
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
that's just a couple examples in my area
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that probably falls in line
 
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
with why the growth
 
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.669 align:start position:0%
 
vaccination

00:32:29.669 --> 00:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
okay melissa all right tobacco tax
 
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
um we did revise this tax tobacco tax
 
00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to date
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
were 40.4 million or 24.4 percent ahead
 
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
of plan
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
and 34.3 or 20 ahead of prior year
 
00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
as we've talked about quite a bit
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
the massachusetts ban on ventilated
 
00:32:58.630 --> 00:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
tobacco and other flavored tobacco
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
products has continued to drive this
 
00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.909 align:start position:0%
products has continued to drive this
increase

00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
in revenues and other states have also
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
seen that trend
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
what we are keeping an eye on for future
 
00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
tax years
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
is there has been a uh the fda has been
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
speaking about a proposed national black
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
band on flavored tobacco products so
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
just something to
 
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
to keep in mind there's no updated
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
information um as of yet i think that
 
00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
came out at the end of april
 
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
and i asked the question right now is
 
00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:28.149 align:start position:0%
and i asked the question right now is
that

00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
um do you know how much
 
00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
of this revenue is due to the
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
methanol cigarettes
 
00:33:41.669 --> 00:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
so we don't have a breakdown of that
 
00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
it's not reported on
 
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
our return uh so it would
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
it would be pretty difficult for us to
 
00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
say what the impact would be if there is
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
a ban on flavor tobacco products however
 
00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
we do
 
00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
know that this is the increase is driven
 
00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:00.559 align:start position:0%
by those mentholated prop
 
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
um mentholated tobacco products
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
anecdotally we had reached out to
 
00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:07.519 align:start position:0%
wholesalers and retailers
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
in the border states and they had
 
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
confirmed that they had seen
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
quite dramatic increase in mentholated
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
in flavor tobacco products but we don't
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
have a breakdown on that
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
in our return data all right thank you
 
00:34:28.069 --> 00:34:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
do you want representative berstein or
 
00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:31.839 align:start position:0%
do you want to keep going
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
representative bernstein has his hand up
 
00:34:35.589 --> 00:34:35.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question man listen
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
there was some um
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
legislation in the mass house about
 
00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.030 align:start position:0%
legislation in the mass house about
repealing

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
repealing
 
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
the prohibition on um menthol cigarettes
 
00:34:49.829 --> 00:34:49.839 align:start position:0%
menthol products do you have any idea
 
00:34:52.069 --> 00:34:52.079 align:start position:0%
where that legislation stands now did
 
00:34:52.079 --> 00:34:52.470 align:start position:0%
where that legislation stands now did
that

00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
get defeated or uh and i guess that's
 
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
not just to you but
 
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
anyone who has any knowledge on it sure
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
i did see that
 
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
and we do get regular updates on
 
00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.190 align:start position:0%
and we do get regular updates on
legislative

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
um information for tobacco i don't think
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
last i knew it was going to pass
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
i don't think it had very strong legs
 
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
but i don't have an update we can look
 
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
into that if you'd like just to confirm
 
00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.430 align:start position:0%
into that if you'd like just to confirm
that

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
it hasn't had any gain traction since i
 
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
last saw information on it
 
00:35:25.349 --> 00:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
thank you that would be good if you
 
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
looked into that thanks anybody else
 
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
questions on tobacco at this point
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
go ahead and go awesome okay so our
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
low is 245.6 million
 
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
this assumes the increase due to
 
00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
massachusetts flavor ban continues at
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
the consistent rate
 
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
and then our high is 248.3 million
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
and this assumes the fiscal year to date
 
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
over plan of 24
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
is maintained um
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
for the rest of the year as well as an
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
increase with the cross-border sales
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
due to consumer confidence again and
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
travel restrictions lifted
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
and then for fiscal year 22 we have
 
00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:07.190 align:start position:0%
and then for fiscal year 22 we have
negative

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
negative
 
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
three percent to zero percent um this is
 
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
the historic year-over-year reduction
 
00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
and then we tempered it to account for
 
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
any residual offsetting of e-cigarettes
 
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
um and then fiscal year 23
 
00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
we have a negative four percent to
 
00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
negative one percent
 
00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
and again that's just consistent with
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax trends
 
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
um in the past after we sort of had this
 
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
year of
 
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh this blip year of um
 
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
the e-cigarettes and the massachusetts
 
00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:40.069 align:start position:0%
the e-cigarettes and the massachusetts
tobacco

00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
tobacco
 
00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions on tobacco
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:56.079 align:start position:0%
is minus three percent enough if they
 
00:36:56.079 --> 00:36:56.550 align:start position:0%
is minus three percent enough if they
ban

00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
ban
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
flavored tobacco if they take the banana
 
00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%
off of
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
flavored tobacco products in
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
can you ask that one more time do you
 
00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
mean if they put the band
 
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
on in massachusetts oh yeah if they put
 
00:37:13.829 --> 00:37:13.839 align:start position:0%
it on right
 
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
sorry that's okay too many negatives
 
00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
didn't i thought
 
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
that's okay um so we have not accounted
 
00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.030 align:start position:0%
that's okay um so we have not accounted
for

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
the national ban on flavored tobacco
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
products because we don't know if it's
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
going through at this point
 
00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
um i did read that if it were to go
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
through it would take a year
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
so i assume we'd see it more in 23 than
 
00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.270 align:start position:0%
so i assume we'd see it more in 23 than
22

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
22
 
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
but it's not factored into our estimates
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
go ahead melissa
 
00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
all right moving on to interest and
 
00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
dividends tax i think when we were here
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
a month ago we didn't have
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't have an estimate on this tax
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
because we were waiting for april to
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
come in
 
00:37:59.109 --> 00:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal year to date we are 13.5
 
00:37:59.119 --> 00:37:59.670 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal year to date we are 13.5
million

00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
or 13.8 percent ahead of plan this
 
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
includes the 9.2 million of us anomalous
 
00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.230 align:start position:0%
includes the 9.2 million of us anomalous
receivable

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
receivable
 
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
and we're 33.8 or 43.7 ahead of prior
 
00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.470 align:start position:0%
and we're 33.8 or 43.7 ahead of prior
year

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
as we know this tax does have historic
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
year-over-year swings
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
and does seem to do well when the stock
 
00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:17.270 align:start position:0%
and does seem to do well when the stock
market

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
market
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
performs well which is shaky a little
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
here and there
 
00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
right now we do know people have had
 
00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:26.079 align:start position:0%
more money in the bank during
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
this pandemic lastly i want to know
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to note that the irs did extend
 
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
the due date for individuals to pay
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
returns to may 17th
 
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
although new hampshire maintained their
 
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
april 15th due date
 
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:42.079 align:start position:0%
so in april we did see some reductions
 
00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
in revenues and we assumed
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
it was because of the federal due date
 
00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.109 align:start position:0%
it was because of the federal due date
as

00:38:47.109 --> 00:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
um we talked about the anomalous
 
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
receivable that happened
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
when taxpayers did that last year when
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
the uh feds put the due date out to july
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
and we said june taxpayers still filed
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
late so
 
00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
looking at main numbers so far they have
 
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
come in
 
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh ahead of plan and that is because
 
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayers filed late they were supposed
 
00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:08.950 align:start position:0%
taxpayers filed late they were supposed
to

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
file it in april and they filed in may
 
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
based on the federal due date
 
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
we did factor that into our revenue
 
00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.950 align:start position:0%
we did factor that into our revenue
estimates

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
so fiscal year 21 our low range is 124
 
00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:23.190 align:start position:0%
so fiscal year 21 our low range is 124
million

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
this assumes fiscal year to date
 
00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
percentage over plan of 14
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
is maintained through the end of the
 
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
year um with
 
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
revenue shifting again from april to may
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
and then our high is 132 point million
 
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
this again assumes revenue shifted from
 
00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:41.839 align:start position:0%
april to may
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
with increased tax reported on returns
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
and extensions for texture 20 compared
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
to 2019
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
and 2021 estimates continuing on trend
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
it looks like right now based on our
 
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
estimates it's
 
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
we still have june to come in which is
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
another estimate month but we're falling
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
pretty close to the middle of our range
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
right now for
 
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax for fiscal
 
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
year 21.
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
and then fiscal year 22 we have the four
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
to six percent growth based on past
 
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
performance of the tax
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
coupled with anticipated gdp
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
and then in 23 we have this tax slowing
 
00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
down to a two to four percent growth
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
again based on past performance and then
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
an anticipated reduction of gdp
 
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
in 2023
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
once more any questions on interest and
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
dividend tax uh represent
 
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
southwest uh yes
 
00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
basically this would be deducted in the
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
surplus station
 
00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
statement if various bills pass that's
 
00:40:48.079 --> 00:40:48.870 align:start position:0%
statement if various bills pass that's
accurate

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
so it would be you know a net zero
 
00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:56.230 align:start position:0%
so it would be you know a net zero
really

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
the what would be a net zero well if
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
it goes in in the revenue and comes out
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
in the surplus statement
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
if it's phased out quickly and we don't
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
know how that's going to work but
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so i think that the phase out the
 
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
the larger impact is in later years it's
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
a longer phase out for this tax so i
 
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
think there's sort of a minimal in
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
a minimal decrease that will occur on
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
the surplus statement for 22 and 23 and
 
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
then the further you go out the larger
 
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
the decrease will be
 
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
in revenues so pardon my
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
ignorance so really they have decided
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
that they're going to do the face out
 
00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
it's i think it's still up for
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
discussion it's over um with the senate
 
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i'm not sure
 
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
um you're gonna know the answer to this
 
00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
uh melissa but
 
00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
i guess one of the things i'm concerned
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
about is we've heard that the biden
 
00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.069 align:start position:0%
about is we've heard that the biden
administration

00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
administration
 
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
is considering doubling the capital
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
gains tax
 
00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
so that instead of the high range of 20
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
it'll be
 
00:42:07.349 --> 00:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
potentially high range of 40 plus yield
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
obama tax of 3.4
 
00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:11.839 align:start position:0%
yielding a total capital gains of
 
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
roughly i believe
 
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
it's 43.4 or something like that
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
do we have any historical data on how
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
tax received could be influenced by the
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
federal i know it's
 
00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:32.079 align:start position:0%
the federal has been the same for quite
 
00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
some time so that's why i'm
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
wondering whether you have any idea how
 
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
that could influence because that's
 
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
going to be a huge change in the federal
 
00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
which could cause people to not
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
you know sell stocks and other things
 
00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
um we have not done any comparison
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
from the interest and dividends tax to
 
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
the federal tax
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
uh carolyn do you have any more
 
00:43:00.069 --> 00:43:00.079 align:start position:0%
information on how you think
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
that would affect interest and dividends
 
00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.990 align:start position:0%
that would affect interest and dividends
tax

00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
no i don't have any other information
 
00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
but i do think it's an apt
 
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
point right i mean the tax rate
 
00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:13.839 align:start position:0%
certainly could impact taxpayer behavior
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
and therefore impact our tax
 
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
of course the ind tax doesn't tax
 
00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
capital gains
 
00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
it cap it uh taxes the
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
income earned on holding stock so if the
 
00:43:27.599 --> 00:43:28.069 align:start position:0%
income earned on holding stock so if the
federal

00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
tax rate encourages taxpayers to hold on
 
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
to their stock longer rather than
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
sell it presumably you could see an
 
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
impact on the ind tax which i'm
 
00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:39.990 align:start position:0%
impact on the ind tax which i'm
presuming

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
presuming
 
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
would be a positive impact um
 
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
but i don't know that we've we've
 
00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
certainly not looked at it before and i
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
would have to think
 
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
long and hard about whether we could do
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
any predictive work
 
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
to try to estimate that impact
 
00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i just uh thank you i i believe
 
00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
that that capital gains
 
00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
tax proposal is uh
 
00:44:13.829 --> 00:44:13.839 align:start position:0%
related only to taxpayers with very high
 
00:44:13.839 --> 00:44:14.870 align:start position:0%
related only to taxpayers with very high
incomes

00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
incomes
 
00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
in other words there's a different
 
00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.150 align:start position:0%
in other words there's a different
threshold

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
this part of the package so
 
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
just take that into account um and then
 
00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
of course the other point is that
 
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh that as far as individuals are
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
concerned we don't tax
 
00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
capital gains and
 
00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps the buying and selling of stock
 
00:44:37.589 --> 00:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
would be triggered by
 
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
the federal action but as
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
i say it's limited to some individuals
 
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
who have other ways of making their
 
00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:45.030 align:start position:0%
who have other ways of making their
money

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
and uh so i'm not so sure that would be
 
00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
the case
 
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
further questions or comments on the
 
00:44:59.349 --> 00:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
okay melissa you can continue okay
 
00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
um moving on to cst or the communication
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
services tax this is again a tax that we
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
have not
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
um felt the need to update since we last
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
presented to you because it's ahead
 
00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
performed as we anticipated
 
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to date through april um or
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
a hundred million or
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
point three percent below plan so
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
basically at plan
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
and um four hundred thousand or one
 
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
point two percent ahead of prior year
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
this tax can be affected by the new
 
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire unemployment rate
 
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
taxability of video conferencing and the
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
increased use of product as well as
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
decreased use of voip
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
so as i said our estimate has remained
 
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
the same at 39.1 million
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
this is a loss of 2 for the remaining
 
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
months of the year
 
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
and then we keep this tax flat for
 
00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
22 and 23.
 
00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty consistent tax month over
 
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
can you speak more to the taxability of
 
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
sure so i think we're still at the same
 
00:46:08.069 --> 00:46:08.079 align:start position:0%
point that we discussed
 
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
a month ago if if that's what you're
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
when we say taxability video
 
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
conferencing we're talking about some
 
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
applications like we're using today
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
those are taxable under the
 
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
communication services tax and obviously
 
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
in higher demand and higher use since
 
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
our audit division is working on making
 
00:46:32.069 --> 00:46:32.079 align:start position:0%
sure taxpayers are paying taxes
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we'll make sure everyone's
 
00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:42.079 align:start position:0%
in compliance
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
you seen much evidence
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
of a number
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
of clients not compliance on this
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
video conferencing tax
 
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
i think again it's a little bit too
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
early to know that audit is doing a
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
project on it
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
um so they will eventually have more
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
information if they can share it based
 
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
on the number of taxpayers but
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
um when they file the return it's not
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
broken out onto
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
what area is being taxed it's just a
 
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
number as a whole so it takes some
 
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
digging to see
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
if they are charging tax on it
 
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
well that's a statement that comes up
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
all the time doesn't it
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
sure does oh representatives you still
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
have your hand
 
00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:32.559 align:start position:0%
up no no i'm sorry
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh any further questions on the
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:44.069 --> 00:47:44.079 align:start position:0%
okay melissa okay real estate transfer
 
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
tax again this is a tax we did not
 
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
update our estimate from when we were
 
00:47:48.549 --> 00:47:48.559 align:start position:0%
last here because
 
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
it had performed as we expected in april
 
00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
and in may
 
00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:54.079 align:start position:0%
i think we're starting to figure out a
 
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
little bit which is nice uh fiscal year
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
to date
 
00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
we through april were 37 million or
 
00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
or 28.2 ahead of plan and 30.2 million
 
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
or 21.9
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
ahead of prior year as we've stated
 
00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:09.839 align:start position:0%
several times
 
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to date amounts are net of a
 
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
5 million transfer to the affordable
 
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
housing fund
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
it's new this year so when you're
 
00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
comparing it to prior year
 
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
you should add back that five million um
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
to get sort of an apples to apples
 
00:48:22.079 --> 00:48:23.829 align:start position:0%
to get sort of an apples to apples
comparison

00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:23.839 align:start position:0%
comparison
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
with real estate transfer tax um it's
 
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
important to look at mortgage interest
 
00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
interest rates in how they're performing
 
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
they have been at a historical low we do
 
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
know that they've bumped
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
up in the last month or so not by a ton
 
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
but something
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
definitely keeping an eye on other
 
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
factors are virtual home
 
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
sales and available housing and property
 
00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:47.510 align:start position:0%
sales and available housing and property
value

00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
value
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
as well as inventory shortage cost of
 
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
building supplies
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
and a lower affordability factor so we
 
00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:54.069 align:start position:0%
and a lower affordability factor so we
know

00:48:54.069 --> 00:48:54.079 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
all of these really make this this tax
 
00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:57.510 align:start position:0%
all of these really make this this tax
go

00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
up and down so we know that home prices
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
have gone
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
through the roof especially with
 
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
available housing
 
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
being low people are paying much more
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
for homes and actually paying cash for
 
00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:09.750 align:start position:0%
for homes and actually paying cash for
homes

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
homes
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
than they had in the past however there
 
00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
what we do
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
keep an eye on is that affordability
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
factor because
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
if you have high home prices and low
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
interest rates you can afford more but
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
if those interest rates start to go
 
00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
up and home prices keep going up what
 
00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:28.559 align:start position:0%
someone can afford definitely decreases
 
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
and that can affect the amount of
 
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
transactions that occur
 
00:49:36.349 --> 00:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
so for fiscal year 21 we have a range of
 
00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.079 align:start position:0%
201.5 million
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
this assumes the fiscal year to date
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
percentage over plan of 28
 
00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
is maintained through the end of the
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
year and our tie is 205.7 million
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
and this assumes the fiscal year date
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
percentage over plan increases to 30
 
00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:53.670 align:start position:0%
percentage over plan increases to 30
percent

00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 22 we have a low
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
of negative seven percent and a high of
 
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
a negative two percent
 
00:50:04.549 --> 00:50:04.559 align:start position:0%
the negative seven percent assumes that
 
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year is going to continue
 
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
strong and then it's slowly going to
 
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:10.559 align:start position:0%
taper off to performance less than we
 
00:50:14.790 --> 00:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
and that's for the negative seven to
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
negative two percent and then fiscal
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
year 23 we have a range of negative 10
 
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
percent to negative 8
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
again we assume historical trends were
 
00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:25.430 align:start position:0%
again we assume historical trends were
maintained

00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
maintained
 
00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 2020 through 2022 so
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
essentially removing this
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
this um peak that we have seen with real
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
estate transfer tax
 
00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
and the spike in the housing market and
 
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
that does fall in line with the
 
00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
economist predictions that 2023 will
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
start to
 
00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
um have a lower decline compared to 22
 
00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chairman
 
00:50:59.829 --> 00:50:59.839 align:start position:0%
um i was just wondering when you
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
estimate your ranges
 
00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
um do you take potential inflation into
 
00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:05.829 align:start position:0%
um do you take potential inflation into
account

00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:05.839 align:start position:0%
account
 
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
as there is a concern that inflation may
 
00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:09.190 align:start position:0%
as there is a concern that inflation may
increase

00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
um in the next in the coming years
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
is inflation part i guess is the
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
inflation factor a part of the
 
00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
range uh we have not specifically looked
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
at inflation and applying it to our
 
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
estimate ranges
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:36.549 --> 00:51:36.559 align:start position:0%
so the fy23
 
00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
it's more so that the housing bubble is
 
00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
coming down
 
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
because the interest rates are going up
 
00:51:50.069 --> 00:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
less houses are sold and prices are
 
00:51:50.079 --> 00:51:51.750 align:start position:0%
less houses are sold and prices are
probably

00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
is that the main contributor yeah i the
 
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
way we modeled out fiscal year 23
 
00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
is we took 21 out of the picture
 
00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:09.839 align:start position:0%
so where would we be if we started um
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
with 20 and if we continued to grow
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
because real estate transfer has a
 
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.589 align:start position:0%
because real estate transfer has a
pretty

00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
standard growth rate over the last
 
00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
couple of years so if you took that
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
standard growth rate from fiscal year 20
 
00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
and grew it to fiscal year 23 what would
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
that look like
 
00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
and that brought us to that negative 10
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
to negative 8
 
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
because we don't think that the market
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
will maintain where it has been with the
 
00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:36.390 align:start position:0%
will maintain where it has been with the
2021

00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
2021
 
00:52:38.549 --> 00:52:38.559 align:start position:0%
spike up with all the factors that have
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
come in with again the real estate
 
00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
market being um really hot interest
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
rates being really low
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
and what has happened is i'm sure you've
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
all read in the news is that the
 
00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
inventory shortage have shrunk as well
 
00:52:53.589 --> 00:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
as cost of building supplies
 
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
and getting people to build homes has
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
also reduced so that
 
00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
inventory is starting to fall at
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
historical lows
 
00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
um so at some point we think it's going
 
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
to catch up
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
and um not have enough
 
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
housing available which would decrease
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
decrease the home prices as well as
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
decrease the transaction amounts and get
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
us back to the normal
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh representative
 
00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:22.870 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh representative
brownlee

00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
brownlee
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chair uh listen this
 
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
is a random thought i had here as you're
 
00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:27.349 align:start position:0%
is a random thought i had here as you're
talking

00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
talking
 
00:53:29.109 --> 00:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
you know we all we all look at that
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
revenue focus at the end of
 
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
every month um and that's put out by
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
that puts that out administrative
 
00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:37.349 align:start position:0%
that puts that out administrative
services

00:53:37.349 --> 00:53:37.359 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
yep uh but
 
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
i think you guys do you guys provide
 
00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:44.309 align:start position:0%
i think you guys do you guys provide
input

00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
input
 
00:53:47.589 --> 00:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
into how to spread how to spread the
 
00:53:47.599 --> 00:53:48.470 align:start position:0%
into how to spread how to spread the
revenues

00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh especially in a year that may be
 
00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
different than
 
00:53:55.109 --> 00:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
past years like this tax for instance
 
00:53:58.309 --> 00:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
may have a different pattern of uh
 
00:54:01.589 --> 00:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
uh you know because you were saying you
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
know if
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
by the by the second half of the year
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
the number of transactions would be less
 
00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:08.230 align:start position:0%
the number of transactions would be less
than

00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh then the first half of the year which
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
may be different than
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
the historic trends so do you get to say
 
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
your piece
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
does department of revenue get to work
 
00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
with them to
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
come up with the way to spread the
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
estimates across the 12 months
 
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
yeah great question representative brown
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
we sure do so
 
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
essentially das sends us our revenues
 
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
and asks that asks us to
 
00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
spread them out over the 12 months and
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
we do look at information like that we
 
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
look at historical trends we look at how
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
it performed the prior year
 
00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
we remove any anomalies that we know
 
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
occurred in different months that may
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
spike up a percentage of revenue in a
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
specific month
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
and then we may also make adjustments to
 
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
situations like this where
 
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
where we may see a spike up in the first
 
00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
six months and then a decrease in the
 
00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
next six months
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
and then we submit that to das for
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
approval okay that's good to know thank
 
00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:02.630 align:start position:0%
approval okay that's good to know thank
you

00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:14.069 --> 00:55:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
all right i believe this is our last tax
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
utility property tax
 
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
um we did adjust this down some fiscal
 
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
year to date
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
through april we're down 2.6 million or
 
00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
7.8 percent below plan
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
and 1.8 million or 5.6 below
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
prior year um we did want to note that
 
00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:34.799 align:start position:0%
in april we did see a decline in revenue
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
compared to prior year
 
00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
in plan and this was essentially due to
 
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
some credits on file
 
00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
and due to decreased valuations compared
 
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
to prior years
 
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
so we have the next month being down at
 
00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:48.870 align:start position:0%
so we have the next month being down at
10

00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
10
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
and that is because valuations that came
 
00:55:52.789 --> 00:55:52.799 align:start position:0%
in in january
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
were down 10 compared to the prior year
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
and just a little bit information for
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
those of you that are not familiar how
 
00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:00.309 align:start position:0%
those of you that are not familiar how
upt

00:56:00.309 --> 00:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
upt
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
works essentially taxpayers make
 
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
quarterly estimate payments based on
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
their last valuation
 
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
and then in january they true up those
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
payments compared to their new
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
assessment value
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
so if they paid if their assessment
 
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
value went more they end up with more
 
00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:17.190 align:start position:0%
value went more they end up with more
funds

00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
on file which essentially creates a
 
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
credit and then they
 
00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
use those up pretty quick and that's
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
what we saw in april some utilization of
 
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
those credits
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh other factors to consider with this
 
00:56:30.069 --> 00:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
tax is some
 
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
property properties may decline in value
 
00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
due to changes in economic conditions
 
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
or may uh sometimes get adjusted if
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
there's new taxable
 
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
property that may be constructed and it
 
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
does appear that upt
 
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
was not impacted by the coven 19
 
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
economic crisis
 
00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
with that information fiscal year 21
 
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
our new number is 40.6 million
 
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
and then again we have the tax slat for
 
00:56:59.829 --> 00:56:59.839 align:start position:0%
22 and 23.
 
00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
okay melissa continue
 
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
okay and then lastly we have our revised
 
00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates this is sort of just
 
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
a one-page cheat sheet with fiscal year
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
21 having the anomalous receivable
 
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
removed and it just sums up all our
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
highs and lows ring
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
high and low ranges for 22 and 23
 
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
and then lastly we have our colorful
 
00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh a colorful comparison
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
sheet on the left we have our fiscal
 
00:57:39.829 --> 00:57:39.839 align:start position:0%
year 20 audited revenue for reference we
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
have fiscal year 21 plan
 
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
we then have the governor's and your
 
00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
estimates which had pre-march data
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
we have those filled in and then we have
 
00:57:51.119 --> 00:57:51.829 align:start position:0%
we have those filled in and then we have
senate's

00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
senate's
 
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
newest estimates that were done on
 
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:54.870 align:start position:0%
newest estimates that were done on
monday

00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
monday
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
that includes april data and it has our
 
00:57:57.839 --> 00:57:58.230 align:start position:0%
that includes april data and it has our
hour

00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
hour
 
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
high and low that we just went over and
 
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
then we have this for 22 and 23.
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
we always like to know on this chart
 
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
it's more important to pay attention to
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
the percentages
 
00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
growth for our low and high versus the
 
00:58:12.069 --> 00:58:12.079 align:start position:0%
actual number because
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
those percentages growth vary based on
 
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
what your base is for fiscal year 21
 
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
and then same with 23 focus on the
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
percentages because it depends on what
 
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
your base is for
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
2022. this is a great job
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
why do you include this the wealth of
 
00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:34.829 align:start position:0%
why do you include this the wealth of
information

00:58:34.829 --> 00:58:34.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:34.839 --> 00:58:46.230 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to send this to us aren't
 
00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
you and i think
 
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
it sounds like chris is out of business
 
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
at the moment
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
by jen jensen it came in last night
 
00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
you didn't get a
 
00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
thanks i'm trying
 
00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
in the meantime further questions from
 
00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
the committee members on any of the
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%

devin

00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
devin
 
00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
i don't think so i think melissa did a
 
00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
great job
 
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's a good great team with the bra
 
01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:12.829 --> 01:00:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:12.839 --> 01:00:14.230 align:start position:0%
 
add

01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
add
 
01:00:19.589 --> 01:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
since we're gonna do our actual revenue
 
01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
estimates on june 8th
 
01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
we'll have may data uh which would
 
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
probably be helpful
 
01:00:30.069 --> 01:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
i guess i would just ask the department
 
01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
of revenue
 
01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
not to redo what they did but if there's
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
anything they see
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
when maze finalized that they think is
 
01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
noteworthy that just pass it along to us
 
01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
before as we do our january was it
 
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
eighth you said
 
01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:48.799 align:start position:0%
no january not january
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:55.349 --> 01:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
yes i'm sure we'll be with you on june
 
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
8th at least in the audience and we'll
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
be happy to share any
 
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
new or helpful information that we have
 
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
based on how
 
01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:05.839 align:start position:0%
may performs on june 8 we'll have both
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
the lba and the
 
01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
dre the lba could not be with us
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
today or will not be available next week
 
01:01:17.829 --> 01:01:17.839 align:start position:0%
because they're finishing up
 
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
in the budget with the senate so that's
 
01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.150 align:start position:0%
in the budget with the senate so that's
why

01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
push this out to the eighth
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative me followed by
 
01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
representative southwood
 
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
so i just went on spent the time i
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
should have been looking at my email
 
01:01:33.599 --> 01:01:34.390 align:start position:0%
should have been looking at my email
again

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
on going through all of the latest may
 
01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:38.870 align:start position:0%
on going through all of the latest may
data

01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
and i think that uh the dra has just
 
01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
given us just everything that
 
01:01:50.789 --> 01:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
uh that you could consider had changed
 
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
so far and we're pretty close to the end
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
of may at this point but
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
i i do agree that
 
01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
that if there's another few surprises we
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
ought to know about it
 
01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:06.799 align:start position:0%
thanks representative salisbury
 
01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman a point of
 
01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
order it seems obvious i guess but
 
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
they'll be taking our revenue estimates
 
01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
subtracting the surplus statement if
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
most of it is negative
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
then that will give new figures that
 
01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully would
 
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
match the finance committee's budget
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
i just haven't seen a chart before that
 
01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:27.829 align:start position:0%
i just haven't seen a chart before that
showed

01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
showed
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
the surplus statement subtracted that
 
01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
way i bring it up because i'm still
 
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
finding many of my constituents are
 
01:02:36.789 --> 01:02:36.799 align:start position:0%
reading on the paper about the
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
great revenues and they aren't really
 
01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.069 align:start position:0%
great revenues and they aren't really
understanding

01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
and that's why they are electing you as
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
their state representative
 
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
so you could inform them yes i've been
 
01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:58.630 align:start position:0%
so you could inform them yes i've been
trying

01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
okay any other comments from any
 
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
then what we will do on the 8th
 
01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039 align:start position:0%
we'll have the dra and
 
01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
along with the lba
 
01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:19.839 align:start position:0%
will also have the final numbers from
 
01:03:19.839 --> 01:03:20.470 align:start position:0%
will also have the final numbers from
the

01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
senate on their budget with their
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
surplus statement so be we'll be able to
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
have that as a comparison
 
01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
and then we'll consider all of this on
 
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:38.069 --> 01:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
any further questions or comments mr
 
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry go ahead yeah shouldn't we
 
01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
take a look
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
at the
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
department of safety estimates for the
 
01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
i think that they had estimated
 
01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
somewhat rosier but i haven't been able
 
01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
to find
 
01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
their month to on
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
on estimates of what the road toll was
 
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
going to come
 
01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
come in at but as i recall them
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
they thought that we'd be closer than we
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
are now
 
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
to 2019 we are
 
01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh the latest week came down to
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
to negative three percent but
 
01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
two weeks before that it was still at
 
01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
negative 10.
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
who was going to bring in all the other
 
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
agency heads
 
01:04:45.270 --> 01:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
and review their revenues and see what's
 
01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:45.910 align:start position:0%
and review their revenues and see what's
changed

01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
changed
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
and if we need to make any changes
 
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
and on the eighth that may
 
01:04:58.950 --> 01:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
but anything else if not i i'm
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
this is nothing else and thank everybody
 
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
for attending this morning
 
01:05:13.589 --> 01:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
thank you and thanks
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
to the dra for another excellent job i
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
it was interesting information
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
and no meeting tomorrow mr chairman
 
01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
