00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.030 align:start position:0%
committee that we have hearings this

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
friday
 
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
and those are all
 
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 align:start position:0%
on friday we should be prepared to
 
00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 align:start position:0%
execute as many of those bills as we can
 
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
we'll have to do it no later than the
 
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
following tuesday
 
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
so please read those those bills in
 
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
particular and if you think there are
 
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.229 align:start position:0%
particular and if you think there are
issues

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
spread the word the only one i know
 
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
about is the study committee on funding
 
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.869 align:start position:0%
about is the study committee on funding
oplc

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
and i have an amendment to delete that
 
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
and combine it with the other study
 
00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 align:start position:0%
committee we have on how to run the oplc
 
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't make sense to have
 
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
two of them
 
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
particularly since they'd probably
 
00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 align:start position:0%
picked the same people to serve on both
 
00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 align:start position:0%
those committees
 
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
so it being 10 o'clock i'm opening the
 
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
hearing on senate bill 223 and i call
 
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
i hope everyone is having a great day
 
00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 align:start position:0%
it's early i understand but always great
 
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
to see you this august body and it's a
 
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
privilege and a pleasure to appear
 
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
before you as the prime sponsor of
 
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
senate bill 223
 
00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
relative to the requirements for
 
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
recovery housing
 
00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh years ago i i sponsored an initial
 
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation that talked about
 
00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 align:start position:0%
recovery housing and
 
00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 align:start position:0%
it was in reaction to the problems that
 
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
had surfaced both in manchester and
 
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me in the city of franklin with
 
00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
regard to recovery housing so we had to
 
00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
get a wrap our arms around recovery
 
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
housing and make sure that it was really
 
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
recovery housing
 
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh format police chief of manchester
 
00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 align:start position:0%
dave mara came to me and the
 
00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 align:start position:0%
requirements that were initially
 
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
suggested were too stringent in terms of
 
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
the square footage
 
00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
so this piece of legislation
 
00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 align:start position:0%
is meant to adjust the square footage so
 
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
that it meets the national standard
 
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.070 align:start position:0%
that it meets the national standard
and

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
is applicable to all of the recovery
 
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
housing in new hampshire
 
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
so after the implementation of house
 
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
bill 377 which resulted in rsa 153 colon
 
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.589 align:start position:0%
bill 377 which resulted in rsa 153 colon

10-d
 
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
it was discovered that the 200 square
 
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
feet per resident requirement is too
 
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
restrictive 200 square feet is too
 
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.390 align:start position:0%
restrictive 200 square feet is too
restrictive

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
restrictive
 
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
the 200 square feet per person standard
 
00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 align:start position:0%
is required for single family homes
 
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
the national association of recovery
 
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
residences standard is 50 square feet
 
00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
per person in each sleeping room this
 
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
standard is consistent with the state's
 
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
building code for dormitory occupancy
 
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
load that in essence is is the structure
 
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
of the piece of legislation
 
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
and the 50 square feet
 
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
meets that meets the national standard
 
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
the 200 square feet was was a little bit
 
00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
more than was required
 
00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.949 align:start position:0%
more than was required
uh

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
that that's the corpus of the bill
 
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
that's the intent of the bill that's the
 
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
rationale for the bill
 
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh we need the recovery housing
 
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
obviously uh we we know
 
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
what's happening in our communities
 
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.789 align:start position:0%
what's happening in our communities
and

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 align:start position:0%
i've been to many of these recovery
 
00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
houses i've visited them with the police
 
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
chief and the fire chief
 
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
in manchester and i see that the fire
 
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
marshal was here looks good by the way
 
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
nice new haircut congratulations and uh
 
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
wonderful to see you
 
00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
thank you and that's that's the
 
00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:53.439 align:start position:0%
rationale for the bill mountain gym and
 
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
i appreciate a positive vote on this as
 
00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 align:start position:0%
it it makes sense uh we're just doing
 
00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
good things for the communities and
 
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
we're arriving at a
 
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
a principle that that is enforceable and
 
00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 align:start position:0%
it's it's usable uh and it it's uh
 
00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 align:start position:0%
it meets the national standard so i
 
00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.229 align:start position:0%
it meets the national standard so i
appreciate

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 align:start position:0%

thank you representative schmidt has a
 
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.390 align:start position:0%
thank you representative schmidt has a
question

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair good morning
 
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
senator uh so was there any opposition
 
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
or is there any opposition
 
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
either from
 
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
god knows where or
 
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
in the hearing in the senate
 
00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt thank you so much
 
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh this is one of the pieces of
 
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
legislation a rarity i might say in this
 
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
new world that we live in
 
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
there is there has been no opposition it
 
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
it uh i think it's well received by all
 
00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 align:start position:0%
of the parties the individuals involved
 
00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 align:start position:0%
uh and by those who are in the recovery
 
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh business by the fire marshal i'm sure
 
00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
he's here to support it by our local
 
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
fire chief in the city of manchester and
 
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
for all of those uh who were involved
 
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
and that's as i say that's a rarity in
 
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh senator i have a question
 
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.310 align:start position:0%
thank you uh senator i have a question
yes

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
the previous requirement was
 
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
essentially per the house 200 square
 
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
feet of house per resident this is
 
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
purely for bedroom space yes
 
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
so there this says that there doesn't
 
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
need to be any
 
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
and there's no restriction or limitation
 
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
on how much space there is other than in
 
00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
the bedrooms is that correct
 
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
yes as i understand it that that's
 
00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 align:start position:0%
that's the way it is
 
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that's a little weird but
 
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair that that was
 
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
exactly my same question
 
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.070 align:start position:0%
exactly my same question
um

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
i'm going to
 
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
continue on that line and
 
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
ask you
 
00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 align:start position:0%
since i i really don't know much about
 
00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
recovery houses we don't have any in
 
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.270 align:start position:0%
recovery houses we don't have any in
holiness

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
holiness
 
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.230 align:start position:0%
holiness
but

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.510 align:start position:0%
but
my

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 align:start position:0%
best understanding is that it supports
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a supportive environment
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
for people recovering from probably some
 
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
kind of addiction
 
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
and that what i read in the papers is
 
00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like a family
 
00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
model and people have chores and and
 
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
they need
 
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
space to act like a family
 
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.990 align:start position:0%
space to act like a family
and

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
maybe if we if this amendment if we if
 
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
we have that but also put back in
 
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
some amount of space i don't know if it
 
00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:43.759 align:start position:0%
has to be what is it
 
00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
200 but some amount of space for the
 
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
congregate area otherwise you could have
 
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
a home that's just like a row of
 
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
bedrooms with no
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
no kitchen no living room no
 
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
space for them to get together and
 
00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:03.919 align:start position:0%
talk uh i think first of all thank you
 
00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
very much for your comments yeah that's
 
00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:07.759 align:start position:0%
a good point i've visited many of these
 
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
sites and they do have a a congregate
 
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
area and they do have an area with where
 
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
they cook now i don't know if that's
 
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
specified it isn't specified in the law
 
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about in the law is
 
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
just the
 
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
the the minute of the the amount of
 
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
the gross amount of square feet per bed
 
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
for a sleeping room but the amenities
 
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
that are associated with recovery
 
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
housing i think they appear in the in
 
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
in the buildings that i have visited
 
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
there was a living room area there was a
 
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
cooking area all right there were
 
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
there's a bathroom area i mean all of
 
00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:45.919 align:start position:0%
this all of this was was was available i
 
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
i think the fact that that 200 square
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
feet was required rather than the 50
 
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
square feet gave rise to the fact that
 
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
you were creating problems because of
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
the size of the entity this this
 
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
addresses it and addresses what what you
 
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
have uh are articulated the fact that
 
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
this is a recovery situation it's an
 
00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity for for people to recover
 
00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
you know and to have some social
 
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
environment that that's there
 
00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:08:17.749 --> 00:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
the problem that that i witnessed was uh
 
00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
some of these things weren't being
 
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
handled as properly as they they should
 
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
and i think we're we have a better
 
00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:25.039 align:start position:0%
handle on that now and we're doing a
 
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
better job that this helps in in terms
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
of uh meeting meeting the requirement
 
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
and also providing what what you have uh
 
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
have mentioned that there's got to be a
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
way to socially interact so that you so
 
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
that recovery is enhanced and and it
 
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
isn't you know it's not
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
it's not set aside it's a positive
 
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
situation that brings support and social
 
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
interaction is very important as far as
 
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
that's concerned thank you thank you uh
 
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.670 align:start position:0%
that's concerned thank you thank you uh
follow-up

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.710 align:start position:0%
follow-up
so

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
do you think you might be agreeable if
 
00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
we um
 
00:09:01.829 --> 00:09:01.839 align:start position:0%
we used what what is written here
 
00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
but we also
 
00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
um we move that to be a new item and
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
then amend
 
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
the one of the
 
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
total square footage to be something
 
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.990 align:start position:0%
total square footage to be something
less

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
less
 
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there is that
 
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
congregate area
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
i have no suggestion off the top of my
 
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
head what that would be yeah i i mean i
 
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
first of all thank you for comments i i
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
don't have a i mean i don't have a
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
problem with that i think uh that's
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
something you would expect
 
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
in a recovery house
 
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
uh so if if it's if it's implicit or or
 
00:09:40.949 --> 00:09:40.959 align:start position:0%
or it has to be uh in the statute i i
 
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
don't i don't have a concern
 
00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
with that i just wonder what
 
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
i just wonder if it's needed
 
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
but but
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you we'll have to consider
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
whether this is the appropriate place
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes and then grota
 
00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question so
 
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm looking up real fast
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
to see
 
00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:07.839 align:start position:0%
what the size of
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
a jail cell is and i
 
00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
on a quick look um i i think that this
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
actually might be be smaller
 
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
of what an actual jail cell would be and
 
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
with that my question is do you know
 
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
how many bedrooms would be
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
like is there a
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
is there a maximum number of bedrooms
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to be because i my
 
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839 align:start position:0%
concern is are you are you now taking
 
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
people that may need
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
space if you will room to breathe and
 
00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:38.069 align:start position:0%
space if you will room to breathe and
and

00:10:38.069 --> 00:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
compacting them into a
 
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
living environment where anxiety is
 
00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:43.839 align:start position:0%
really high and then you're going to put
 
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
them in a
 
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
space that is
 
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
basically the size of a jail cell if not
 
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.230 align:start position:0%
basically the size of a jail cell if not
smaller

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
the facility shall have a minimum 50
 
00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
gross square feet
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
i haven't been in many jail cells so i i
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
really mean either i had to look at it i
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
really can't comment but but but indeed
 
00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.870 align:start position:0%
really can't comment but but but indeed
uh

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
in in the jail cell as i understand it
 
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
you have the facility you know the the
 
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
the bathroom facility and so forth so
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
there's and there are usually two two in
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
a cell because of the problem with with
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
the number of people that we have to
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
take care of so i don't think that that
 
00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:26.839 align:start position:0%
that's a good analogy
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
but the 50 square feet is is the
 
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
standard that's that that the national
 
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
association of recovery residences say
 
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
it's the standard so there's a standard
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
that has been set and we're we're trying
 
00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:43.519 align:start position:0%
to adhere to the standard by saying
 
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
we'll have a minimum of 50 gross square
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
feet per bed in the in the sleeping room
 
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
and i think we're trying to beat the
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
standard so that so that there's
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
something that everyone everyone can
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
adhere to by by creating a standard
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
and uh as a result that gives the
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
oversight an opportunity to have
 
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
something to to compare it to when they
 
00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
visit these these these stay these uh
 
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
safe houses you got to have a standard i
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
think what what happened there was so
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
much of a variation in the way they were
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
being handled that they caused problems
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
but i appreciate it your standard
 
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
old-fashioned suburban bedroom of 8 by
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
10 is 64 square feet so it's it easily
 
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
meets this
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
representative grota and then o'brien
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
senator d'alessandro i believe that the
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.910 align:start position:0%
that this
bill

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
refers to
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
the bedrooms because this is a fire code
 
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
bill correct
 
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
this is for the for the fire code
 
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i i yes yes
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
the fire code's an important issue and
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
the fire marshal's here to address that
 
00:12:59.190 --> 00:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
right so and that's the that's what
 
00:13:01.269 --> 00:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
we're trying to change now
 
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
and i'm just
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
before we make any other changes to the
 
00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.829 align:start position:0%
before we make any other changes to the
bill

00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
we could look at what the requirements
 
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
are for
 
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
in the rsa for
 
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
recovery houses because
 
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
the fire code
 
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
i would think that the fire code for the
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
recovery houses is different than the
 
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
standard for the rest of the facility
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your question but i
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
think the the fire marshal could address
 
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.629 align:start position:0%
think the the fire marshal could address
that

00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
more comprehensively than i and he
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
that's what he's here for i believe
 
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome representative
 
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.829 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome representative
o'brien

00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:37.839 align:start position:0%
o'brien
 
00:13:39.509 --> 00:13:39.519 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
senator looking at
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
section 153 semicolon 10-d exemption for
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
recovery houses
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
many of the questions that i'm hearing
 
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
seem to be already covered
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
basic statute and everything and
 
00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
so which leads me to think that
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
basically all we're really talking about
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
is the sleeping quarters per se for the
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
individual because if not in these
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
recovery houses do these people are they
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
encouraged to go out maybe get other
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
type of jobs or different other things
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
they may not be hanging around the
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
recovery house for the full day they
 
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
have uh let's say in the example of a an
 
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
a.a meeting to go to maybe several that
 
00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
you know they may not be there at that
 
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:30.160 align:start position:0%
full a lot of time
 
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your quality yes that's
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
exactly right it's it's a it's a place
 
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
for them to be but they should have a
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
job that's the name of the game get a
 
00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
job enhance your recovery so that you
 
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
can get out of here and get into
 
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chairman thank you
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question am i
 
00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
correct that this is an rsa 153 because
 
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
all this is is an exception to the fire
 
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
codes so that we can put more people
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
into recovery houses in order to
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
accommodate the demand for services and
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
that these are in fact not licensed
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
facilities and therefore there are no
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
other requirements for these facilities
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you thank you for your
 
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
comments i believe that's correct
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
thank you yes there are quite a few
 
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
things in the requirements for recovery
 
00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
houses other questions oh senate
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
representative schuett
 
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
i'll just expand slightly on what
 
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
representative marsh said and
 
00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
call attention to the fact that the
 
00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:38.959 align:start position:0%
language says
 
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
gross square feet per bed per sleeping
 
00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.389 align:start position:0%
gross square feet per bed per sleeping
room

00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
room
 
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
not the entire sleeping room but per bed
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that that would be
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
the space
 
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
for this individual's like individual
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
living quarters
 
00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
in perhaps like a dormitory type setting
 
00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.749 align:start position:0%
in perhaps like a dormitory type setting
yes

00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
i got that impression and i will and i
 
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
will correct myself and an 8 by 10 room
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
is 80 square feet i was thinking by
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
eight room so yes it it depends on how
 
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
the room is arranged but uh having
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
shared rooms of that size most of my
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
childhood it's
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
you you do need other spaces does anyone
 
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
else have questions for senator
 
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
d'alessandro representative judy
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
i know kovari houses is temporarily
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
so what about if that person have uh
 
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:41.590 align:start position:0%
so what about if that person have uh
children

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
well that's a
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's a good question uh
 
00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
the i i don't think the recovery houses
 
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
were were meant for families
 
00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:56.079 align:start position:0%
i i think they're for individuals
 
00:16:56.079 --> 00:16:56.790 align:start position:0%
i i think they're for individuals
uh

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
now now families in transition
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
is another component that we have in
 
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
manchester which is for families who are
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
making that transition but but i believe
 
00:17:08.309 --> 00:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
that the recovery house is for an
 
00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:09.829 align:start position:0%
that the recovery house is for an
individual

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:10.870 align:start position:0%
individual
okay

00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
all right thank you other questions for
 
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
senator representative bailey
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:17:17.039 --> 00:17:17.990 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
senator

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
this will be a simple one hopefully i'm
 
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
familiar with the term square feet how
 
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
does the adjective gross
 
00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
alter that if at all
 
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
i i don't think it
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know to be honest with you i
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
think gross gross square feet
 
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
includes the
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
the the the number of square feet in the
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
area now maybe the fire marshal can
 
00:17:41.679 --> 00:17:42.549 align:start position:0%
area now maybe the fire marshal can
address

00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
that question specifically but i'm but
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that gross square feet
 
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
means gross square feet that's the
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
amount of square feet that's available
 
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
in that particular area
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
before a subtraction of some sort well
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
yeah before a subtraction of some sort
 
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
but because that would be adjusted
 
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
the adjusted gross if indeed that were
 
00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:07.039 align:start position:0%
the case
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
 
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:11.990 align:start position:0%
all right
you

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
thinks a one-line bill would would be
 
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
easier to pretend wouldn't you
 
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh other questions for the senator
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
c don thank you very much thank you very
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:36.070 align:start position:0%

and

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
committee for the record representative
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
jeff goalie representing hillsborough 8
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
manchester ward 1 and i was not going to
 
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
speak but i'm just going to help try and
 
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
clarify some of the things that are
 
00:18:48.789 --> 00:18:48.799 align:start position:0%
going on here
 
00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
this is just one piece of the exemptions
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
for recovery housing you have to go
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
through and look at
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
like representative o'brien pointed out
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
the full context of rsa 153 colon 10d
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
that deals with exemptions for recovery
 
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.110 align:start position:0%
that deals with exemptions for recovery
houses

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
houses
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
because in there you will see i mean
 
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
this just deals with the sleeping
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
quarters not the living quarters the
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
sleeping quarters
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
there's still everything else in there
 
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.590 align:start position:0%
there's still everything else in there
and

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
properly maintained electrical system
 
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
properly maintained heating system
 
00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
properly maintained cooking appliances
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
that is all part of the statute in these
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
recovery houses that's all we're doing
 
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
here is looking at the square footage
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
for sleeping quarters for the individual
 
00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
to sleep in um so it has the support of
 
00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919 align:start position:0%
the fire marshal he's here he can answer
 
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.870 align:start position:0%
any other questions
but

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
i ask that you
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
pass this as is and not get into the
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
weeds because this is just dealing with
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
sleeping quarters
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
nothing else in recovery housing thank
 
00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.190 align:start position:0%
nothing else in recovery housing thank
you

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you at
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
it does appear that the current statute
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
just specifies as square feet per
 
00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:57.830 align:start position:0%
just specifies as square feet per
resident

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
resident
 
00:19:59.830 --> 00:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
and this narrows it down to merely the
 
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
sleeping quarters and that was what the
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
concern was that you're not
 
00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:06.799 align:start position:0%
addressing the other issues but i i
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
agree with you this may not be the right
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
place to put any other requirements
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative goalie do you know i'm
 
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
just curious is there a limit
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
to how many bedrooms are are allowed to
 
00:20:23.909 --> 00:20:23.919 align:start position:0%
be in a re
 
00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
in a sober home or recovery facility
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
i do not but i'm sure the fire marshal
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
can answer that question um who is here
 
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
today okay
 
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
sorry i tried to find it i don't i don't
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
think there's a maximum number as long
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
as you meet
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
the standards of having their proper
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
inspections and fire alarm systems and
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
any of that stuff okay
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
it's also
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
this this section talks about the rules
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
adopted by health and human services so
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
that's maybe where things like that are
 
00:20:57.909 --> 00:20:57.919 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
 
00:20:57.919 --> 00:20:59.990 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
goalie

nonprofit health policy and advocacy
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
organization we've been working for uh
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
more than nearly 25 years to address
 
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
issues of addiction and behavioral
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
health in this state
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
we stand strongly in support of this
 
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
bill as it would help to increase
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
housing access to housing for
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
individuals who are struggling
 
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
struggling uh with substance use
 
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
disorder uh the lack of
 
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
accessible housing in this state remains
 
00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
one of the greatest obstacles for
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
individuals who are looking to obtain a
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
long-term recovery uh this bill is quite
 
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
simple as has been mentioned several
 
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
times this is uh the square footage
 
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
stipulation is just one of many
 
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
provisions of the rsa this is looking to
 
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.350 align:start position:0%
provisions of the rsa this is looking to
uh

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.549 align:start position:0%
uh
to

00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
be able to bring in more recovery
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
housing there are a number of houses and
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
ms bach can speak to this better than i
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
can who are not able to meet the
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
requirement of 200 square feet and
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
specifically in a bedroom that is far in
 
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
excess of the national standard so we're
 
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
looking to bring the uh the square
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
footage requirement into in line with
 
00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:26.559 align:start position:0%
the national standard to be able to help
 
00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:27.919 align:start position:0%
more uh
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
more housing facilities be able to to
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
meet this requirement uh for the uh for
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
the fire codes
 
00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559 align:start position:0%
um thank you for for giving me the time
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
to speak my name is kim bach i'm in the
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
executive director for the new hampshire
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
coalition of recovery residences we
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
don't run any recovery residences we
 
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
certify that the recovery residences
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
meet the national standard as senator
 
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
d'alessandro suggested by the national
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
alliance of recovery residences they
 
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
have 31 standards to meet there are
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
several parts to many of those standards
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
we're looking at many many aspects of
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
the homes so i can address a few of the
 
00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
questions that were asked
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
there is a requirement in this in this
 
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
statute already that to be to get the
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
exemption from the fire marshal the
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
state the house has to achieve nh core
 
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
certification within six months of their
 
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
of their being given the exemption
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
within our standards they have to have
 
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
adequate gathering space for the
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
community to come together as a whole in
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
the living area they have to have a
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
living room that's big enough to seat
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
everybody they have to have a dining
 
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
area that's big enough to seat everybody
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
they have to have a kitchen that's big
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
enough to store everybody's food
 
00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
everybody gets a chance to cook
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
individually or as a group together so
 
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
they have to have common area that they
 
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
can they can all use the bedroom is not
 
00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
a place for somebody to hang out in
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
recovery that just as you wouldn't want
 
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
your teenager hanging out in the bedroom
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
all day and playing game boy because
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
it's detrimental to their mental health
 
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
it's detrimental to somebody to an
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
adult's health as well that's not where
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be hanging out
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
during the day
 
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.549 align:start position:0%
during the day
um

00:24:02.549 --> 00:24:02.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
there was a question asked about
 
00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.350 align:start position:0%
there was a question asked about
children

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
we do have of the 72 houses we have now
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
certified and we've only been around for
 
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
two years so we're moving along on this
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
we do have
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
one house that does accept children but
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
it's um it's a very special program it's
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
hope on haven hill abby's place accepts
 
00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:23.919 align:start position:0%
children and we're very careful about
 
00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
what that looks like and that it's an
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
adequate home-like environment
 
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
that for the women and their infants
 
00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
um i'm trying to think if they were
 
00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
50 square feet
 
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of these
 
00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
houses are
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
older properties in the city so older
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
properties in nashua and if you think
 
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
about as you were suggesting you shared
 
00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:49.039 align:start position:0%
a bedroom when you were young maybe an
 
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
eight by ten bedroom we'd only allow
 
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
one resident in that bedroom
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh but the older houses don't have
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
bedrooms that are that large
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
to get the 200 square feet per person in
 
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
the entire building there was a question
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
is there a limitation on the number of
 
00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
bedrooms that you can have in house it's
 
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
not a limitation on the number of
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
bedrooms but there's a requirement to
 
00:25:09.679 --> 00:25:10.470 align:start position:0%
bedrooms but there's a requirement to
have

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
a full bathroom for every six residents
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
so that does put a limitation on the
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
number of bedrooms i'd be happy to
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
entertain any other questions you might
 
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
have about recovery houses how they
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
achieve certification what the
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
certification requirements are if that's
 
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
helpful for you
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
we're also in favor of this amendment as
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
it follows the national standards
 
00:25:33.269 --> 00:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
i believe you've answered most of the
 
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
previous questions but representative
 
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
schmidt has another one
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.430 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
uh

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
in your response to my question could
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
you just say your name again but but uh
 
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
the question i have is
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
since you have a lot of experience we
 
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
know we've seen you before
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
do you have any written
 
00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:57.039 align:start position:0%
testimony or written documentation to
 
00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
provide the committee and with regard to
 
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
hi my name is kim bach again with the
 
00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire coalition of recovery
 
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
residences and i did not prepare any
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
written statement but i can do that and
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
submit it for you
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
that might be helpful thank you sure
 
00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you miss uh bach uh the question i
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
have is you said you do not run any
 
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
recovery houses but do you actually
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
conduct inspections
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
yes we do you do we do walk-throughs we
 
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
measure the bedrooms we count the
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
bathrooms we're looking at um we're as
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
well as
 
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
as mr toomey's office we are looking at
 
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
safety systems we're checking smoke
 
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
detectors we set them all off we're
 
00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
looking at egresses from every bedroom
 
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that's proper
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
that they have
 
00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
adequate safe
 
00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
ethically run homes
 
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you miss bach other questions
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh representative marsh
 
00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:57.919 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chairman i'm looking
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
at both of these sketches here uh and it
 
00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:01.990 align:start position:0%
at both of these sketches here uh and it
it's

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:03.919 align:start position:0%
can you can you tell me if i'm correct
 
00:27:03.919 --> 00:27:04.870 align:start position:0%
can you can you tell me if i'm correct
because

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
you are voluntarily certifying safe
 
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
houses and it seems to me that what
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
we're doing here is we've created an
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
exemption from the fire code for such
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
safe houses that choose to be
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
voluntarily certified which therefore
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
would not apply to any other safe houses
 
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
which might not choose to be certified
 
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
are there any uncertified state house
 
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
safe houses in new hampshire there's a
 
00:27:26.389 --> 00:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
large number as i said we've only been
 
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
in existence for two years so being up
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
to 72 houses already i feel like we're
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
chugging right along
 
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
but it takes time to get everybody
 
00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.830 align:start position:0%
but it takes time to get everybody
certified

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
certified
 
00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
there's also a restriction on funding
 
00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
availability for
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
recovery houses that's set by dhhs
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
so if you want assistance financial
 
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
assistance in the form of
 
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
rental assistance for people coming in
 
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
you have to be certified
 
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
one one follow-up question um
 
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
since only certified safe houses uh
 
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
can fall into this exemption and your
 
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
certification requires all these various
 
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
other things like a living area in the
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
kitchen and that sort of thing uh would
 
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:12.559 align:start position:0%
it not be true that it would be
 
00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%
unnecessary for us to put those
 
00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
requirements into the fire code
 
00:28:16.399 --> 00:28:17.590 align:start position:0%
requirements into the fire code
exemption

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
i would agree with you i would agree
 
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
with you
 
00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.789 align:start position:0%
with you
yeah

00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
okay if i could add just very briefly
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
with the work that kim and nh core are
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
doing along with work through the new
 
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of health and human
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
services there has been a a broad effort
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
to increase the the regulation and
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
safety protocols around recovery houses
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
and again this is just intended to be a
 
00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
very minor tweak to be able to help uh
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
to help more houses uh be able to secure
 
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
this exemption be able to uh uh
 
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
to be able to conduct safe uh operations
 
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
and to support individuals in recovery
 
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
so again there is a large backdrop here
 
00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
this is just a minor tweak and if i
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
could just reinforce what senator
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
d'alessandro said there's really no
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
opposition to this the homes are on
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
board the the
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
regulators are on board and certainly i
 
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
think i can speak for members of the
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
provider community who feel that this is
 
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
a an important uh way to support
 
00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
recovery housing
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other questions
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
there's no scitec
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh this is the bill seems fine to me but
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
there i've
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
i'm puzzled by something you certify
 
00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
houses but you're not a municipal agency
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
you're not you're not the fire
 
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
department you're not the health officer
 
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
how are you inspect what gives you the
 
00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:33.919 align:start position:0%
right to inspect what does your
 
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
certification mean
 
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
means they can get money from hhs for
 
00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
one thing
 
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
sure that's what she said and i would
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
imagine that's a powerful incentive
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
that's a powerful incentive and we're
 
00:29:48.389 --> 00:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
the state affiliate for the national
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
alliance of recovery residences and
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of houses that come to
 
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
us because they want to advertise that
 
00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
they are doing it right
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
this is an area where abuse can happen
 
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
and having the certification is a really
 
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
powerful tool for them
 
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm all for it but it sounds
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
odd you're a private agency aren't you
 
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
doing it
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
doing a
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
certification that the hhs accepts
 
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
is that that's correct okay great thank
 
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
you that that applies in other things
 
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
too okay other questions
 
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you my name is sean

board of fire control has been actively
 
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
involved in this they also support their
 
00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:50.950 align:start position:0%
involved in this they also support their
change

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
where we kind of landed in this we've
 
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
worked closely with new hampshire corps
 
00:30:55.269 --> 00:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
and recovery communities the fire chiefs
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
and the court officials over the last
 
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
several years and we landed with house
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
bill 377 and that included the 200
 
00:31:02.789 --> 00:31:02.799 align:start position:0%
square feet
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
over since we've implemented it we
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
realized we needed a slight change in a
 
00:31:07.509 --> 00:31:07.519 align:start position:0%
cleanup so
 
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
how we got here in the first place was
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
from the code perspective we look at one
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
or two family homes much like we
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
probably live in or
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
you look into apartments or you look at
 
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
hotels or dorms you look at lodging and
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
rooming and most of these ended up in
 
00:31:24.389 --> 00:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
the classification of lodging and
 
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
rooming and it required more robust fire
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
protection requirements that were a
 
00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
little bit bursting to the recovery uh
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
community and what we learned through
 
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
some federal um cases that went through
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
is that uh if we enforce the uh
 
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
requirements of lodging and rooming on
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
the facilities it would be
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
discriminatory because they're
 
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
considered uh in need of an
 
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
accommodation because they're in
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
recovery so we've we worked closely to
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
try to come up with a reasonable
 
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
solution and we uh codified it through
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
the the statutes in the last through
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
house bill 377 last session and came up
 
00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:02.799 align:start position:0%
with the list the fire marshal's office
 
00:32:05.509 --> 00:32:05.519 align:start position:0%
and myself now could uh
 
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
issue an exemption to if they're
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
properly operating as a recovery health
 
00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:11.919 align:start position:0%
certified through you know following the
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
nars standard following new hampshire
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
core new hampshire corps does the
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
assessment initially we work closely
 
00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
with the local fire departments do
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
inspections and we issue a variance and
 
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
do a visit for each of these facilities
 
00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
the 200 square feet was just too much it
 
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
was going to end up closing a lot of the
 
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
facilities that were in existence and
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
that clearly wasn't necessary we had
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
been in many of the facilities and we
 
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
realized that it was just the 200 was
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
too big
 
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
when we initially did house bill 377
 
00:32:42.149 --> 00:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
we needed a number that would seem
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable and we just didn't want to
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
pull a number out of thin air we used
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
200 square feet because that was what
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
was in residential other than
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
single-family homes uh so we had
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
something we can go to uh that was
 
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
already instead in the the codes
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
building in fire codes without just
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
making a number up because we didn't
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
want to discriminate against people in
 
00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.269 align:start position:0%
want to discriminate against people in
recovery

00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
recovery
 
00:33:06.389 --> 00:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
once as we've processed these almost 72
 
00:33:06.399 --> 00:33:07.350 align:start position:0%
once as we've processed these almost 72
now

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
we're like well this just doesn't this
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't work so we went to the nar
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
standard and then we were we wanted to
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh match it with something that was in
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
the codes the codes now for a dorm
 
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
setting is 50 square feet so that's
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
where we came up with the 50s it matched
 
00:33:23.909 --> 00:33:23.919 align:start position:0%
nicely within our standard it matched
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
nicely with what was already in our
 
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
existing building and fire codes as a
 
00:33:29.669 --> 00:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
dorm for 50 square feet so i hope that
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
provides a little bit of context and
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
background but i think that i mean we
 
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
it has wholesale support um and it's i
 
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
think it's for the betterment of the
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
recovery support in the recovery
 
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
community and happy to answer any
 
00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.830 align:start position:0%
community and happy to answer any
questions

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:33:45.509 --> 00:33:45.519 align:start position:0%
thank you marshall are there any
 
00:33:45.519 --> 00:33:48.470 align:start position:0%
thank you marshall are there any
questions

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:50.549 --> 00:33:50.559 align:start position:0%
yes representative schuett thank you
 
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you mr marshall um
 
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
based on what you just said um
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
would you say
 
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
i i realize the analysis does not say
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
that your office
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
requested this legislation
 
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
but uh recommended would that be a good
 
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
word to use i would feel comfortable
 
00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
saying recommend we were definitely
 
00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
supportive of it we were behind we were
 
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
with the uh governor's office named
 
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
score in our office everyone trying to
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
come up with a solution in the beginning
 
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh so yeah we're we're fully supportive
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
all in a way of
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
instituting this change thank you you're
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
welcome representative o'brien
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chip thank you marshall
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
for taking the question uh you've heard
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
a lot of the debate and many of the
 
00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
questions that went on in reviewing what
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
you've heard as far as questions from
 
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
this body do you see any amendments in
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
need to spill the need of any amendments
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
or anything or do you think it's
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
satisfactory as it stands alone thank
 
00:34:49.829 --> 00:34:49.839 align:start position:0%
you for the question i wouldn't
 
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
recommend any further changes at this
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
point i don't think we want to
 
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
complicate matters any having been in
 
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
many many uh houses throughout the state
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
at this point i think this is a great
 
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
solution hopefully will
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
put us in a really good spot to
 
00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:06.079 align:start position:0%
support these facilities
 
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you other questions
 
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair marshall toomey
 
00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.109 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair marshall toomey
the

00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
voluntary certification by new hampshire
 
00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.190 align:start position:0%
voluntary certification by new hampshire
core

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
core
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
um they just touted their the
 
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
inspections that they conduct
 
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
would it be correct in in a line of
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
thinking that that does not
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
alleviate that's a wrong word it does
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
not take the place of a local
 
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
municipality conducting their own
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
inspections as a municipal fire agency
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's correct part of the variance
 
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
approval is a
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
a a
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
an annual inspection by the local fire
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
department so that in addition to the
 
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire corps maintaining new
 
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire core certification which is
 
00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:56.079 align:start position:0%
part of this process and a link to dhhs
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
funding there is a requirement for local
 
00:35:59.910 --> 00:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
fire inspections annually to make sure
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
the safety features are in place they're
 
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
still operating under the parameters of
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
the 153 10d
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
everything's safe you know the systems
 
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
are still maintained and they're they're
 
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
operating under that recovery model
 
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
which is uh considered family-like
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.349 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:28.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
just to clarify just uh two little
 
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
questions one of them the 200 square
 
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
feet that would have
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's what applies to places like
 
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
assisted living
 
00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
or because it's not not a home and it's
 
00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
not a dorm
 
00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
i can't remember the chart of my top of
 
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
my head for assist living i think more
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
of an like an apartment building would
 
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
be more appropriate for the 200 square
 
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
feet would be one or a hotel would be
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
200 square feet
 
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.109 align:start position:0%
200 square feet
um

00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
a dorm like a college dorm would be down
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
in the 50 but
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
i don't remember the assist living and
 
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
my other question is there any um
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
for the recovery homes is there any
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
limit on the number of residents there
 
00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:15.599 align:start position:0%
could be i mean you know i know most of
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
them are probably like 10 or 20 but
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
could there be 50
 
00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
i've not seen any that large it would be
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
require a pretty significantly sized
 
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
house to make that happen and
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh the 50 square feet remember a couple
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
things it would the the bedroom size has
 
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
to be supported by the other stuff in
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
the house and for instance other things
 
00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
that come into play if there are houses
 
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
in a rural area in new hampshire and
 
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
it's on septic
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
the septic is going to drive the number
 
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
of bedrooms as well so there's some ties
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
there in concord or manchester it's
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
going to be driven by the number of
 
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
bedrooms in the in general so
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
you know some things we'll also look at
 
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
but no bedrooms in the in the basements
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
or an attic stuff them in an attic or
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
things like that you know some of the
 
00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
early early ones we were in and seeing
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
is that people were in basements
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
they were putting multiple bunk beds
 
00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
crammed into a room
 
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
this 50 is really
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
we've found so far that it's it's
 
00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
satisfactory and it meets the intent and
 
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you are there other questions
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
 
00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839 align:start position:0%
much thank you to me
 
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
testify on senate bill 223
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to close the hearing
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
and we'll be opening the hearing on
 
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%

398 relative to the building code and
 
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
fire code enforcement
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
this bill came out of a study committee
 
00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:41.349 align:start position:0%
this bill came out of a study committee
that

00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
worked i believe in the summer of 2018
 
00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.910 align:start position:0%
worked i believe in the summer of 2018
myself

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
your chair representative of

your chair representative of

oh my goodness i can't remember
 
00:39:53.839 --> 00:39:55.270 align:start position:0%
oh my goodness i can't remember
maguire

00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
maguire
 
00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
as well as senator guida the three of us
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
worked on this issue
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
because there was a lot of
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of problems getting
 
00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:06.079 align:start position:0%
codes passed in the house and we wanted
 
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
to work on a way
 
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
in order to facilitate
 
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
those codes here
 
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
in the in the legislature because i
 
00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
think we all know that we do have these
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
codes and they need to be updated
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
periodically as well as amendments
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
needing to get passed and so
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
the bill was filed and it was heard in
 
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
the senate it was then
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
held over for more work because of the
 
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
information we received at the public
 
00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:35.589 align:start position:0%
information we received at the public
hearing

00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
and it came forward and then we went
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
into uh lockdown
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
because of coven and it was placed into
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
an omnibus bill and it died in one of
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
the omnibus bills that was not passed by
 
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
i was asked to bring it forward again
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
this year and so that is what you have
 
00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
in front of us so just to kind of walk
 
00:40:59.430 --> 00:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
you through
 
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
um what this bill does it's the first
 
00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
thing it does is it clarifies that the
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
issuance of a permit and the collection
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
of fees shall not be considered as an
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
amendment to the building code
 
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
to the building code itself let me take
 
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
a step back we had the public hearing in
 
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
the senate there were some suggestions
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
that were made by both the fire
 
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
marshal's office and the
 
00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
building code review board
 
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
and what you have in front of you as
 
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
amended by the senate are there are
 
00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:29.839 align:start position:0%
their recommendations so the first is
 
00:41:32.309 --> 00:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
they want to make it very clear
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
that if you get a permit or there's a
 
00:41:37.109 --> 00:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
collection of fees it's there it's not
 
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
considered to be an amendment to the
 
00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
building code review uh the
 
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
the building codes i should say secondly
 
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
no fee is required to appeal a notice of
 
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
violation or any decision of a code
 
00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.190 align:start position:0%
violation or any decision of a code
official

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
official
 
00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
third it deals with the state-wide
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
amendments to the building code that
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
they are to be reviewed and approved by
 
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
the board then they're submitted to the
 
00:42:03.829 --> 00:42:03.839 align:start position:0%
legislature before becoming effective
 
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
third excuse me fourth the board shall
 
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
review a newer version of the code that
 
00:42:11.589 --> 00:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
has been published for two years because
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
we we've kind of made the decision that
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to stay two years
 
00:42:16.079 --> 00:42:17.270 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to stay two years
behind

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
behind
 
00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:20.079 align:start position:0%
so that gives both the fire marshal's
 
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
office as well as the state uh building
 
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
code review board an opportunity to go
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
over those boards uh excuse me to go
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
over those proposed courts court
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
codes and then make a decision about
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
what they want to send to the
 
00:42:33.599 --> 00:42:35.109 align:start position:0%
what they want to send to the
legislature

00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
and then finally is an issue dealing
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
with municipal amendments one of the
 
00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:43.240 align:start position:0%
things that we discovered was that
 
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities tend to adopt their own
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
codes as ordinances and oftentimes those
 
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
codes go way beyond what the state
 
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
building code review board has
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
authorized or the legislature has
 
00:42:56.319 --> 00:42:57.670 align:start position:0%
authorized or the legislature has
authorized

00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
this makes it difficult for trades
 
00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
persons when they go from community to
 
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
community instead of having one document
 
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
that they're working off of
 
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with a different
 
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
document in every single community and
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
that can make it harder for them to do
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
their jobs
 
00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:15.750 align:start position:0%
their jobs
so

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
what everyone came up with was a
 
00:43:20.069 --> 00:43:20.079 align:start position:0%
procedure that first that
 
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
a municipality shall submit proposed
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
amendments to the board for review prior
 
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
to adoption
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
we're not saying that you have to get
 
00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
them approved by the board but the board
 
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
just wants to take a look to review
 
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
whatever amendments that you want to
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
adopt for your community
 
00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:42.079 align:start position:0%
second it allows for an advisory opinion
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
where the building code review board can
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
take a look at that and they can say
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
well you know this is what we think
 
00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
about this proposed amendment
 
00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
third it looks to see that the proposed
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
amendment does not establish a
 
00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
requirement which conflicts with or are
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
less stringent than the most recent
 
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
statewide building code that's been
 
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
approved by the legislature and there
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
are no conflicts with the fire code
 
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
itself again what we're trying to get to
 
00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
do is to get everyone on the same page
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
when it comes to these building codes
 
00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
and then finally
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
they're published by the board
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
so that way anyone who a trades person
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
who's work looking to work in any
 
00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:25.190 align:start position:0%
who's work looking to work in any
community

00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
knows that i can go and look at these
 
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
building codes they're all updated in
 
00:44:31.589 --> 00:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
one place instead of having to go to
 
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
each municipality and dig through those
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
codes to find out which ones are
 
00:44:35.599 --> 00:44:36.630 align:start position:0%
codes to find out which ones are
different

00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:37.670 align:start position:0%
different
so

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
at this point madam chair i'm going to
 
00:44:41.829 --> 00:44:41.839 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony i will try to
 
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
answer questions but i am not a building
 
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
code official
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
we do have individuals who are here that
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
have worked on this
 
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
with the building code review board and
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
fire marshal twomey is here to answer
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
any questions that you might have thank
 
00:44:59.349 --> 00:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
you very much madam chair
 
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lekkis
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair just one
 
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
and that is it was my understanding that
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
we've been updating the building codes
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
every three years and part of the reason
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
for that was to see
 
00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
how they worked out elsewhere and if
 
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
there were problems
 
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
and apparently this drops that down to
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
two years and i'm wondering why that was
 
00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
done if if i'm correct
 
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much if my memory serves
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
me correct it was we did just didn't
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
want to get too far behind
 
00:45:31.589 --> 00:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
um there has been a lot of difficulty in
 
00:45:31.599 --> 00:45:32.790 align:start position:0%
um there has been a lot of difficulty in
getting

00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
codes passed by the legislature
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
and if we wait too long we get too far
 
00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
behind and what ends up happening
 
00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.190 align:start position:0%
behind and what ends up happening
is

00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:45:43.829 --> 00:45:43.839 align:start position:0%
insurance rates go up for either a
 
00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
builder for building a single-family
 
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
home again that cost gets put off to the
 
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
new buyer or for commercial developments
 
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:45:55.109 --> 00:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
there is a fire and safety code we do
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
not want to get too far behind on that
 
00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
code either because we are dealing about
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
the safety of individuals that are in
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
hospitals nursing homes and other places
 
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
and we thought two years would would is
 
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
a workable schedule
 
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
and we have just gone through
 
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
what i guess you would call the first
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
cycle of the two years and what's really
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
working out well is everyone is working
 
00:46:20.079 --> 00:46:21.109 align:start position:0%
working out well is everyone is working
together

00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
and that's why and it has made it much
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
much easier to uh to get these things
 
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
looked at and to get them passed thank
 
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thank you
 
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
senator for taking the question looking
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
at the bill on line 12
 
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
section 4 the committee shall work with
 
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
the building code review board and the
 
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
board of fire control when you mention
 
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
the board of fire control
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
would it be better to specify the i
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
would assume that means the state fire
 
00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:54.790 align:start position:0%
would assume that means the state fire
marshal

00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question i think um
 
00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
when we we were talking about the board
 
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
we were talking about the the building
 
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
code review board
 
00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:03.750 align:start position:0%
code review board
um

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
and that is excuse me not to interrupt
 
00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:06.630 align:start position:0%
and that is excuse me not to interrupt
you

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:47:08.069 --> 00:47:08.079 align:start position:0%
but so the
 
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh board of fire control is the building
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
called reveal board it's my
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
understanding that there's two separate
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
boards one is the fire board and the
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
other is the state building code review
 
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
board um the fire marshal is telling me
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
correctly if you folks want to clarify
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
or add in the fire board as well that's
 
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
fine with me
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
okay i'll withhold that question madam
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
chair and if the fire marshal's going to
 
00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
testify thank you thank you senator
 
00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative pearson did you want to
 
00:47:38.069 --> 00:47:38.079 align:start position:0%
respond to that
 
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
you and i can talk i can explain if
 
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
if you need it but i think the marshall
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
representative schuett
 
00:47:49.589 --> 00:47:49.599 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
senator would you say that if we
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
went back and just
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
approved these every three years as
 
00:47:59.829 --> 00:47:59.839 align:start position:0%
opposed to every two years that that
 
00:48:02.549 --> 00:48:02.559 align:start position:0%
results in a lot more changes going
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
forward for people to
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
try and
 
00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%
digest and comply with
 
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yes i would
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
agree with that and if you have every
 
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:14.720 align:start position:0%
three years um
 
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with a different
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
oftentimes a different group of people
 
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
um because we are elected for two years
 
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
in a two-year cycle so you could have
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
the board be working on something and
 
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
then come forward and now the sudden
 
00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
you've got
 
00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
a new group of people who really don't
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
understand and they have to get caught
 
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
up on this and it will make it i think a
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
little bit harder and heaven forbid you
 
00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:39.349 align:start position:0%
little bit harder and heaven forbid you
fall

00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
fall
 
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
into a budget year
 
00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.390 align:start position:0%
into a budget year
where

00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of people are just really focused
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
on the budget itself
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
representative grota
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
senator carson um
 
00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
the building codes are
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
a minimum
 
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
are the state minimum
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
so this would not prevent municipalities
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
to in
 
00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
to put in ordinances
 
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
codes that are
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
more stringent is that correct
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
all this does thank you for the question
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
all this does is it it creates a
 
00:49:17.349 --> 00:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
mechanism for the building code review
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
board to look at those amendments
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
and to talk with the municipality and
 
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
say this is more stringent or this is
 
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
less stringent but it doesn't prevent
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
them from adopting them okay in the
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
original legislation that i had filed
 
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
that said if the building code review
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
board said this is not good they
 
00:49:38.109 --> 00:49:38.119 align:start position:0%
couldn't adopt that but the
 
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities were very
 
00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:41.839 align:start position:0%
upset about that
 
00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to tread on their toes
 
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
we just want to try to get everybody on
 
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
the same page
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:49.270 align:start position:0%
follow up
sir

00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
sir
 
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
so in municipalities that don't have
 
00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:53.839 align:start position:0%
a building inspector
 
00:49:55.829 --> 00:49:55.839 align:start position:0%
or um
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
how do they
 
00:49:57.359 --> 00:49:58.390 align:start position:0%
how do they
then

00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
how do we
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
ensure that
 
00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:03.270 align:start position:0%
ensure that
the

00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
constructions that being it's being done
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
in those
 
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities does meet the building
 
00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
code well thank you for the question um
 
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
i don't feel that i'm in a position to
 
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
make that kind of a an assessment but i
 
00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
know that uh building code
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
building code review board folks are
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
here as well as the fire marshal and i
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
i want to say maybe a year ago or maybe
 
00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:26.470 align:start position:0%
i want to say maybe a year ago or maybe
two

00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
we had legislation that would allow the
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
state fire marshal to be the inspecting
 
00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:32.950 align:start position:0%
state fire marshal to be the inspecting
um

00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
uh entity
 
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
on places that do not have building
 
00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.430 align:start position:0%
on places that do not have building
codes

00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
codes
 
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
a person to look for that stuff the
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
vectors okay thank you but they will
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
answer that question better than i can
 
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:49.349 --> 00:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
marshall toomey
 
00:50:58.630 --> 00:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
i forgot about representative mcguire's
 
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
committee i'm carol mcguire representing
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
merrimack district 29
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
which is allenstown epsom in pittsfield
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
senate bill 398 was amended by the
 
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
senate and it is now a much simpler bill
 
00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
because most of the content that the
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
senator was speaking about was
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
incorporated into house bill 1681
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
which we passed earlier this year
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
has been passed by the senate edna
 
00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
committee and the senate and is now in
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
in senate finance
 
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
although i'm not sure why
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
but it is in senate finance and
 
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
it's expected to be approved
 
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
so what this bill as amended primarily
 
00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:52.230 align:start position:0%
so what this bill as amended primarily
does

00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
reconstitutes the joint committee on
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
code enforcement and advisory committee
 
00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
on state building and fire code
 
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
it it consolidates them into one
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
advisory committee that essentially
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
would be the legislative liaison
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
to the building code
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
review board and the board of fire
 
00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:17.670 align:start position:0%
review board and the board of fire
control

00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
requires them to work with them start
 
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
planning when to introduce legislation
 
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
to update codes
 
00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
so that we can continue in the process
 
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
of updating so there were only one code
 
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
cycle behind which is what the what what
 
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
the plan is the state building code
 
00:52:40.270 --> 00:52:40.280 align:start position:0%
review board has started looking at the
 
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
2021 codes
 
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
they're not ready for adoption but
 
00:52:48.069 --> 00:52:48.079 align:start position:0%
not this session
 
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
next session would be appropriate
 
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
there's also a
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
grace period established in the building
 
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
code that's section 2 of the bill
 
00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
starting on line 23
 
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
that is a
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
simplified version of what we approved
 
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:06.710 align:start position:0%
simplified version of what we approved
in

00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
house bill 1681 and the committee might
 
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
want to think about deleting it from
 
00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
because as i said it's
 
00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
it's a simplified
 
00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:19.030 align:start position:0%
it's a simplified
um

00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
a simplified paragraph with the same
 
00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
intent namely that if you're doing a
 
00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
major project you don't have to worry
 
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
about when a code chain comes in the the
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
code when you get your building permit
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
is what applies
 
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um madam chair
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
um just just so that i understand
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
building codes in general because i
 
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
don't believe my town has any
 
00:53:54.309 --> 00:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
of those
 
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
um is is it correct that
 
00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
the state will publish these building
 
00:54:00.079 --> 00:54:01.430 align:start position:0%
the state will publish these building
codes

00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
codes
 
00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
kind of as a model no no the state
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
building code is effective throughout
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
it is passed by the legislature and
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
the building code review board and it
 
00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
applies throughout the state and and
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
even to towns that don't have building
 
00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:20.230 align:start position:0%
even to towns that don't have building
inspectors

00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
inspectors
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
if you do something in a town that does
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
not have a building inspector such as my
 
00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:25.910 align:start position:0%
not have a building inspector such as my
town

00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
you the person who builds the house is
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for making sure it meets the
 
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.069 align:start position:0%
responsible for making sure it meets the
code

00:54:32.069 --> 00:54:32.079 align:start position:0%
code
 
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
or and it may be inspected
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
or it may not be but it's still the
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
owner's responsibility to do so
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
and the state fire marshal i i believe
 
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
and the building code review board help
 
00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:47.510 align:start position:0%
and the building code review board help
with

00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:54:51.589 --> 00:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
major projects that are outside of
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
outside of the towns that do have these
 
00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:54.870 align:start position:0%
outside of the towns that do have these
officials

00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
officials
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
a town may adopt a
 
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
ch an amendment to the building to the
 
00:55:01.829 --> 00:55:01.839 align:start position:0%
building code
 
00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
that is more stringent than the base
 
00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:05.349 align:start position:0%
that is more stringent than the base
code

00:55:05.349 --> 00:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
code
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
and but house bill 1681 requires it to
 
00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:09.670 align:start position:0%
and but house bill 1681 requires it to
be

00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:55:11.589 --> 00:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
sent to the
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
and do they have the option to
 
00:55:23.349 --> 00:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
say that they don't want to follow one
 
00:55:23.359 --> 00:55:24.710 align:start position:0%
say that they don't want to follow one
presid

00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
presid
 
00:55:26.789 --> 00:55:26.799 align:start position:0%
provision or
 
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
only if they are making it more
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
see no further questions
 
00:55:38.549 --> 00:55:38.559 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
good morning again sean toomey the state
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
fire marshal i think uh codes are
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
probably one of the most confusing
 
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
things out there frankly um
 
00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh so sorry for the we were doing this
 
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
crash course on education for you
 
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
tonight so senator this morning senator
 
00:56:07.349 --> 00:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
carson i think gave a great background
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
on of the package of where we're at and
 
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
sort of where we're landed with some of
 
00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
the senate bill 398 and representative
 
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
mcguire i think helped clean up some of
 
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:16.799 align:start position:0%
the amendments so we have multiple bills
 
00:56:18.309 --> 00:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
as you recall probably there's a couple
 
00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
more coming to you on uh building and
 
00:56:22.789 --> 00:56:22.799 align:start position:0%
fire code items now we're really i think
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
it's the culmination of a lot of cleanup
 
00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
over the last few years and really
 
00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
trying to streamline the the process of
 
00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
code development in the state so
 
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
a quick note on 398 uh
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
the part of it as representative mcguire
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned the joint committee on code
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
enforcement was established in 1999 and
 
00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
it was pre uh state building code so
 
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
that was at a time where each
 
00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
municipality did their own building code
 
00:56:50.069 --> 00:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
work uh in 1999 and established a joint
 
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
committee on code enforcement which is
 
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
kind of a subset of the board of fire
 
00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
control and it brought together
 
00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
different representatives professional
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
engineers building officials fire
 
00:56:58.319 --> 00:56:59.589 align:start position:0%
engineers building officials fire
officials

00:56:59.589 --> 00:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
officials
 
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
water well board and others architects
 
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
to try to talk about common concerns
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
around code enforcement
 
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
and kind of come up with a plan to go to
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
a state building code once that happened
 
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
the board uh building code review board
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
was established and the the kind of the
 
00:57:17.109 --> 00:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
useful life of the joint committee on
 
00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
code enforcement is no longer so this
 
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
bill uh eliminates the joint committee
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
on co-enforcement and establishes in its
 
00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
place the advisory committee that
 
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire spoke to so that
 
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
the building code review board and the
 
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
board of fire control can feed up an
 
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
annual report to the legislature sort of
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
a summary of its activity over the last
 
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
year of any necessary whether it's
 
00:57:42.069 --> 00:57:42.079 align:start position:0%
amendments that come forward for the
 
00:57:44.069 --> 00:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
building or the fire code side or
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
proposals for a wholesale update to the
 
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:48.559 align:start position:0%
fire code and staying with that
 
00:57:50.789 --> 00:57:50.799 align:start position:0%
three-year cycle the two-year part of it
 
00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
is we have to be published for at least
 
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
two years before the either board
 
00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:55.829 align:start position:0%
two years before the either board
considers

00:57:55.829 --> 00:57:55.839 align:start position:0%
considers
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
updating a wholesale code so we're in
 
00:58:01.589 --> 00:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
the 15 codes now the 18 is about to be
 
00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh processed this uh committee
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
in the house already approved it it's as
 
00:58:07.589 --> 00:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
we heard it's in senate finance right
 
00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
now and that should go through we'll
 
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
that will get us on the 18 codes with
 
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire amendments the new
 
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire amendments are heard at the
 
00:58:18.069 --> 00:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
board of fire control for fireside
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
building code reboot for the building
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
side so that cleans up that in a little
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
bit of history and i think uh providing
 
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
the advisory committee on state building
 
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
and fire codes at the legislative level
 
00:58:31.829 --> 00:58:31.839 align:start position:0%
is a great thing that we have uh
 
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
kind of support and thought process
 
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
earlier into the process on the
 
00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
legislative side coming out of the two
 
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
boards so i think that'll be a good
 
00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:39.910 align:start position:0%
boards so i think that'll be a good
thing

00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
and as representative mcguire mentioned
 
00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
starting at line 23 the grace period
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
that landed in a couple different spots
 
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
and it would be more than appropriate
 
00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:50.559 align:start position:0%
for this committee to eliminate that
 
00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
section the new paragraph starting at
 
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
line 23 on the grace period because it's
 
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
also in house bill 1681
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
and it's more detailed in 1681 so happy
 
00:59:01.109 --> 00:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions hope that
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
provided a little bit of background
 
00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
pearson thank you
 
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:09.589 align:start position:0%
madam chair
as

00:59:09.589 --> 00:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
marshall toomey as you and i are in
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
their unique uh circumstance of both
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
having advanced degrees in this field
 
00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
my concern and i and i'm just asking if
 
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
this will address that is that we have
 
00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:21.589 align:start position:0%
this will address that is that we have
local

00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
local
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
especially local fire inspectors that
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
invent their own engineering degrees
 
00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:27.109 align:start position:0%
invent their own engineering degrees
okay

00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:59:27.119 --> 00:59:29.190 align:start position:0%
okay
and

00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
that's been a a issue not only just for
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
the builders because
 
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
the builders are the builders deal with
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
what they deal with but joe homeowner
 
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
especially having to deal with something
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
that has come out of nowhere that really
 
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
cannot be cited or
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
referenced in any sort of real and
 
00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
logical way
 
00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
does this provide the ability for
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
john q public when they have an issue
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
with a local fire official that's
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
inventing his engineering degree to come
 
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
before the state
 
00:59:58.710 --> 00:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
and have that decision reviewed
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
that would be in senate bill 443
 
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
that put that portion of it on the
 
01:00:06.549 --> 01:00:06.559 align:start position:0%
building side the fire side of it is not
 
01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
in there right now it's not in 443 no no
 
01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
that ended up being amended in the
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
building side of its own in there now i
 
01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
spoke with a representative from the
 
01:00:17.589 --> 01:00:17.599 align:start position:0%
ecba steve raincord with probably many
 
01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
of you familiar with yesterday and
 
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
they're looking to add it in and we
 
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
would support it as long as the process
 
01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
follows what we did we established on
 
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
the building side so uh okay great thank
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um fire marshal i
 
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
want to bring you back to
 
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
your remarks before representative
 
01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:43.990 align:start position:0%
your remarks before representative
pearson

01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
pearson
 
01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
has uh interrogated you you met
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
referenced in the bill on line 23 and
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
following uh could you uh
 
01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
repeat that just so we get it right did
 
01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
i hear you correctly that you want to
 
01:00:59.670 --> 01:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
you suggest that we uh strip that out of
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
the bill yes yeah so starting at line 23
 
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
down through
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
ending at 29
 
01:01:08.309 --> 01:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
29 would be appropriate that that's
 
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
covered in house bill 1681 which was
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
already passed by the house and as i
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
said is in senate finance right now
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you for
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is phillip sherman
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
i speak as the chair of the building
 
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
code review board i speak in favor of
 
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
i strongly support the concept of a
 
01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
standing legislative committee which
 
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
will lead to positive work and
 
01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
relationships between the bcrb and the
 
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
legislature and will help us get more
 
01:01:59.589 --> 01:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
quickly to a standard schedule for code
 
01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
updates not to mention the ability to
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
deal with other related issues in a more
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
orderly manner we look forward to
 
01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
working closely with this committee once
 
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
it's formed
 
01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:12.559 align:start position:0%
this bill also provides a six-month
 
01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:14.799 align:start position:0%
grace period previously
 
01:02:14.799 --> 01:02:16.150 align:start position:0%
grace period previously
discussed

01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
where the current or the updated code
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
may be used different language which
 
01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
amends a different rsa section but to
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
the same effect is presented in hb 1681.
 
01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
i recommend as previously uh recommended
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
that the hp 1681 language be used
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
in an effective
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
take it out of this bill as it has more
 
01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
precise language it's not only longer it
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
gets to the point more accurately and
 
01:02:45.029 --> 01:02:45.039 align:start position:0%
has been agreed upon by several of the
 
01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
groups having interest that are
 
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:49.440 align:start position:0%

you want to know about that committee
 
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:47.440 align:start position:0%

yeah
so

01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%

when a
 
01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
department head requested a
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
title change
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%

01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
fills out a very lengthy application
 
01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
and they bring it to the joint committee
 
01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
on employee classification
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
who then
 
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
approves the application which is then
 
01:05:50.789 --> 01:05:50.799 align:start position:0%
forwarded to the corn ferry hay group of

san francisco california
 
01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
and what the
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
what the hay group does is compares that
 
01:05:58.079 --> 01:05:59.670 align:start position:0%
what the hay group does is compares that
job

01:05:59.670 --> 01:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
job
 
01:06:02.829 --> 01:06:02.839 align:start position:0%
with similar jobs throughout the united
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
states and
 
01:06:07.109 --> 01:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
seeks to
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
justify or not justify the request for
 
01:06:13.109 --> 01:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
the change in title or the increase in
 
01:06:13.119 --> 01:06:16.710 align:start position:0%
the change in title or the increase in
salary

01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:21.670 align:start position:0%
we have
recently

01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
recently
 
01:06:23.589 --> 01:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
the former commissioner of health and
 
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
human services who found that health and
 
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
human services
 
01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:30.470 align:start position:0%
human services
were

01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
at the
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
seeking a certain pay grade
 
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
and disregarding the titles
 
01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:42.950 align:start position:0%
and disregarding the titles
so

01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
hence we have this bill with a laundry
 
01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
list of job titles that are
 
01:06:48.319 --> 01:06:49.270 align:start position:0%
list of job titles that are
just

01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
dismissed and reinstated
 
01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:54.470 align:start position:0%
dismissed and reinstated
and

01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
this is an unprecedent unprecedented
 
01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.349 align:start position:0%
this is an unprecedent unprecedented
number

01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
of job title changes
 
01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:07.349 align:start position:0%
of job title changes
so

01:07:07.349 --> 01:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
when the recommendations come back from
 
01:07:11.349 --> 01:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
the hay group
 
01:07:13.109 --> 01:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
the committee meets and approves the
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations which are sent to the
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee
 
01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
and that's how
 
01:07:18.079 --> 01:07:20.109 align:start position:0%
and that's how
the

01:07:20.109 --> 01:07:20.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
unclassified people
 
01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:23.349 align:start position:0%
unclassified people
get

01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
changes and pay grades
 
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
and that's what we bring to you today
 
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
this was the latest effort by the joint
 
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
committee on employee classification
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
for these employees
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
so that these actually can be done
 
01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
it requires an act of the legislature
 
01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
so we put it into bill form
 
01:07:53.829 --> 01:07:53.839 align:start position:0%
and bring it to you today
 
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
into the
 
01:07:59.270 --> 01:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
house in the senate for approval
 
01:08:01.589 --> 01:08:01.599 align:start position:0%

01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
introduction was that
 
01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
they did not have
 
01:08:20.319 --> 01:08:22.149 align:start position:0%
they did not have

01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative grow to ask her question
 
01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
while i look that up okay
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you senator reagan um so if i
 
01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
understand what you just said to us
 
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
the first
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
nine lines of the bill
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
are titles that are no longer
 
01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
being used
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
and therefore we're going to delete
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
those yes and then the rest of the bill
 
01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:52.709 align:start position:0%
those yes and then the rest of the bill
are

01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:08:52.719 --> 01:08:53.990 align:start position:0%
are
departments

01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
departments
 
01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
both of them the department is on the
 
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
left-hand side and the titles are on the
 
01:08:59.590 --> 01:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
right-hand side and these are the ones
 
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
that we are now using
 
01:09:04.829 --> 01:09:04.839 align:start position:0%
is that correct yes okay thank
 
01:09:04.839 --> 01:09:06.470 align:start position:0%
is that correct yes okay thank
you

01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
there's no note that this bill has a new
 
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
01:09:13.110 --> 01:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
and i would expect
 
01:09:15.749 --> 01:09:15.759 align:start position:0%
if i understood senator reagan correctly
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
these are the same people doing the same
 
01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
job we're just rationalizing the titles
 
01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
the titles and the pay grades and the
 
01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
pay grades yes so
 
01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
are people getting major raises because
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
within the reasonable judgment of the
 
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
hay group
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
that they are
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
in line with their peers and other
 
01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
agencies okay that they
 
01:09:47.749 --> 01:09:47.759 align:start position:0%
are earning that rate of pay
 
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
i see but for example on line five
 
01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
there's a glenn cliff home administrator
 
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
salary grade ff
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
and down on line
 
01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
29 there's the
 
01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
executive director of the glenn glenkiff
 
01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
of home which i presume is the same
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
person or the same job
 
01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:15.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
may be the same person
 
01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:32.550 align:start position:0%
may be the same person
okay

01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
and 428 yes the assistant commissioner
 
01:10:38.070 --> 01:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
of the insurance department and also on
 
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
line seven the insurance department
 
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
general counsel is
 
01:10:48.149 --> 01:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
line 27 and it's going up from ff to gg
 
01:10:48.159 --> 01:10:49.590 align:start position:0%
line 27 and it's going up from ff to gg
so

01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
uh we don't have a fiscal note
 
01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
minimum chair
 
01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
yes i'm over here yes my understanding
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
and maybe senator
 
01:11:03.189 --> 01:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
reagan can can confirm that my
 
01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
understanding is that
 
01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
from line 12 down these positions
 
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
already exist and these people are
 
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
already are exist at that grade level
 
01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
and the people that are in line from
 
01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
line three to line nine
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
don't exist so it i think the
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that
 
01:11:27.669 --> 01:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
these people are already performing
 
01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
these jobs at that pay grade so there
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have there wouldn't be a fiscal
 
01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:34.630 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have there wouldn't be a fiscal
note

01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
note
 
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
and maybe that's probably not what
 
01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
should be happening
 
01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
okay if someone from the jcec could
 
01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
explain what happens to these people
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
or i mean
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
the title is one
 
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
the trouble is that the titles and pay
 
01:11:51.669 --> 01:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
grades are given in statute
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
so i madam chair if i might so i think i
 
01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
think what we ought to
 
01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
do is consult with uh the
 
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner of das
 
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
charlie arlinghaus who is the
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
person who actually administers the
 
01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
situation the jcec is an executive board
 
01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
several of the members are here today
 
01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
senator reagan is the chair
 
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
senator and alessandro was the second
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
senator second senate member
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
on the jcec and representative scitec
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
and i are two of the three house members
 
01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:30.470 align:start position:0%
and i are two of the three house members
but

01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
some of these questions need to have the
 
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
administ need to have the commissioner
 
01:12:35.679 --> 01:12:36.550 align:start position:0%
administ need to have the commissioner
or

01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner joe bouchard here to
 
01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
give us uh no so i think some of the
 
01:12:45.669 --> 01:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
assumptions here are perhaps uh you know
 
01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
incorrect uh and and we need to have
 
01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:49.430 align:start position:0%
incorrect uh and and we need to have
somebody

01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
you know who can corroborate the actual
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
state of affairs before we
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
get into hypothesizing too much because
 
01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
i think we're getting off track
 
01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative schmidt i tend
 
01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
to agree with you that we're
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
hypothesizing in absence of the facts i
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
will try to get rep
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
the commissioner arlington or his deputy
 
01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
here to explain what this is doing
 
01:13:15.669 --> 01:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
before we we take a vote on it
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for
 
01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:19.840 align:start position:0%

i don't like to disagree with you but
 
01:34:21.669 --> 01:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
you keep saying medicaid and i believe
 
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
medicare is the operative program you're
 
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
right you're right thank you thank you
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:32.790 --> 01:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that
 
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
i want the committee to get confused
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
right well
 
01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i could confuse you i think so
 
01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
i apologize for that i'm mortal
 
01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:34:44.070 --> 01:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh this chan
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
this change allowed the state to
 
01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
capitalize on additional federal funding
 
01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
and decrease the premium costs for both
 
01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:51.270 align:start position:0%
and decrease the premium costs for both
state

01:34:51.270 --> 01:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:34:54.070 --> 01:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
and medicare eligible retirees this bill
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
intends to update the premium billing
 
01:34:58.390 --> 01:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
and collection process as was requested
 
01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
by the department and cassie kane was
 
01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
instrumental in assisting with
 
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
this situation and as i say both both
 
01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
members of admin services are here
 
01:35:12.229 --> 01:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
this does good things for the state and
 
01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
does good good things for the retirees
 
01:35:17.669 --> 01:35:17.679 align:start position:0%
which indeed is is important and i think
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
the key issue is it decreased the cost
 
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
from 171 million
 
01:35:29.189 --> 01:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
to 130 million in 2223 from 1819 to 2223
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
and that's a fairly significant
 
01:35:32.790 --> 01:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
reduction in cost
 
01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:33.669 align:start position:0%
reduction in cost
and

01:35:33.669 --> 01:35:33.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
the decreased budget can be attributed
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
to successful procurement efforts and
 
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
contract management combined with
 
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
maximizing federal subsidies on the
 
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
medicare plan
 
01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh with that uh madam chair there aren't
 
01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
many questions that i can answer about
 
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
this other than to say
 
01:35:52.629 --> 01:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
it's a good thing
 
01:35:56.310 --> 01:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's a benefit to our retirees and
 
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a real kudo to our state
 
01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
employees who do such a great job
 
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
in fulfilling their job responsibilities
 
01:36:07.270 --> 01:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
and that's to take care of
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
the needs of our state and to deliver
 
01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
results in the most efficient and
 
01:36:15.189 --> 01:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
effective manner so with that madam
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
chair i'll uh i'll retire i'll try to
 
01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
address any questions that you might
 
01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
have but
 
01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
the two employees are here they are
 
01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
experts in the area and they've done all
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
the work
 
01:36:26.639 --> 01:36:27.590 align:start position:0%
the work
okay

01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
if they've done the work i think we
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
should ask them because
 
01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
they'll probably be able to explain in
 
01:36:34.950 --> 01:36:34.960 align:start position:0%

01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
the retiree health benefit plan and then
 
01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
i'm going to
 
01:38:43.990 --> 01:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
ask joyce to share the details of the
 
01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
bill with you
 
01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:46.070 align:start position:0%
bill with you
but

01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:38:49.070 --> 01:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
some of you may have been here back in
 
01:38:52.390 --> 01:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
2015-2016 when we began a couple of
 
01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
years of a rough ride with the retiree
 
01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
health benefit budget
 
01:38:58.709 --> 01:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
and that was both i think a period of
 
01:39:02.470 --> 01:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
time where funding was constrained and
 
01:39:05.910 --> 01:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
um and retiree numbers enrollments were
 
01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:07.109 align:start position:0%
um and retiree numbers enrollments were
rising

01:39:07.109 --> 01:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
rising
 
01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
and we went through a period of time
 
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
where the budget
 
01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
didn't get funded to meet the needs of
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
the retiree health benefit projected
 
01:39:17.750 --> 01:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
costs and then and then we had an
 
01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:19.189 align:start position:0%
costs and then and then we had an
explosion

01:39:19.189 --> 01:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
explosion
 
01:39:19.199 --> 01:39:20.070 align:start position:0%
explosion
in

01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
prescription drug costs and it began us
 
01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
a series of years where we did whatever
 
01:39:26.550 --> 01:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
we could to help save money
 
01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:27.830 align:start position:0%
we could to help save money
and

01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
medicare has been a big part of that
 
01:39:31.590 --> 01:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
picture and it's a if you look at the
 
01:39:33.590 --> 01:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
chart in front of you i'm going to help
 
01:39:36.070 --> 01:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
you understand why how we've been able
 
01:39:38.550 --> 01:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
to achieve these savings
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
but just to let you know we have on the
 
01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs side leverage
 
01:39:46.149 --> 01:39:46.159 align:start position:0%
medicare funding to help control to the
 
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
best degree we are able prescription
 
01:39:51.990 --> 01:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
drugs for our medicare retirees and then
 
01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
beginning in 2019 i believe it was we
 
01:39:57.109 --> 01:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
moved our
 
01:40:00.070 --> 01:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
self-funded retiree health benefits for
 
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
medical benefits from
 
01:40:04.390 --> 01:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
completely self-funded to a fully
 
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
insured medicare plan what that did was
 
01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
bring in medicare funding federal
 
01:40:13.030 --> 01:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
funding to help decrease the cost to the
 
01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
state and also to our retirees part of
 
01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
the solutions over the years with
 
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
how are we going to meet this deficit
 
01:40:22.709 --> 01:40:22.719 align:start position:0%
that we did have in our retiree health
 
01:40:24.149 --> 01:40:24.159 align:start position:0%
benefit plan
 
01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
included retirees paying more toward the
 
01:40:29.669 --> 01:40:29.679 align:start position:0%
cost of care so that we have
 
01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
non-medicare retirees who pay 20 percent
 
01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
of the cost of the monthly premium and
 
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
now certain retirees who
 
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
who are born 1149 and later
 
01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
um contribute to
 
01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:44.629 align:start position:0%
um contribute to
20

01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
20
 
01:40:47.109 --> 01:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
of the non-medicare premium
 
01:40:47.119 --> 01:40:48.149 align:start position:0%
of the non-medicare premium
and

01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:48.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:50.950 --> 01:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
so we we moved our retirees from this
 
01:40:53.990 --> 01:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
self-funded plan into a medicare part c
 
01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:54.950 align:start position:0%
self-funded plan into a medicare part c
plan

01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
and we were able to bring in federal
 
01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:58.390 align:start position:0%
and we were able to bring in federal
funds

01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:41:00.390 --> 01:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
now what this means is that our plan
 
01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
administration has to comply with
 
01:41:05.109 --> 01:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
medicare regulations and joyce is going
 
01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
to tell you a little bit more about what
 
01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
that means and why we're asking for a
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
change in the law
 
01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:12.470 align:start position:0%
change in the law
yes

01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:13.510 align:start position:0%
yes
so

01:41:13.510 --> 01:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
senate bill 356 really focuses in on two
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
different areas one is pertaining to the
 
01:41:21.189 --> 01:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
cms laws as written
 
01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
we are not permitted to do any kind of
 
01:41:26.070 --> 01:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
retroactive enrollment or disenrollment
 
01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
or terminations on our plan the way the
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
current legislation is written
 
01:41:33.590 --> 01:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
it says that our retirees can
 
01:41:35.430 --> 01:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
basically get reinstated in the health
 
01:41:38.470 --> 01:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
plan up to six months after
 
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
due to non-payment so we allow them a
 
01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
six-month gap of not paying for their
 
01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
benefits in our law today and then if
 
01:41:47.669 --> 01:41:47.679 align:start position:0%
they decide to pay and make up the
 
01:41:50.470 --> 01:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
difference for that six-month gap we'll
 
01:41:53.590 --> 01:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
continue their benefits and um cms says
 
01:41:55.270 --> 01:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
you cannot do that
 
01:41:57.510 --> 01:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
so um and we haven't been doing that
 
01:42:00.070 --> 01:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
because we by law cannot if we want to
 
01:42:02.550 --> 01:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
when i say law i mean federal law
 
01:42:04.950 --> 01:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
if we want to maintain those federal
 
01:42:06.870 --> 01:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
subsidies that cassie was just referring
 
01:42:08.790 --> 01:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
to that have enabled us to control our
 
01:42:10.950 --> 01:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
costs to our retiree health benefit plan
 
01:42:13.990 --> 01:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
we have to comply with that federal law
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
where that causes confusion is our
 
01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
retirees are reading the state law and
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
they're saying well what do you mean i
 
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
can do this but we're trying to explain
 
01:42:22.629 --> 01:42:22.639 align:start position:0%
to them well the federal law says you
 
01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
cannot so we're trying to remove that
 
01:42:28.070 --> 01:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
i'll say confusion for our retirees
 
01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
because i don't think anyone wants us to
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
jeopardize that federal
 
01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh subsidy coming in for our for our
 
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
retirees to benefit from that savings as
 
01:42:38.229 --> 01:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
well as our our budget
 
01:42:40.070 --> 01:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
um so that's the big change as far as
 
01:42:44.229 --> 01:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
the cms um area the paragraph line
 
01:42:44.239 --> 01:42:46.470 align:start position:0%
the cms um area the paragraph line
um

01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:48.310 --> 01:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
that yeah that's basically that's the
 
01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
first section of the bill the second
 
01:42:51.990 --> 01:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
section is pertaining to
 
01:42:54.629 --> 01:42:54.639 align:start position:0%
i'm going to call it unnecessary costs
 
01:42:58.950 --> 01:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:02.070 --> 01:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
a 10-day notice period for when retirees
 
01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:02.870 align:start position:0%
a 10-day notice period for when retirees
are

01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:43:05.990 --> 01:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
paying for their monthly premium
 
01:43:08.310 --> 01:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
and then we are required to send them a
 
01:43:10.870 --> 01:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
mail a letter certified
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
to them at seven dollars per letter
 
01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
to avoid that termination
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
and what we've learned through over the
 
01:43:19.350 --> 01:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
past couple years is our retirees are
 
01:43:21.590 --> 01:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
using that 10-day grace period
 
01:43:23.590 --> 01:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
as when their bills are due so they're
 
01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
actually working with your banks to set
 
01:43:27.430 --> 01:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
up an automatic payment
 
01:43:29.830 --> 01:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
in the 10-day window which is great for
 
01:43:31.430 --> 01:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
them because they can set it and forget
 
01:43:33.189 --> 01:43:33.199 align:start position:0%
it but it's bad for us because the law
 
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
requires us to send them a certified
 
01:43:35.119 --> 01:43:36.070 align:start position:0%
requires us to send them a certified
mail

01:43:36.070 --> 01:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
mail
 
01:43:38.550 --> 01:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
telling them that they need to pay us
 
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
um to avoid that termination and we get
 
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
regular calls saying stop sending me
 
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
these certified letters you're just
 
01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
wasting the state's money i already have
 
01:43:47.189 --> 01:43:47.199 align:start position:0%
it all set up
 
01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
so we've been working with our retirees
 
01:43:50.790 --> 01:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
and we have another
 
01:43:52.470 --> 01:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
vendor that we're working with for
 
01:43:54.629 --> 01:43:54.639 align:start position:0%
retiree billing and collections where
 
01:43:56.149 --> 01:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
we've actually gotten retirees to
 
01:43:58.709 --> 01:43:58.719 align:start position:0%
correct that automatic bill pay so now
 
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
they're good they're in that window
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
where they're paying their bills on time
 
01:44:04.229 --> 01:44:04.239 align:start position:0%
so we're not in uh
 
01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
i gotcha we're going to terminate your
 
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
benefit business we actually want our
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
retirees to maintain their benefits and
 
01:44:11.189 --> 01:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
we work with them to do so but we're
 
01:44:14.550 --> 01:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
trying to avoid an unnecessary cost
 
01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:16.159 align:start position:0%
by sending those
 
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
expensive notices to people who had
 
01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
every intention to pay their bills
 
01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:21.830 align:start position:0%
every intention to pay their bills
anyway

01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
um so that's really what these
 
01:44:26.790 --> 01:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
two sections of the bill are trying to
 
01:44:29.189 --> 01:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
address is elimination of unnecessary
 
01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
spending and also compliance with the
 
01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:38.870 --> 01:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'm sure are there
 
01:44:40.470 --> 01:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
on this procedure or this bill
 
01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
representative lucas and then shut
 
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um
 
01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned there are a number of
 
01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
things that were done to save money
 
01:44:54.229 --> 01:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
which is great i'm just wondering um
 
01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
how much are we getting from the federal
 
01:44:58.070 --> 01:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
government to support this program how
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
much of those savings are from uh the
 
01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
federal contribution
 
01:45:04.070 --> 01:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
so from the
 
01:45:06.310 --> 01:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
medicare advantage side of the business
 
01:45:08.310 --> 01:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
so the federal subsidies are coming in
 
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
they're actually going to aetna
 
01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:10.870 align:start position:0%
they're actually going to aetna
and

01:45:10.870 --> 01:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:13.669 --> 01:45:13.679 align:start position:0%
aetna in turn is charging us a zero per
 
01:45:16.470 --> 01:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
member per month premium contribution
 
01:45:18.629 --> 01:45:18.639 align:start position:0%
for our retirees to be on that aetna
 
01:45:18.639 --> 01:45:19.510 align:start position:0%
for our retirees to be on that aetna
plan

01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:45:21.990 --> 01:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
just to give you an idea that xero is
 
01:45:26.470 --> 01:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
locked in for 2021 22 and 23.
 
01:45:28.390 --> 01:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
buy our contract
 
01:45:30.149 --> 01:45:30.159 align:start position:0%
prior to that we were paying about a
 
01:45:32.310 --> 01:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
hundred and ten dollars per month per
 
01:45:34.550 --> 01:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
retiree to be on the previous medicare
 
01:45:38.070 --> 01:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
advantage plan in 2020.
 
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
just to give you an idea there yep thank
 
01:45:41.590 --> 01:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
you sure
 
01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:43.830 align:start position:0%
you sure
representative

01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um
 
01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:47.189 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um
hi

01:45:47.189 --> 01:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
hi
 
01:45:50.229 --> 01:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
miss pittman and keane know you well
 
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
um you did not address section three of
 
01:45:55.270 --> 01:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm curious
 
01:45:58.870 --> 01:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
i know that
 
01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
i introduced in fact house bill 130 last
 
01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:03.910 align:start position:0%
i introduced in fact house bill 130 last
term

01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
term
 
01:46:07.270 --> 01:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
because there was a question between
 
01:46:09.990 --> 01:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
das and
 
01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
the retirement system billing
 
01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
retirees for their additional costs
 
01:46:18.629 --> 01:46:18.639 align:start position:0%
and i'm curious
 
01:46:21.189 --> 01:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
how if this resolves that
 
01:46:23.830 --> 01:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
i understand that
 
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
there was concern on behalf of the
 
01:46:27.270 --> 01:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
that it put them in jeopardy for some
 
01:46:32.229 --> 01:46:32.239 align:start position:0%
kind of regulation with the irs
 
01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm curious
 
01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
how that got resolved so so this bill
 
01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:37.230 align:start position:0%
how that got resolved so so this bill
doesn't

01:46:37.230 --> 01:46:37.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:38.550 align:start position:0%
doesn't
[Music]

01:46:38.550 --> 01:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
relate at all to the issue around
 
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
the nhrs withholding the premium from
 
01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
certain retirement payments two separate
 
01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
issues entirely and
 
01:46:52.310 --> 01:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
paragraph three is about our ability to
 
01:46:54.550 --> 01:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
comply with medicare law and joyce can
 
01:46:56.310 --> 01:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
talk to you this is similar to what i
 
01:46:57.990 --> 01:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
was saying before on the retroactive
 
01:47:01.350 --> 01:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
enrollment and so the um
 
01:47:03.669 --> 01:47:03.679 align:start position:0%
what medicare tells us we have to do is
 
01:47:06.709 --> 01:47:06.719 align:start position:0%
we have to proactively enroll people so
 
01:47:08.470 --> 01:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
if people do get terminated for
 
01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
non-payment we are not able to
 
01:47:12.790 --> 01:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
retroactively enroll them we have to
 
01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
have them actually fill out new forms
 
01:47:16.709 --> 01:47:16.719 align:start position:0%
um so we want to make it clear to our
 
01:47:20.310 --> 01:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
retirees that if you allow your plan to
 
01:47:22.709 --> 01:47:22.719 align:start position:0%
terminate due to non-payment it's not
 
01:47:24.229 --> 01:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
just flipping the switch and turning you
 
01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
back on you actually have to re-enroll
 
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
in order to go forward back on our it's
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
all prospective with medicare
 
01:47:34.229 --> 01:47:34.239 align:start position:0%
so this section just
 
01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
refers to the re-enrollment process
 
01:47:38.629 --> 01:47:38.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:40.149 --> 01:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so
 
01:47:44.629 --> 01:47:44.639 align:start position:0%
the people that are affected by i'm
 
01:47:45.830 --> 01:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:47:48.229 --> 01:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
you know the the part that's like
 
01:47:50.229 --> 01:47:50.239 align:start position:0%
three quarters of the way down the first
 
01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
page here
 
01:47:54.390 --> 01:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
are those all
 
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
people who
 
01:47:59.590 --> 01:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
are getting a retirement
 
01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:01.510 align:start position:0%
are getting a retirement
benefit

01:48:01.510 --> 01:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
but their benefit
 
01:48:06.310 --> 01:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
is not enough money to cover what you
 
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
have to withhold or is there anybody
 
01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
else that is affected by this so this
 
01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
pertains to so we do have the largest
 
01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
number of our retirees who are required
 
01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
to pay actually pay through an automatic
 
01:48:18.790 --> 01:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
deduction from their new hampshire
 
01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:20.229 align:start position:0%
deduction from their new hampshire
retirement

01:48:20.229 --> 01:48:20.239 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
pension payment so this does not apply
 
01:48:23.590 --> 01:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
to them because it's happening
 
01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
automatically for them
 
01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:26.719 align:start position:0%
but if there is ever
 
01:48:28.229 --> 01:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
for the retirees who actually have to
 
01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
make a physical payment
 
01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
this is who it applies to so to your
 
01:48:34.149 --> 01:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
point is if their their pension check
 
01:48:36.070 --> 01:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
isn't great enough to withhold the
 
01:48:38.149 --> 01:48:38.159 align:start position:0%
contribution from it then we would build
 
01:48:40.709 --> 01:48:40.719 align:start position:0%
them this applies to them it also
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
applies to
 
01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
what representative stewart was
 
01:48:45.830 --> 01:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
referring to is
 
01:48:47.590 --> 01:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
a different bill that we're in a
 
01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:48.629 align:start position:0%
a different bill that we're in a
different

01:48:48.629 --> 01:48:48.639 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
area we are charging about 640 of our
 
01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
retirees outside of the new hampshire
 
01:48:56.070 --> 01:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
retirement system due to
 
01:48:58.470 --> 01:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
an ongoing conversation that das is
 
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
having with new hampshire retirement
 
01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
on how the uh
 
01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:04.149 align:start position:0%
on how the uh
the

01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
law is currently being interpreted
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:11.350 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:49:11.350 --> 01:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:13.109 --> 01:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
that second group that you're talking
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
about are those people who
 
01:49:19.669 --> 01:49:19.679 align:start position:0%
worked for the state and when they
 
01:49:22.149 --> 01:49:22.159 align:start position:0%
retired they maybe they took all their
 
01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
money out in cash
 
01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.270 align:start position:0%
money out in cash
no

01:49:25.270 --> 01:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:49:27.189 --> 01:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
so if you take all of your money out in
 
01:49:28.709 --> 01:49:28.719 align:start position:0%
cash and you're no longer getting a
 
01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:30.719 align:start position:0%
monthly pension payment you're not
 
01:49:33.669 --> 01:49:33.679 align:start position:0%
eligible for our retiree health benefits
 
01:49:35.750 --> 01:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
so this is only for people who are
 
01:49:38.550 --> 01:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
getting a monthly pension benefit on an
 
01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
ongoing basis is that what your question
 
01:49:43.270 --> 01:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
is asking yes that's what my first
 
01:49:46.390 --> 01:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
question was and follow up
 
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so i'm not understanding because
 
01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
you told me there were two groups so you
 
01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
told me there were some that that you
 
01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
were taking
 
01:49:55.750 --> 01:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
taking the money tried to take the money
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
out of their retirement but it wasn't
 
01:50:00.229 --> 01:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
enough to cover the help and what was
 
01:50:02.550 --> 01:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
the second group so there's there are
 
01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:03.910 align:start position:0%
the second group so there's there are
two

01:50:03.910 --> 01:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
we're actually talking about three
 
01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
groups if i understood you so there's
 
01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
the group that paid they get a monthly
 
01:50:09.830 --> 01:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
pension check from the new hampshire
 
01:50:11.830 --> 01:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
retirement system and they're eligible
 
01:50:13.750 --> 01:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
for health insurance
 
01:50:15.270 --> 01:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire retirement takes a
 
01:50:17.350 --> 01:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
deduction out of their monthly pension
 
01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:18.149 align:start position:0%
deduction out of their monthly pension
check

01:50:18.149 --> 01:50:18.159 align:start position:0%
check
 
01:50:20.070 --> 01:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
and sends that to us for their monthly
 
01:50:22.709 --> 01:50:22.719 align:start position:0%
payment that's group number one group
 
01:50:24.709 --> 01:50:24.719 align:start position:0%
number two is people who don't have
 
01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
enough money in that monthly pension
 
01:50:28.470 --> 01:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
check to cover the cost of their health
 
01:50:30.870 --> 01:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
insurance so we the department of
 
01:50:32.550 --> 01:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
administrative services is required to
 
01:50:34.229 --> 01:50:34.239 align:start position:0%
bill them outside of the new hampshire
 
01:50:37.669 --> 01:50:37.679 align:start position:0%
retirement system pension payment
 
01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
so it's they're still eligible for a
 
01:50:41.910 --> 01:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
monthly pension check from nhrs which
 
01:50:43.990 --> 01:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
they still receive but it doesn't take
 
01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
the deduction for the health benefits is
 
01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
not withheld so they're still required
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
by law to pay it so we have to invoice
 
01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
them outside of the retirement system
 
01:50:54.790 --> 01:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
the group three that i think i may
 
01:50:56.550 --> 01:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
introduce but you weren't asking about
 
01:50:58.470 --> 01:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
was the people who took a lump sum
 
01:50:59.910 --> 01:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
payment from their pension when they
 
01:51:02.149 --> 01:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
left state service and they are 100
 
01:51:03.510 --> 01:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
percent done with the state of new
 
01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire in terms of receiving pension
 
01:51:08.950 --> 01:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
were you referring to those people
 
01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:10.310 align:start position:0%
were you referring to those people
or

01:51:10.310 --> 01:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to i'm just trying to
 
01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
figure out who
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
is affected by this
 
01:51:20.310 --> 01:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
because my next question was going to be
 
01:51:22.550 --> 01:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
your follow-up representative fellows
 
01:51:25.270 --> 01:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you just a little one why why
 
01:51:27.589 --> 01:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
are you billing them once a month
 
01:51:31.189 --> 01:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
instead of like quarterly
 
01:51:33.430 --> 01:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
instead it's actually how it's outlined
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
in the law but it's a lot easier for
 
01:51:37.109 --> 01:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
them right now when we look at our
 
01:51:39.189 --> 01:51:39.199 align:start position:0%
medicare retirees we're seeing twenty
 
01:51:40.950 --> 01:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
dollars it feels like an
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
inconsequential amount to some it's a
 
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
lot to others um they may if they choose
 
01:51:47.510 --> 01:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
pay in advance so if it's more
 
01:51:49.109 --> 01:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
convenient for them to pay we have some
 
01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
retirees that pay for the entire year in
 
01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:52.470 align:start position:0%
retirees that pay for the entire year in
advance

01:51:52.470 --> 01:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
advance
 
01:51:54.390 --> 01:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
they're welcome to do that but we found
 
01:51:56.070 --> 01:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
that it's more manageable for them on a
 
01:51:58.229 --> 01:51:58.239 align:start position:0%
monthly basis to do it once a month just
 
01:51:59.510 --> 01:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
like they get their monthly pension
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
check you get a monthly pension check at
 
01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
the end of every month there's a check
 
01:52:06.709 --> 01:52:06.719 align:start position:0%
sent to our retirees so we withhold once
 
01:52:09.990 --> 01:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:11.990 --> 01:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you i have a question
 
01:52:14.070 --> 01:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
you said that you have a contract with
 
01:52:16.950 --> 01:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
aetna for a zero per month
 
01:52:19.510 --> 01:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
premium so why are you billing people to
 
01:52:22.629 --> 01:52:22.639 align:start position:0%
cover zero sure good question i was
 
01:52:24.790 --> 01:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
waiting for that one
 
01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
that is actually so remember we also
 
01:52:28.709 --> 01:52:28.719 align:start position:0%
have prescription drug benefits so don't
 
01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639 align:start position:0%
forget about those so the zero front
 
01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
does not include drugs correct that is
 
01:52:36.629 --> 01:52:36.639 align:start position:0%
100 medical only so anything you get for
 
01:52:38.790 --> 01:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
your medical services is through aetna
 
01:52:40.229 --> 01:52:40.239 align:start position:0%
and your prescription drug is still
 
01:52:40.239 --> 01:52:41.030 align:start position:0%
and your prescription drug is still
through

01:52:41.030 --> 01:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:52:42.709 --> 01:52:42.719 align:start position:0%
the prescription drug benefit is through
 
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
express scripts also a medicare
 
01:52:48.629 --> 01:52:48.639 align:start position:0%
sponsored plan subject to the same rules
 
01:52:50.790 --> 01:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
we have to comply with them as well
 
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
because i was wondering because that's
 
01:52:54.790 --> 01:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
that seemed like an extraordinarily good
 
01:52:56.550 --> 01:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
deal and i can't see why you would need
 
01:52:56.560 --> 01:52:57.430 align:start position:0%
deal and i can't see why you would need
to

01:52:57.430 --> 01:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:52:59.589 --> 01:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
deduct zero every month and then bill
 
01:53:02.070 --> 01:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
them for it but if there's a separate
 
01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
charge for the drug coverage
 
01:53:07.109 --> 01:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
thank you that makes a little more sense
 
01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much i think you've
 
01:53:13.830 --> 01:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
covered that
 
01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:33.910 --> 01:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman members of the
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
committee i'm roy schweiker from concord
 
01:53:36.719 --> 01:53:37.669 align:start position:0%
committee i'm roy schweiker from concord
and

01:53:37.669 --> 01:53:37.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:39.270 --> 01:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
i did not take a position on this
 
01:53:40.709 --> 01:53:40.719 align:start position:0%
particular bill i don't know enough
 
01:53:42.229 --> 01:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
about it i assume
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
those people have explained it carefully
 
01:53:46.390 --> 01:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
but i'd like to mention a germain
 
01:53:48.390 --> 01:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
amendment which will save the state
 
01:53:51.910 --> 01:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
money improve conditions for retirees
 
01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:52.870 align:start position:0%
money improve conditions for retirees
and

01:53:52.870 --> 01:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:55.510 --> 01:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
help new hampshire businesses
 
01:53:57.669 --> 01:53:57.679 align:start position:0%
as they've explained to you
 
01:53:59.510 --> 01:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
there are separate
 
01:54:01.350 --> 01:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
contracts and policies for the drug
 
01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:02.390 align:start position:0%
contracts and policies for the drug
benefit

01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:54:03.430 --> 01:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:54:05.910 --> 01:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
medicare part two benefit
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
and right now
 
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
retirees are required to accept both or
 
01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:10.870 align:start position:0%
retirees are required to accept both or
neither

01:54:10.870 --> 01:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
neither
 
01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
they cannot choose one or the other
 
01:54:15.270 --> 01:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
and this has been a concern of retirees
 
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
one person at a
 
01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
meeting said well when i have adequate
 
01:54:22.470 --> 01:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
health coverage from my husband's job
 
01:54:24.790 --> 01:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
but i'd like the drug benefit
 
01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:25.830 align:start position:0%
but i'd like the drug benefit
and

01:54:25.830 --> 01:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:27.430 --> 01:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
my case and those of other people is
 
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
different that we feel the drug benefit
 
01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:31.510 align:start position:0%
different that we feel the drug benefit
is

01:54:31.510 --> 01:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
terrible and we'd rather choose our own
 
01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
there's a highly so
 
01:54:37.830 --> 01:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
large number of competitive drug
 
01:54:39.430 --> 01:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
benefits available
 
01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
through medicare
 
01:54:42.629 --> 01:54:42.639 align:start position:0%
that we could get on our own but you're
 
01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
only allowed to have one
 
01:54:46.070 --> 01:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
so because we're retired to take the one
 
01:54:47.270 --> 01:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
from the state
 
01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:48.719 align:start position:0%
we cannot
 
01:54:51.589 --> 01:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
choose our own even if we do not accept
 
01:54:53.189 --> 01:54:53.199 align:start position:0%
the state subsidy
 
01:54:55.030 --> 01:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
so if you would add a third thing to
 
01:54:56.149 --> 01:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:54:58.470 --> 01:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
that retirees are allowed to choose
 
01:55:00.629 --> 01:55:00.639 align:start position:0%
either or both of the two separately
 
01:55:02.550 --> 01:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
that would save the state money from
 
01:55:04.870 --> 01:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
retirees that didn't choose
 
01:55:06.470 --> 01:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
one or the other
 
01:55:08.470 --> 01:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
it would uh make things better for
 
01:55:10.149 --> 01:55:10.159 align:start position:0%
retirees who could get themselves a
 
01:55:11.910 --> 01:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
better plan
 
01:55:13.830 --> 01:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
for less money than they're paying now
 
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
even for more money than they're paying
 
01:55:19.350 --> 01:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
now the one that suits their needs and
 
01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
one of my chief gripes about it is
 
01:55:24.229 --> 01:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
that essentially you're required to buy
 
01:55:26.790 --> 01:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
your thing from a mail order pharmacy
 
01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
i don't have a secure mailbox
 
01:55:30.229 --> 01:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
and while the drugs i'm getting are not
 
01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
anything that a drug addict would want
 
01:55:33.750 --> 01:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
they don't know that if they can steal
 
01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:34.470 align:start position:0%
they don't know that if they can steal
them

01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:55:36.390 --> 01:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
so i may wind up without drugs not
 
01:55:37.750 --> 01:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
knowing they're missing
 
01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
and ultimately you know what do i do
 
01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's a pain
 
01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
whereas if we allowed people to choose
 
01:55:46.149 --> 01:55:46.159 align:start position:0%
their own drug plan then they could
 
01:55:48.070 --> 01:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
choose a drug plan that gave a
 
01:55:49.510 --> 01:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable co-pay to a new
 
01:55:51.189 --> 01:55:51.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire-based business
 
01:55:53.109 --> 01:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
i know someone that has a drug plan
 
01:55:54.870 --> 01:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
through walmart that their typical
 
01:55:56.950 --> 01:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
payment for a month's supply of drugs is
 
01:55:58.870 --> 01:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
like 50 cents
 
01:56:01.109 --> 01:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
whereas once again that's a problem with
 
01:56:01.119 --> 01:56:02.149 align:start position:0%
whereas once again that's a problem with
this

01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:56:03.830 --> 01:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
one of the ways that in fact the state
 
01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
has saved money on the prescription drug
 
01:56:06.550 --> 01:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
plan is
 
01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
the minimum charge for a generic drug
 
01:56:12.070 --> 01:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
used to be a dollar it's now ten dollars
 
01:56:13.910 --> 01:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
you know that's nine dollars that's a
 
01:56:16.470 --> 01:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
900 increase well obviously that's one
 
01:56:18.070 --> 01:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
way to keep costs down
 
01:56:19.990 --> 01:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
but you know it's a hassle for those of
 
01:56:21.990 --> 01:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
us who are paying it and why we don't
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
see this drug plan that the state has
 
01:56:27.430 --> 01:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
got for us is being particularly useful
 
01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:28.550 align:start position:0%
got for us is being particularly useful
and

01:56:28.550 --> 01:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:30.229 --> 01:56:30.239 align:start position:0%
at the last hearing someone said oh yes
 
01:56:32.709 --> 01:56:32.719 align:start position:0%
you can get them at a local pharmacy so
 
01:56:35.030 --> 01:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
i brought the sheep today yes
 
01:56:36.550 --> 01:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
i can get a three-month supply for ten
 
01:56:38.149 --> 01:56:38.159 align:start position:0%
dollars mail order
 
01:56:39.669 --> 01:56:39.679 align:start position:0%
but it cost me ten dollars for a one
 
01:56:41.830 --> 01:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
month supply at a pharmacy so i'm paying
 
01:56:44.229 --> 01:56:44.239 align:start position:0%
triple as much to buy it locally and
 
01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
apparently i can only get it one month
 
01:56:47.669 --> 01:56:47.679 align:start position:0%
at a time so i've got to go in every
 
01:56:49.830 --> 01:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
month wasting gas instead of picking up
 
01:56:52.070 --> 01:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
a three-month supply whereas if i was
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
able to choose one of the many available
 
01:56:57.270 --> 01:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
drug plans then
 
01:56:59.669 --> 01:56:59.679 align:start position:0%
i would be able to have a better system
 
01:57:02.149 --> 01:57:02.159 align:start position:0%
for myself would save the state money
 
01:57:03.910 --> 01:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
because they're not paying the 80 of my
 
01:57:05.910 --> 01:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
drug subsidy i'd be helping new
 
01:57:07.750 --> 01:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire businesses
 
01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:09.109 align:start position:0%
hampshire businesses
so

01:57:09.109 --> 01:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:12.229 --> 01:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
and once again last time i said maybe
 
01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
the state should
 
01:57:16.310 --> 01:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
you know take a random sample of you
 
01:57:18.229 --> 01:57:18.239 align:start position:0%
know plan participants without their
 
01:57:21.030 --> 01:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
names and run the drugs through you know
 
01:57:23.030 --> 01:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
different alternative plans to see
 
01:57:24.950 --> 01:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
whether the one they chose is
 
01:57:27.109 --> 01:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
you know most beneficial to retirees
 
01:57:29.030 --> 01:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
well they didn't do that of course
 
01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:29.830 align:start position:0%
well they didn't do that of course
and

01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:57:31.270 --> 01:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
if they try and tell you they can't
 
01:57:32.709 --> 01:57:32.719 align:start position:0%
split the twos up separately i think
 
01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
it's really because they're afraid
 
01:57:36.709 --> 01:57:36.719 align:start position:0%
they'd lose so many customers from the
 
01:57:38.310 --> 01:57:38.320 align:start position:0%
drug side of the thing that it would
 
01:57:40.470 --> 01:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
show how bad their plan is
 
01:57:42.709 --> 01:57:42.719 align:start position:0%
so no that's what i have to say thank
 
01:57:42.719 --> 01:57:44.310 align:start position:0%
so no that's what i have to say thank
you

01:57:44.310 --> 01:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:57:46.149 --> 01:57:46.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony yes working
 
01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
on pearson thank you um i appreciate the
 
01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
concept that you're bringing forward
 
01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:53.430 align:start position:0%
concept that you're bringing forward
truly

01:57:53.430 --> 01:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:55.990 --> 01:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
what you're asking would be would work
 
01:57:58.390 --> 01:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
fantastically to be filed next year
 
01:58:00.310 --> 01:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
because it would have to be studied that
 
01:58:02.149 --> 01:58:02.159 align:start position:0%
that's a change that is
 
01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
is substantial
 
01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
i think it has merit but i it would
 
01:58:07.750 --> 01:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
definitely be something that we would
 
01:58:09.910 --> 01:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
it would be extraordinarily difficult to
 
01:58:12.229 --> 01:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
tack on as an amendment to to something
 
01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:14.719 align:start position:0%
that that's such a substantive pop
 
01:58:16.950 --> 01:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
change in operation
 
01:58:18.070 --> 01:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:58:20.149 --> 01:58:20.159 align:start position:0%
so i i would suggest that you find
 
01:58:20.159 --> 01:58:21.109 align:start position:0%
so i i would suggest that you find
someone

01:58:21.109 --> 01:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
someone
 
01:58:23.030 --> 01:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
to file this this piece of legislation
 
01:58:25.109 --> 01:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
this fall for next year
 
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
is that a question
 
01:58:28.950 --> 01:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
no that's just a little bit of advice on
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
the process
 
01:58:32.070 --> 01:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
well i i don't understand why this is
 
01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
such a major change all you're doing is
 
01:58:35.750 --> 01:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
some people would get a bill for one
 
01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:36.629 align:start position:0%
some people would get a bill for one
amount

01:58:36.629 --> 01:58:36.639 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:58:37.830 --> 01:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
some people would get a bill for the
 
01:58:39.189 --> 01:58:39.199 align:start position:0%
other month which apparently actually is
 
01:58:39.199 --> 01:58:40.149 align:start position:0%
other month which apparently actually is
zero

01:58:40.149 --> 01:58:40.159 align:start position:0%
zero
 
01:58:41.510 --> 01:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
so it just means that some people would
 
01:58:43.270 --> 01:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
get a bill and others wouldn't
 
01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
i don't see that as a substantial change
 
01:58:47.109 --> 01:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
at all i see it as a simple change that
 
01:58:49.109 --> 01:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
would help retirees help businesses in
 
01:58:53.430 --> 01:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:55.510 --> 01:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your suggestion we'll take
 
01:58:57.350 --> 01:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
it under advisement
 
01:58:58.870 --> 01:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your testimony are
 
01:59:02.870 --> 01:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
there any any actual questions
 
01:59:02.880 --> 01:59:03.910 align:start position:0%
there any any actual questions
represents

01:59:03.910 --> 01:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
represents
 
01:59:05.990 --> 01:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
like us
 
01:59:08.070 --> 01:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
represents did you have a question nope
 
01:59:10.950 --> 01:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you they're just twitching
 
01:59:15.270 --> 01:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
is there any other member of the public
 
01:59:20.070 --> 01:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
that wishes to testify on senate bill
 
01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:23.109 align:start position:0%
that wishes to testify on senate bill
356

01:59:23.109 --> 01:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none i'll close the
 
01:59:27.510 --> 01:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
01:59:28.870 --> 01:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
and we will be
 
01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
resuming the hearing on
 
03:16:07.349 --> 03:16:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:07.359 --> 03:16:08.469 align:start position:0%
 
hey

03:16:08.469 --> 03:16:08.479 align:start position:0%
hey
 
03:16:08.479 --> 03:16:09.349 align:start position:0%
hey

03:16:09.349 --> 03:16:09.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:16:13.910 --> 03:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
we're i'm resuming the hearing on
 
03:16:15.830 --> 03:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
03:16:18.150 --> 03:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
and i have commissioner arlinghaus here
 
03:16:26.229 --> 03:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:28.469 --> 03:16:28.479 align:start position:0%
that was fast hi i'm charlie arlinghaus
 
03:16:29.750 --> 03:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
i'm the commissioner of administrative
 
03:16:31.830 --> 03:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
services and i'm going to do my best to
 
03:16:36.710 --> 03:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:39.349 --> 03:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
every every year or two years there is a
 
03:16:41.910 --> 03:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
clean up bill to
 
03:16:43.590 --> 03:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
codify the actions of the joint
 
03:16:45.910 --> 03:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
committee on employee classification
 
03:16:47.510 --> 03:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
that committee evaluates all
 
03:16:49.590 --> 03:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions has a number of
 
03:16:49.600 --> 03:16:50.550 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions has a number of
other

03:16:50.550 --> 03:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:16:50.560 --> 03:16:51.590 align:start position:0%
other
uh

03:16:51.590 --> 03:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:16:53.110 --> 03:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
smaller duties that they don't often
 
03:16:54.710 --> 03:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
exercise but the biggest thing they do
 
03:16:56.550 --> 03:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
is they look at all of the unclassified
 
03:16:56.560 --> 03:16:57.750 align:start position:0%
is they look at all of the unclassified
positions

03:16:57.750 --> 03:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
positions
 
03:16:59.269 --> 03:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
the classified positions are
 
03:17:00.550 --> 03:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
administered by the division of
 
03:17:00.560 --> 03:17:01.830 align:start position:0%
administered by the division of
personnel

03:17:01.830 --> 03:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
03:17:04.469 --> 03:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
and reclassification decisions etc an
 
03:17:06.389 --> 03:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
ongoing thing that's happening is the
 
03:17:08.070 --> 03:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
03:17:09.349 --> 03:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
had for
 
03:17:11.670 --> 03:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
quite some years with their their older
 
03:17:13.990 --> 03:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
positions which are referred to
 
03:17:17.110 --> 03:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
as terry morton positions um
 
03:17:18.790 --> 03:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
had been putting people in them without
 
03:17:20.469 --> 03:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
regard to what they did
 
03:17:23.110 --> 03:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
and uh and so a lot of changes were made
 
03:17:24.309 --> 03:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
where you would have somebody who was a
 
03:17:26.070 --> 03:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
dentist who was actually the
 
03:17:27.510 --> 03:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
functionally the chief information
 
03:17:29.510 --> 03:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
technology officer they just tried to
 
03:17:31.830 --> 03:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
match the salary with the person
 
03:17:33.510 --> 03:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
03:17:35.510 --> 03:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
made them go back and take all of those
 
03:17:38.309 --> 03:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
positions which i believe is about 80
 
03:17:40.710 --> 03:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
and they are one by one by one
 
03:17:44.309 --> 03:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
um having them be actively codified so
 
03:17:46.790 --> 03:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
that the position questionnaire on
 
03:17:48.950 --> 03:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
record has been evaluated like all
 
03:17:51.349 --> 03:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
others and matches so every time you see
 
03:17:52.790 --> 03:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
one of these bills you'll see a handful
 
03:17:54.950 --> 03:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
of those there are something like six of
 
03:17:56.630 --> 03:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
those in this bill
 
03:17:58.070 --> 03:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
where they take somebody and they and
 
03:18:00.150 --> 03:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
they make the title match occasionally
 
03:18:01.670 --> 03:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
the title does match but occasionally
 
03:18:03.269 --> 03:18:03.279 align:start position:0%
somebody was
 
03:18:04.630 --> 03:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
serving in a role and that's not
 
03:18:06.550 --> 03:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
actually what they did so these are now
 
03:18:06.560 --> 03:18:07.590 align:start position:0%
actually what they did so these are now
fully

03:18:07.590 --> 03:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
fully
 
03:18:10.790 --> 03:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
classified according to the
 
03:18:12.630 --> 03:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
evaluation of a group called corn fairy
 
03:18:14.710 --> 03:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
hay which is a national classification
 
03:18:17.269 --> 03:18:17.279 align:start position:0%
group with which we have a contract so
 
03:18:20.150 --> 03:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
that's one subset of them
 
03:18:21.590 --> 03:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
that occasionally happens with other
 
03:18:23.030 --> 03:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
positions assistant commissioner of
 
03:18:24.790 --> 03:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
insurance is like that
 
03:18:26.630 --> 03:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
the assistant commissioner insurance
 
03:18:29.670 --> 03:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
position was classified quite some time
 
03:18:29.680 --> 03:18:30.630 align:start position:0%
position was classified quite some time
ago

03:18:30.630 --> 03:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
ago
 
03:18:32.070 --> 03:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
and their duties
 
03:18:34.309 --> 03:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
aren't what they were then so you have
 
03:18:37.349 --> 03:18:37.359 align:start position:0%
that um that commission look at it jcec
 
03:18:39.190 --> 03:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
ratifies that there are a number of
 
03:18:40.710 --> 03:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
other positions a bunch of which happen
 
03:18:42.469 --> 03:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
to be mine
 
03:18:44.630 --> 03:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
where we took positions at senior
 
03:18:46.070 --> 03:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
leadership positions that had been
 
03:18:46.080 --> 03:18:47.349 align:start position:0%
leadership positions that had been
classified

03:18:47.349 --> 03:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
classified
 
03:18:49.190 --> 03:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
and they are now unclassified when you
 
03:18:50.630 --> 03:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
do that you have to have those positions
 
03:18:52.550 --> 03:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
evaluated as well
 
03:18:56.229 --> 03:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
and what this bill does is simply
 
03:18:59.030 --> 03:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
codify the result of those decisions
 
03:18:59.040 --> 03:19:00.070 align:start position:0%
codify the result of those decisions
where

03:19:00.070 --> 03:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:19:02.150 --> 03:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
a questionnaire is filled out
 
03:19:05.670 --> 03:19:05.680 align:start position:0%
it is sent to corn fairy slash hay group
 
03:19:08.790 --> 03:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
to the two groups merged um to evaluate
 
03:19:11.830 --> 03:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
it according to the uh their proprietary
 
03:19:13.670 --> 03:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
evaluation software
 
03:19:16.070 --> 03:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
like like a classification project it
 
03:19:17.990 --> 03:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
then comes back as presented to the
 
03:19:19.990 --> 03:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
joint committee the joint committee
 
03:19:22.150 --> 03:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
ratifies it it then becomes effective
 
03:19:23.590 --> 03:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
but the committee is required to do a
 
03:19:27.510 --> 03:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
cleanup bill to put it into the statute
 
03:19:27.520 --> 03:19:29.910 align:start position:0%
cleanup bill to put it into the statute
941

03:19:29.910 --> 03:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
941
 
03:19:31.990 --> 03:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
that's what's happening globally i can
 
03:19:33.750 --> 03:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
talk about specific positions if you
 
03:19:35.750 --> 03:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
need maybe
 
03:19:38.389 --> 03:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
i hope so does this
 
03:19:40.790 --> 03:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
this includes the salary ranges for the
 
03:19:42.950 --> 03:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
positions in your department the deputy
 
03:19:44.950 --> 03:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
director and so forth we made
 
03:19:47.110 --> 03:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
unclassified last year
 
03:19:47.120 --> 03:19:48.070 align:start position:0%
unclassified last year
yes

03:19:48.070 --> 03:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:19:51.190 --> 03:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
so the so the letter grade to the left
 
03:19:53.670 --> 03:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
if you look at the bill and you see gg
 
03:19:55.269 --> 03:19:55.279 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
03:19:56.870 --> 03:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
deputy director division of financial
 
03:19:58.790 --> 03:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
data management
 
03:20:02.469 --> 03:20:02.479 align:start position:0%
gg is a grade is a is a is a labor grade
 
03:20:05.830 --> 03:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
a salary range with seven steps in it in
 
03:20:08.710 --> 03:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
the classified system they're numbered
 
03:20:10.710 --> 03:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
one through 35. i don't think we have
 
03:20:12.790 --> 03:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
any ones anymore but and in the
 
03:20:14.710 --> 03:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
unclassified system they're lettered a
 
03:20:14.720 --> 03:20:15.130 align:start position:0%
unclassified system they're lettered a
through

03:20:15.130 --> 03:20:15.140 align:start position:0%
through
 
03:20:15.140 --> 03:20:16.710 align:start position:0%
through
[Music]

03:20:16.710 --> 03:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:20:19.349 --> 03:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
actually aaa through something
 
03:20:21.349 --> 03:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
it's two letters not one because in
 
03:20:21.359 --> 03:20:25.750 align:start position:0%
it's two letters not one because in
2010ish

03:20:25.750 --> 03:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:27.190 --> 03:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
all the positions in state government
 
03:20:29.670 --> 03:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
were redone and to save confusion they
 
03:20:31.510 --> 03:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
did a double letter instead of a single
 
03:20:31.520 --> 03:20:33.110 align:start position:0%
did a double letter instead of a single
letter

03:20:33.110 --> 03:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
letter
 
03:20:35.670 --> 03:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
or to create confusion either yes
 
03:20:42.150 --> 03:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:43.670 --> 03:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
excuse me i've been sitting here so
 
03:20:46.070 --> 03:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
quiet today that i forgot
 
03:20:46.080 --> 03:20:47.510 align:start position:0%
quiet today that i forgot
um

03:20:47.510 --> 03:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:49.670 --> 03:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
maybe this has been mentioned and uh i
 
03:20:51.830 --> 03:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
was distracted but what's the difference
 
03:20:53.349 --> 03:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
in pay range
 
03:20:57.590 --> 03:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
between say a gg and an hh
 
03:20:59.990 --> 03:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
roughly it's a good question i'm going
 
03:21:04.309 --> 03:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:08.309 --> 03:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say about 5
 
03:21:09.910 --> 03:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
no that's too high it's going to be more
 
03:21:11.910 --> 03:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
like four percent i can look them up the
 
03:21:13.110 --> 03:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
the grades are published they're
 
03:21:16.150 --> 03:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
actually on our website if you go to uh
 
03:21:18.550 --> 03:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
das website and human resources is an
 
03:21:20.550 --> 03:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
unclassified salary schedule if you get
 
03:21:22.710 --> 03:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
to job classification but
 
03:21:25.030 --> 03:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
um but i'm gonna guess that it's about
 
03:21:25.040 --> 03:21:26.950 align:start position:0%
um but i'm gonna guess that it's about
um

03:21:26.950 --> 03:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:29.190 --> 03:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
about four thousand dollars on a on a
 
03:21:32.469 --> 03:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
maximum pay of a hundred and
 
03:21:34.790 --> 03:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
six hundred and eight in in that range i
 
03:21:36.389 --> 03:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
can i can send the committee if you want
 
03:21:38.150 --> 03:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
the unclassified schedule no that
 
03:21:40.550 --> 03:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't thank you
 
03:21:42.790 --> 03:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
representative blackist and then scitec
 
03:21:44.389 --> 03:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
03:21:45.590 --> 03:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you can answer this
 
03:21:47.910 --> 03:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
question but looking here not only are
 
03:21:49.590 --> 03:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
the titles changed
 
03:21:50.830 --> 03:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
um but
 
03:21:54.710 --> 03:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
the the salary uh range letters have
 
03:21:56.389 --> 03:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
changed for a number of these
 
03:21:58.550 --> 03:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
and you know they're they're higher so
 
03:21:58.560 --> 03:21:59.830 align:start position:0%
and you know they're they're higher so
presumably

03:21:59.830 --> 03:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
presumably
 
03:22:01.349 --> 03:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
some people are going to be getting paid
 
03:22:01.359 --> 03:22:02.550 align:start position:0%
some people are going to be getting paid
more

03:22:02.550 --> 03:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:22:05.349 --> 03:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
um and given that i am disturbed that
 
03:22:06.950 --> 03:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
there's not a fiscal note on this i mean
 
03:22:07.990 --> 03:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
they must know how many of these
 
03:22:10.229 --> 03:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
employees there are in these positions
 
03:22:12.389 --> 03:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
and uh and what the increase is and all
 
03:22:14.389 --> 03:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
that so do you is there some reason you
 
03:22:16.229 --> 03:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
know of why there's no fiscal note or
 
03:22:18.150 --> 03:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
well what would typically happen in a
 
03:22:20.469 --> 03:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
situation like this is as as a result of
 
03:22:23.349 --> 03:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
this change your budget does not change
 
03:22:24.950 --> 03:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
it it you're gonna have to ask you might
 
03:22:26.150 --> 03:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
have to ask for something different in
 
03:22:28.550 --> 03:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
the next salary in the next budget but
 
03:22:30.389 --> 03:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
you're expected to absorb the costs
 
03:22:32.070 --> 03:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
within your existing budget so you're
 
03:22:34.070 --> 03:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
not granted additional budget budget
 
03:22:36.469 --> 03:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
authority for this so in terms of the
 
03:22:39.510 --> 03:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
overall state spend
 
03:22:41.269 --> 03:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
the state spend isn't changing so let's
 
03:22:42.950 --> 03:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
just say you have a salary line where
 
03:22:44.870 --> 03:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
your class
 
03:22:46.870 --> 03:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
typically class 11 or 12 is where these
 
03:22:48.790 --> 03:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
are budgeted let's say your class 11
 
03:22:51.750 --> 03:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
line is uh you know 262 thousand dollars
 
03:22:53.590 --> 03:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
and uh and this happens
 
03:22:56.630 --> 03:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
um you're still limited to that 262 000
 
03:22:58.630 --> 03:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
and that uh so that doesn't change in
 
03:23:00.630 --> 03:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
terms of a fiscal impact from a
 
03:23:02.790 --> 03:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
budgetary standpoint um you have no
 
03:23:05.429 --> 03:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
additional spending authority
 
03:23:07.190 --> 03:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:23:09.110 --> 03:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
i take it that the
 
03:23:14.070 --> 03:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:15.590 --> 03:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
typically the
 
03:23:17.429 --> 03:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
let's say for example so seven steps
 
03:23:20.070 --> 03:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
right in the unclassified range step six
 
03:23:23.750 --> 03:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
of uh of a of a lower grade is the same
 
03:23:26.150 --> 03:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
as step five of a higher grade
 
03:23:28.710 --> 03:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
because of oddities over time the
 
03:23:31.190 --> 03:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
unclassified ranges are a little bit
 
03:23:31.200 --> 03:23:32.309 align:start position:0%
unclassified ranges are a little bit
weirder

03:23:32.309 --> 03:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
weirder
 
03:23:34.389 --> 03:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
that that's almost perfectly done in the
 
03:23:35.990 --> 03:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
classified system where you move
 
03:23:38.070 --> 03:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
diagonally along a grid and you can just
 
03:23:40.630 --> 03:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
go bang the same number um the
 
03:23:42.790 --> 03:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
unclassified system odd things happen
 
03:23:45.110 --> 03:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
where there are slight anomalies but
 
03:23:47.750 --> 03:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
generally speaking a five is the same as
 
03:23:50.309 --> 03:23:50.319 align:start position:0%
six of the one one away from it
 
03:23:52.389 --> 03:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of overlap thank you
 
03:23:54.870 --> 03:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
represent follow-up
 
03:23:57.750 --> 03:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so um
 
03:23:59.750 --> 03:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
it might i mean i don't know how raises
 
03:24:02.070 --> 03:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
are handled but uh so this might provide
 
03:24:04.070 --> 03:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
some mild pressure for increases in the
 
03:24:06.229 --> 03:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
future but it won't do anything in the
 
03:24:07.990 --> 03:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
short term i guess
 
03:24:10.229 --> 03:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
i mean if somebody's in at a lower
 
03:24:12.150 --> 03:24:12.160 align:start position:0%
i know i knew how the salaries worked at
 
03:24:14.309 --> 03:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
places i work but uh you know if you're
 
03:24:15.670 --> 03:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
the lower end of the salary range
 
03:24:17.429 --> 03:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
assuming you're doing well you're more
 
03:24:18.950 --> 03:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
likely to get more of a raise than if
 
03:24:20.070 --> 03:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
you're towards the higher end of your
 
03:24:21.510 --> 03:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
salary range and i don't know if that's
 
03:24:23.510 --> 03:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
true that's not true in state government
 
03:24:26.550 --> 03:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
so in state government uh the the in the
 
03:24:28.469 --> 03:24:28.479 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining the because it's a
 
03:24:30.469 --> 03:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
unionized system right the collective
 
03:24:32.950 --> 03:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement will will um if one
 
03:24:35.110 --> 03:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
is signed will typically have an
 
03:24:35.120 --> 03:24:36.229 align:start position:0%
is signed will typically have an
adjustment

03:24:36.229 --> 03:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
adjustment
 
03:24:37.830 --> 03:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
often referred to as a cost of living
 
03:24:39.510 --> 03:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
adjustment because it tends to track
 
03:24:41.349 --> 03:24:41.359 align:start position:0%
what that doesn't have to
 
03:24:43.750 --> 03:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
um but it but it tends to
 
03:24:47.110 --> 03:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
your your raises i have no discretion in
 
03:24:49.910 --> 03:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
granting good performers about uh more
 
03:24:49.920 --> 03:24:51.429 align:start position:0%
granting good performers about uh more
money

03:24:51.429 --> 03:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:24:53.510 --> 03:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
that's not part of the state system
 
03:24:55.190 --> 03:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
merit is although it's called a merit
 
03:24:55.200 --> 03:24:56.630 align:start position:0%
merit is although it's called a merit
system

03:24:56.630 --> 03:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:24:59.030 --> 03:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
performance bonuses etc are not part of
 
03:25:00.150 --> 03:25:00.160 align:start position:0%
it um
 
03:25:02.229 --> 03:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
you're moving from one step to another
 
03:25:04.550 --> 03:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
you're in step five moving to a step six
 
03:25:07.190 --> 03:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
is governed by um statute or the cba and
 
03:25:09.429 --> 03:25:09.439 align:start position:0%
it's and it's based on longevity
 
03:25:11.269 --> 03:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
03:25:11.279 --> 03:25:14.150 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
representative

03:25:14.150 --> 03:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:16.229 --> 03:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
and representative pearson thank you
 
03:25:18.870 --> 03:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:21.429 --> 03:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
as with the private sector
 
03:25:25.269 --> 03:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:28.870 --> 03:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:32.110 --> 03:25:32.120 align:start position:0%
picture that is painted in what is
 
03:25:34.070 --> 03:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily competitive market in
 
03:25:37.110 --> 03:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has the inability to
 
03:25:39.110 --> 03:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
fill some of these positions been
 
03:25:41.110 --> 03:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
factored into the classification rate
 
03:25:41.120 --> 03:25:42.469 align:start position:0%
factored into the classification rate
change

03:25:42.469 --> 03:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
change
 
03:25:42.479 --> 03:25:43.269 align:start position:0%
change
no

03:25:43.269 --> 03:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:25:44.950 --> 03:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
technically the classification system
 
03:25:46.870 --> 03:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
both in the unclassified and classified
 
03:25:48.830 --> 03:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
range is based on is based on job
 
03:25:51.830 --> 03:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
content and it is specifically forbidden
 
03:25:53.750 --> 03:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
to use um
 
03:25:55.990 --> 03:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
in in this in this provision it's
 
03:25:58.150 --> 03:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
forbidden to use um
 
03:26:00.229 --> 03:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
uh recruitment difficulties for that
 
03:26:01.590 --> 03:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
which is why you end up seeing things
 
03:26:04.309 --> 03:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
for example nursing positions um tend to
 
03:26:06.790 --> 03:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
have an enhanced pay their their job
 
03:26:09.030 --> 03:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
content determines a number but you
 
03:26:10.710 --> 03:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
can't hire people at that number so
 
03:26:11.910 --> 03:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
there are there are a couple of
 
03:26:13.429 --> 03:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
extraordinary measures that you can do
 
03:26:15.429 --> 03:26:15.439 align:start position:0%
that the one exception to that in the
 
03:26:17.190 --> 03:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
unclassified system that's very rarely
 
03:26:20.630 --> 03:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
done but it is done on occasion the the
 
03:26:23.670 --> 03:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
most the easy easiest to explain uh
 
03:26:26.070 --> 03:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
version is medical examiners
 
03:26:28.070 --> 03:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
if you do if you evaluate a medical
 
03:26:30.710 --> 03:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
examiner on job content they they come
 
03:26:32.389 --> 03:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
in at a fairly high number
 
03:26:33.750 --> 03:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
but not that high because it's
 
03:26:35.750 --> 03:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
apparently not
 
03:26:37.510 --> 03:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
i don't want to know how to phrase this
 
03:26:39.670 --> 03:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
exactly it's not that complicated
 
03:26:41.590 --> 03:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
but there just aren't that many people
 
03:26:44.150 --> 03:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
who want to cut up dead bodies for a
 
03:26:44.160 --> 03:26:45.269 align:start position:0%
who want to cut up dead bodies for a
living

03:26:45.269 --> 03:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
living
 
03:26:47.510 --> 03:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
so uh you can't hire somebody at the
 
03:26:49.590 --> 03:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
number that comes up with so there's a
 
03:26:52.150 --> 03:26:52.160 align:start position:0%
there is a range established in in
 
03:26:55.030 --> 03:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
statute it's a section of 941
 
03:26:57.190 --> 03:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
for that which is frankly double roughly
 
03:26:59.269 --> 03:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
what they were evaluated at they make a
 
03:27:01.510 --> 03:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
great deal more than say the governor
 
03:27:03.750 --> 03:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
the one if you look at the bottom of the
 
03:27:03.760 --> 03:27:04.950 align:start position:0%
the one if you look at the bottom of the
bill

03:27:04.950 --> 03:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:27:06.950 --> 03:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh subparagraph three
 
03:27:08.790 --> 03:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
salary adjustment for recruitment and
 
03:27:08.800 --> 03:27:10.389 align:start position:0%
salary adjustment for recruitment and
retention

03:27:10.389 --> 03:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
retention
 
03:27:10.399 --> 03:27:12.150 align:start position:0%
retention
um

03:27:12.150 --> 03:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:14.150 --> 03:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
this is this is done the unclassified i
 
03:27:15.830 --> 03:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
think there are seven positions where
 
03:27:17.349 --> 03:27:17.359 align:start position:0%
this has been done
 
03:27:18.710 --> 03:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
and this one the deputy director of
 
03:27:20.309 --> 03:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
accounting services is the deputy
 
03:27:20.319 --> 03:27:21.590 align:start position:0%
accounting services is the deputy
comptroller

03:27:21.590 --> 03:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
comptroller
 
03:27:24.229 --> 03:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
and uh the comptroller salary is off
 
03:27:24.239 --> 03:27:25.110 align:start position:0%
and uh the comptroller salary is off
grid

03:27:25.110 --> 03:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
grid
 
03:27:27.030 --> 03:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
and the deputy comptroller salary is
 
03:27:29.429 --> 03:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
grid by a percentage
 
03:27:32.950 --> 03:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
so she has a range outside she currently
 
03:27:35.750 --> 03:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
sherry rockburn has a range outside of
 
03:27:37.750 --> 03:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
that grid which actually in this case
 
03:27:37.760 --> 03:27:39.110 align:start position:0%
that grid which actually in this case
approximates

03:27:39.110 --> 03:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
approximates
 
03:27:42.150 --> 03:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
somewhere between a g and an h
 
03:27:43.670 --> 03:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
okay i can i can appreciate the fact
 
03:27:45.110 --> 03:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
that the medical examiner's patients
 
03:27:46.870 --> 03:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
rarely complain
 
03:27:48.550 --> 03:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
but the
 
03:27:50.229 --> 03:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
the fact is is that we have some
 
03:27:52.229 --> 03:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
positions in government that we just are
 
03:27:55.750 --> 03:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
not getting filled yes so if
 
03:27:58.630 --> 03:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
if there if we're prohibited
 
03:28:02.150 --> 03:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
from changing the grade on these
 
03:28:02.160 --> 03:28:02.950 align:start position:0%
from changing the grade on these
to

03:28:02.950 --> 03:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:28:06.469 --> 03:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
balance or match market conditions
 
03:28:08.950 --> 03:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
is the state suffering
 
03:28:11.030 --> 03:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
in the sense that we have
 
03:28:13.190 --> 03:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
fairly important functions here that are
 
03:28:15.510 --> 03:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
just not being performed because our
 
03:28:18.150 --> 03:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
hands are tied with the with the system
 
03:28:19.990 --> 03:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
that i if i'm understanding you collect
 
03:28:21.750 --> 03:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
really can't be modified to deal with
 
03:28:24.150 --> 03:28:24.160 align:start position:0%
market conditions in in this part of the
 
03:28:25.830 --> 03:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
process they can't be modified there are
 
03:28:27.910 --> 03:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
a couple of methods for modifying them
 
03:28:29.269 --> 03:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
and i mentioned nurses because they're
 
03:28:31.670 --> 03:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
the most prominent example where nursing
 
03:28:34.950 --> 03:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
salaries are enhanced by sometimes 45
 
03:28:37.269 --> 03:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
because that's that's what nurses get
 
03:28:39.269 --> 03:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
and so there are increasingly there's
 
03:28:40.790 --> 03:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
something like a thousand positions in
 
03:28:42.630 --> 03:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
state government where where they have
 
03:28:45.190 --> 03:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
an enhanced range it's not based on job
 
03:28:47.429 --> 03:28:47.439 align:start position:0%
content but there's an enhancement
 
03:28:49.750 --> 03:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
um in the unclassified ranks it it's
 
03:28:52.630 --> 03:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
many fewer again six or seven
 
03:28:52.640 --> 03:28:54.550 align:start position:0%
many fewer again six or seven
um

03:28:54.550 --> 03:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:56.550 --> 03:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
in um
 
03:28:58.950 --> 03:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
the system is old
 
03:29:02.389 --> 03:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
old-fashioned and uh awkward
 
03:29:03.830 --> 03:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
and we are
 
03:29:05.429 --> 03:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
currently doing a lot there's a lot of
 
03:29:06.710 --> 03:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
work being done through the division of
 
03:29:08.630 --> 03:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
personnel to look at the classification
 
03:29:10.710 --> 03:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
system how it's organized how it's
 
03:29:10.720 --> 03:29:11.910 align:start position:0%
system how it's organized how it's
arranged

03:29:11.910 --> 03:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
arranged
 
03:29:14.630 --> 03:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
and and what what we can do with it to
 
03:29:17.269 --> 03:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
make it more modern it was established
 
03:29:19.190 --> 03:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
in our case it's you know most of it
 
03:29:21.030 --> 03:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
goes back to president garfield
 
03:29:23.030 --> 03:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
um it was established in our case as a
 
03:29:24.710 --> 03:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
result of social security amendments in
 
03:29:27.269 --> 03:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
1939 governor murphy
 
03:29:29.429 --> 03:29:29.439 align:start position:0%
and um at the time there's a vision of
 
03:29:31.030 --> 03:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
the system that's functionally clerks
 
03:29:33.590 --> 03:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
and supervisors right that everybody's
 
03:29:35.429 --> 03:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
cat everybody's job is either a clerk or
 
03:29:37.750 --> 03:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
a supervisor and so it's very simple to
 
03:29:39.190 --> 03:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
classify it's just not how the world
 
03:29:41.510 --> 03:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
works frankly it wasn't then and
 
03:29:43.030 --> 03:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
certainly isn't now
 
03:29:44.950 --> 03:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
and we're in the process of you have to
 
03:29:46.630 --> 03:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
evaluate somebody with significant
 
03:29:49.030 --> 03:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
computer skills um against somebody
 
03:29:51.110 --> 03:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
who's a purchasing agent and their jobs
 
03:29:54.229 --> 03:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
aren't related or comparable that well
 
03:29:55.990 --> 03:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
um but we do it so we're looking at
 
03:29:57.429 --> 03:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
changing the system
 
03:29:59.670 --> 03:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
i i think one of those things is going
 
03:30:01.429 --> 03:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
to have to be one of the factors we do a
 
03:30:02.950 --> 03:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
factor analysis
 
03:30:04.710 --> 03:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
is going to have to be some sort of a
 
03:30:06.710 --> 03:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
sort of a market factor you have to be
 
03:30:07.990 --> 03:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
careful about doing that because the
 
03:30:09.349 --> 03:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
system is i mean there are a couple
 
03:30:10.870 --> 03:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
things one is it is
 
03:30:12.550 --> 03:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
it is a is controlled by collective
 
03:30:14.150 --> 03:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements and you have to
 
03:30:16.710 --> 03:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
take that into consideration always in
 
03:30:18.229 --> 03:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
addition to that it's the government
 
03:30:20.469 --> 03:30:20.479 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not a private company
 
03:30:22.469 --> 03:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
where people can uh people can make
 
03:30:24.870 --> 03:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
decisions and there are responsibilities
 
03:30:27.429 --> 03:30:27.439 align:start position:0%
to the taxpayers um in terms of
 
03:30:30.309 --> 03:30:30.319 align:start position:0%
transparency and in terms of equity and
 
03:30:32.630 --> 03:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of ensuring that people don't
 
03:30:35.110 --> 03:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
benefit from favoritism
 
03:30:37.110 --> 03:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
that require
 
03:30:39.670 --> 03:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
a more complicated structure but are we
 
03:30:41.190 --> 03:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
suffering i would say we're suffering in
 
03:30:43.349 --> 03:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
the same way that everybody else is our
 
03:30:45.750 --> 03:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
our vacancy rates are higher than
 
03:30:45.760 --> 03:30:46.870 align:start position:0%
our vacancy rates are higher than
historical

03:30:46.870 --> 03:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
historical
 
03:30:48.630 --> 03:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
averages which tend to be
 
03:30:52.389 --> 03:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
9 to 11 and we're we're at about 17
 
03:30:52.399 --> 03:30:53.429 align:start position:0%
9 to 11 and we're we're at about 17
um

03:30:53.429 --> 03:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:55.590 --> 03:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
but they're coming down a little bit and
 
03:30:58.309 --> 03:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
um hiring is a lot of work but if you
 
03:30:59.510 --> 03:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
stick your nose to the grindstone you
 
03:31:00.550 --> 03:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
can hire
 
03:31:02.229 --> 03:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
i interviewed two i
 
03:31:04.309 --> 03:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
interview and i do typically do final
 
03:31:06.950 --> 03:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
interviews um with two to three people a
 
03:31:09.910 --> 03:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
week on average over the last uh
 
03:31:12.710 --> 03:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
25 weeks so we're bringing people in
 
03:31:14.950 --> 03:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes from other agencies don't tell
 
03:31:16.950 --> 03:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
them but um
 
03:31:20.950 --> 03:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:24.550 --> 03:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
other representatives and then
 
03:31:27.510 --> 03:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um just an aside
 
03:31:29.269 --> 03:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
strange that you mentioned president
 
03:31:31.510 --> 03:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
garfield as i recall he was
 
03:31:33.910 --> 03:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
assassinated by a disappointed office
 
03:31:33.920 --> 03:31:35.269 align:start position:0%
assassinated by a disappointed office
seeker

03:31:35.269 --> 03:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
seeker
 
03:31:38.710 --> 03:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
but seriously my my question is in line
 
03:31:41.190 --> 03:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
with representative lake is from the
 
03:31:43.510 --> 03:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
standpoint do you know why
 
03:31:45.510 --> 03:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
they were unable to
 
03:31:47.990 --> 03:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
give us a fiscal note on this i
 
03:31:50.550 --> 03:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
i was able to i started looking at this
 
03:31:50.560 --> 03:31:51.670 align:start position:0%
i was able to i started looking at this
bill

03:31:51.670 --> 03:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:31:53.349 --> 03:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
and for example
 
03:31:58.389 --> 03:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
if you look at rsa 99 or 94 colon 1
 
03:32:01.910 --> 03:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
the rates for like the starting rate at
 
03:32:04.229 --> 03:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
each grade is there
 
03:32:06.309 --> 03:32:06.319 align:start position:0%
and i just looked at the assistant
 
03:32:07.510 --> 03:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the insurance
 
03:32:07.520 --> 03:32:08.950 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the insurance
department

03:32:08.950 --> 03:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:32:12.870 --> 03:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
the starting rate at ee is 68 000
 
03:32:15.990 --> 03:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
and this would move him to a gg
 
03:32:18.630 --> 03:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
which is 78 000
 
03:32:22.710 --> 03:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
seems like it would be fairly simple to
 
03:32:24.870 --> 03:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
rate the cause one's concern of
 
03:32:27.269 --> 03:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
representative schuett is that there are
 
03:32:28.870 --> 03:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
probably only one person in that
 
03:32:31.269 --> 03:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
position and it probably matters a great
 
03:32:33.510 --> 03:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
deal whether he's at step one or step
 
03:32:33.520 --> 03:32:34.550 align:start position:0%
deal whether he's at step one or step
seven

03:32:34.550 --> 03:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
seven
 
03:32:37.190 --> 03:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
well i'm still guessing and all of these
 
03:32:39.349 --> 03:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
i imagine are very
 
03:32:41.110 --> 03:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
it's not like you say you've got a labor
 
03:32:43.190 --> 03:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
grade 27 clerk
 
03:32:44.870 --> 03:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
because there's lots of them
 
03:32:46.070 --> 03:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
there's one
 
03:32:48.550 --> 03:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
in one of each and you'd
 
03:32:50.630 --> 03:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
and they i'm not sure they'd be willing
 
03:32:52.469 --> 03:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
to make a quick and dirty guess that
 
03:32:54.710 --> 03:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like their style i think
 
03:32:57.030 --> 03:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
the other i think the other point on the
 
03:32:59.190 --> 03:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
on the fiscal impact is again it's a
 
03:33:02.070 --> 03:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact is a budgetary impact and
 
03:33:03.750 --> 03:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
as with the reclassification in the
 
03:33:06.469 --> 03:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
classified system you are expected to
 
03:33:09.670 --> 03:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
absorb it in your budget this is not
 
03:33:11.110 --> 03:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
this is not an attempt to get you
 
03:33:12.710 --> 03:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
additional budget authority so in that
 
03:33:15.269 --> 03:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
respect there's not a fiscal impact you
 
03:33:17.349 --> 03:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
do not have to appropriate more money we
 
03:33:19.590 --> 03:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
will not cut a warrant
 
03:33:21.590 --> 03:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
of any sort on the basis of this piece
 
03:33:24.229 --> 03:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
of legislation so typically like a if
 
03:33:25.750 --> 03:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
there's a fiscal impact it's something
 
03:33:28.150 --> 03:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
where or at the end of it when it passes
 
03:33:29.830 --> 03:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
somebody goes over to the bureau of
 
03:33:32.150 --> 03:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
accounts and we end up having a warrant
 
03:33:33.590 --> 03:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
and they do the monthly summary of
 
03:33:35.510 --> 03:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
warrant adjustments there's a warrant
 
03:33:37.190 --> 03:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
um there's an adjustment to the
 
03:33:38.950 --> 03:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
appropriations the appropriations unit
 
03:33:41.030 --> 03:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
is involved in this particular case that
 
03:33:43.429 --> 03:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
won't happen because you again you're
 
03:33:45.510 --> 03:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
you're absorbing it within your budget
 
03:33:46.870 --> 03:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
if there are adjustments to be made
 
03:33:48.630 --> 03:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
they're both salary adjustment funds and
 
03:33:50.710 --> 03:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
benefit adjustment funds but that's a
 
03:33:52.389 --> 03:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
it's a separate process and there's not
 
03:33:54.389 --> 03:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
an additional appropriation and i think
 
03:33:56.710 --> 03:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's the real story i will note
 
03:33:58.150 --> 03:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
about president garfield that in fact
 
03:34:00.710 --> 03:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
that's exactly why
 
03:34:03.110 --> 03:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
president arthur after he died passed
 
03:34:05.110 --> 03:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
the civil service reform bill was
 
03:34:06.870 --> 03:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
because he got killed by a disgruntled
 
03:34:10.469 --> 03:34:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:12.630 --> 03:34:12.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the history lesson
 
03:34:14.469 --> 03:34:14.479 align:start position:0%
is there are there any other questions
 
03:34:15.910 --> 03:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
for the commissioner
 
03:34:17.990 --> 03:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt you're good okay
 
03:34:19.269 --> 03:34:19.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:34:20.870 --> 03:34:20.880 align:start position:0%

all right well thank you for coming
 
03:34:23.750 --> 03:34:23.760 align:start position:0%

pleasure to introduce this
bill

03:35:08.469 --> 03:35:08.479 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:35:10.870 --> 03:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
together with my colleague senator
 
03:35:10.880 --> 03:35:11.910 align:start position:0%
together with my colleague senator
carson

03:35:11.910 --> 03:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
carson
 
03:35:15.110 --> 03:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh we teamed up to give you the largest
 
03:35:15.120 --> 03:35:15.990 align:start position:0%
uh we teamed up to give you the largest
bill

03:35:15.990 --> 03:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:35:18.550 --> 03:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh of the session i think
 
03:35:20.710 --> 03:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
what do you think yeah
 
03:35:21.750 --> 03:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
what an
 
03:35:25.990 --> 03:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:28.469 --> 03:35:28.479 align:start position:0%
in any case
 
03:35:30.790 --> 03:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
these are two separate sections brought
 
03:35:32.710 --> 03:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
together in the senate
 
03:35:35.110 --> 03:35:35.120 align:start position:0%
because they both involve
 
03:35:38.550 --> 03:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
compacts with other states
 
03:35:43.510 --> 03:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
in the case of the original legislation
 
03:35:47.910 --> 03:35:47.920 align:start position:0%

03:36:01.830 --> 03:36:01.840 align:start position:0%

10 states

before it is enacted
 
03:36:08.950 --> 03:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
there are currently
 
03:36:10.950 --> 03:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
seven states that have
 
03:36:13.830 --> 03:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
entered into the compact
 
03:36:15.830 --> 03:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
those seven states include maine
 
03:36:15.840 --> 03:36:17.030 align:start position:0%
those seven states include maine
maryland

03:36:17.030 --> 03:36:17.040 align:start position:0%

the

03:36:27.349 --> 03:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:36:30.229 --> 03:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
there are 15 other states
 
03:36:33.510 --> 03:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
that are considering licensure
 
03:36:35.830 --> 03:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
just as we are
 
03:36:37.990 --> 03:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
so it's very likely during this

that
 
03:36:45.910 --> 03:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
this the minimum number of states to

existing statutes conditions need to be

03:37:13.429 --> 03:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
03:37:16.790 --> 03:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
if a person wishes to be licensed in new
 
03:37:19.030 --> 03:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire they'll pay the fee
 
03:37:21.510 --> 03:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
they just won't go through as
 
03:37:23.830 --> 03:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
much of a
 
03:37:23.840 --> 03:37:25.110 align:start position:0%
much of a
review

03:37:25.110 --> 03:37:25.120 align:start position:0%
review
 
03:37:27.510 --> 03:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
because they are in another compact
 
03:37:27.520 --> 03:37:28.469 align:start position:0%
because they are in another compact
state

03:37:28.469 --> 03:37:28.479 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:37:30.389 --> 03:37:30.399 align:start position:0%
which has agreed to live by the same
 
03:37:33.269 --> 03:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
standards any kind of discipline
 
03:37:33.279 --> 03:37:34.070 align:start position:0%
standards any kind of discipline
that

03:37:34.070 --> 03:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:37:35.830 --> 03:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
03:37:38.870 --> 03:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
would exercise over a practicing
 
03:37:41.269 --> 03:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
licensed person
 
03:37:44.389 --> 03:37:44.399 align:start position:0%
would apply to a person who is in a
 
03:37:46.309 --> 03:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
reciprocity state and has sought
 
03:37:49.110 --> 03:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
licensure in new hampshire
 
03:37:49.120 --> 03:37:53.910 align:start position:0%
licensure in new hampshire
so

03:37:53.910 --> 03:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:56.070 --> 03:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
the other thing i'd like to to point out
 
03:37:57.830 --> 03:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:37:59.590 --> 03:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
other than maine
 
03:38:02.790 --> 03:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
there is no other new england state
 
03:38:04.950 --> 03:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
currently considering
 
03:38:08.229 --> 03:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
entering into this in this year
 
03:38:11.670 --> 03:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
that's good news for new hampshire
 
03:38:13.110 --> 03:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
we all know
 
03:38:14.950 --> 03:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
the mental health
 
03:38:16.790 --> 03:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
counseling needs that there are in the
 
03:38:18.790 --> 03:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
state they affect every region in the
 
03:38:18.800 --> 03:38:20.389 align:start position:0%
state they affect every region in the
state

03:38:20.389 --> 03:38:20.399 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:38:23.190 --> 03:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
we have people that are waiting
 
03:38:25.510 --> 03:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
excessive periods of time
 
03:38:28.309 --> 03:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
particularly if they are medicaid
 
03:38:28.319 --> 03:38:30.710 align:start position:0%
particularly if they are medicaid
payers

03:38:30.710 --> 03:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
payers
 
03:38:30.720 --> 03:38:31.830 align:start position:0%
payers
and

03:38:31.830 --> 03:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:38:34.950 --> 03:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
we need to solve this problem creatively
 
03:38:37.110 --> 03:38:37.120 align:start position:0%
and so i think that the
 
03:38:39.590 --> 03:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
department of
 
03:38:41.990 --> 03:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
03:38:44.790 --> 03:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
has brought forth a
 
03:38:44.800 --> 03:38:46.229 align:start position:0%
has brought forth a
worthwhile

03:38:46.229 --> 03:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
worthwhile
 
03:38:48.790 --> 03:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
proposal that can begin to address those
 
03:38:54.790 --> 03:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:57.030 --> 03:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
there are endorsements that you should
 
03:38:59.429 --> 03:38:59.439 align:start position:0%
have received from the american
 
03:39:01.830 --> 03:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
psychology associate american counseling
 
03:39:01.840 --> 03:39:03.189 align:start position:0%
psychology associate american counseling
association

03:39:03.189 --> 03:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
association
 
03:39:05.269 --> 03:39:05.279 align:start position:0%
and also the united states department of
 
03:39:05.279 --> 03:39:07.030 align:start position:0%
and also the united states department of
defense

03:39:07.030 --> 03:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
defense
 
03:39:08.950 --> 03:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
why would the department of defense
 
03:39:11.429 --> 03:39:11.439 align:start position:0%
enter into this
 
03:39:13.670 --> 03:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
debate in new hampshire
 
03:39:15.670 --> 03:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
it's because
 
03:39:17.110 --> 03:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
when their
 
03:39:19.910 --> 03:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
military counseling personnel
 
03:39:23.030 --> 03:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
are discharged from military service
 
03:39:26.070 --> 03:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
they begin to consider what other states
 
03:39:28.550 --> 03:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
they would wish to be licensed in or
 
03:39:29.990 --> 03:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
practice in
 
03:39:30.000 --> 03:39:30.790 align:start position:0%
practice in
so

03:39:30.790 --> 03:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:39:32.790 --> 03:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
the reciprocity agreement is an
 
03:39:35.910 --> 03:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
important step for military personnel to
 
03:39:38.229 --> 03:39:38.239 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
03:39:40.469 --> 03:39:40.479 align:start position:0%
choose the state and
 
03:39:43.750 --> 03:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
not have an excessive burden on them
 
03:39:45.750 --> 03:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
to be re-licensed
 
03:39:48.150 --> 03:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
in another state
 
03:39:50.150 --> 03:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
and this is the new hampshire advantage
 
03:39:53.990 --> 03:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
that comes from authorizing this compact
 
03:39:55.830 --> 03:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
is that uh
 
03:39:57.670 --> 03:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
i know this from
 
03:39:57.680 --> 03:39:59.110 align:start position:0%
i know this from
our

03:39:59.110 --> 03:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:40:00.870 --> 03:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
region 10
 
03:40:03.269 --> 03:40:03.279 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
03:40:03.279 --> 03:40:04.469 align:start position:0%
mental health
department

03:40:04.469 --> 03:40:04.479 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:40:04.479 --> 03:40:05.510 align:start position:0%
department
uh

03:40:05.510 --> 03:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:40:07.750 --> 03:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
it is that when
 
03:40:07.760 --> 03:40:08.630 align:start position:0%
it is that when
people

03:40:08.630 --> 03:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:40:12.630 --> 03:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
seek to be licensed we are not as quick
 
03:40:14.389 --> 03:40:14.399 align:start position:0%
as other states
 
03:40:16.229 --> 03:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
in that process
 
03:40:16.239 --> 03:40:17.910 align:start position:0%
in that process
and

03:40:17.910 --> 03:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:40:20.389 --> 03:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
people have turned down jobs in new
 
03:40:23.830 --> 03:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire because those processes are
 
03:40:25.990 --> 03:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
faster in other states
 
03:40:28.070 --> 03:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
this is an accelerator
 
03:40:30.469 --> 03:40:30.479 align:start position:0%
this compact would accelerate those
 
03:40:30.479 --> 03:40:31.670 align:start position:0%
this compact would accelerate those
licensing

03:40:31.670 --> 03:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
03:40:34.309 --> 03:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
from out-of-state
 
03:40:35.750 --> 03:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
qualified people
 
03:40:37.189 --> 03:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
into new hampshire
 
03:40:39.590 --> 03:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
and give us a competitive advantage in
 
03:40:41.269 --> 03:40:41.279 align:start position:0%
attracting people from other states who
 
03:40:44.070 --> 03:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
are looking to relocate in new england
 
03:40:44.080 --> 03:40:44.950 align:start position:0%
are looking to relocate in new england
so

03:40:44.950 --> 03:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:40:48.229 --> 03:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
that's why this is before you uh and why
 
03:40:51.110 --> 03:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
i believe the the senate gave uh such a
 
03:40:54.630 --> 03:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
positive endorsement uh to this compact
 
03:40:56.469 --> 03:40:56.479 align:start position:0%
and there are people there is a
 
03:40:58.790 --> 03:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
representative from uh professional
 
03:41:01.269 --> 03:41:01.279 align:start position:0%
licensure and certification present
 
03:41:04.469 --> 03:41:04.479 align:start position:0%
uh to answer additional questions
 
03:41:06.950 --> 03:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
but i'd be glad to hear what yours are
 
03:41:09.269 --> 03:41:09.279 align:start position:0%
and maybe deflect them over to mr
 
03:41:09.279 --> 03:41:10.389 align:start position:0%
and maybe deflect them over to mr
shoemaker

03:41:10.389 --> 03:41:10.399 align:start position:0%
shoemaker
 
03:41:12.309 --> 03:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
i do have one question
 
03:41:15.030 --> 03:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
i know that we don't just license mental
 
03:41:17.030 --> 03:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
health counselors we've got social
 
03:41:17.040 --> 03:41:17.990 align:start position:0%
health counselors we've got social
workers

03:41:17.990 --> 03:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
workers
 
03:41:20.229 --> 03:41:20.239 align:start position:0%
and psychologists and pastoral
 
03:41:22.630 --> 03:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
psychotherapists the whole bit and
 
03:41:24.389 --> 03:41:24.399 align:start position:0%
they're all very
 
03:41:27.510 --> 03:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
jealously maintaining their distinctions
 
03:41:29.269 --> 03:41:29.279 align:start position:0%
does this address that or just says
 
03:41:30.710 --> 03:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
you're a counselor
 
03:41:32.630 --> 03:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
it's a counselor
 
03:41:37.830 --> 03:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:39.990 --> 03:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
it's only for mental health counselors
 
03:41:42.790 --> 03:41:42.800 align:start position:0%

03:41:48.630 --> 03:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh it may
 
03:41:50.389 --> 03:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
cover pastoral
 
03:41:50.399 --> 03:41:52.550 align:start position:0%
cover pastoral
counseling

03:41:52.550 --> 03:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
counseling
 
03:41:57.030 --> 03:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
but it is for the counseling statute
 
03:41:59.429 --> 03:41:59.439 align:start position:0%
so it's for only one of the multiple
 
03:42:01.110 --> 03:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
03:42:03.910 --> 03:42:03.920 align:start position:0%

senator for
 
03:42:17.830 --> 03:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
keeping the paper mills in business
 
03:42:17.840 --> 03:42:18.950 align:start position:0%
keeping the paper mills in business
the

03:42:18.950 --> 03:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:42:20.070 --> 03:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
question that i have and this is
 
03:42:21.429 --> 03:42:21.439 align:start position:0%
something that kind of holds true with a
 
03:42:23.670 --> 03:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
lot of the compacts that we enter into
 
03:42:25.750 --> 03:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
03:42:28.710 --> 03:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
and you brought up uh discipline
 
03:42:28.720 --> 03:42:31.110 align:start position:0%
and you brought up uh discipline
so

03:42:31.110 --> 03:42:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:32.550 --> 03:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
and we've now you know there's no
 
03:42:32.560 --> 03:42:33.990 align:start position:0%
and we've now you know there's no
uniform

03:42:33.990 --> 03:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
uniform
 
03:42:35.349 --> 03:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
continuity here between some of these
 
03:42:37.510 --> 03:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
compacts if a provider in new hampshire
 
03:42:39.269 --> 03:42:39.279 align:start position:0%
has a complainary problem in another
 
03:42:39.279 --> 03:42:40.950 align:start position:0%
has a complainary problem in another
state

03:42:40.950 --> 03:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:42:43.030 --> 03:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
is that handled in new hampshire or is
 
03:42:44.950 --> 03:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
it handled in the other state and then
 
03:42:47.990 --> 03:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
vice versa if we have a provider that's
 
03:42:50.710 --> 03:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
you know say from maryland
 
03:42:52.630 --> 03:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
and there's a complaint registered in
 
03:42:54.790 --> 03:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is that handled
 
03:42:56.229 --> 03:42:56.239 align:start position:0%
in maryland
 
03:42:57.590 --> 03:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
or new hampshire you see what i'm
 
03:43:00.229 --> 03:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
getting at so does this does this cover
 
03:43:00.239 --> 03:43:01.830 align:start position:0%
getting at so does this does this cover
that

03:43:01.830 --> 03:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:43:03.590 --> 03:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
it does
 
03:43:03.600 --> 03:43:05.830 align:start position:0%
it does
and

03:43:05.830 --> 03:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:43:08.309 --> 03:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
mr shoemaker i but i
 
03:43:11.750 --> 03:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
stand up if i get this wrong i believe
 
03:43:14.070 --> 03:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
that the adjudication of that takes
 
03:43:15.910 --> 03:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
place in the state in which the service
 
03:43:21.269 --> 03:43:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:23.269 --> 03:43:23.279 align:start position:0%
and the results are reported to the home
 
03:43:25.510 --> 03:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
state correct
 
03:43:27.830 --> 03:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you okay
 
03:43:29.510 --> 03:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
represent black us
 
03:43:30.469 --> 03:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:43:32.309 --> 03:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
um if i understood you correctly you
 
03:43:34.630 --> 03:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
said that
 
03:43:36.229 --> 03:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
if there's somebody who's licensed in
 
03:43:38.070 --> 03:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
another state is part of the compact and
 
03:43:39.750 --> 03:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
we're part of the compact
 
03:43:41.189 --> 03:43:41.199 align:start position:0%
they could come to new hampshire they
 
03:43:42.550 --> 03:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
would still need to get a new hampshire
 
03:43:45.110 --> 03:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
license but the procedure would be
 
03:43:46.870 --> 03:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
abbreviated because they'd already met
 
03:43:48.870 --> 03:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
some requirements is that correct yes
 
03:43:50.790 --> 03:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
okay follow up or get into the actual
 
03:43:50.800 --> 03:43:51.750 align:start position:0%
okay follow up or get into the actual
question

03:43:51.750 --> 03:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:43:53.030 --> 03:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
um i'm looking i was looking at the
 
03:43:54.790 --> 03:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
telehealth section so that's a thing
 
03:43:54.800 --> 03:43:55.750 align:start position:0%
telehealth section so that's a thing
where

03:43:55.750 --> 03:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:43:57.510 --> 03:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
somebody's still residing in another
 
03:43:59.189 --> 03:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
state and they're going to be
 
03:44:01.110 --> 03:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
have a client in new hampshire as i
 
03:44:03.110 --> 03:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
03:44:05.349 --> 03:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
do they have to in that case get a new
 
03:44:07.189 --> 03:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire license as i read this i think
 
03:44:09.110 --> 03:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
the answer is no but could you confirm
 
03:44:09.120 --> 03:44:13.189 align:start position:0%
the answer is no but could you confirm
that

03:44:13.189 --> 03:44:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:16.070 --> 03:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think that this requires that i
 
03:44:17.910 --> 03:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
think there are other
 
03:44:19.750 --> 03:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
bills that are before the legislature
 
03:44:20.950 --> 03:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
this year
 
03:44:20.960 --> 03:44:22.070 align:start position:0%
this year
that

03:44:22.070 --> 03:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:44:24.950 --> 03:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
if you are practicing
 
03:44:27.269 --> 03:44:27.279 align:start position:0%
taking clients in this state you need to
 
03:44:29.429 --> 03:44:29.439 align:start position:0%
be licensed in this state
 
03:44:30.469 --> 03:44:30.479 align:start position:0%
we have
 
03:44:33.110 --> 03:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
currently emergency and probationary
 
03:44:33.120 --> 03:44:35.269 align:start position:0%
currently emergency and probationary
licensure

03:44:35.269 --> 03:44:35.279 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
03:44:37.429 --> 03:44:37.439 align:start position:0%
and that too is another bill before the
 
03:44:39.349 --> 03:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
legislature to extend
 
03:44:39.359 --> 03:44:40.870 align:start position:0%
legislature to extend
probationary

03:44:40.870 --> 03:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
probationary
 
03:44:43.030 --> 03:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
licensure temp i'm sorry temporary
 
03:44:43.040 --> 03:44:44.550 align:start position:0%
licensure temp i'm sorry temporary
licensure

03:44:44.550 --> 03:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
03:44:47.189 --> 03:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
for another two years through
 
03:44:50.309 --> 03:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
january of 2024.
 
03:44:50.319 --> 03:44:52.389 align:start position:0%
january of 2024.
so

03:44:52.389 --> 03:44:52.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:44:54.870 --> 03:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
there are a variety of vehicles for
 
03:44:56.790 --> 03:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
an out-of-state practitioner to provide
 
03:44:58.710 --> 03:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
telehealth services in the state of new
 
03:44:58.720 --> 03:45:00.309 align:start position:0%
telehealth services in the state of new
hampshire

03:45:00.309 --> 03:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:45:00.319 --> 03:45:01.910 align:start position:0%
hampshire
um

03:45:01.910 --> 03:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:01.920 --> 03:45:03.750 align:start position:0%
um
follow-up

03:45:03.750 --> 03:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:45:05.189 --> 03:45:05.199 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm just wondering if someone else
 
03:45:08.070 --> 03:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
here later can speak to this or if that
 
03:45:09.670 --> 03:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
could be looked into because i'm looking
 
03:45:09.680 --> 03:45:11.030 align:start position:0%
could be looked into because i'm looking
at

03:45:11.030 --> 03:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:45:14.229 --> 03:45:14.239 align:start position:0%

and as i read it it says that they can
 
03:45:22.469 --> 03:45:22.479 align:start position:0%
do it and they don't it doesn't say they
 
03:45:24.070 --> 03:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
have to have a new hampshire license so
 
03:45:25.990 --> 03:45:26.000 align:start position:0%

madam chair
 
03:46:58.309 --> 03:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
please um we've had a number of bills
 
03:47:01.429 --> 03:47:01.439 align:start position:0%
dealing with the issue of telehealth um
 
03:47:03.349 --> 03:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
you'll find that there was a piece in
 
03:47:05.830 --> 03:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
here there's also a piece in a bill
 
03:47:07.510 --> 03:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
that's going to be going to hhs i
 
03:47:09.990 --> 03:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
believe it's senate bill 430 so you
 
03:47:11.830 --> 03:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
might want to take a look at that
 
03:47:14.070 --> 03:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
we also had a bill last week
 
03:47:16.469 --> 03:47:16.479 align:start position:0%
dealing with telehealth and one of the
 
03:47:19.030 --> 03:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
things that we discovered was that
 
03:47:22.630 --> 03:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire in 2016 joined a medical
 
03:47:26.469 --> 03:47:26.479 align:start position:0%
doctor's compact that recognizes the
 
03:47:28.790 --> 03:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
license of doctors from other states
 
03:47:31.429 --> 03:47:31.439 align:start position:0%
currently there are 31
 
03:47:33.189 --> 03:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
states that are part of that compact
 
03:47:35.590 --> 03:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
other states are have legislation
 
03:47:38.389 --> 03:47:38.399 align:start position:0%
pending on that and what it does is it
 
03:47:40.309 --> 03:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
recognizes the fact that they're a
 
03:47:42.070 --> 03:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
doctor in good standing in their state
 
03:47:43.510 --> 03:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
and it makes it very
 
03:47:45.349 --> 03:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
easy for them to get a reciprocal
 
03:47:47.349 --> 03:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
license here in new hampshire
 
03:47:51.110 --> 03:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
there's also statutes dealing with
 
03:47:53.910 --> 03:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
doc exempting doctors that are on the
 
03:47:56.070 --> 03:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
border states surrounding us
 
03:47:59.189 --> 03:47:59.199 align:start position:0%
for requirements for licensure and we
 
03:48:01.830 --> 03:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
also put in an amendment
 
03:48:05.110 --> 03:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
to fill that small hole that exists with
 
03:48:06.630 --> 03:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
doctors that are not part of the the
 
03:48:08.150 --> 03:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
states that are not a part of this other
 
03:48:10.309 --> 03:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
compact that they're going to be able to
 
03:48:12.389 --> 03:48:12.399 align:start position:0%
be get to get a reciprocal license here
 
03:48:13.990 --> 03:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire if they're in good
 
03:48:15.750 --> 03:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
standing in their state so i think
 
03:48:17.429 --> 03:48:17.439 align:start position:0%
there's a number of different pieces of
 
03:48:19.429 --> 03:48:19.439 align:start position:0%
legislation that's moving through the
 
03:48:21.269 --> 03:48:21.279 align:start position:0%
legislature right now dealing with
 
03:48:24.630 --> 03:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
telehealth okay thank you you're welcome
 
03:48:27.830 --> 03:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
madam chair um what i'd like to do
 
03:48:30.309 --> 03:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
is i have i i was asked to draw up an
 
03:48:32.469 --> 03:48:32.479 align:start position:0%
amendment i had it drawn up
 
03:48:34.710 --> 03:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
to present to the committee
 
03:48:37.510 --> 03:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
for your consideration um is that okay
 
03:48:39.429 --> 03:48:39.439 align:start position:0%
if i
 
03:48:41.189 --> 03:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
what's this amendment about this
 
03:48:43.670 --> 03:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
amendment deals with the section of the
 
03:48:47.110 --> 03:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
compact if that i added to this bill
 
03:48:49.910 --> 03:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
because i amended this bill
 
03:48:52.710 --> 03:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
to add in another compact
 
03:48:54.389 --> 03:48:54.399 align:start position:0%
um if you'd like i can speak to that
 
03:48:54.399 --> 03:48:56.389 align:start position:0%
um if you'd like i can speak to that
first

03:48:56.389 --> 03:48:56.399 align:start position:0%
first
 
03:49:00.309 --> 03:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:02.389 --> 03:49:02.399 align:start position:0%
yes i think what other compact you think
 
03:49:04.389 --> 03:49:04.399 align:start position:0%
i might be a little ahead of you
 
03:49:04.399 --> 03:49:05.590 align:start position:0%
i might be a little ahead of you
well

03:49:05.590 --> 03:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:49:08.150 --> 03:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i was asked to
 
03:49:10.870 --> 03:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
bring in an amendment to this compact
 
03:49:13.830 --> 03:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
dealing with a different compact
 
03:49:13.840 --> 03:49:14.710 align:start position:0%
dealing with a different compact
that

03:49:14.710 --> 03:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:49:17.349 --> 03:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
that we are currently a part of it was a
 
03:49:19.670 --> 03:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
compact that was first put together i
 
03:49:21.830 --> 03:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
believe in 1965
 
03:49:23.830 --> 03:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
and we've been a member of and it deals
 
03:49:25.990 --> 03:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
with um children
 
03:49:28.070 --> 03:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh most of the section that we were
 
03:49:29.750 --> 03:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
really interested in was the placement
 
03:49:32.150 --> 03:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
of children across state lines as you
 
03:49:34.469 --> 03:49:34.479 align:start position:0%
all know we're dealing with the uh the
 
03:49:37.910 --> 03:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
tragedy of finding a missing little girl
 
03:49:39.750 --> 03:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
harmony montgomery
 
03:49:39.760 --> 03:49:41.030 align:start position:0%
harmony montgomery
and

03:49:41.030 --> 03:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:49:43.429 --> 03:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
we do know now that she was placed here
 
03:49:45.189 --> 03:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire without a home study
 
03:49:47.269 --> 03:49:47.279 align:start position:0%
being done in fact there was no
 
03:49:49.830 --> 03:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
communication that was between the state
 
03:49:51.910 --> 03:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
of massachusetts and new hampshire about
 
03:49:53.189 --> 03:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
this little girl
 
03:49:55.429 --> 03:49:55.439 align:start position:0%
and we are we are all putting our
 
03:49:59.510 --> 03:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:59.520 --> 03:50:00.550 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:50:00.550 --> 03:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:50:02.710 --> 03:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
when this issue started coming forward i
 
03:50:05.189 --> 03:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
remembered that we had
 
03:50:06.950 --> 03:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
a couple of bills dealing with this
 
03:50:10.389 --> 03:50:10.399 align:start position:0%
issue but unfortunately because of the
 
03:50:12.229 --> 03:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
pandemic they were either part of
 
03:50:14.630 --> 03:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
omnibus bills that got killed or they
 
03:50:16.309 --> 03:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
were just bills that were placed on the
 
03:50:16.319 --> 03:50:17.590 align:start position:0%
were just bills that were placed on the
table

03:50:17.590 --> 03:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
table
 
03:50:19.670 --> 03:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm referring to some of the
 
03:50:22.070 --> 03:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
testimony that i had already given her
 
03:50:24.790 --> 03:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
given on this issue one was senate bill
 
03:50:28.150 --> 03:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
698 the other was senate bill 699 which
 
03:50:32.870 --> 03:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
were filed in 2000 as a request of dhhs
 
03:50:34.389 --> 03:50:34.399 align:start position:0%
and again this was brought forward
 
03:50:36.550 --> 03:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
because of uh the harmony montgomery
 
03:50:36.560 --> 03:50:37.429 align:start position:0%
because of uh the harmony montgomery
clays

03:50:37.429 --> 03:50:37.439 align:start position:0%
clays
 
03:50:39.990 --> 03:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
what my the section of the bill that i
 
03:50:42.550 --> 03:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
amended this particular bill with
 
03:50:44.710 --> 03:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
replaces the current language in rsa
 
03:50:47.110 --> 03:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
170a and would not become effective
 
03:50:50.309 --> 03:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
until 35 states have adopted the compact
 
03:50:52.469 --> 03:50:52.479 align:start position:0%
if we choose to join the compact as one
 
03:50:54.870 --> 03:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
of the original 35 states we'll have a
 
03:50:57.110 --> 03:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
seat at the table which is as you know
 
03:50:59.269 --> 03:50:59.279 align:start position:0%
is very very important as this
 
03:51:01.429 --> 03:51:01.439 align:start position:0%
legislation goes through
 
03:51:03.670 --> 03:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
this compact sets the framework when
 
03:51:05.189 --> 03:51:05.199 align:start position:0%
working with other states to act
 
03:51:07.269 --> 03:51:07.279 align:start position:0%
uniformly with the interstate placement
 
03:51:08.469 --> 03:51:08.479 align:start position:0%
of children
 
03:51:11.510 --> 03:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
and again our current compact is out of
 
03:51:11.520 --> 03:51:12.469 align:start position:0%
and again our current compact is out of
date

03:51:12.469 --> 03:51:12.479 align:start position:0%
date
 
03:51:15.670 --> 03:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
which results in delays with the icpc
 
03:51:15.680 --> 03:51:16.950 align:start position:0%
which results in delays with the icpc
placements

03:51:16.950 --> 03:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
placements
 
03:51:19.189 --> 03:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
so um there's going to be people from
 
03:51:20.710 --> 03:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
the department that are here they're
 
03:51:22.630 --> 03:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
going to be able to speak to this bill
 
03:51:26.469 --> 03:51:26.479 align:start position:0%
but i was asked to bring in an amendment
 
03:51:29.830 --> 03:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
that would put this particular part of
 
03:51:31.750 --> 03:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
the concerning the placement of children
 
03:51:34.630 --> 03:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
into law right away
 
03:51:37.590 --> 03:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:39.750 --> 03:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
again how the committee might feel about
 
03:51:42.150 --> 03:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
that i know it's not the way we usually
 
03:51:44.630 --> 03:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
do things but i was asked to bring in
 
03:51:46.710 --> 03:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
the amendment and so
 
03:51:49.110 --> 03:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
um with the chair's
 
03:51:50.389 --> 03:51:50.399 align:start position:0%
permission yes well if you're just
 
03:51:52.469 --> 03:51:52.479 align:start position:0%
changing the effective date that's not a
 
03:51:53.750 --> 03:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
big deal
 
03:51:56.150 --> 03:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
well it's a little bit more than that
 
03:51:56.160 --> 03:51:57.750 align:start position:0%
well it's a little bit more than that
but

03:51:57.750 --> 03:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:51:59.750 --> 03:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully you folks can just think about
 
03:52:01.269 --> 03:52:01.279 align:start position:0%
it and consider what you would like to
 
03:52:02.870 --> 03:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
do whether you adopt the amendment or
 
03:52:04.309 --> 03:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
not is up to you
 
03:52:06.550 --> 03:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
um well i would like to have suggest
 
03:52:08.150 --> 03:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
that it would have been possible for you
 
03:52:10.950 --> 03:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
to take some bill you didn't like and
 
03:52:13.269 --> 03:52:13.279 align:start position:0%
amended that to include this compact
 
03:52:13.279 --> 03:52:14.469 align:start position:0%
amended that to include this compact
because

03:52:14.469 --> 03:52:14.479 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:52:14.479 --> 03:52:15.349 align:start position:0%
because
the

03:52:15.349 --> 03:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:52:17.189 --> 03:52:17.199 align:start position:0%
interstate compact for the placement of
 
03:52:17.199 --> 03:52:18.309 align:start position:0%
interstate compact for the placement of
children

03:52:18.309 --> 03:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:52:20.150 --> 03:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
more properly belongs in a different
 
03:52:20.160 --> 03:52:21.990 align:start position:0%
more properly belongs in a different
committee

03:52:21.990 --> 03:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:52:24.550 --> 03:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
i would agree that and that's why i
 
03:52:27.590 --> 03:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
believe chairman rice here is from
 
03:52:29.269 --> 03:52:29.279 align:start position:0%
children and family law
 
03:52:29.279 --> 03:52:29.990 align:start position:0%
children and family law
but

03:52:29.990 --> 03:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:52:32.070 --> 03:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
the issue came to edna as you know
 
03:52:34.550 --> 03:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
because it is an interstate compact
 
03:52:37.030 --> 03:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
and this was the only interstate compact
 
03:52:40.870 --> 03:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
that we had so we amended that bill with
 
03:52:43.349 --> 03:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
the kind concession of senator khan and
 
03:52:45.269 --> 03:52:45.279 align:start position:0%
i would like to publicly thank him for
 
03:52:47.670 --> 03:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
allowing us to do this with his bill
 
03:52:49.910 --> 03:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
so what you basically have in front of
 
03:52:53.510 --> 03:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
you are two two different compacts
 
03:52:54.870 --> 03:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
same subject
 
03:52:57.510 --> 03:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
same compact not same compacts but both
 
03:52:59.990 --> 03:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
compacts with different subjects
 
03:53:01.910 --> 03:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
do both these compacts have the clause
 
03:53:03.269 --> 03:53:03.279 align:start position:0%
that says that their rules have the
 
03:53:05.590 --> 03:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
force and effective law whether we pat
 
03:53:07.269 --> 03:53:07.279 align:start position:0%
pass them or not
 
03:53:09.030 --> 03:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
i can't speak to that madam chair i'm
 
03:53:12.389 --> 03:53:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:14.070 --> 03:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
representative lackas
 
03:53:15.590 --> 03:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
03:53:17.429 --> 03:53:17.439 align:start position:0%
so as i understand it
 
03:53:19.349 --> 03:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
this would um
 
03:53:22.550 --> 03:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
repeal rsa 178 and replace it as i
 
03:53:23.750 --> 03:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
understand you said we're part of a
 
03:53:27.349 --> 03:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
compact now and have been since the 60s
 
03:53:29.750 --> 03:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
so and then this new compact as i
 
03:53:31.030 --> 03:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
understand it would take some number of
 
03:53:33.429 --> 03:53:33.439 align:start position:0%
states to join it for it to become
 
03:53:34.790 --> 03:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
go into effect
 
03:53:36.710 --> 03:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
so what are the consequences of as i
 
03:53:38.150 --> 03:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
understand it leaving an existing
 
03:53:40.469 --> 03:53:40.479 align:start position:0%
compact and not joining another one as i
 
03:53:42.389 --> 03:53:42.399 align:start position:0%
understand it until more states sign up
 
03:53:45.830 --> 03:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
is or am i misunderstanding this
 
03:53:48.389 --> 03:53:48.399 align:start position:0%
um thank you um
 
03:53:50.389 --> 03:53:50.399 align:start position:0%
i believe that's what this amendment
 
03:53:53.030 --> 03:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
addresses that if for some reason that
 
03:53:55.110 --> 03:53:55.120 align:start position:0%
we decide we're not going to rejoin the
 
03:53:58.870 --> 03:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
compact this language will be in statute
 
03:54:01.030 --> 03:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
and will allow for the cross-state
 
03:54:03.030 --> 03:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
communication um concerning the
 
03:54:04.790 --> 03:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
placement of children
 
03:54:06.150 --> 03:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
because there's no guarantee that we
 
03:54:08.309 --> 03:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
would join the compact um even though
 
03:54:09.990 --> 03:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
we're already a part of the existing
 
03:54:13.510 --> 03:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
compact um it is a new compact and it's
 
03:54:13.520 --> 03:54:15.349 align:start position:0%
compact um it is a new compact and it's
updating

03:54:15.349 --> 03:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
updating
 
03:54:17.110 --> 03:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
what's in place i mean the world is a
 
03:54:18.710 --> 03:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
very very different place than it was in
 
03:54:18.720 --> 03:54:20.389 align:start position:0%
very very different place than it was in
1965

03:54:20.389 --> 03:54:20.399 align:start position:0%
1965
 
03:54:23.590 --> 03:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
so um but we want to be able to have
 
03:54:25.349 --> 03:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
something in place
 
03:54:27.510 --> 03:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
just in case this fails so quick
 
03:54:30.389 --> 03:54:30.399 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up so is the old
 
03:54:32.950 --> 03:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
compact going away in general or is
 
03:54:34.710 --> 03:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
there some reason we have to leave it
 
03:54:34.720 --> 03:54:36.070 align:start position:0%
there some reason we have to leave it
before

03:54:36.070 --> 03:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
before
 
03:54:38.389 --> 03:54:38.399 align:start position:0%
if we choose to join the new one or
 
03:54:40.229 --> 03:54:40.239 align:start position:0%
how's what's the coordination there
 
03:54:42.070 --> 03:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for that a question
 
03:54:43.510 --> 03:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
representative i believe someone from
 
03:54:45.830 --> 03:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
the department will be able to explain
 
03:54:47.510 --> 03:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
what the mechanics of this is going to
 
03:54:51.590 --> 03:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
do okay thank you yes i also am
 
03:54:55.030 --> 03:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
in the first part of 170a as
 
03:54:57.750 --> 03:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
inserted by the spill it just says the
 
03:54:59.830 --> 03:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
interstate compact for the placement of
 
03:55:01.750 --> 03:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
children and it doesn't say which
 
03:55:04.309 --> 03:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
version that applies to because if you
 
03:55:06.150 --> 03:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
could read this it says well we've it's
 
03:55:09.269 --> 03:55:09.279 align:start position:0%
already been enacted by more than 30 35
 
03:55:09.279 --> 03:55:11.110 align:start position:0%
already been enacted by more than 30 35
states

03:55:11.110 --> 03:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
states
 
03:55:13.030 --> 03:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
we're already there
 
03:55:15.110 --> 03:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
and that would be the old version i hope
 
03:55:17.510 --> 03:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
you fix that language in your amendment
 
03:55:17.520 --> 03:55:19.189 align:start position:0%
you fix that language in your amendment
um

03:55:19.189 --> 03:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:21.269 --> 03:55:21.279 align:start position:0%
we have that amendment so hopefully it's
 
03:55:23.269 --> 03:55:23.279 align:start position:0%
fixed it came from the department
 
03:55:25.990 --> 03:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
um but it's my understanding we we do
 
03:55:28.150 --> 03:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
not have 35 states that have signed on
 
03:55:30.870 --> 03:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
to it yet so but they signed on to the
 
03:55:33.510 --> 03:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
original one yeah this does not specify
 
03:55:37.510 --> 03:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
you know rev a or whatever okay
 
03:55:39.429 --> 03:55:39.439 align:start position:0%
yes representative pearson thank you
 
03:55:41.590 --> 03:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
madam chair in reference to the the 35
 
03:55:41.600 --> 03:55:42.710 align:start position:0%
madam chair in reference to the the 35
number

03:55:42.710 --> 03:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
number
 
03:55:44.870 --> 03:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
the new compact
 
03:55:46.790 --> 03:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
the the enaction of that new compact the
 
03:55:49.030 --> 03:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
threshold is 35 states or is that just
 
03:55:50.229 --> 03:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
you're just referencing the prior
 
03:55:52.950 --> 03:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
compact as far as the num
 
03:55:55.030 --> 03:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding representative is it's
 
03:55:56.870 --> 03:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
35 states
 
03:55:59.110 --> 03:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
35 states have to sign on to it in order
 
03:56:01.269 --> 03:56:01.279 align:start position:0%
for it to become effective unlike the
 
03:56:05.670 --> 03:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:07.349 --> 03:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
i i'm not i think we'll let the expert
 
03:56:09.349 --> 03:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
answer that the expert will be able to
 
03:56:10.550 --> 03:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
answer that
 
03:56:12.469 --> 03:56:12.479 align:start position:0%
can we get that question answered right
 
03:56:13.990 --> 03:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
now rather than
 
03:56:15.990 --> 03:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
he's the next one up if there are no
 
03:56:18.150 --> 03:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
other questions for senator carson thank
 
03:56:18.160 --> 03:56:19.429 align:start position:0%
other questions for senator carson thank
you

03:56:19.429 --> 03:56:19.439 align:start position:0%

03:56:21.269 --> 03:56:21.279 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
03:56:23.830 --> 03:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much senator
 
03:56:25.830 --> 03:56:25.840 align:start position:0%

joe shoemaker i'm the director of the
 
03:56:48.150 --> 03:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
division of licensing and board
 
03:56:49.349 --> 03:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
administration at the office of

professional licensure
 
03:56:54.790 --> 03:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
just to clarify um you know we are here
 
03:56:58.469 --> 03:56:58.479 align:start position:0%
in support of senate bill 397
 
03:57:00.469 --> 03:57:00.479 align:start position:0%
but really the original bill i cannot
 
03:57:02.150 --> 03:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
speak to the compact that was just
 
03:57:03.510 --> 03:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
brought up we're here in support of the
 
03:57:06.229 --> 03:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
mental health counseling compact
 
03:57:08.630 --> 03:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
just to clarify so certainly happy to
 
03:57:10.229 --> 03:57:10.239 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
03:57:12.389 --> 03:57:12.399 align:start position:0%
regarding that compact
 
03:57:15.110 --> 03:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
in that case since we did have a hanging
 
03:57:17.910 --> 03:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
question is there anyone who knows about
 
03:57:20.790 --> 03:57:20.800 align:start position:0%
the approval of the compact for children
 
03:57:22.630 --> 03:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
that can answer the question of how many
 
03:57:25.349 --> 03:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
states have to approve it
 
03:57:26.790 --> 03:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
is there anyone here who knows that
 
03:57:26.800 --> 03:57:29.030 align:start position:0%
is there anyone here who knows that
number

03:57:29.030 --> 03:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
number
 
03:57:34.870 --> 03:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:39.429 --> 03:57:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:42.389 --> 03:57:42.399 align:start position:0%

question i'll do my best to answer it
 
03:57:53.910 --> 03:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
the question
 
03:57:55.990 --> 03:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative pearson your question
 
03:57:57.510 --> 03:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
mike thank you madam chair my question
 
03:57:59.349 --> 03:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
involved you know we in the original
 
03:58:00.790 --> 03:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
bill we're looking at a compact that
 
03:58:03.429 --> 03:58:03.439 align:start position:0%
involves a 15 state threshold
 
03:58:05.429 --> 03:58:05.439 align:start position:0%
for it to kick in
 
03:58:05.439 --> 03:58:06.630 align:start position:0%
for it to kick in
this

03:58:06.630 --> 03:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:58:06.640 --> 03:58:08.070 align:start position:0%
this
particular

03:58:08.070 --> 03:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
particular
 
03:58:09.670 --> 03:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
new part that involves the placement of
 
03:58:11.910 --> 03:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
children what's the threshold for that
 
03:58:13.830 --> 03:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
compact to kick in
 
03:58:15.910 --> 03:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
so in the same way mr shamaker was
 
03:58:17.510 --> 03:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
representing that he was here on behalf
 
03:58:18.870 --> 03:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
of the office of professional licensure
 
03:58:20.309 --> 03:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
certification for the first part of the
 
03:58:22.389 --> 03:58:22.399 align:start position:0%
bill which dealt with sections one and
 
03:58:24.389 --> 03:58:24.399 align:start position:0%
two respectfully i'm here on section
 
03:58:25.830 --> 03:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
three the bill that deals with the
 
03:58:25.840 --> 03:58:27.030 align:start position:0%
three the bill that deals with the
interstate

03:58:27.030 --> 03:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
interstate
 
03:58:29.750 --> 03:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
compact on child placement
 
03:58:32.309 --> 03:58:32.319 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the bill itself under one
 
03:58:34.630 --> 03:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
of the articles uh i believe it's
 
03:58:36.389 --> 03:58:36.399 align:start position:0%
article 5 of the bill that deals with an
 
03:58:38.469 --> 03:58:38.479 align:start position:0%
effective date it says there has to be
 
03:58:40.950 --> 03:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
35 states that actually adopt
 
03:58:42.790 --> 03:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
legislation to
 
03:58:46.070 --> 03:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
accepting the compact before the compact
 
03:58:47.510 --> 03:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
would take effect
 
03:58:50.229 --> 03:58:50.239 align:start position:0%
and at current time the last i heard
 
03:58:51.750 --> 03:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
from our subject matter experts we were
 
03:58:54.389 --> 03:58:54.399 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 17 and 20 states and
 
03:58:56.550 --> 03:58:56.560 align:start position:0%
we actually this is the third time
 
03:58:58.150 --> 03:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
around with this very important piece of
 
03:59:01.590 --> 03:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
legislation and the numbers uh creep up
 
03:59:04.309 --> 03:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
a couple of states per per year
 
03:59:07.750 --> 03:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
to address the other question until 35
 
03:59:10.070 --> 03:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
states actually adopt legislation it's
 
03:59:12.229 --> 03:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
very clear in the effective date and the
 
03:59:14.070 --> 03:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
springing contingency that it would not
 
03:59:15.990 --> 03:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
be effective here in new hampshire until
 
03:59:18.550 --> 03:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
such time that 35 states adopted that
 
03:59:20.229 --> 03:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
same um
 
03:59:21.429 --> 03:59:21.439 align:start position:0%
same bill
 
03:59:21.439 --> 03:59:23.030 align:start position:0%
same bill
follow-up

03:59:23.030 --> 03:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:59:25.910 --> 03:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so you can understand then the
 
03:59:29.349 --> 03:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
the concern here of of exiting a compact
 
03:59:31.590 --> 03:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
to enter into a new compact that has an
 
03:59:33.429 --> 03:59:33.439 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily high
 
03:59:37.189 --> 03:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
threshold here at 30 i mean 50 states i
 
03:59:39.189 --> 03:59:39.199 align:start position:0%
mean 35 out of the 50s
 
03:59:41.830 --> 03:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
is quite a high bar so are you
 
03:59:41.840 --> 03:59:43.910 align:start position:0%
is quite a high bar so are you
comfortable

03:59:43.910 --> 03:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
03:59:44.870 --> 03:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
because you guys are gonna have to deal
 
03:59:47.269 --> 03:59:47.279 align:start position:0%
with this are you comfortable with
 
03:59:49.269 --> 03:59:49.279 align:start position:0%
the language
 
03:59:51.429 --> 03:59:51.439 align:start position:0%
that exists here
 
03:59:52.950 --> 03:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
in reference to
 
03:59:52.960 --> 03:59:53.750 align:start position:0%
in reference to
the

03:59:53.750 --> 03:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:59:56.070 --> 03:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
contingent withdrawal of an existing
 
03:59:56.080 --> 03:59:57.590 align:start position:0%
contingent withdrawal of an existing
compact

03:59:57.590 --> 03:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
compact
 
03:59:59.910 --> 03:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
based on the ability to enter into the
 
04:00:02.309 --> 04:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
new compact is your office comfortable
 
04:00:03.830 --> 04:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
with the way that is
 
04:00:08.790 --> 04:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
in the event that we get to 33 and stop
 
04:00:11.269 --> 04:00:11.279 align:start position:0%
um so uh i'm chairman mcguire in
 
04:00:14.070 --> 04:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
addressing represent pearson's question
 
04:00:14.080 --> 04:00:14.870 align:start position:0%
addressing represent pearson's question
this

04:00:14.870 --> 04:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:00:17.590 --> 04:00:17.600 align:start position:0%
um compact was developed by a lot of
 
04:00:20.389 --> 04:00:20.399 align:start position:0%
experts at a at a national level in
 
04:00:21.830 --> 04:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
terms of creating a model they were the
 
04:00:23.750 --> 04:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
ones that determined the uniformity of
 
04:00:25.750 --> 04:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
how many states would have to come
 
04:00:27.830 --> 04:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
aboard i think it's pretty close to what
 
04:00:30.389 --> 04:00:30.399 align:start position:0%
i think would be a super majority of
 
04:00:32.469 --> 04:00:32.479 align:start position:0%
states entering into it before that
 
04:00:34.870 --> 04:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
compact would then become effective in
 
04:00:36.469 --> 04:00:36.479 align:start position:0%
those respective states i think they did
 
04:00:38.469 --> 04:00:38.479 align:start position:0%
that in contemplation for reciprocity
 
04:00:39.830 --> 04:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
purposes that they wanted to make sure
 
04:00:41.590 --> 04:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
there was a sufficient number of states
 
04:00:43.590 --> 04:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
that would be able to speak to each
 
04:00:45.349 --> 04:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
other through the same compact rather
 
04:00:47.269 --> 04:00:47.279 align:start position:0%
than an outdated compact
 
04:00:49.349 --> 04:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
if you do not pass the legislation what
 
04:00:51.510 --> 04:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
you are left with is as senator carson
 
04:00:54.950 --> 04:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
appropriately stated is a very outdated
 
04:00:57.269 --> 04:00:57.279 align:start position:0%
law in terms of how our state interacts
 
04:00:58.469 --> 04:00:58.479 align:start position:0%
with other states whether we're
 
04:01:00.630 --> 04:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
receiving children here and having to
 
04:01:00.640 --> 04:01:01.590 align:start position:0%
receiving children here and having to
honor

04:01:01.590 --> 04:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
honor
 
04:01:01.600 --> 04:01:02.950 align:start position:0%
honor
whatever

04:01:02.950 --> 04:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
04:01:04.469 --> 04:01:04.479 align:start position:0%
protocols placements court orders what
 
04:01:05.910 --> 04:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
not from another jurisdiction or the
 
04:01:08.469 --> 04:01:08.479 align:start position:0%
reverse it really is important looking
 
04:01:11.189 --> 04:01:11.199 align:start position:0%
prospectively to making sure that new
 
04:01:12.710 --> 04:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire's laws are updated this is
 
04:01:14.469 --> 04:01:14.479 align:start position:0%
just happens to be the process to which
 
04:01:16.630 --> 04:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
this takes place and and it's the model
 
04:01:19.990 --> 04:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that mandated the 35 states
 
04:01:21.830 --> 04:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
you can make some adjustments in
 
04:01:24.389 --> 04:01:24.399 align:start position:0%
compacts but typically you take them
 
04:01:25.910 --> 04:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
pretty much wholesale unless they
 
04:01:27.269 --> 04:01:27.279 align:start position:0%
otherwise directly you can take certain
 
04:01:29.189 --> 04:01:29.199 align:start position:0%
pieces out this is not a piece that
 
04:01:32.389 --> 04:01:32.399 align:start position:0%
we've been told that you could change
 
04:01:34.309 --> 04:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
that's fantastic but did not answer my
 
04:01:34.319 --> 04:01:35.910 align:start position:0%
that's fantastic but did not answer my
question

04:01:35.910 --> 04:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:01:38.469 --> 04:01:38.479 align:start position:0%
i will do my best with a yes or no
 
04:01:40.389 --> 04:01:40.399 align:start position:0%
the the question was
 
04:01:42.950 --> 04:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
is your office comfortable
 
04:01:44.870 --> 04:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
with the transition languages in here
 
04:01:46.630 --> 04:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
that's extracting us out of an old
 
04:01:46.640 --> 04:01:48.469 align:start position:0%
that's extracting us out of an old
compact

04:01:48.469 --> 04:01:48.479 align:start position:0%
compact
 
04:01:52.070 --> 04:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
and putting us into a new compact
 
04:01:54.070 --> 04:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
in the way that is it
 
04:01:56.309 --> 04:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
because the way i'm if i'm hearing this
 
04:01:58.870 --> 04:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
right if this passes
 
04:02:01.750 --> 04:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
we're out of the old one
 
04:02:02.950 --> 04:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
we're not out
 
04:02:02.960 --> 04:02:05.269 align:start position:0%
we're not out
no

04:02:05.269 --> 04:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:07.189 --> 04:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
okay so then i guess that's that's where
 
04:02:08.790 --> 04:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
we're i need a little bit of more
 
04:02:10.710 --> 04:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
clarification then is to
 
04:02:12.229 --> 04:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
it's a there sounds like there's a big
 
04:02:15.030 --> 04:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
if then going on here in the sense that
 
04:02:18.630 --> 04:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
we remain in the initial 1965 compact
 
04:02:20.469 --> 04:02:20.479 align:start position:0%
up until the point of entering into the
 
04:02:22.309 --> 04:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
new compact
 
04:02:22.319 --> 04:02:23.990 align:start position:0%
new compact
yep

04:02:23.990 --> 04:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
yep
 
04:02:26.070 --> 04:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't leave us in in a limbo of
 
04:02:28.550 --> 04:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
exiting one but not another happens in a
 
04:02:30.550 --> 04:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
magical nanosecond of time that's
 
04:02:30.560 --> 04:02:32.309 align:start position:0%
magical nanosecond of time that's
measurable

04:02:32.309 --> 04:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
measurable
 
04:02:33.349 --> 04:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:02:34.870 --> 04:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative fellows you have a
 
04:02:34.880 --> 04:02:35.910 align:start position:0%
uh representative fellows you have a
question

04:02:35.910 --> 04:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:02:37.110 --> 04:02:37.120 align:start position:0%
yes oh
 
04:02:39.990 --> 04:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
is this for mr williams
 
04:02:40.000 --> 04:02:40.830 align:start position:0%
is this for mr williams
so

04:02:40.830 --> 04:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:02:44.070 --> 04:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
so maybe let let me see if i'm
 
04:02:46.229 --> 04:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
understanding this correctly
 
04:02:48.790 --> 04:02:48.800 align:start position:0%
so section five of the bill which is on
 
04:02:51.830 --> 04:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
the very last fit page has a contingency
 
04:02:53.990 --> 04:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
and basically it says that
 
04:02:54.000 --> 04:02:54.830 align:start position:0%
and basically it says that
um

04:02:54.830 --> 04:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:57.750 --> 04:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
the section three
 
04:03:00.630 --> 04:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
which is the language in the bill
 
04:03:00.640 --> 04:03:01.429 align:start position:0%
which is the language in the bill
of

04:03:01.429 --> 04:03:01.439 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:03:03.750 --> 04:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
of a compact
 
04:03:07.990 --> 04:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:10.630 --> 04:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
does not does not occur
 
04:03:13.030 --> 04:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
until there are 35 states already signed
 
04:03:14.950 --> 04:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
on to it
 
04:03:19.110 --> 04:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
so my question is is that correct and
 
04:03:22.870 --> 04:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
what might be a better substitute
 
04:03:25.429 --> 04:03:25.439 align:start position:0%
um for
 
04:03:27.269 --> 04:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
what's here in the bill
 
04:03:27.279 --> 04:03:28.309 align:start position:0%
what's here in the bill
is

04:03:28.309 --> 04:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:03:32.309 --> 04:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:34.870 --> 04:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
this is one where i would suggest you
 
04:03:36.630 --> 04:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
may want to speak with the attorneys at
 
04:03:38.229 --> 04:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
the office of state of services because
 
04:03:39.349 --> 04:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
they could actually take the time
 
04:03:41.590 --> 04:03:41.600 align:start position:0%
offline to explain to the nuances that
 
04:03:43.110 --> 04:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
are involved with reading this
 
04:03:45.269 --> 04:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
contingency but i will do my best with
 
04:03:47.670 --> 04:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
this audience you have section five of
 
04:03:49.189 --> 04:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
the bill that deals with the contingency
 
04:03:51.030 --> 04:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
that says essentially what exactly what
 
04:03:52.790 --> 04:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
you just said that sections three and
 
04:03:56.070 --> 04:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
four of the act uh of this uh 2009
 
04:03:58.630 --> 04:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
edition of the icpc shall take effect on
 
04:03:59.910 --> 04:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
the date that the commissioner of the
 
04:04:02.150 --> 04:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
department health and services certifies
 
04:04:04.070 --> 04:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
the legislative services and secretary
 
04:04:05.990 --> 04:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
of state that 35 compacting states
 
04:04:07.910 --> 04:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
including new hampshire have enacted the
 
04:04:11.030 --> 04:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
2009 edition of the icpc
 
04:04:13.189 --> 04:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
if you go into section 3 of the bill
 
04:04:14.790 --> 04:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
there's actually provision that mirrors
 
04:04:16.389 --> 04:04:16.399 align:start position:0%
this as well that discusses the
 
04:04:17.990 --> 04:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
springing contingency that you have to
 
04:04:21.110 --> 04:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
have 35 states that adopt this before
 
04:04:22.710 --> 04:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
such time that it would go into effect
 
04:04:24.229 --> 04:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire or any other state
 
04:04:29.830 --> 04:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:34.550 --> 04:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
that is the answer yes thank you um
 
04:04:36.870 --> 04:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
well got a question yeah the
 
04:04:41.670 --> 04:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
section five is on the last page page 37
 
04:04:43.510 --> 04:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
and representative lucas you had a
 
04:04:43.520 --> 04:04:44.710 align:start position:0%
and representative lucas you had a
question

04:04:44.710 --> 04:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:04:47.750 --> 04:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
um i think it's been uh answered the
 
04:04:49.189 --> 04:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
only thing i'll say is if you look at
 
04:04:51.110 --> 04:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment that was passed around it
 
04:04:53.189 --> 04:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
also interacts with this
 
04:04:55.590 --> 04:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:58.229 --> 04:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
i yes you should have
 
04:05:00.469 --> 04:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
if you didn't i believe
 
04:05:02.630 --> 04:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
we will make sure you get them
 
04:05:05.189 --> 04:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
i've got one
 
04:05:07.110 --> 04:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
okay and represent mcguire if i could
 
04:05:08.870 --> 04:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
comment just one item on the amendment
 
04:05:11.110 --> 04:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
because i was a participant in the
 
04:05:13.750 --> 04:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
drafting of this with um with um the
 
04:05:16.469 --> 04:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
senate and uh working along with senator
 
04:05:19.030 --> 04:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
carson but also with director joe ripson
 
04:05:20.710 --> 04:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
because of the complexities that you see
 
04:05:22.389 --> 04:05:22.399 align:start position:0%
with the springing contingency dates
 
04:05:24.150 --> 04:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
built in here we had to be very careful
 
04:05:26.070 --> 04:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
to making sure that we brought forward
 
04:05:28.150 --> 04:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
the amendment that senator carson
 
04:05:29.590 --> 04:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
provided to you
 
04:05:31.269 --> 04:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
because of the fact
 
04:05:33.830 --> 04:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
that section three of the bill goes into
 
04:05:36.150 --> 04:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
effect only after 35 states adopted
 
04:05:38.309 --> 04:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
there is a critical need for a portion
 
04:05:40.070 --> 04:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
of the bill which is reflected in this
 
04:05:44.150 --> 04:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
amendment to be uh to be enacted upon um
 
04:05:45.670 --> 04:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
i believe what i'm trying to look for
 
04:05:47.750 --> 04:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
upon its passage or 60 days i have to
 
04:05:49.830 --> 04:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
read the language quickly but it needed
 
04:05:50.790 --> 04:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:05:52.309 --> 04:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
more immediate rather than waiting for
 
04:05:55.110 --> 04:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
other 35 states to come on board we need
 
04:05:56.790 --> 04:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
to have this provision for the reasons
 
04:06:00.070 --> 04:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
that were provided for child protection
 
04:06:02.710 --> 04:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
reasons that senator carson so artfully
 
04:06:04.389 --> 04:06:04.399 align:start position:0%
spoke about
 
04:06:07.349 --> 04:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so we will consider that
 
04:06:09.590 --> 04:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
senator carson some new words
 
04:06:11.349 --> 04:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
i believe this bill is going to go to
 
04:06:13.910 --> 04:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee because it is
 
04:06:16.790 --> 04:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
there's no way we can handle it at once
 
04:06:18.389 --> 04:06:18.399 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions for
 
04:06:21.429 --> 04:06:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:22.870 --> 04:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
thank you we will expect you at the
 
04:06:22.880 --> 04:06:24.710 align:start position:0%
thank you we will expect you at the
subcommittee

04:06:24.710 --> 04:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
04:06:26.870 --> 04:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
mr shoemaker if you if you care to
 
04:06:37.429 --> 04:06:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:39.590 --> 04:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again for the record joe
 
04:06:41.349 --> 04:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
shoemaker director of licensing and
 
04:06:42.790 --> 04:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
board administration at the office of
 
04:06:45.750 --> 04:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
04:06:48.469 --> 04:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
i believe uh director courtney has
 
04:06:50.389 --> 04:06:50.399 align:start position:0%
submitted testimony
 
04:06:52.469 --> 04:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
i'll basically going to summarize that
 
04:06:55.670 --> 04:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
this morning but to clarify we are here
 
04:06:58.070 --> 04:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
or i'm here on behalf of oplc
 
04:07:00.469 --> 04:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
to support the portions of this bill
 
04:07:02.229 --> 04:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
related to the mental health counseling
 
04:07:02.239 --> 04:07:03.590 align:start position:0%
related to the mental health counseling
compact

04:07:03.590 --> 04:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
compact
 
04:07:05.030 --> 04:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
i believe you're all aware new hampshire
 
04:07:06.469 --> 04:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
has a significant
 
04:07:08.790 --> 04:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
behavioral health force health
 
04:07:11.670 --> 04:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
workforce shortage which was exacerbated
 
04:07:13.830 --> 04:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic
 
04:07:14.790 --> 04:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the state of
 
04:07:17.269 --> 04:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
emergency in march of 2020
 
04:07:19.110 --> 04:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
governor sununu issued an executive
 
04:07:21.030 --> 04:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
order permitting the office
 
04:07:23.030 --> 04:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
to issue licenses to health care workers
 
04:07:25.269 --> 04:07:25.279 align:start position:0%
from out of state
 
04:07:27.510 --> 04:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
04:07:29.110 --> 04:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire observed a massive
 
04:07:31.590 --> 04:07:31.600 align:start position:0%
increase in the total number of licensed
 
04:07:34.550 --> 04:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
behavioral health clinicians 63 percent
 
04:07:36.870 --> 04:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
of psychologists 40 percent of marriage
 
04:07:38.950 --> 04:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
and family therapists and 45 percent of
 
04:07:41.590 --> 04:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
clinical mental health counselors
 
04:07:44.950 --> 04:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
who were licensed during 2021 were doing
 
04:07:47.830 --> 04:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
so under those emergency licenses
 
04:07:49.429 --> 04:07:49.439 align:start position:0%
these statistics overwhelmingly
 
04:07:51.030 --> 04:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that new hampshire must take
 
04:07:52.950 --> 04:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
changes or make changes to licensure of
 
04:07:55.110 --> 04:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
mental health professions to enable
 
04:07:57.750 --> 04:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
greater licensed portability
 
04:08:00.309 --> 04:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
senate bill 397 proposes to enact the
 
04:08:02.630 --> 04:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
mental health counseling compact
 
04:08:04.550 --> 04:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
as this committee is no doubt aware new
 
04:08:05.910 --> 04:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire is a member of most
 
04:08:08.790 --> 04:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
occupational licensing compacts
 
04:08:11.830 --> 04:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
oplc has observed that compacts which
 
04:08:13.590 --> 04:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
are agreement between states
 
04:08:15.590 --> 04:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
significantly reduce the amount of time
 
04:08:18.950 --> 04:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
it takes to become licensed
 
04:08:20.870 --> 04:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
as was discussed earlier this compact
 
04:08:23.670 --> 04:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
becomes effective once 10 states adopt
 
04:08:25.189 --> 04:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
the compact
 
04:08:27.590 --> 04:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
we understand that at least six states
 
04:08:29.510 --> 04:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
have adopted the compact
 
04:08:31.830 --> 04:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
and 15 additional states at this time
 
04:08:34.229 --> 04:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
have legislation in place
 
04:08:36.149 --> 04:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
are going forward at this time
 
04:08:38.870 --> 04:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
so it is promising that this will pass
 
04:08:40.309 --> 04:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
this year and the compact will be
 
04:08:40.319 --> 04:08:41.670 align:start position:0%
this year and the compact will be
enacted

04:08:41.670 --> 04:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
enacted
 
04:08:43.189 --> 04:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
given the behavioral health workforce
 
04:08:45.830 --> 04:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
shortage oplc strongly supports the
 
04:08:48.469 --> 04:08:48.479 align:start position:0%
provisions of senate bill 397 adopting
 
04:08:52.870 --> 04:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:54.550 --> 04:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to answer any questions you
 
04:08:56.149 --> 04:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
may have
 
04:08:58.469 --> 04:08:58.479 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
04:09:00.550 --> 04:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
04:09:02.309 --> 04:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
04:09:05.910 --> 04:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:08.710 --> 04:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
we've had a number
 
04:09:11.750 --> 04:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
of compact bills come before us
 
04:09:15.750 --> 04:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
and most recently we withdrew from one
 
04:09:17.590 --> 04:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
and we keep hearing when these bills
 
04:09:19.670 --> 04:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
come forward once a number of states
 
04:09:22.389 --> 04:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
reach this goal it will be an act
 
04:09:22.399 --> 04:09:24.070 align:start position:0%
reach this goal it will be an act
enacted

04:09:24.070 --> 04:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
enacted
 
04:09:24.080 --> 04:09:25.830 align:start position:0%
enacted
and

04:09:25.830 --> 04:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:09:28.550 --> 04:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
a number of these have gone on for a
 
04:09:32.710 --> 04:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:34.950 --> 04:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
my question is once we get into these
 
04:09:34.960 --> 04:09:36.710 align:start position:0%
my question is once we get into these
compacts

04:09:36.710 --> 04:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
compacts
 
04:09:39.590 --> 04:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
it sets up for them to set the rules for
 
04:09:42.870 --> 04:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
us not for us to set the rules for them
 
04:09:42.880 --> 04:09:45.910 align:start position:0%
us not for us to set the rules for them
and

04:09:45.910 --> 04:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:47.830 --> 04:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
while we all
 
04:09:50.149 --> 04:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
strive to be the first ones at the table
 
04:09:52.630 --> 04:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
so we can set the rules
 
04:09:54.710 --> 04:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
that may not be the case
 
04:09:57.830 --> 04:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
and do you feel that we are giving up
 
04:10:00.149 --> 04:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
too much by getting into these compacts
 
04:10:01.590 --> 04:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
than what we should be
 
04:10:02.870 --> 04:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
um because
 
04:10:04.630 --> 04:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
once they're enacted
 
04:10:06.389 --> 04:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
we're in it
 
04:10:07.830 --> 04:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
unless we decide to get out like we did
 
04:10:11.110 --> 04:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
with this last one
 
04:10:12.229 --> 04:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question
 
04:10:14.229 --> 04:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
representative goalie i certainly
 
04:10:16.149 --> 04:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
understand your concern
 
04:10:17.670 --> 04:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
our understanding although there's no
 
04:10:19.510 --> 04:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
members of the board of mental health
 
04:10:22.229 --> 04:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
here today that the board does support
 
04:10:23.590 --> 04:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
this compact
 
04:10:25.030 --> 04:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
they have reviewed the initial
 
04:10:27.590 --> 04:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
requirements as you've noted the initial
 
04:10:31.830 --> 04:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
requirements come in and are set to join
 
04:10:34.950 --> 04:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
but the provision thereafter
 
04:10:34.960 --> 04:10:35.830 align:start position:0%
but the provision thereafter
every

04:10:35.830 --> 04:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
every
 
04:10:37.510 --> 04:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
board that's a member every state that's
 
04:10:40.070 --> 04:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
a member has a seat at that table
 
04:10:41.990 --> 04:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
and if when
 
04:10:44.870 --> 04:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
any of those rules change by vote
 
04:10:47.990 --> 04:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
majority vote of those states
 
04:10:50.070 --> 04:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
we would need to abide by those
 
04:10:51.670 --> 04:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
and the way we would need to back out of
 
04:10:55.189 --> 04:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
the compact uh which is noted in here
 
04:10:56.950 --> 04:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
would be to submit legislation to
 
04:10:56.960 --> 04:10:58.790 align:start position:0%
would be to submit legislation to
withdraw

04:10:58.790 --> 04:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
withdraw
 
04:11:02.149 --> 04:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
i can tell you as i mentioned earlier
 
04:11:04.550 --> 04:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of any major concerns with
 
04:11:07.349 --> 04:11:07.359 align:start position:0%
the professional licensing compacts
 
04:11:08.469 --> 04:11:08.479 align:start position:0%
that we
 
04:11:10.309 --> 04:11:10.319 align:start position:0%
are a part of now it was mentioned
 
04:11:12.229 --> 04:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
earlier we've had the the medicine
 
04:11:15.030 --> 04:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
compact since 2016.
 
04:11:17.110 --> 04:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
we have compacts with the allied health
 
04:11:17.120 --> 04:11:18.870 align:start position:0%
we have compacts with the allied health
boards

04:11:18.870 --> 04:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
boards
 
04:11:22.149 --> 04:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
and several uh licensed reciprocity
 
04:11:24.149 --> 04:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
agreements with national organizations
 
04:11:26.950 --> 04:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
such as engineers architects accountants
 
04:11:28.309 --> 04:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
and so forth
 
04:11:30.469 --> 04:11:30.479 align:start position:0%
and i'm not aware of any major concerns
 
04:11:32.710 --> 04:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
with the professional licensing compacts
 
04:11:37.429 --> 04:11:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:40.790 --> 04:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:44.710 --> 04:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much mr schumacher
 
04:11:46.309 --> 04:11:46.319 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
04:11:53.830 --> 04:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:56.149 --> 04:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none i will close the
 
04:11:59.269 --> 04:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:01.590 --> 04:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
representative pearson it's this one's
 
04:12:04.710 --> 04:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:09.349 --> 04:12:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:11.349 --> 04:12:11.359 align:start position:0%
i do have a request though madam chair
 
04:12:12.630 --> 04:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
if we're going to do a subcommittee i'd
 
04:12:14.550 --> 04:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
like a joint subcommittee with with
 
04:12:16.870 --> 04:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative rice's committee as well
 
04:12:18.229 --> 04:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
i think that that's
 
04:12:19.670 --> 04:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
would be highly appropriate considering
 
04:12:21.429 --> 04:12:21.439 align:start position:0%
the nature and topic of what's going on
 
04:12:23.269 --> 04:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
this is more than just simply
 
04:12:25.830 --> 04:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
um a procedural
 
04:12:25.840 --> 04:12:26.550 align:start position:0%
um a procedural
re

04:12:26.550 --> 04:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
re
 
04:12:28.070 --> 04:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
um reconstruction i think this
 
04:12:29.590 --> 04:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
definitely involves the policy portion
 
04:12:31.670 --> 04:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
of what they do so i would ask that we
 
04:12:33.429 --> 04:12:33.439 align:start position:0%
that we form a joint subcommittee with
 
04:12:35.910 --> 04:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
her with her folks
 
04:12:37.750 --> 04:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
i would agree provided she's okay with
 
04:12:42.830 --> 04:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:44.870 --> 04:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative first
 
04:12:46.710 --> 04:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
and and then we can focus on the
 
04:12:48.710 --> 04:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
interstate compact second so that my
 
04:12:50.229 --> 04:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
committee members aren't sitting through
 
04:12:51.590 --> 04:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
it sure
 
04:12:54.309 --> 04:12:54.319 align:start position:0%
fair enough i you but probably more
 
04:12:54.319 --> 04:12:56.070 align:start position:0%
fair enough i you but probably more
would

04:12:56.070 --> 04:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:12:59.189 --> 04:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
that would be the sensible way to do it
 
04:13:02.149 --> 04:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:02.159 --> 04:13:08.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:13:08.070 --> 04:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:09.189 --> 04:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
04:13:09.199 --> 04:13:10.229 align:start position:0%
let's see
that's

04:13:10.229 --> 04:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:13:12.469 --> 04:13:12.479 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:13:14.790 --> 04:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
i think so unless uh unless somebody
 
04:13:16.229 --> 04:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
wants to
 
04:13:18.149 --> 04:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
move into executive session we're done
 
04:13:21.830 --> 04:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:32.229 --> 04:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:34.630 --> 04:13:34.640 align:start position:0%
okay we're going into executive session
 
04:13:37.269 --> 04:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 223
 
04:13:39.110 --> 04:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
and representative goldie you have a
 
04:13:39.120 --> 04:13:41.349 align:start position:0%
and representative goldie you have a
motion

04:13:41.349 --> 04:13:41.359 align:start position:0%
motion
 
04:13:43.269 --> 04:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i move out to pass
 
04:13:45.830 --> 04:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 223
 
04:13:47.429 --> 04:13:47.439 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
04:13:49.510 --> 04:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt okay
 
04:13:52.149 --> 04:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your motion
 
04:13:54.710 --> 04:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
i'll speak briefly i think this bill as
 
04:13:57.670 --> 04:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
we heard from the fire marshal
 
04:13:59.830 --> 04:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
takes away from an arbitrary figure of
 
04:14:02.630 --> 04:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
the 200 when they put it into uh using
 
04:14:05.030 --> 04:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
dormitory numbers to what it really is
 
04:14:08.149 --> 04:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
as more of a rooming house and goes by
 
04:14:10.710 --> 04:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
what is set as a national standard for
 
04:14:13.030 --> 04:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
recovery houses at 50 square feet per
 
04:14:13.040 --> 04:14:14.309 align:start position:0%
recovery houses at 50 square feet per
bedroom

04:14:14.309 --> 04:14:14.319 align:start position:0%
bedroom
 
04:14:15.670 --> 04:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
so it makes it
 
04:14:17.510 --> 04:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh consistent
 
04:14:19.269 --> 04:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
okay representative schmidt do you have
 
04:14:21.429 --> 04:14:21.439 align:start position:0%
a question
 
04:14:23.429 --> 04:14:23.439 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am try i just would say
 
04:14:27.910 --> 04:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
that uh clearly the 200 square feet
 
04:14:30.149 --> 04:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
figure that is currently
 
04:14:31.349 --> 04:14:31.359 align:start position:0%
in effect
 
04:14:33.030 --> 04:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
is completely unworkable and
 
04:14:35.590 --> 04:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
unreasonable under this concept
 
04:14:39.349 --> 04:14:39.359 align:start position:0%
and but 50 square feet is workable for
 
04:14:41.110 --> 04:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
the purpose that
 
04:14:43.510 --> 04:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
these recovery houses are being operated
 
04:14:46.870 --> 04:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
when it's obvious you cannot have
 
04:14:49.030 --> 04:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
multiple individuals rooming together
 
04:14:51.030 --> 04:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
who are in recovery i think that's
 
04:14:53.750 --> 04:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
running a risk that would be uh
 
04:14:56.149 --> 04:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
extremely unwise
 
04:14:57.670 --> 04:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:14:59.910 --> 04:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
we i think that we need to support this
 
04:15:01.269 --> 04:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
bill thank you
 
04:15:01.279 --> 04:15:02.550 align:start position:0%
bill thank you
okay

04:15:02.550 --> 04:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:15:04.870 --> 04:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
representative allegro yeah there seemed
 
04:15:07.349 --> 04:15:07.359 align:start position:0%
to be some difficulty before
 
04:15:10.710 --> 04:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
um defining what gross square feet is
 
04:15:13.429 --> 04:15:13.439 align:start position:0%
and so i looked it up and it includes
 
04:15:15.910 --> 04:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
outer wall to outer wall
 
04:15:18.389 --> 04:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
so 50 square feet is actually an
 
04:15:20.630 --> 04:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
overestimate and you can imagine if you
 
04:15:23.110 --> 04:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
had six of these rooms on a corridor
 
04:15:24.790 --> 04:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
you'd have to take away
 
04:15:26.149 --> 04:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
some of that
 
04:15:28.550 --> 04:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
space particularly if there was a wall
 
04:15:29.510 --> 04:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
and and
 
04:15:31.910 --> 04:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
the definition specifically includes
 
04:15:35.110 --> 04:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
unused space dead space
 
04:15:37.830 --> 04:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
so if you had a a gap somewhere you're
 
04:15:40.870 --> 04:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
looking at less than 50 square feet i
 
04:15:44.149 --> 04:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:45.590 --> 04:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
i don't want to call it an amendment but
 
04:15:47.910 --> 04:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
with some other ways to look at this
 
04:15:47.920 --> 04:15:48.790 align:start position:0%
with some other ways to look at this
um

04:15:48.790 --> 04:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:50.149 --> 04:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
and i haven't really organized my
 
04:15:51.750 --> 04:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
thoughts very well but
 
04:15:51.760 --> 04:15:52.870 align:start position:0%
thoughts very well but
uh

04:15:52.870 --> 04:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:15:56.309 --> 04:15:56.319 align:start position:0%
what if going from 200 to 50 square feet
 
04:15:59.990 --> 04:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
we went from 200 to 100.
 
04:16:02.229 --> 04:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
minimum square feet and then you know
 
04:16:06.070 --> 04:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
100 square feet per two bed area
 
04:16:09.349 --> 04:16:09.359 align:start position:0%
and an additional 50 square feet and not
 
04:16:11.510 --> 04:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
gross square feet but square feet living
 
04:16:11.520 --> 04:16:12.710 align:start position:0%
gross square feet but square feet living
space

04:16:12.710 --> 04:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
space
 
04:16:14.630 --> 04:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
for rooms housing
 
04:16:16.550 --> 04:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh more than two beds
 
04:16:18.550 --> 04:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
i had two
 
04:16:19.990 --> 04:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
problems with
 
04:16:21.670 --> 04:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
with those numbers those original
 
04:16:23.830 --> 04:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
numbers one is that it sounds to me more
 
04:16:26.870 --> 04:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
like a purdue farm chicken factory
 
04:16:29.030 --> 04:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
with people stacked on top of each other
 
04:16:30.630 --> 04:16:30.640 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's good for the
 
04:16:30.640 --> 04:16:31.990 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's good for the
residents

04:16:31.990 --> 04:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
residents
 
04:16:34.070 --> 04:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is it
 
04:16:36.469 --> 04:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
it could far more than double the
 
04:16:38.790 --> 04:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
population in that residence which could
 
04:16:41.510 --> 04:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
put a burden on the neighborhood
 
04:16:41.520 --> 04:16:43.030 align:start position:0%
put a burden on the neighborhood
um

04:16:43.030 --> 04:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:46.070 --> 04:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
so i'll leave it that at that for now um
 
04:16:50.229 --> 04:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
i just think perhaps some other more
 
04:16:52.149 --> 04:16:52.159 align:start position:0%
generous formula
 
04:16:53.670 --> 04:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
is needed in this
 
04:16:55.510 --> 04:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
04:16:55.520 --> 04:16:56.710 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
alekas

04:16:56.710 --> 04:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
alekas
 
04:16:58.950 --> 04:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um so a couple of points one
 
04:17:00.469 --> 04:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
is um
 
04:17:03.269 --> 04:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
it does change it from being 200
 
04:17:05.110 --> 04:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
for the whole building to 50 for the
 
04:17:06.710 --> 04:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
sleeping area and
 
04:17:07.830 --> 04:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:17:07.840 --> 04:17:08.830 align:start position:0%
you know
having

04:17:08.830 --> 04:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
having
 
04:17:11.990 --> 04:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
people in a dormitory situation which in
 
04:17:13.590 --> 04:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
college for a couple years i was in i
 
04:17:15.429 --> 04:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
don't think i had any more maybe less
 
04:17:16.630 --> 04:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
space than that
 
04:17:18.790 --> 04:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
um it's just a place to sleep it's not
 
04:17:20.070 --> 04:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to spend your whole day and
 
04:17:22.389 --> 04:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
that's i think why the comparison to
 
04:17:24.469 --> 04:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
the prison situation wasn't applicable
 
04:17:25.830 --> 04:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
because there you're going to spend most
 
04:17:28.309 --> 04:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
your day there
 
04:17:29.750 --> 04:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
and there are other
 
04:17:32.149 --> 04:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
constraints on the number of people and
 
04:17:33.830 --> 04:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
the size of the whole
 
04:17:33.840 --> 04:17:34.950 align:start position:0%
the size of the whole
facility

04:17:34.950 --> 04:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
facility
 
04:17:36.630 --> 04:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
because they have requirements as they
 
04:17:38.550 --> 04:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
said for you know everybody's got to be
 
04:17:40.469 --> 04:17:40.479 align:start position:0%
able to meet together and dine together
 
04:17:41.830 --> 04:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
and there's other requirements that have
 
04:17:43.750 --> 04:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
to be there so i really don't see a
 
04:17:45.750 --> 04:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
problem with 50 square feet just for the
 
04:17:48.710 --> 04:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
sleeping space and it's not 100 to 50 it
 
04:17:51.590 --> 04:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
was or 250 it's 200 for the whole
 
04:17:53.269 --> 04:17:53.279 align:start position:0%
building not just sleeping space going
 
04:17:56.389 --> 04:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
on a 50 for the bed area sleeping area
 
04:17:58.710 --> 04:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
so i mean i i fully support this bill as
 
04:18:01.030 --> 04:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:18:07.189 --> 04:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:07.199 --> 04:18:08.630 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:18:08.630 --> 04:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:18:10.950 --> 04:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
we're not the experts on this we had the
 
04:18:13.269 --> 04:18:13.279 align:start position:0%
fire marshal we had uh
 
04:18:13.279 --> 04:18:15.429 align:start position:0%
fire marshal we had uh
uh

04:18:15.429 --> 04:18:15.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:18:15.439 --> 04:18:16.309 align:start position:0%
uh
um

04:18:16.309 --> 04:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:18.950 --> 04:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
who else was in here uh jake berry
 
04:18:21.510 --> 04:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
kimbach people who do this for a living
 
04:18:23.990 --> 04:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
all the time and they're satisfied with
 
04:18:26.469 --> 04:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
there was somebody else that besides uh
 
04:18:29.429 --> 04:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:31.110 --> 04:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
they're the people that know about this
 
04:18:34.070 --> 04:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like this was just an um
 
04:18:35.910 --> 04:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
it meets uh
 
04:18:39.030 --> 04:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh national standards um
 
04:18:40.870 --> 04:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
i i i'm going to
 
04:18:42.550 --> 04:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
representative lectures i think we
 
04:18:44.070 --> 04:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
should well i'm agreeing with you i
 
04:18:45.429 --> 04:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
think we should just
 
04:18:49.030 --> 04:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
accept that this is an improvement
 
04:18:51.189 --> 04:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
okay representative pearson
 
04:18:52.630 --> 04:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i actually sat on
 
04:18:53.990 --> 04:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
this commission
 
04:18:57.189 --> 04:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
with senator del sandro so um and i'm
 
04:18:59.030 --> 04:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
sorry i wasn't here for the
 
04:19:01.269 --> 04:19:01.279 align:start position:0%
the whole shebang we
 
04:19:02.790 --> 04:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
this this building's like a bee's nest
 
04:19:03.910 --> 04:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
right now everybody's double booked
 
04:19:05.269 --> 04:19:05.279 align:start position:0%
everywhere but
 
04:19:07.030 --> 04:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know one of the things i want to
 
04:19:09.189 --> 04:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
just just point out to all of you is
 
04:19:10.950 --> 04:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
that you know you're you're looking at
 
04:19:12.950 --> 04:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
what amounts to basically four pieces of
 
04:19:14.830 --> 04:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
statute in a
 
04:19:14.840 --> 04:19:16.550 align:start position:0%
statute in a
overall

04:19:16.550 --> 04:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
overall
 
04:19:18.710 --> 04:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
area of the code that is
 
04:19:21.349 --> 04:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
dozens of pages long and i think that
 
04:19:23.110 --> 04:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
there's a there's probably a little bit
 
04:19:25.750 --> 04:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
of a context loss there in the sense
 
04:19:25.760 --> 04:19:27.510 align:start position:0%
of a context loss there in the sense
that

04:19:27.510 --> 04:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:19:29.670 --> 04:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
what you also don't see because you know
 
04:19:30.870 --> 04:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
it's only
 
04:19:32.710 --> 04:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
changing this one particular part so
 
04:19:34.389 --> 04:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
that's what we see in front of us on the
 
04:19:34.399 --> 04:19:35.189 align:start position:0%
that's what we see in front of us on the
bill

04:19:35.189 --> 04:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:19:37.590 --> 04:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
but you know as was reiterated in the
 
04:19:39.110 --> 04:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
testimony you know there's restrictions
 
04:19:41.670 --> 04:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
in reference to septic bathrooms
 
04:19:44.309 --> 04:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of criteria that exists
 
04:19:47.510 --> 04:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
that defines how these structures look
 
04:19:49.750 --> 04:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
in as far as how many people you can put
 
04:19:51.510 --> 04:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
in them and that's
 
04:19:52.790 --> 04:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
i don't want that to get lost in the
 
04:19:54.870 --> 04:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
weeds here without just having to focus
 
04:19:54.880 --> 04:19:56.229 align:start position:0%
weeds here without just having to focus
on

04:19:56.229 --> 04:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:19:58.550 --> 04:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
them wanting to do more of a dormitory
 
04:19:58.560 --> 04:19:59.990 align:start position:0%
them wanting to do more of a dormitory
style

04:19:59.990 --> 04:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
style
 
04:20:03.750 --> 04:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
of sleeping arrangement than an overall
 
04:20:05.269 --> 04:20:05.279 align:start position:0%
an overall encompassing one which we're
 
04:20:07.189 --> 04:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
doing now which frankly is horrible it
 
04:20:09.030 --> 04:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't work and the pack and stack
 
04:20:10.710 --> 04:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
thing this doesn't create pack and stack
 
04:20:12.870 --> 04:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
this gets rid of pack and stack
 
04:20:12.880 --> 04:20:14.309 align:start position:0%
this gets rid of pack and stack
and

04:20:14.309 --> 04:20:14.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:16.950 --> 04:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
this this doesn't create pack and stack
 
04:20:18.469 --> 04:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
it gets rid of it
 
04:20:20.149 --> 04:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
right and one of the things that has
 
04:20:22.309 --> 04:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
been concerning in my my profession in
 
04:20:23.670 --> 04:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
the fire service
 
04:20:26.149 --> 04:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
has been when these started popping up
 
04:20:27.830 --> 04:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
we had no idea where they were there was
 
04:20:28.870 --> 04:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
really no
 
04:20:30.950 --> 04:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
standards of any kind it was it was kind
 
04:20:32.710 --> 04:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
of a free-for-all that
 
04:20:37.670 --> 04:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:40.070 --> 04:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
shield if you will in that they became a
 
04:20:42.149 --> 04:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
protected class and they just started
 
04:20:43.910 --> 04:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
running rampant
 
04:20:43.920 --> 04:20:45.349 align:start position:0%
running rampant
without

04:20:45.349 --> 04:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
without
 
04:20:47.670 --> 04:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
you know every time a state tried to put
 
04:20:49.030 --> 04:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
some restrictions they said oh well the
 
04:20:49.910 --> 04:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
fed said we're you know we're a
 
04:20:52.070 --> 04:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
protected class you can't do anything to
 
04:20:52.080 --> 04:20:52.790 align:start position:0%
protected class you can't do anything to
us

04:20:52.790 --> 04:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
us
 
04:20:54.950 --> 04:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
that wasn't entirely accurate but that
 
04:20:56.389 --> 04:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
was the kind of the attitude when they
 
04:20:57.990 --> 04:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
came storming into new hampshire and i
 
04:20:59.990 --> 04:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate the testimony here
 
04:21:01.670 --> 04:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
where the director of new hampshire core
 
04:21:03.910 --> 04:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
is substantially different than she was
 
04:21:05.590 --> 04:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
two years ago when she came before our
 
04:21:08.070 --> 04:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
commission i'll tell you that right now
 
04:21:09.590 --> 04:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
no doubt so
 
04:21:12.389 --> 04:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
so like i said i just i don't want
 
04:21:14.469 --> 04:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
i don't want us to get lost in this one
 
04:21:18.149 --> 04:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
little part of of this change where it's
 
04:21:19.670 --> 04:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
you know there's there's a clinical
 
04:21:21.910 --> 04:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
aspect to what they're asking for here
 
04:21:23.429 --> 04:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
it's it's not
 
04:21:26.070 --> 04:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
just simply hey you know we want to do
 
04:21:29.510 --> 04:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
50 50 you know typical dorm room size 50
 
04:21:29.520 --> 04:21:30.469 align:start position:0%
50 50 you know typical dorm room size 50
feet

04:21:30.469 --> 04:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
feet
 
04:21:31.590 --> 04:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
you know per
 
04:21:33.750 --> 04:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
per sleeping room it's
 
04:21:37.750 --> 04:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
there's more to it so
 
04:21:37.760 --> 04:21:38.950 align:start position:0%
there's more to it so
okay

04:21:38.950 --> 04:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:21:41.510 --> 04:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
brooks and o'brien and then fellows
 
04:21:43.590 --> 04:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just very quickly
 
04:21:44.790 --> 04:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
i couldn't agree more with
 
04:21:46.469 --> 04:21:46.479 align:start position:0%
representative pearson
 
04:21:48.309 --> 04:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
it's been my understanding with some of
 
04:21:51.349 --> 04:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
these groups they are for profit to some
 
04:21:54.309 --> 04:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
degree that they come into the community
 
04:21:57.349 --> 04:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
and they offer this and uh like
 
04:21:59.110 --> 04:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
representative pearson said my
 
04:22:00.710 --> 04:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
experience on the fire department they
 
04:22:02.469 --> 04:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
were popping up in neighborhoods hard to
 
04:22:04.790 --> 04:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
find and everything else i find this
 
04:22:07.269 --> 04:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
very much more regulatory plus it's
 
04:22:09.429 --> 04:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
something that the industry itself needs
 
04:22:12.070 --> 04:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
there is a need out there that we have
 
04:22:14.630 --> 04:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
seen and i think this basically uh does
 
04:22:16.870 --> 04:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
it so not to rehash what representative
 
04:22:19.030 --> 04:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
pearson said but i'm in total agreement
 
04:22:20.950 --> 04:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
with him thank you madam chair
 
04:22:22.870 --> 04:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
04:22:25.429 --> 04:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
um i'd just like to say that that um
 
04:22:28.229 --> 04:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
representative allegro has a point about
 
04:22:30.950 --> 04:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
the wording of this and if everybody's
 
04:22:32.790 --> 04:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
in agreement
 
04:22:35.269 --> 04:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
with the concept i'm willing to go get
 
04:22:37.510 --> 04:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
an amendment to just change the wording
 
04:22:38.630 --> 04:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
of this
 
04:22:40.950 --> 04:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
and to say something really instead of
 
04:22:43.030 --> 04:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
what it says here it would say each
 
04:22:45.830 --> 04:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
bedroom shall have a minimum of 500
 
04:22:48.309 --> 04:22:48.319 align:start position:0%
square feet per bid which i think is
 
04:22:51.830 --> 04:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:53.750 --> 04:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
not 500
 
04:22:56.870 --> 04:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry you said 500 square feet which
 
04:22:59.510 --> 04:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
is a very large bedroom that would be
 
04:23:02.950 --> 04:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
nice but we can make it 50.
 
04:23:06.630 --> 04:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that will
 
04:23:10.469 --> 04:23:10.479 align:start position:0%
representative goalie and then bailey
 
04:23:12.710 --> 04:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
i don't care much for the term gross i
 
04:23:15.110 --> 04:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
mean you could substitute less than 50
 
04:23:16.950 --> 04:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
feet by the meaning of that term the way
 
04:23:18.389 --> 04:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
they're using that
 
04:23:18.399 --> 04:23:20.229 align:start position:0%
they're using that
um

04:23:20.229 --> 04:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:21.990 --> 04:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
it would be sufficient for me to amend
 
04:23:28.469 --> 04:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:31.110 --> 04:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
representative allegro
 
04:23:33.590 --> 04:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you i yeah so
 
04:23:35.910 --> 04:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
that number 200 stuck in my head and i
 
04:23:35.920 --> 04:23:36.710 align:start position:0%
that number 200 stuck in my head and i
was

04:23:36.710 --> 04:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:23:38.630 --> 04:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
clearly mistaken about that
 
04:23:40.389 --> 04:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
can somebody on the committee says the
 
04:23:42.149 --> 04:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
questions to anybody and everybody
 
04:23:44.550 --> 04:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
present can somebody on the committee
 
04:23:46.630 --> 04:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
just give me
 
04:23:48.630 --> 04:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
you know put it in context to me we're
 
04:23:50.229 --> 04:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
going from
 
04:23:53.990 --> 04:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
200 square feet for an entire facility
 
04:23:54.000 --> 04:23:54.950 align:start position:0%
200 square feet for an entire facility
to

04:23:54.950 --> 04:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:23:56.309 --> 04:23:56.319 align:start position:0%
you know we're comparing apples to
 
04:23:58.070 --> 04:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
oranges can somebody compare oranges to
 
04:24:00.469 --> 04:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
oranges for me just roughly anyway i
 
04:24:01.670 --> 04:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
could do that if you want representative
 
04:24:01.680 --> 04:24:02.630 align:start position:0%
could do that if you want representative
pearson

04:24:02.630 --> 04:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
pearson
 
04:24:06.790 --> 04:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:08.870 --> 04:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
i think you know we've new hampshire's
 
04:24:11.349 --> 04:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
notorious for building splits so let's
 
04:24:12.630 --> 04:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
just go with a split because we all know
 
04:24:15.030 --> 04:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
what a split level house looks like
 
04:24:16.710 --> 04:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
when you take
 
04:24:18.950 --> 04:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
when one of those is purchased and be in
 
04:24:22.309 --> 04:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
becomes a recovery house to which no one
 
04:24:24.309 --> 04:24:24.319 align:start position:0%
can stop i want to make that clear no
 
04:24:26.710 --> 04:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
one they are federally protected it is
 
04:24:29.189 --> 04:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
extr extraordinarily difficult to stop
 
04:24:31.189 --> 04:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
that so it's going to happen right now
 
04:24:32.550 --> 04:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
they'll look at that and say okay it's a
 
04:24:35.189 --> 04:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
2 000 square foot house
 
04:24:37.349 --> 04:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
based on this
 
04:24:39.670 --> 04:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
no a 2 000 square foot house based on
 
04:24:42.550 --> 04:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
this i can put 10 people in here
 
04:24:45.990 --> 04:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
just off of this one particular line
 
04:24:48.950 --> 04:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
where the where 153 kicks in in all the
 
04:24:51.110 --> 04:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
other things is if you're on septic
 
04:24:53.269 --> 04:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
there's no way you can do 10 people you
 
04:24:54.950 --> 04:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
you i guarantee the place doesn't have a
 
04:24:57.750 --> 04:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
septic system designed for that
 
04:24:59.990 --> 04:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
there's other provisions that kick in in
 
04:25:02.070 --> 04:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
the fire code in reference to
 
04:25:04.630 --> 04:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
the definitions of boarding houses
 
04:25:06.550 --> 04:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
versus single-family homes and those
 
04:25:08.389 --> 04:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
sort of things
 
04:25:10.630 --> 04:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
the certification agency
 
04:25:10.640 --> 04:25:12.229 align:start position:0%
the certification agency
has

04:25:12.229 --> 04:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
has
 
04:25:14.149 --> 04:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
requirements you would have to have at
 
04:25:16.309 --> 04:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
least two full baths which you might in
 
04:25:18.389 --> 04:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
a ranch a split a split level ranch you
 
04:25:21.670 --> 04:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
might have two full baths potentially
 
04:25:23.830 --> 04:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
but now you're talking about the kitchen
 
04:25:26.389 --> 04:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
part of it the there's like it's it's a
 
04:25:29.349 --> 04:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
matrix of requirements so
 
04:25:31.189 --> 04:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
04:25:33.910 --> 04:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
come up with a gross number of for the
 
04:25:36.630 --> 04:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
whole structure
 
04:25:38.870 --> 04:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
keep in mind it says 10 but it's three
 
04:25:38.880 --> 04:25:39.990 align:start position:0%
keep in mind it says 10 but it's three
bedrooms

04:25:39.990 --> 04:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
bedrooms
 
04:25:41.670 --> 04:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
that's pack and stack
 
04:25:44.070 --> 04:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
this takes the pack and stack element
 
04:25:46.950 --> 04:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
out of it and says okay if you know if
 
04:25:48.389 --> 04:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
i've got a split level range that's
 
04:25:49.590 --> 04:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
three bedrooms
 
04:25:52.389 --> 04:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
i can't put 10 people in it i i can put
 
04:25:53.670 --> 04:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
far less
 
04:25:56.790 --> 04:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
and you know that's the concern that the
 
04:25:58.870 --> 04:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
fire service has had
 
04:26:00.870 --> 04:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
in in certainly neighborhood groups and
 
04:26:02.550 --> 04:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
folks like that of you know i have this
 
04:26:04.309 --> 04:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
i'm in a single family neighborhood and
 
04:26:06.630 --> 04:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
a recovery house shows up next door and
 
04:26:10.070 --> 04:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
i've got 15 cars in the driveway
 
04:26:12.229 --> 04:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
so this this is an impr i think this is
 
04:26:16.149 --> 04:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
a huge improvement to the current
 
04:26:18.149 --> 04:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
way that we can do things in the sense
 
04:26:20.469 --> 04:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
that it's it's going to provide a more
 
04:26:22.149 --> 04:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
restriction and it's a restriction that
 
04:26:24.950 --> 04:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
the the regulatory agency is welcoming
 
04:26:26.229 --> 04:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
so as far as i'm concerned that's
 
04:26:28.630 --> 04:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
fantastic yeah instead of 10 people in
 
04:26:32.149 --> 04:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
that house you'd probably get
 
04:26:33.349 --> 04:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
four yeah
 
04:26:33.359 --> 04:26:34.389 align:start position:0%
four yeah
right

04:26:34.389 --> 04:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:26:36.229 --> 04:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
based on the size of the bedrooms okay i
 
04:26:37.830 --> 04:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
mean you just basically answered my
 
04:26:39.830 --> 04:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
question there really is no apples to
 
04:26:42.229 --> 04:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
apples comparison in this but you're
 
04:26:44.070 --> 04:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
feeling confident that this is going to
 
04:26:46.389 --> 04:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
decrease the stacking
 
04:26:47.670 --> 04:26:47.680 align:start position:0%
and that's why i asked to be on that
 
04:26:49.750 --> 04:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
commission is because it
 
04:26:51.830 --> 04:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
you know my concern is you know rolling
 
04:26:53.189 --> 04:26:53.199 align:start position:0%
up with engine two at three o'clock in
 
04:26:55.670 --> 04:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
the morning i got 10 people
 
04:26:57.189 --> 04:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
crawling in the front yard from smoke
 
04:26:58.389 --> 04:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
inhalation and people hanging out in
 
04:26:59.590 --> 04:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
windows and we didn't even know this
 
04:27:01.590 --> 04:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
place was here yeah that was my concern
 
04:27:03.110 --> 04:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
and they exist and this is you know the
 
04:27:04.389 --> 04:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
city of manchester could probably handle
 
04:27:05.590 --> 04:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
that a whole lot differently than up
 
04:27:05.600 --> 04:27:06.630 align:start position:0%
that a whole lot differently than up
north

04:27:06.630 --> 04:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
north
 
04:27:09.189 --> 04:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
with the resources are far less so
 
04:27:10.710 --> 04:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
you know i
 
04:27:12.469 --> 04:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
i you know it's it's
 
04:27:14.710 --> 04:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
it's not a secret that miss miss bach
 
04:27:17.189 --> 04:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
and i have butted heads over this since
 
04:27:18.710 --> 04:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
i got on the commission because when
 
04:27:20.630 --> 04:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
they first came into it they came into
 
04:27:22.070 --> 04:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire they came in in a stock
 
04:27:23.750 --> 04:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
car and they were just ramming their way
 
04:27:25.990 --> 04:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
through things and this you know things
 
04:27:27.910 --> 04:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
have changed in two years a lot and
 
04:27:29.189 --> 04:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
they're starting to understand that new
 
04:27:29.199 --> 04:27:30.389 align:start position:0%
they're starting to understand that new
hampshire

04:27:30.389 --> 04:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:27:31.910 --> 04:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
isn't really interested in playing the
 
04:27:33.349 --> 04:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
game the way they thought it was going
 
04:27:35.910 --> 04:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
to be played here so this is this is a
 
04:27:38.070 --> 04:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
huge improvement yeah i can support that
 
04:27:40.149 --> 04:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
i would just recommend with
 
04:27:42.550 --> 04:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
representative bailey that we strike the
 
04:27:44.950 --> 04:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
word gross from this and just deal with
 
04:27:46.550 --> 04:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
floor space and just
 
04:27:47.830 --> 04:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
square feet
 
04:27:50.550 --> 04:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
04:27:52.309 --> 04:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and
 
04:27:53.750 --> 04:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
i i just want to
 
04:27:56.389 --> 04:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
state that i mean we heard
 
04:27:58.149 --> 04:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
as representative pearson said that they
 
04:28:00.309 --> 04:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
have come in here stating as a
 
04:28:01.910 --> 04:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
protective class
 
04:28:01.920 --> 04:28:03.030 align:start position:0%
protective class
and

04:28:03.030 --> 04:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:28:04.630 --> 04:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
one of the things and one of the issues
 
04:28:06.229 --> 04:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
this was brought before us and you heard
 
04:28:08.389 --> 04:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
it from the fire marshal that the 200
 
04:28:10.229 --> 04:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
square feet that they initially did was
 
04:28:11.349 --> 04:28:11.359 align:start position:0%
because they didn't know where to go
 
04:28:12.469 --> 04:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
when they started looking through the
 
04:28:14.790 --> 04:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
statutes they came out with a dormitory
 
04:28:14.800 --> 04:28:15.750 align:start position:0%
statutes they came out with a dormitory
number

04:28:15.750 --> 04:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
number
 
04:28:17.990 --> 04:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
well in
 
04:28:19.870 --> 04:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
square feet is the dormitory number
 
04:28:22.550 --> 04:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
fifty-five per bed no it was for
 
04:28:24.710 --> 04:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
something 200 it was from single family
 
04:28:25.910 --> 04:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
single family
 
04:28:26.870 --> 04:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:28:26.880 --> 04:28:28.710 align:start position:0%
thank you
the

04:28:28.710 --> 04:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:28:30.790 --> 04:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
by picking that number with nothing
 
04:28:30.800 --> 04:28:32.389 align:start position:0%
by picking that number with nothing
entailed

04:28:32.389 --> 04:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
entailed
 
04:28:34.550 --> 04:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
these folks are coming in
 
04:28:37.510 --> 04:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
declaring discriminatory nature because
 
04:28:39.510 --> 04:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
we're picking a number out of nowhere
 
04:28:40.790 --> 04:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
and this is where
 
04:28:40.800 --> 04:28:41.750 align:start position:0%
and this is where
they

04:28:41.750 --> 04:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:28:43.510 --> 04:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
in speaking with these folks went to a
 
04:28:45.429 --> 04:28:45.439 align:start position:0%
national number that's being used
 
04:28:47.750 --> 04:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
nationally so now there's no discrepancy
 
04:28:50.550 --> 04:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
and there's no discrimination against
 
04:28:52.469 --> 04:28:52.479 align:start position:0%
these folks because we're using the
 
04:28:55.750 --> 04:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
national standard that is going by them
 
04:28:57.750 --> 04:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
that's why this is here if we start
 
04:28:59.590 --> 04:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
changing this language now we're going
 
04:29:01.670 --> 04:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
away from that national standard the way
 
04:29:03.429 --> 04:29:03.439 align:start position:0%
it's worded nationally across the
 
04:29:05.590 --> 04:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
country which we haven't heard
 
04:29:07.429 --> 04:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
any problems with
 
04:29:09.750 --> 04:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
so i ask that you keep the language as
 
04:29:11.590 --> 04:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:29:13.670 --> 04:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
and not change it there is nobody here
 
04:29:15.990 --> 04:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
testifying that it isn't working across
 
04:29:16.000 --> 04:29:16.830 align:start position:0%
testifying that it isn't working across
the

04:29:16.830 --> 04:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:29:18.870 --> 04:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
country thank you
 
04:29:21.590 --> 04:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien and then bailey
 
04:29:23.590 --> 04:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
ah thank you madam chair i would just
 
04:29:26.149 --> 04:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
like to state that um i heard testimony
 
04:29:28.550 --> 04:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
by senator d'alessandro this will bring
 
04:29:31.349 --> 04:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
it up as representative gulley mentioned
 
04:29:33.830 --> 04:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
national standards jake barry said the
 
04:29:36.630 --> 04:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
same thing what is the national standard
 
04:29:38.790 --> 04:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
when you come down to occupancies and
 
04:29:38.800 --> 04:29:39.990 align:start position:0%
when you come down to occupancies and
such

04:29:39.990 --> 04:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
such
 
04:29:43.030 --> 04:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
you're under the guidelines of the nfpa
 
04:29:45.750 --> 04:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
the national fire protection association
 
04:29:47.670 --> 04:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
i have been a veteran of a couple of
 
04:29:50.229 --> 04:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
battles in nashua when does a rectory
 
04:29:52.710 --> 04:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
become a roaming house or when does a
 
04:29:55.429 --> 04:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
you know climate become a roaming house
 
04:29:57.990 --> 04:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
and looking at some of those type of
 
04:30:00.870 --> 04:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
issues there to strike anything i'm sure
 
04:30:03.110 --> 04:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
when you have the fire marshal come up
 
04:30:05.830 --> 04:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
and sit here before us he has to do some
 
04:30:08.710 --> 04:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
detailed work into looking in in the
 
04:30:11.429 --> 04:30:11.439 align:start position:0%
proper language and i think to gross and
 
04:30:12.790 --> 04:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
to strike it
 
04:30:15.189 --> 04:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
i just cautioned that
 
04:30:18.309 --> 04:30:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh without a dnfa book
 
04:30:21.030 --> 04:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
in front of me i cannot say striking out
 
04:30:23.030 --> 04:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
anything with jeopardize would not
 
04:30:25.590 --> 04:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
jeopardize this i'm gonna rely on the
 
04:30:28.710 --> 04:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
expertise of the state fire marshal and
 
04:30:31.110 --> 04:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
leave the language as correctly in
 
04:30:33.750 --> 04:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
support not support any changes
 
04:30:36.950 --> 04:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative bailey well i i seem to
 
04:30:39.189 --> 04:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
recall that nobody could define growth
 
04:30:41.590 --> 04:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
for me representative allegro provided
 
04:30:41.600 --> 04:30:42.550 align:start position:0%
for me representative allegro provided
that

04:30:42.550 --> 04:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:30:42.560 --> 04:30:43.830 align:start position:0%
that
but

04:30:43.830 --> 04:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:30:45.990 --> 04:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
a second when you talked about stacking
 
04:30:48.550 --> 04:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
it puts in mind what prevents you from
 
04:30:51.670 --> 04:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
doubling this with bunk beds
 
04:30:53.590 --> 04:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
it's per person
 
04:30:55.990 --> 04:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
so there's they still have 50 feet of
 
04:30:57.510 --> 04:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
space this is not we're not we're not
 
04:30:59.269 --> 04:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
landing airplanes this is the floor
 
04:31:01.189 --> 04:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
space yeah so you can't if you have a
 
04:31:03.269 --> 04:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
100 square foot bedroom you could put in
 
04:31:04.870 --> 04:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
a bunk bed
 
04:31:08.229 --> 04:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:11.510 --> 04:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
i just i i i find find it hard to
 
04:31:14.469 --> 04:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
believe that there's some kind of
 
04:31:17.429 --> 04:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
guidance somewhere that has this exact
 
04:31:20.309 --> 04:31:20.319 align:start position:0%
wording i mean it just is so
 
04:31:20.319 --> 04:31:21.910 align:start position:0%
wording i mean it just is so
convoluted

04:31:21.910 --> 04:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
convoluted
 
04:31:23.189 --> 04:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
that that
 
04:31:24.710 --> 04:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
that there's a guidance somewhere that
 
04:31:28.229 --> 04:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
says the facility shall have a minimum
 
04:31:28.239 --> 04:31:29.670 align:start position:0%
says the facility shall have a minimum
500

04:31:29.670 --> 04:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
500
 
04:31:32.950 --> 04:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
gross square feet per bed per sleeping
 
04:31:34.710 --> 04:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
room i just can't imagine it's worth
 
04:31:36.950 --> 04:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's awarded like that uh well you
 
04:31:38.469 --> 04:31:38.479 align:start position:0%
you're not as familiar with building
 
04:31:41.189 --> 04:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
codes and the this the fire code as some
 
04:31:42.870 --> 04:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
some of our other members i worked for
 
04:31:45.189 --> 04:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
the nfpa i was a technical advisor for
 
04:31:45.199 --> 04:31:45.910 align:start position:0%
the nfpa i was a technical advisor for
them

04:31:45.910 --> 04:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:31:45.920 --> 04:31:46.790 align:start position:0%
them
and

04:31:46.790 --> 04:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:31:48.149 --> 04:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
if i put the fire codes in their
 
04:31:50.469 --> 04:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
entirety on this table
 
04:31:52.630 --> 04:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
it's two and a half feet
 
04:31:54.790 --> 04:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
so so
 
04:31:56.870 --> 04:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
the this type of language is is is
 
04:31:58.229 --> 04:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
exactly what you find in codes for a
 
04:32:00.469 --> 04:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
reason it's so if they're talking about
 
04:32:03.030 --> 04:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
this the square footage in a bedroom why
 
04:32:07.429 --> 04:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:10.149 --> 04:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
because recovery houses see this is this
 
04:32:11.510 --> 04:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
is the problem that you have in the
 
04:32:13.990 --> 04:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
recovery house world in the sense that
 
04:32:15.590 --> 04:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
that when it's convenient for them
 
04:32:17.670 --> 04:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
they're a facility and when it's
 
04:32:20.070 --> 04:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
convenient for them they're an exempt
 
04:32:22.550 --> 04:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
protected class single family home and
 
04:32:24.469 --> 04:32:24.479 align:start position:0%
they stay and when it's convenient they
 
04:32:25.830 --> 04:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
say they're a family that's right and
 
04:32:27.429 --> 04:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
they and they and that's one of the
 
04:32:29.030 --> 04:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
problems that i've the beefs that i've
 
04:32:30.469 --> 04:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
had with new hampshire corps from the
 
04:32:32.550 --> 04:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
beginning is they very conveniently kind
 
04:32:34.870 --> 04:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
of swing between the two things when
 
04:32:36.790 --> 04:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
it's convenient so sometimes they are a
 
04:32:36.800 --> 04:32:37.910 align:start position:0%
it's convenient so sometimes they are a
facility

04:32:37.910 --> 04:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
facility
 
04:32:39.510 --> 04:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
where the code where the national the
 
04:32:41.510 --> 04:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
fire code kicks in is that boarding
 
04:32:43.910 --> 04:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
houses are looked at in a very different
 
04:32:46.550 --> 04:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
world than a treatment type of a center
 
04:32:48.550 --> 04:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
and that's why the word facility comes
 
04:32:51.189 --> 04:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
into play okay i'm just trying to like
 
04:32:52.309 --> 04:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
make it
 
04:32:54.950 --> 04:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
normal english
 
04:32:57.590 --> 04:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
no no no the the codes don't use normal
 
04:32:57.600 --> 04:33:01.030 align:start position:0%
no no no the the codes don't use normal
english

04:33:01.030 --> 04:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:03.590 --> 04:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's rather stylized yes i mean i'm
 
04:33:05.750 --> 04:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
serious i worked i worked on engineering
 
04:33:08.070 --> 04:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
codes and they're the same way yeah i'm
 
04:33:09.510 --> 04:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
sure do you
 
04:33:10.869 --> 04:33:10.879 align:start position:0%
okay representation i just can't believe
 
04:33:12.310 --> 04:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
they have the growth thank you madam
 
04:33:14.230 --> 04:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
chair i just want to want to bring us
 
04:33:17.349 --> 04:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
back around to the to the center here
 
04:33:19.029 --> 04:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
we're actually discussing it not to pass
 
04:33:20.551 --> 04:33:20.561 align:start position:0%
motion and i and i feel like we're
 
04:33:22.869 --> 04:33:22.879 align:start position:0%
getting hung up in words of a possible
 
04:33:24.470 --> 04:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
amendment when we're
 
04:33:26.070 --> 04:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
we're actually we're debating and ought
 
04:33:27.990 --> 04:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
to pass on
 
04:33:30.470 --> 04:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
house bill 223 so if ever i don't know
 
04:33:32.470 --> 04:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
if i'm gonna is that where i'm at
 
04:33:34.629 --> 04:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
senate bill senate bill my bad
 
04:33:34.639 --> 04:33:35.830 align:start position:0%
senate bill senate bill my bad
um

04:33:35.830 --> 04:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:36.709 --> 04:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
so just
 
04:33:38.869 --> 04:33:38.879 align:start position:0%
kind of wanna redirect our efforts here
 
04:33:41.269 --> 04:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
and see if we can
 
04:33:43.269 --> 04:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
and we can vote
 
04:33:44.629 --> 04:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
i would not support an amendment to
 
04:33:46.949 --> 04:33:46.959 align:start position:0%
change that okay
 
04:33:48.949 --> 04:33:48.959 align:start position:0%
is it is there anyone else who wishes to
 
04:33:48.959 --> 04:33:52.230 align:start position:0%
is it is there anyone else who wishes to
comment

04:33:52.230 --> 04:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:54.070 --> 04:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
well i i think
 
04:33:57.189 --> 04:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
yes might not be a bad idea before we
 
04:33:58.390 --> 04:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
complete this
 
04:34:00.070 --> 04:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
just to double check that our
 
04:34:01.590 --> 04:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
understanding i mean we got a lot of
 
04:34:04.629 --> 04:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
expertise here and experience so i'm i'm
 
04:34:07.830 --> 04:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not hospital that testimony at all
 
04:34:09.590 --> 04:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
we could we could
 
04:34:11.670 --> 04:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
ask a question or two just to confirm
 
04:34:11.680 --> 04:34:12.390 align:start position:0%
ask a question or two just to confirm
that

04:34:12.390 --> 04:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:34:14.949 --> 04:34:14.959 align:start position:0%
if everybody's on board with that but
 
04:34:17.189 --> 04:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
otherwise i think that the language that
 
04:34:18.949 --> 04:34:18.959 align:start position:0%
we're seeing here is the language that
 
04:34:21.830 --> 04:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
the fire marshal you know the
 
04:34:24.150 --> 04:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
person who has the responsibility in the
 
04:34:27.029 --> 04:34:27.039 align:start position:0%
state for this has testified in support
 
04:34:30.390 --> 04:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
of so i'm happy to go forward with that
 
04:34:33.189 --> 04:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
just just to run the idea of
 
04:34:35.429 --> 04:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
asking a question or two before we
 
04:34:41.429 --> 04:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:43.510 --> 04:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
does any and how how many people think
 
04:34:45.269 --> 04:34:45.279 align:start position:0%
we need to wait and gather more
 
04:34:45.279 --> 04:34:46.470 align:start position:0%
we need to wait and gather more
information

04:34:46.470 --> 04:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:34:46.480 --> 04:34:49.189 align:start position:0%
information
yeah

04:34:49.189 --> 04:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:50.789 --> 04:34:50.799 align:start position:0%
i'm ready to vote on it
 
04:34:52.949 --> 04:34:52.959 align:start position:0%
okay there's three people that think we

1329
 
04:36:56.470 --> 04:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
h and if anyone doesn't have it i've got
 
04:36:59.429 --> 04:36:59.439 align:start position:0%
some more copies here
 
04:37:01.269 --> 04:37:01.279 align:start position:0%
if it's not on get your place that means
 
04:37:03.109 --> 04:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
you probably didn't get it
 
04:37:05.590 --> 04:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
i'll pass it around
 
04:37:10.949 --> 04:37:10.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:13.349 --> 04:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
well we discussed this this amendment
 
04:37:15.590 --> 04:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
merely moves
 
04:37:17.750 --> 04:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh well
 
04:37:19.750 --> 04:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
procedurally speaking i'm going to move
 
04:37:22.070 --> 04:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
out to pass with the amendment is there
 
04:37:25.510 --> 04:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:29.910 --> 04:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:33.750 --> 04:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
all right so the amendment is 1329 h
 
04:37:36.470 --> 04:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
and that repeat simply deletes the
 
04:37:38.629 --> 04:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
section talking about
 
04:37:41.590 --> 04:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
the effectivity of the building code
 
04:37:44.230 --> 04:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
because we covered it more thoroughly
 
04:37:44.240 --> 04:37:46.551 align:start position:0%
because we covered it more thoroughly
in

04:37:46.551 --> 04:37:46.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:48.551 --> 04:37:48.561 align:start position:0%
13 1681
 
04:37:51.750 --> 04:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
yeah houseboat 1681 which is marching
 
04:37:53.510 --> 04:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
through the senate
 
04:38:00.869 --> 04:38:00.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:03.750 --> 04:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
and for people who don't like
 
04:38:05.910 --> 04:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
study committees this bill takes an
 
04:38:08.629 --> 04:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
existing and ineffective committee
 
04:38:11.349 --> 04:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
re-titles it and repurposes it to
 
04:38:13.670 --> 04:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
something that's useful
 
04:38:15.990 --> 04:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
represent goalie
 
04:38:17.910 --> 04:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair right very well
 
04:38:19.670 --> 04:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
said and i think this
 
04:38:21.670 --> 04:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
just strikes out that section you
 
04:38:27.990 --> 04:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:30.551 --> 04:38:30.561 align:start position:0%
any other comments on the amendment well
 
04:38:36.070 --> 04:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:38.949 --> 04:38:38.959 align:start position:0%
okay i don't see any
 
04:38:42.310 --> 04:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
madam chair if uh if i may having
 
04:38:44.070 --> 04:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
spent a bit of time testifying over in
 
04:38:45.189 --> 04:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
04:38:46.551 --> 04:38:46.561 align:start position:0%
one of the common questions that the
 
04:38:49.269 --> 04:38:49.279 align:start position:0%
senate asks is if the
 
04:38:51.429 --> 04:38:51.439 align:start position:0%
if the when the immense stop as if the
 
04:38:53.429 --> 04:38:53.439 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the original bill was okay
 
04:38:56.150 --> 04:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
with the amendment
 
04:38:57.830 --> 04:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
so i guess i'll ask you is senator
 
04:39:00.869 --> 04:39:00.879 align:start position:0%
carson okay with this
 
04:39:02.551 --> 04:39:02.561 align:start position:0%
well she was here when we discussed
 
04:39:04.869 --> 04:39:04.879 align:start position:0%
deleting that section and she didn't
 
04:39:07.590 --> 04:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
make any objection to it every the other
 
04:39:09.830 --> 04:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
people who were testifying
 
04:39:11.429 --> 04:39:11.439 align:start position:0%
the building code review board and the
 
04:39:13.990 --> 04:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
fire marshal both said that the
 
04:39:17.109 --> 04:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
wording in 1681 was
 
04:39:19.269 --> 04:39:19.279 align:start position:0%
was better than what's in here this was
 
04:39:20.709 --> 04:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
just kind of a
 
04:39:23.109 --> 04:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
built-in suspenders
 
04:39:25.269 --> 04:39:25.279 align:start position:0%

04:39:29.830 --> 04:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh just to clarify
 
04:39:32.629 --> 04:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
the testimony of the both fire marshal
 
04:39:35.830 --> 04:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
and mr sherman who was the chair of the
 
04:39:37.430 --> 04:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
building code review board or something
 
04:39:40.550 --> 04:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
like that both wanted lines 23 to 29
 
04:39:42.788 --> 04:39:42.798 align:start position:0%
removed is that what your amendment does
 
04:39:47.030 --> 04:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
yes sir exactly that section 1 ends at
 
04:39:48.470 --> 04:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
line 22
 
04:39:50.470 --> 04:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
so then it goes into this change and
 
04:39:52.628 --> 04:39:52.638 align:start position:0%

04:39:56.788 --> 04:39:56.798 align:start position:0%

04:41:37.200 --> 04:41:38.628 align:start position:0%
you told you it was inactive and
ineffective

04:41:38.628 --> 04:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
ineffective
 
04:41:40.948 --> 04:41:40.958 align:start position:0%
so we don't we don't even know who sits
 
04:41:42.230 --> 04:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
on the
 
04:41:44.230 --> 04:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
i don't believe it's done anything in a
 
04:41:46.550 --> 04:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
long time so this so it hasn't been
 
04:41:48.070 --> 04:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
sapped by the by the speaker of the
 
04:41:48.080 --> 04:41:49.030 align:start position:0%
sapped by the by the speaker of the
house

04:41:49.030 --> 04:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
house
 
04:41:52.470 --> 04:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:54.390 --> 04:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
yeah it replaces a joint committee on
 
04:41:56.390 --> 04:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
code enforcement which
 
04:41:58.868 --> 04:41:58.878 align:start position:0%
with the this advisory committee and
 
04:42:00.788 --> 04:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
that will is something this was a
 
04:42:03.590 --> 04:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the study committee
 
04:42:04.788 --> 04:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
last year
 
04:42:07.190 --> 04:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
that about building codes so this will
 
04:42:09.750 --> 04:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
let us get started on code updates in a
 
04:42:13.110 --> 04:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:15.030 --> 04:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
anyone else rep ah thank you
 
04:42:17.350 --> 04:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
representative allegra
 
04:42:18.868 --> 04:42:18.878 align:start position:0%
thank you i just had a couple of
 
04:42:20.708 --> 04:42:20.718 align:start position:0%
questions and concerns but again they
 
04:42:23.830 --> 04:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
may be based on a misunderstanding so
 
04:42:25.430 --> 04:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
i'm going to put them out and ask for
 
04:42:25.440 --> 04:42:29.430 align:start position:0%
i'm going to put them out and ask for
clarification

04:42:29.430 --> 04:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:32.708 --> 04:42:32.718 align:start position:0%
if i understood correctly this is
 
04:42:34.708 --> 04:42:34.718 align:start position:0%
going to reduce the involvement of the
 
04:42:34.718 --> 04:42:36.550 align:start position:0%
going to reduce the involvement of the
legislature

04:42:36.550 --> 04:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
04:42:36.560 --> 04:42:37.670 align:start position:0%
legislature
and

04:42:37.670 --> 04:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:42:39.830 --> 04:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
am i wrong on that interrupt me please
 
04:42:41.990 --> 04:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's not going to reduce the involvement
 
04:42:44.708 --> 04:42:44.718 align:start position:0%
of the legislature okay it will in fact
 
04:42:45.990 --> 04:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
increase it
 
04:42:47.910 --> 04:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
into the inner workings of the building
 
04:42:49.990 --> 04:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
code review board and the fire control
 
04:42:51.830 --> 04:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
board because
 
04:42:53.510 --> 04:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
instead of getting a bill every couple
 
04:42:55.430 --> 04:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
of years thrown at us
 
04:42:57.510 --> 04:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
we'd be this committee would be meeting
 
04:42:59.510 --> 04:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
with the building code review board and
 
04:43:03.190 --> 04:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
the board of fire control to see
 
04:43:05.590 --> 04:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
in the process of making amendments to
 
04:43:07.670 --> 04:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
them okay yeah my concern was that we're
 
04:43:09.750 --> 04:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
taking power away from legislature
 
04:43:10.788 --> 04:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
putting more in the hands of the
 
04:43:12.310 --> 04:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
executive branch but
 
04:43:12.320 --> 04:43:13.110 align:start position:0%
executive branch but
um

04:43:13.110 --> 04:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:15.190 --> 04:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification and
 
04:43:17.270 --> 04:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
then the other thing and this is minor
 
04:43:20.150 --> 04:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
it's not gonna well it's not minor
 
04:43:22.550 --> 04:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
but it's uh and it's not going to
 
04:43:25.030 --> 04:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
interfere with my vote on this
 
04:43:27.670 --> 04:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
but just the testimony that uh regarding
 
04:43:30.310 --> 04:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
making it harder for trades people
 
04:43:32.868 --> 04:43:32.878 align:start position:0%
um to have to go from town to town
 
04:43:35.110 --> 04:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
this doesn't affect that at all
 
04:43:38.070 --> 04:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
so where did that come in ah that was
 
04:43:39.990 --> 04:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
in the original bill before the senate
 
04:43:41.990 --> 04:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
deleted it okay
 
04:43:45.788 --> 04:43:45.798 align:start position:0%
i'm good thank you it's yeah the
 
04:43:49.430 --> 04:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
1681 also has a statement where towns
 
04:43:52.230 --> 04:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
have to provide their
 
04:43:53.750 --> 04:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
amendments the building code to the
 
04:43:55.350 --> 04:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
building code review board which will
 
04:43:57.110 --> 04:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
publish them that will help the
 
04:43:59.430 --> 04:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
tradesman going from town to town it
 
04:44:02.230 --> 04:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
won't help the fact that i think hudson
 
04:44:04.708 --> 04:44:04.718 align:start position:0%
wants one type of electrical cable and
 
04:44:06.868 --> 04:44:06.878 align:start position:0%
pelham wants a different one
 
04:44:08.788 --> 04:44:08.798 align:start position:0%
but that's their problem yeah thank you
 
04:44:10.470 --> 04:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
my antennae just went up because i
 
04:44:12.390 --> 04:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
didn't think that that
 
04:44:14.390 --> 04:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
bit of testimony held a lot of yeah
 
04:44:17.030 --> 04:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
sharon's testimony i'm afraid kind of
 
04:44:17.040 --> 04:44:18.150 align:start position:0%
sharon's testimony i'm afraid kind of
muddled

04:44:18.150 --> 04:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
muddled
 
04:44:20.150 --> 04:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
the two or three bills that came out of
 
04:44:22.788 --> 04:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
that study committee and this bill as
 
04:44:24.948 --> 04:44:24.958 align:start position:0%
amended by the senate is
 
04:44:29.750 --> 04:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
a lot simpler than what we started with
 
04:44:29.760 --> 04:44:31.110 align:start position:0%
a lot simpler than what we started with
okay

04:44:31.110 --> 04:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:44:33.190 --> 04:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
anyone else represent fellows
 
04:44:37.590 --> 04:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
um i just had a question about why um
 
04:44:40.470 --> 04:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
the membership of the house is
 
04:44:43.670 --> 04:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
two people from edna i i understand that
 
04:44:46.230 --> 04:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
one person from finance i'm just
 
04:44:48.150 --> 04:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
thinking that really the people you want
 
04:44:49.910 --> 04:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
on the committee are people who know if
 
04:44:53.510 --> 04:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
i understand fire codes and understand
 
04:44:57.990 --> 04:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:00.150 --> 04:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure why finance either except
 
04:45:00.160 --> 04:45:01.510 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure why finance either except
they're

04:45:01.510 --> 04:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
they're
 
04:45:03.270 --> 04:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
generally familiar with all sorts of
 
04:45:05.990 --> 04:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
things they may be familiar with with
 
04:45:06.000 --> 04:45:06.788 align:start position:0%
things they may be familiar with with
the

04:45:06.788 --> 04:45:06.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:45:09.510 --> 04:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
state procurement process and bill and
 
04:45:12.390 --> 04:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
the buildings that we put up
 
04:45:12.400 --> 04:45:17.030 align:start position:0%
the buildings that we put up
but

04:45:17.030 --> 04:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:18.708 --> 04:45:18.718 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with money signature
 
04:45:20.628 --> 04:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
they're familiar with money too so it's
 
04:45:20.638 --> 04:45:21.750 align:start position:0%
they're familiar with money too so it's
uh

04:45:21.750 --> 04:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:45:24.628 --> 04:45:24.638 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm not sure why either i wasn't
 
04:45:26.788 --> 04:45:26.798 align:start position:0%
consulted finance always wants to have
 
04:45:31.110 --> 04:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:32.550 --> 04:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
and you need somebody other than needing
 
04:45:34.230 --> 04:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
to e-dna with another point of view i
 
04:45:35.910 --> 04:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
think yeah we definitely want somebody
 
04:45:35.920 --> 04:45:37.510 align:start position:0%
think yeah we definitely want somebody
different

04:45:37.510 --> 04:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:45:37.520 --> 04:45:40.070 align:start position:0%
different
but

04:45:40.070 --> 04:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:43.190 --> 04:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
i i i'm not sure who else it would be i
 
04:45:44.948 --> 04:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
mean just anyone in general would be
 
04:45:46.948 --> 04:45:46.958 align:start position:0%
well i was just thinking in terms of if
 
04:45:49.510 --> 04:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
it just said and somebody appointed by
 
04:45:52.310 --> 04:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
the speaker then you would assume they'd
 
04:45:54.150 --> 04:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
appoint somebody who
 
04:45:59.590 --> 04:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:00.948 --> 04:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
perhaps i
 
04:46:02.470 --> 04:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
share your concern but i don't think
 
04:46:04.628 --> 04:46:04.638 align:start position:0%
it's worth fighting for and if if you'd
 
04:46:06.390 --> 04:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
been if we thought about it we could
 
04:46:08.310 --> 04:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
have deleted that when i made the other
 
04:46:08.320 --> 04:46:09.830 align:start position:0%
have deleted that when i made the other
amendment

04:46:09.830 --> 04:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:46:12.070 --> 04:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
but sorry about that madam chair when
 
04:46:13.910 --> 04:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
this leaves edna is this going to
 
04:46:17.110 --> 04:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
finance nope okay
 
04:46:18.830 --> 04:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
just not an early
 
04:46:18.840 --> 04:46:20.550 align:start position:0%
just not an early
bill

04:46:20.550 --> 04:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:46:23.270 --> 04:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
and the other representative schmidt
 
04:46:25.190 --> 04:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
having observed the inner workings of
 
04:46:28.310 --> 04:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
the edna committee uh and the building
 
04:46:30.550 --> 04:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
code review board there's another one
 
04:46:31.910 --> 04:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
what's the one that
 
04:46:35.110 --> 04:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
that ransomware what's his name
 
04:46:38.070 --> 04:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
ranford i think rancor ran court that's
 
04:46:40.628 --> 04:46:40.638 align:start position:0%
his name um
 
04:46:42.628 --> 04:46:42.638 align:start position:0%
there's something here contractors know
 
04:46:45.190 --> 04:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
what i'm talking about having observed
 
04:46:47.190 --> 04:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
the inner workings and the
 
04:46:48.788 --> 04:46:48.798 align:start position:0%
i think that this bill really has the
 
04:46:51.190 --> 04:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
possibility this construct has a
 
04:46:54.070 --> 04:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
possibility of enhancing the the
 
04:46:56.948 --> 04:46:56.958 align:start position:0%
cooperation and collaboration and also
 
04:46:58.230 --> 04:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
that you don't
 
04:46:59.990 --> 04:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
find out that some they're off there
 
04:47:02.150 --> 04:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
doing something that we don't like or
 
04:47:03.670 --> 04:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
they're we're doing something they don't
 
04:47:03.680 --> 04:47:04.550 align:start position:0%
they're we're doing something they don't
like

04:47:04.550 --> 04:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:47:06.390 --> 04:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
this collaboration i think really could
 
04:47:08.868 --> 04:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
improve the process a lot and i think
 
04:47:11.110 --> 04:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
it's definitely worth a try
 
04:47:12.948 --> 04:47:12.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:47:15.270 --> 04:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
i'll jump off of that for those that
 
04:47:18.230 --> 04:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
that have not been on edna very long
 
04:47:20.230 --> 04:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
there were times in this room where the
 
04:47:22.070 --> 04:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
where there was a war going on in the
 
04:47:23.910 --> 04:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
seats over there
 
04:47:26.310 --> 04:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
literally because the groups were not on
 
04:47:27.910 --> 04:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
the same page
 
04:47:29.990 --> 04:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
and when this when the last group of
 
04:47:32.070 --> 04:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
changes rolled through here and every
 
04:47:34.230 --> 04:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
single group came up here and was this i
 
04:47:36.150 --> 04:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
couldn't believe what i was that never
 
04:47:38.628 --> 04:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
happened like so
 
04:47:42.150 --> 04:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
if we can have some collaboration before
 
04:47:45.110 --> 04:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
it gets into this room with this stuff
 
04:47:47.670 --> 04:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
and that's what this appears to be doing
 
04:47:49.030 --> 04:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
i think that's going to make life easier
 
04:47:49.040 --> 04:47:49.750 align:start position:0%
i think that's going to make life easier
for

04:47:49.750 --> 04:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:47:51.830 --> 04:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
for the legislature
 
04:47:54.708 --> 04:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
as a whole to not have to sit in front
 
04:47:56.868 --> 04:47:56.878 align:start position:0%
of a war between the building trades in
 
04:48:00.310 --> 04:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
this room and also it's that's a war
 
04:48:03.030 --> 04:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
that most of us are not really
 
04:48:05.430 --> 04:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
that competent to to figure out who's
 
04:48:08.310 --> 04:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
right and who's wrong and if they agree
 
04:48:11.430 --> 04:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
then we're much happier
 
04:48:14.788 --> 04:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
okay you get the attorneys for the uh
 
04:48:17.030 --> 04:48:17.040 align:start position:0%

do you wish to speak to your motion
 
04:51:00.230 --> 04:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh just briefly um i think we had a
 
04:51:02.070 --> 04:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
pretty good explanation of what's going
 
04:51:04.390 --> 04:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
on there i'm satisfied i understand why
 
04:51:06.310 --> 04:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
there's no fiscal note it makes sense
 
04:51:07.670 --> 04:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:51:09.830 --> 04:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
it's a a generally good idea to have
 
04:51:11.430 --> 04:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
people's title have something to do with
 
04:51:15.270 --> 04:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
what they're actually doing so that's it
 
04:51:17.750 --> 04:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
okay robin pearson
 
04:51:19.910 --> 04:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
i fully agree with representative lekkis
 
04:51:21.830 --> 04:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
i i certainly was concerned when they're
 
04:51:23.670 --> 04:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
talking about how the system that was
 
04:51:26.470 --> 04:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
put into place was done in the 1930s
 
04:51:28.868 --> 04:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
and uh you know
 
04:51:30.390 --> 04:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
clearly at some point they're going to
 
04:51:32.470 --> 04:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
need to look at
 
04:51:32.480 --> 04:51:33.590 align:start position:0%
need to look at
um

04:51:33.590 --> 04:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:35.510 --> 04:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
at this this whole venture you know i
 
04:51:37.910 --> 04:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
mean as he said they have a thousand
 
04:51:40.230 --> 04:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
positions that now have enhancements so
 
04:51:42.310 --> 04:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
it clearly tells you that this this
 
04:51:45.350 --> 04:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
system is is definitely antiquated so
 
04:51:47.590 --> 04:51:47.600 align:start position:0%
you know but until such time as we come
 
04:51:48.868 --> 04:51:48.878 align:start position:0%
up with something else this is what we
 
04:51:50.948 --> 04:51:50.958 align:start position:0%
have in place and it needs to function
 
04:51:50.958 --> 04:51:51.830 align:start position:0%
have in place and it needs to function
so

04:51:51.830 --> 04:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:51:55.430 --> 04:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
here we are okay represent goalie
 
04:51:57.190 --> 04:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and
 
04:51:58.550 --> 04:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
i agree especially about those
 
04:52:01.350 --> 04:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
enhancements when we talk about um
 
04:52:03.270 --> 04:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
what the state is paying some of its
 
04:52:04.628 --> 04:52:04.638 align:start position:0%
employees and
 
04:52:06.390 --> 04:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
as i was out and about this weekend and
 
04:52:08.230 --> 04:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
stopped at
 
04:52:09.430 --> 04:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
a local
 
04:52:11.430 --> 04:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
establishment and saw that they had on
 
04:52:13.990 --> 04:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
their doors a posting looking for
 
04:52:16.470 --> 04:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh hiring cashiers and checkers and
 
04:52:18.628 --> 04:52:18.638 align:start position:0%
starting at twelve dollars and change an
 
04:52:18.638 --> 04:52:19.510 align:start position:0%
starting at twelve dollars and change an
hour

04:52:19.510 --> 04:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
hour
 
04:52:20.948 --> 04:52:20.958 align:start position:0%
i thought was
 
04:52:22.550 --> 04:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
pretty pathetic
 
04:52:23.990 --> 04:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
looking at our state agency actually
 
04:52:26.230 --> 04:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
putting that on their front door
 
04:52:27.670 --> 04:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
when you can see signs out there for
 
04:52:29.190 --> 04:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
dunkin donuts mcdonald's and other
 
04:52:32.070 --> 04:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
places paying well over that so there is
 
04:52:34.390 --> 04:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
needed change
 
04:52:37.110 --> 04:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
okay this is a small step
 
04:52:39.990 --> 04:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else
 
04:52:42.550 --> 04:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
okay the motion is ought to pass on
 
04:52:44.788 --> 04:52:44.798 align:start position:0%
senate bill 460 and the clerk can call
 
04:52:48.470 --> 04:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:50.550 --> 04:52:50.560 align:start position:0%

represent yes representative
 
04:53:34.470 --> 04:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
with respect to commissioner
 
04:53:36.868 --> 04:53:36.878 align:start position:0%
arlinghaus's presentation
 
04:53:38.628 --> 04:53:38.638 align:start position:0%
i heard all that
 
04:53:42.070 --> 04:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
at jcec and if i had real powers of
 
04:53:44.310 --> 04:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
recollection i could have said it all i
 
04:53:46.830 --> 04:53:46.840 align:start position:0%
forgot it once i'll probably forget it
 
04:53:51.670 --> 04:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:53.750 --> 04:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
well i think it's important for us to to
 
04:53:56.310 --> 04:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
hear from the commissioner with regard
 
04:53:58.708 --> 04:53:58.718 align:start position:0%
to some of these issues because

the request of the agency then
 
04:54:30.718 --> 04:54:31.788 align:start position:0%
the request of the agency then
the

04:54:31.788 --> 04:54:31.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:54:35.350 --> 04:54:35.360 align:start position:0%

that
 
04:54:38.708 --> 04:54:38.718 align:start position:0%
it gets the politic partisan politics
 
04:54:41.190 --> 04:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
out of it that you know causing a lot of
 
04:54:41.200 --> 04:54:42.868 align:start position:0%
out of it that you know causing a lot of
problems

04:54:42.868 --> 04:54:42.878 align:start position:0%
problems
 
04:54:44.628 --> 04:54:44.638 align:start position:0%
several decades ago
 
04:54:48.390 --> 04:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
um but then it's the edna committee's
 
04:54:51.430 --> 04:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility to put that change in the
 
04:54:54.390 --> 04:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
statute then it goes to finance for
 
04:54:57.030 --> 04:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
financing and so forth so it is an
 
04:54:59.430 --> 04:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
antiquated system but as representative
 
04:55:03.270 --> 04:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
pearson said uh it it is working and the
 
04:55:06.230 --> 04:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
ministerial function of the jcec
 
04:55:08.310 --> 04:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
works and representative scitec and i
 
04:55:09.990 --> 04:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
have been on it for more than 10 years
 
04:55:12.310 --> 04:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
so we've seen it in action so thank you
 
04:55:14.390 --> 04:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
for your support of it
 
04:55:14.400 --> 04:55:18.390 align:start position:0%
for your support of it
okay

04:55:18.390 --> 04:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:18.400 --> 04:55:20.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:55:20.230 --> 04:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:55:23.670 --> 04:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
cleaning up representative lekkis moves
 
04:55:27.350 --> 04:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on senate bill 356 the
 
04:55:29.990 --> 04:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
medical benefits payments
 
04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
is there a second a second
 
04:55:36.470 --> 04:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:39.750 --> 04:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
we should speak to your motion sure um
 
04:55:41.190 --> 04:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
i think this is pretty straightforward
 
04:55:43.670 --> 04:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
it aligns the billing and renewal and
 
04:55:45.830 --> 04:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
expiration policy
 
04:55:47.430 --> 04:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
with um you know the federal
 
04:55:49.750 --> 04:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
requirements and i don't always support
 
04:55:52.150 --> 04:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
federal requirements but looking at it i
 
04:55:55.510 --> 04:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
think it looks reasonable and um
 
04:55:57.590 --> 04:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know if we want to stay uh you know
 
04:56:00.070 --> 04:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
getting the federal money from uh
 
04:56:02.788 --> 04:56:02.798 align:start position:0%
medicare um so and i don't see you know
 
04:56:05.430 --> 04:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
anything particularly bad about these
 
04:56:07.510 --> 04:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
um and they're from my experience
 
04:56:09.670 --> 04:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
typical for other insurance policies if
 
04:56:11.750 --> 04:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
you stop paying them you you stop
 
04:56:13.670 --> 04:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
getting coverage and you've got to start
 
04:56:15.510 --> 04:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
up again so i don't see anything
 
04:56:17.670 --> 04:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
objectionable here okay representative
 
04:56:20.310 --> 04:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
