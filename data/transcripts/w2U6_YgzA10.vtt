00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
because of the situation we have here
 
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
with limited amount of zoom
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
um meetings and individuals that can
 
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
assist us
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
actually next thursday the 28th
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
and then the following thursday
 
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
uh the fourth um those are the two
 
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.030 align:start position:0%
uh the fourth um those are the two
schedules

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
schedules
 
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
meetings at this point um so i will
 
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
quickly uh get together a list today so
 
00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
i can make the calendars that the bills
 
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
will be looking at
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
for those two dates it is my hope
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
that we can look at these 16 bills in
 
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
three sessions
 
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
um and have the hearings leadership has
 
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
expressed that when we do have a hearing
 
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
date they want us to meet the full day
 
00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
not a half a day um so we will be
 
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
meeting these
 
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
um these three days will be long days
 
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
for us
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
it is my intent not to i don't like to
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
do it
 
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh i don't like to exec any bill that
 
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
has been heard the same day
 
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
um we will have the ability uh
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
the bills could be exact um
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
at any uh any of the sessions but i will
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
not be doing anything today
 
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh bill has heard um
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
don't just don't like to do that we're
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
going to do our best here with zoom as
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
you can see
 
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
from the screen here we are able to see
 
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
each other
 
00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:24.959 align:start position:0%
we will not be able to see people
 
00:11:24.959 --> 00:11:26.310 align:start position:0%
we will not be able to see people
testifying

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
now i don't have all of the rules they
 
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
have not been provided to me yet i'm
 
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
sure they'll be provided to all of the
 
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.310 align:start position:0%
sure they'll be provided to all of the
representatives

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh by the speaker shortly but there's
 
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
things that still need to be
 
00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
worked out um one of the reasons we we i
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
don't know what i'll
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
probably like to see the individual
 
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
testifying in front of us
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
we don't know if someone's going to do
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
something off of color inappropriately
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes
 
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
which will be out there for everyone to
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
see and be recorded
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
we hope that won't happen but you never
 
00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.590 align:start position:0%
we hope that won't happen but you never
know

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
we saw they still have to work on how
 
00:11:59.110 --> 00:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to dealing with the cards
 
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
that are being submitted to us the red
 
00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:02.959 align:start position:0%
cards to call on unfolds and how that's
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
going to work
 
00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:07.839 align:start position:0%
um you know one of the questions that
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
was was given to me is um let's say
 
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
um you know someone wants to testify and
 
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
a bill and they happen to be
 
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
in the legislative office building but
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
some people are not
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
um how do they you know come on with
 
00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
zoom if representative cahill
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
is um once he has a bill that's coming
 
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
in front of our committee will he be
 
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
be in the llb and be on this
 
00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
zoom call and be able to submit his
 
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation when others
 
00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
you know possibly could not and so how
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
are all these things going to work out
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry folks i just don't have the
 
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.790 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry folks i just don't have the
answers

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
answers
 
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
um we're going to do our best we can uh
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
i know there's some concern
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
you know everyone wants to keep this
 
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
fair i've had a long conversation with
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
worked on the sullivan on a number of
 
00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.190 align:start position:0%
worked on the sullivan on a number of
issues

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
and how things are going to work and
 
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
the goal is to make sure everybody is
 
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
and we will do our best to make that
 
00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
happen um there is no intent here brian
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
uh stuart and myself with no intent here
 
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.230 align:start position:0%
uh stuart and myself with no intent here
to

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
you know pull only fast ones and not do
 
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
anything that's completely fair that
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
everyone has
 
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
a chance of being uh completely
 
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
um heard and represented one of the
 
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
conversations we had with representative
 
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
sullivan and i had to do with
 
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
um folks online versus in the lob
 
00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
i do plan to be in the llp
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
but that's my choice um and i have no
 
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
problem with anyone who does not want to
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
be there
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
will everyone be treated in the lob
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
testifying or being able to ask a
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
question as a representative
 
00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:50.959 align:start position:0%
of the test of people testifying or the
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
witnesses or whatever
 
00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
will they be given the same as people
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
online the answer is yes
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
no one's going to be singled out because
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
of any of those things but
 
00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:01.839 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to uh trust a
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
little bit of
 
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%

now
 
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
um been on a labor committee for
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
10 10 out of those 15 terms
 
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
a little bit about what's going on um
 
00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
i think we got a couple thursdays
 
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
already planned and it looks like uh
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
those are the days that i have free
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
right now but
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
um it would help me to have the same day
 
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
every week whatever day you pick
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh so i could plan ahead
 
00:15:58.629 --> 00:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to do that okay thank
 
00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
next on my screen representative brian
 
00:16:03.199 --> 00:16:04.949 align:start position:0%
next on my screen representative brian
sullivan

00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:04.959 align:start position:0%
sullivan
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
good morning um ryan sullivan i'm
 
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
live in grantham i'm entering my
 
00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
third term in the um in the house
 
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
i spent most of it on the labor
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
committee i
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
started briefly on the judiciary
 
00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.389 align:start position:0%
started briefly on the judiciary
committee

00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
but was then moved to labor which i
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
think fits my background i spent 25
 
00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
years working with the national
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
education association
 
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
as a labor rep so
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
i would say there's no particular day
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
bad i think traditionally we've had
 
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
mondays and fridays
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
um to attend to things
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
back home so if we can avoid mondays and
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
fridays i think that would
 
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
i mean if i make an appointment i
 
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
usually try to make it on a monday or
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
friday but
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%

00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
how we're going to proceed
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
hey will has has house leadership
 
00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
decided which day
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
of the week is going to be for session
 
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.750 align:start position:0%
of the week is going to be for session
days

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
you know i have not heard anything but
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
as i said earlier i've been cop out of
 
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
commission in the last three days
 
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
um uh representative turcotte um
 
00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:02.799 align:start position:0%
have you found out any information of
 
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
what is the plan of the
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
uh house leadership at this point as of
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
right now there is no specific day for
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
house sessions that has not been
 
00:28:12.789 --> 00:28:12.799 align:start position:0%
determined yet i think they're going to
 
00:28:12.799 --> 00:28:14.310 align:start position:0%
determined yet i think they're going to
be

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:16.559 align:start position:0%
my gut tells me it's not going to be any
 
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
specific day
 
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
of the week it's going to be almost as
 
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
an as needed basis but
 
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we were asked to
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
do um if any
 
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
they've asked all the chairman if
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
there's certain bills that are
 
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
very involved they usually require a
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
considerable amount of conversation
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
possibly some committee work uh
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
to postpone those um until next year
 
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
um because there's just so much we can
 
00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:55.669 align:start position:0%
um because there's just so much we can
do

00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:28:57.909 --> 00:28:57.919 align:start position:0%
just the problems with some of this that
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
we're doing a pretty good job as many as
 
00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
new meetings go
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh but when we have when it's not just
 
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:06.799 align:start position:0%
the committee and we have people
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
testifying we have questions going back
 
00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
and forth
 
00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:12.559 align:start position:0%
um and technical problems things could
 
00:29:12.559 --> 00:29:12.870 align:start position:0%
um and technical problems things could
go

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
relatively slow you know i was going to
 
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
hold one hearing that i knew
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
it's probably going to pass unanimously
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
with not any issues one of our first
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
ones out
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
and i was going to you know say 15 or 20
 
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
minutes but it could take 15 or 20
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
minutes to get going
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
um so that's you know one thing that i
 
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
learned from today that i'm gonna have
 
00:29:29.919 --> 00:29:30.389 align:start position:0%
learned from today that i'm gonna have
to

00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
schedule a little more time um
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
i don't see any of those in our
 
00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:36.559 align:start position:0%
community um
 
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
um but um that we wanna retain retain
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
and i i don't know i talked to
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
representative hunt in commerce and
 
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be able to have
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
their subcommittee so they're trying to
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
break things up a little differently
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan and i talked
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
about some of the same bills
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
the bills being of the same um type of
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
putting those
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
uh all in one day and having those heard
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
together so
 
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
um you know i'm really hoping
 
00:30:11.669 --> 00:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh that this week tomorrow
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
it will be um much more clarity to
 
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
how some of the procedures are going to
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
go because right now
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%

it is my intent to be at the lob yes i
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%

00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%

i have been told but i had not seen i've
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
not gone there to see
 
00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:46.960 align:start position:0%

how

00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
there's gonna be plastic between uh
 
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
where people would sit
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
six to eight ten feet apart uh these uh
 
00:32:00.389 --> 00:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
filtration machines i have not seen them
 
00:32:00.399 --> 00:32:01.430 align:start position:0%
filtration machines i have not seen them
yet

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
um i felt i would go the first day to
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
see how it is
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
to at least have one representative be
 
00:32:08.399 --> 00:32:08.950 align:start position:0%
to at least have one representative be
there

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
i know what at least one other
 
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
individual has told me they would like
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
to be there as well
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
but it's not you know by any means it's
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
not mandatory
 
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
um i was hoping to just
 
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
be able to be there and give you folks a
 
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
feel as to what it's like
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
um in case you were
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
on this indecisive of whether you wanted
 
00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:32.559 align:start position:0%
to join or not
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
representative cahill yes so thank you
 
00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
mr chairman if
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
a lobbyists or citizens want to send the
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
committee documents what's the best
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
uh path to do that would it be just the
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
the committee address or through uh hcs
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i i believe that the
 
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
leadership was talking about
 
00:33:04.149 --> 00:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
using the committee uh
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
email as as the best way to send
 
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
information like that
 
00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
you know my my druthers i'd like some of
 
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
this stuff to go
 
00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:16.640 align:start position:0%
through the chairman so i can make sure
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
uh it can and
 
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
then gets to the clerk so it's in the
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
record uh and then it gets out to
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
everybody whether
 
00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
whether um brian or i or or
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
john can get it out to everybody or it
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
gets to everybody at least if it goes
 
00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:33.519 align:start position:0%
to at least the charity as well as
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
everybody else that would probably be
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
the best way
 
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
for all of us i don't want to put a lot
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
on a lot more on legislative services at
 
00:33:41.909 --> 00:33:41.919 align:start position:0%
this point
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
um you know i haven't even spoken
 
00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:49.669 align:start position:0%
um you know i haven't even spoken
um

00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
to heather yet um which i'll be doing
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
after this meeting to see how

promote people
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
if they're doing a public hearing and
 
00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
someone needs to

claim volume trust fund balance things
 
00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
like that so what i thought we'd start
 
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
off with
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
is the three bureaus that we have our
 
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
employment services bureau
 
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
which is what i'll start with so
 
00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
prior pandemic we used to be able to do
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
job fairs throughout the state
 
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
we had somewhere between 25 and 30 job
 
00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
fairs we'd have
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
some places especially the southern tier
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
we would have a significant number of
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
job seekers that would show up there
 
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
you know some of the facilities we'd
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
have 800 people since that time
 
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
we've sort of had to go back and pivot
 
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
and try to figure out okay how are we
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
how are we going to produce uh job
 
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
opportunities for those seeking jobs and
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
to work
 
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
with employers who are looking for job
 
00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:31.589 align:start position:0%

share my screen just to show
 
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee um what the
 
00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
if you haven't seen some of the new
 
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
micro sites that we've stood up during
 
00:46:36.069 --> 00:46:36.079 align:start position:0%
the pandemic that the commissioner was
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
um you can see um how those sites look
 
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
and feel and how they function so i'll
 
00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
do that and then i'll
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
i'll have i think i'll need to stop my
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
share at that point and then restart it
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
to show you
 
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%

okay everyone should be seeing the nhes
 
00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:11.190 align:start position:0%
okay everyone should be seeing the nhes
website

00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
um this is our this is our old website
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
the the website that existed pre
 
00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
pandemic um and um
 
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
it is uh a it's an older
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
website that has a there it's a
 
00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:25.990 align:start position:0%
website that has a there it's a
difficult

00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
site to navigate on and we immediately
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
encountered problems at the beginning of
 
00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:32.559 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and realized we
 
00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:35.839 align:start position:0%
we needed to change and change quickly
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
how we're going to be communicating with
 
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
the large segment of the public that was
 
00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
utilizing our services
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
what we have done and what we will be
 
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
continuing to do
 
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
is we launched a new microsite for all
 
00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
information related to unemployment here
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
it is you can see
 
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
it's available at
 
00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:58.549 align:start position:0%
it's available at
unemploymentbenefits.nh.gov

00:47:58.549 --> 00:47:58.559 align:start position:0%
unemploymentbenefits.nh.gov
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
and this is where we've been providing
 
00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.390 align:start position:0%
and this is where we've been providing
information

00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
not only for individuals looking to go
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
in file their claim
 
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%
to learn the process for filing a claim
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
but this is where we've been promoting
 
00:48:10.549 --> 00:48:10.559 align:start position:0%
all of our
 
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
information on the jobs portal the
 
00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:13.829 align:start position:0%
information on the jobs portal the
virtual

00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
virtual
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh job fairs as the commissioner was
 
00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
and this is what we've been using for
 
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
all of the quick uh the fast
 
00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
changing information that we had over
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
these last few weeks with the federal
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
extension you know on again off again
 
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%
that was tough to communicate
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
with the public and there are a lot of
 
00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%
people that had questions
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
we were able to use this site um it was
 
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
kind of our
 
00:48:38.309 --> 00:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
it was a george or my personal blog it
 
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
seemed like
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
um for those days as we were trying to
 
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
get the most accurate information
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
up to the public um so this
 
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
the site was launched in the early part
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
and and again this is where we've linked
 
00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:53.349 align:start position:0%
and and again this is where we've linked
the

00:48:53.349 --> 00:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
jobs portal um that you can see here so
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
this is the site that the commissioner
 
00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
was talking about
 
00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
um where an individual is able to go in
 
00:49:02.069 --> 00:49:02.079 align:start position:0%
they can search
 
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
by region so here are our regions that
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
you could search by
 
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
you can search by community so this is
 
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
all of our communities
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
and you can search by occupational type
 
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
so the the um narrower that you have
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
your search
 
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
the fewer results the broader um the um
 
00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
the higher the number of results that
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
you're going to see
 
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
and what an individual sees is that i'll
 
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
just uh grab
 
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
i'll grab exeter um
 
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
for an example um and i'll search
 
00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
there so we have with just using exeter
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
as our
 
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
filter you have 42 jobs that come up
 
00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
here are the employers along with
 
00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
whether or not the positions are full or
 
00:49:48.319 --> 00:49:49.510 align:start position:0%
whether or not the positions are full or
part-time

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
part-time
 
00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
for instance this position with vapor
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
therm they are a medical device
 
00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.309 align:start position:0%
therm they are a medical device
manufacturer

00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
manufacturer
 
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
with respiratory technology over an
 
00:49:59.190 --> 00:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
exeter we've worked with them closely
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
throughout the pandemic helping to fill
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
their growing needs
 
00:50:04.549 --> 00:50:04.559 align:start position:0%
someone coming in and interested in
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
vapor therm they would then click
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
see this description of vapor therm they
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
would then be able to fill out some
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
simple information um confirm that they
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
are are not a bot and then they'd be
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
able to fire that off
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
to the hiring manager at vapor therm and
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
then that individual can then look at
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
the information decide if they want to
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
keep that conversation going
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
so that's what we've made available to
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
as the commissioner said about 400
 
00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:32.559 align:start position:0%
employers originally that started as a
 
00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
service for the
 
00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
long-term care industry because of their
 
00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:37.190 align:start position:0%
long-term care industry because of their
desperate

00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
desperate
 
00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
workforce needs at the beginning of the
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
pandemic and then we quickly grew it
 
00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh to manufacturing and education we
 
00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:45.109 align:start position:0%
uh to manufacturing and education we
have

00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
school districts that are on there
 
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
looking to fill uh positions
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
um with their their needs during the
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
pandemic as well so it's available
 
00:50:54.309 --> 00:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
across industries
 
00:50:56.549 --> 00:50:56.559 align:start position:0%
and across all regions of the state our
 
00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
virtual job fairs the commissioner was
 
00:51:00.069 --> 00:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
if the link would work oh here we go
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
this is our event that we have scheduled
 
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
right now we just completed those four
 
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
healthcare virtual job fairs the
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
commission was talking about
 
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh this event on the 28th as you can see
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
gives it provides a quick description
 
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
both job seekers and employers are able
 
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
to register right on the site
 
00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
and then what what they are then
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
provided is
 
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
as we get closer to the date they get
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
information on the platform that we use
 
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%

remo r-e-m-o i can't go there right now
 
00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:34.470 align:start position:0%
remo r-e-m-o i can't go there right now
because

00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:34.480 align:start position:0%

it will want to use my camera and
 
00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:37.839 align:start position:0%
microphone and
 
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
that will not play nicely with zoom so
 
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
um it's a site that you can check out at
 
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
remo dot co you can do a quick
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
tutorial it's something we were
 
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:50.870 align:start position:0%
tutorial it's something we were
introduced

00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh to by the new hampshire tech alliance
 
00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
and that's what we've used for all of
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
the 11 job fairs that we've conducted so
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
as you can see this is it's a good
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
vehicle for communicating out
 
00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:01.990 align:start position:0%
vehicle for communicating out
information

00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
you know we try to communicate as much
 
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
about uh searching for work and the
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
tools that we have available
 
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
um later on this week we'll be putting
 
00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
up quite a quite a bit of information on
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
1099 forms that will be going out for
 
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
the 165 000 people that received
 
00:52:18.549 --> 00:52:18.559 align:start position:0%
benefits during 2020.
 
00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
so again a great way to communicate with
 
00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:21.990 align:start position:0%
so again a great way to communicate with
them

00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
and hopefully it avoids people having to
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
call into the hotline which which we
 
00:52:29.589 --> 00:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
continue to have available
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
as well so i'll i'll stop that chair
 
00:52:37.349 --> 00:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
and i'll restart that so we can see the
 
00:52:41.829 --> 00:52:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
all right and
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:58.829 --> 00:52:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:58.839 --> 00:53:03.829 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
oops all right
 
00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
so i'll start i'll skip some slides here
 
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
and i'll go down to getting into the
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
nuts and bolts of what we've been
 
00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
experiencing so
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh folks can um start to
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
see what we've been doing and ask some
 
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
questions um and i'll make this
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
available to you mr chairman
 
00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
so you can distribute out to all of the
 
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
members as well um this first slide
 
00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
gives you a a picture of what we were
 
00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:35.990 align:start position:0%
gives you a a picture of what we were
experiencing

00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
experiencing
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh prior to the pandemic and when i say
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
prior i mean immediately prior
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh the for the week ending march 14th so
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
this is the
 
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
the week prior to the increase in claims
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
um employment security had just under 4
 
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
000 weekly claims filed
 
00:53:53.829 --> 00:53:53.839 align:start position:0%
um now you fast forward to the beginning
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
of may at the height of the pandemic we
 
00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
had close to 117
 
00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
000 claims filed during that week this
 
00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:02.559 align:start position:0%
is all programs both federal
 
00:54:06.150 --> 00:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
and state um and we then fast forward
 
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh to the right-hand side of this chart
 
00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
where you see that for week ending
 
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
january 2nd
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
we have now dropped to a little over 45
 
00:54:14.559 --> 00:54:15.030 align:start position:0%
we have now dropped to a little over 45
000

00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
claims we have as you'll see in some
 
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
other slides and you've
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
might have heard and and read
 
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
um from some of the the weekly
 
00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
publications that we put out or our new
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
elmy director and his conversations
 
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
brian gottlob
 
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
um claims have really um they've
 
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh they've stagnated uh in november
 
00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:36.789 align:start position:0%
uh they've stagnated uh in november
december

00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:36.799 align:start position:0%
december
 
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
um and now we're starting to see a
 
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
gradual increase
 
00:54:43.349 --> 00:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
each week of three to five percent is
 
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
what we've
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
what we've been seeing um so
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
it reinforces the importance of
 
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
providing opportunities for people to
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
be able to connect with hiring employers
 
00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
so we've continued to try to highlight
 
00:54:55.359 --> 00:54:56.150 align:start position:0%
so we've continued to try to highlight
that

00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
um but um certainly um it's
 
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh it's different than the trend of what
 
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
we were seeing
 
00:55:07.109 --> 00:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
earlier say in late summer and early
 
00:55:07.119 --> 00:55:07.510 align:start position:0%
earlier say in late summer and early
fall

00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
fall
 
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
when we were steadily declining each
 
00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:11.750 align:start position:0%
when we were steadily declining each
week

00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:55:13.829 --> 00:55:13.839 align:start position:0%
our payments uh that we've that we've
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
paid out so far as the commissioner
 
00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:16.470 align:start position:0%
paid out so far as the commissioner
indicated

00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
indicated
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh just over one and a half billion
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
dollars in benefits paid out
 
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
this slide tells shows you the breakdown
 
00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
of the program
 
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
source for those dollars
 
00:55:31.109 --> 00:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
the of note for those that remember all
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
of our
 
00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
conversations on trust fund solvency
 
00:55:38.069 --> 00:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
the red line represents those dollars
 
00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799 align:start position:0%
that have come
 
00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
out of the new hampshire
 
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation trust fund so

the
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
the largest share
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
of dollars paid out and benefits paid
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
out have come
 
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
from uh the federal pandemic
 
00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation program or
 
00:56:00.069 --> 00:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
f puck that top line at 874 million
 
00:56:00.079 --> 00:56:01.190 align:start position:0%
f puck that top line at 874 million
dollars

00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
those are the six hundred dollar
 
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
payments that were being paid out from
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
april through the end of july um
 
00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh that was created as part of the
 
00:56:12.549 --> 00:56:12.559 align:start position:0%
original cares act
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
uh when those payments stopped uh
 
00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
at the end of july then there was a
 
00:56:20.549 --> 00:56:20.559 align:start position:0%
presidential memorandum
 
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
issued that created a 300
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
a week program that paid for
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
weeks in august and the first two weeks
 
00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
in september
 
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
that was the fourth line down lwa that
 
00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
was the lost
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
wages assistance program that we paid
 
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
out 88 million dollars that was
 
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
federally funded and it was administered
 
00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:43.589 align:start position:0%
federally funded and it was administered
through

00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
fema new hampshire along with every
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
i think every other state in the country
 
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
except one of the dakotas
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
participated in that program
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
um then we we look back up to our second
 
00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:57.670 align:start position:0%
um then we we look back up to our second
line

00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
pua this is federally paid pandemic
 
00:57:02.789 --> 00:57:02.799 align:start position:0%
unemployment assistance
 
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
this is uh the program that pays
 
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
benefits to those individuals that would
 
00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:08.630 align:start position:0%
benefits to those individuals that would
not

00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:57:10.829 --> 00:57:10.839 align:start position:0%
have ordinarily been eligible for
 
00:57:10.839 --> 00:57:11.990 align:start position:0%
have ordinarily been eligible for
unemployment

00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
so those individuals like self-employed
 
00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
gig workers or non-covered non-covered
 
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
employees along with those folks that
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
have a covid related reason
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
that's recognized in the cares act that
 
00:57:31.829 --> 00:57:31.839 align:start position:0%
has required that they remove themselves
 
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
from the labor force they're able to
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
file for and collect benefits through
 
00:57:37.599 --> 00:57:38.230 align:start position:0%
file for and collect benefits through
pua

00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
pua
 
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
and we've paid out 287 million dollars
 
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
in the pua program
 
00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
and that's a that pays benefits
 
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
it started as a 39-week program
 
00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
that was a recently
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
extended for an additional 11 weeks so
 
00:57:55.359 --> 00:57:55.910 align:start position:0%
extended for an additional 11 weeks so
now

00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:57:58.950 --> 00:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
that's a 50 week program and
 
00:58:02.069 --> 00:58:02.079 align:start position:0%
it goes until there's two different
 
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
types of eligibility
 
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
um the first expires on march 13th
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
um and the second expires on april 10th
 
00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
that's where they're currently
 
00:58:14.349 --> 00:58:14.359 align:start position:0%
set to expire on the red line here at
 
00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
278 million these are dollars that have
 
00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:17.190 align:start position:0%
278 million these are dollars that have
come

00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
come
 
00:58:19.589 --> 00:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
out of the new hampshire trust fund paid
 
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
out in regular unemployment
 
00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
a federal requirement
 
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
in order for someone to be paid
 
00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
under any of these programs you first
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
have to determine whether or not they
 
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
are eligible for state unemployment
 
00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:35.589 align:start position:0%
are eligible for state unemployment
benefits

00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
traditional reasons for eligibility for
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
state unemployment are temporary and
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
permanent layoffs
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
so we first look at your reason for
 
00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:45.270 align:start position:0%
so we first look at your reason for
separation

00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
separation
 
00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
we then look at your reasons for why
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
you're continuing to remove yourself
 
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
from the labor force
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
and then that determines whether or not
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
you are required to be paid by the state
 
00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:55.349 align:start position:0%
you are required to be paid by the state
program

00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
or you fall into the pua program
 
00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
state unemployment benefits have
 
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
continued uh
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
to be available for 26 weeks
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
the folks that exhaust their 26 weeks of
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
ui then go into the bottom
 
00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
bottom line here for p euc
 
00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
this is the third started as a 13-week
 
00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:22.789 align:start position:0%
this is the third started as a 13-week
extension

00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
extension
 
00:59:25.109 --> 00:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
for people that exhausted their 26 weeks
 
00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%
of ui
 
00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
to give them 39 weeks of eligibility the
 
00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
same number of weeks that people in pua
 
00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
would have like pua this has been
 
00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
extended with an additional 11 weeks
 
00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
for 50 weeks of eligibility as well
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
peuc stands for pandemic emergency
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
so this is the other cares act created
 
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
program federally paid
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
that provides benefits to ui exhaustees
 
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:55.839 align:start position:0%
for the additional 24 weeks i mean
 
00:59:59.109 --> 00:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
we've paid out 27 million dollars
 
01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
rate of recovery with these next
 
01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
two slides gives you some perspective
 
01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
for how new hampshire has been doing
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
this slide shows you new hampshire with
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
the red line the u.s with the blue line
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
how we have been recovering compared
 
01:00:24.069 --> 01:00:24.079 align:start position:0%
to the country as a whole you'll notice
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
that in the right-hand side
 
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
these two lines are getting much closer
 
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
that was not the case during
 
01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
the summer and fall new hampshire was
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
putting people back to work
 
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
at a much higher rate than the country
 
01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
as a whole and what we've seen as i had
 
01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:42.789 align:start position:0%
as a whole and what we've seen as i had
indicated

01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:42.799 align:start position:0%
indicated
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
throughout november december and now
 
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
into january
 
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
our claim volume is going back up and
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
you can see that the red and blue lines
 
01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
are getting much closer
 
01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
than they had previously been
 
01:00:59.109 --> 01:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
now looking at where we stand
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
compared to all of the other states
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
what we see here we've highlighted all
 
01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
of the new england states new hampshire
 
01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.069 align:start position:0%
of the new england states new hampshire
here's

01:01:08.069 --> 01:01:08.079 align:start position:0%
here's
 
01:01:11.109 --> 01:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
the red line at 5.4 percent
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
that percentage indicates the number of
 
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
people that
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
are currently filing for unemployment
 
01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:18.309 align:start position:0%
are currently filing for unemployment
benefits

01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
in all of the not only the state program
 
01:01:24.309 --> 01:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
but all of the federal programs so pua
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
and peuc that's we take that number for
 
01:01:28.559 --> 01:01:29.109 align:start position:0%
and peuc that's we take that number for
each

01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
each
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
state and then we compare that number
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
against your pre-pandemic labor force we
 
01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:35.349 align:start position:0%
against your pre-pandemic labor force we
use

01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
february of 2020 for that number this
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
allows us to avoid
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
some of the distortion that has been
 
01:01:42.559 --> 01:01:43.190 align:start position:0%
some of the distortion that has been
caused

01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
caused
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
and has been admitted to by the bureau
 
01:01:47.349 --> 01:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
of labor statistics
 
01:01:50.789 --> 01:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
with some of the highly
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
volatile labor force numbers that we
 
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
have been seeing
 
01:01:58.610 --> 01:01:58.620 align:start position:0%
that are attributed to some
 
01:01:58.620 --> 01:01:59.990 align:start position:0%
that are attributed to some
[Music]

01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's really attributed to the way in
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
which labor force
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
questions have previously been asked
 
01:02:08.789 --> 01:02:08.799 align:start position:0%
they are not
 
01:02:12.069 --> 01:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
very well suited for the pandemic simply
 
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
because so many people
 
01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
are currently allowed and considered
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
eligible for unemployment benefits
 
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
that are not actively seeking work um
 
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
and that created some confusion with the
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
way that bls compiled that data at the
 
01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
beginning of the pandemic
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
that continues we we've decided to
 
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
to avoid that confusion we just compare
 
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
the current filers
 
01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:38.799 align:start position:0%
against pre-pandemic labor force numbers
 
01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
we do that for each state and what the
 
01:02:43.029 --> 01:02:43.039 align:start position:0%
take away from the slide is that
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is faring better than any
 
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
other state
 
01:02:49.109 --> 01:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
in the northeast you see where our
 
01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:50.559 align:start position:0%
neighbor to the south
 
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
is located on the far right-hand side of
 
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
this chart where you do not want to be
 
01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire is doing much better
 
01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
than our other northeastern neighbors
 
01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
and certainly our new england neighbors
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
when you look at total number of people
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
filing as a percentage of that
 
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic labor force
 
01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
and now looking at where the our claims
 
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
are located in terms of sector um here
 
01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
you can see
 
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
that um in our top port part of this
 
01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
graph you see hospitals ambulatory care
 
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
and our grocery stores these
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
three sectors are all at 95 percent and
 
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
above in terms of their percentage
 
01:03:38.309 --> 01:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
of pre-pandemic labor force uh that is
 
01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
currently working
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
uh these um uh well for hospitals and
 
01:03:43.599 --> 01:03:44.069 align:start position:0%
uh these um uh well for hospitals and
grocery

01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
grocery
 
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
stores they have consistently been at
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
the top throughout the pandemic
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
that was not the case for ambulatory
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
health these are
 
01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
your uh primary care offices these are
 
01:03:56.829 --> 01:03:56.839 align:start position:0%
your your physical therapists your
 
01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
chiropractors uh your dentists
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
those folks had an initial significant
 
01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:03.270 align:start position:0%
those folks had an initial significant
impact

01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
on when they were closed during the
 
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
beginning part of the pandemic
 
01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
but what we saw when they were when they
 
01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:10.549 align:start position:0%
but what we saw when they were when they
were

01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
able to reopen their workforce really
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
came back
 
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
and that you see now at 96 and a half
 
01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:17.670 align:start position:0%
and that you see now at 96 and a half
percent

01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
you see here in the middle that um
 
01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
before i get to the retail you see our
 
01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
nursing and residential care facilities
 
01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:25.839 align:start position:0%
that's our long-term care
 
01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:29.839 align:start position:0%
employers at close to 95 percent
 
01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
of pre-pandemic employment our retailers
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
are below that um with there in the
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
middle you see our clothing retailers
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
back to about 93 percent
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
of their pre-pandemic employment and
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
down towards the bottom you have our
 
01:04:49.029 --> 01:04:49.039 align:start position:0%
administrative and support services so
 
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
these are a lot of your office
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
type of support occupations that are
 
01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:54.390 align:start position:0%
type of support occupations that are
captured

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
captured
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
in that category significantly impact
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
impacted by the amount of remote work
 
01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
that continues to happen here in new
 
01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire and throughout the country
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
and then you have restaurants and
 
01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:07.510 align:start position:0%
and then you have restaurants and
lodging

01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
lodging
 
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
both have consistently been the most
 
01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:11.829 align:start position:0%
both have consistently been the most
significantly

01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
impacted sector throughout the pandemic
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
because of
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
obviously because of the need to
 
01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:19.430 align:start position:0%
obviously because of the need to
interact

01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
interact
 
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
with people regularly as part of those
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh part of their operation and um with
 
01:05:29.829 --> 01:05:29.839 align:start position:0%
all the the reluctance to um go out to
 
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
those types of establishments
 
01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
they have been the hardest hit so one
 
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
last note on these numbers um what uh
 
01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
for instance with accommodation with our
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
lodging sector
 
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
where you see 86 and a half percent on
 
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
the right hand side of the screen
 
01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
what that tells you is that 86 and a
 
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
half percent of their pre-pandemic labor
 
01:05:53.029 --> 01:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
force is back working it does not
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that 86 and a half
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
percent of their pre-pandemic labor
 
01:05:58.870 --> 01:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
force are working within lodging
 
01:06:01.589 --> 01:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
um they are they are working they are
 
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
not collecting
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh benefits with us but they
 
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
could a percentage of that
 
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
which would be probably a pretty
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
significant percentage
 
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
within hospitality and within retail
 
01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
while they are back working they are
 
01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
likely working in another sector
 
01:06:23.029 --> 01:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
because of um obviously with the demand
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
for services
 
01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
in those or the traditional type of
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
demand for those services
 
01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
has been depressed and has been reduced
 
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
um now i'll move on to talk a little bit
 
01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
the last two slides here talk about the
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
so um what we have seen thus far
 
01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
is we have 18 states that have depleted
 
01:06:48.789 --> 01:06:48.799 align:start position:0%
their trust funds
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
we have not we'll get into that you'll
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
see where we where we are forecasted
 
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
to be headed we have 21 states right now
 
01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:57.190 align:start position:0%
to be headed we have 21 states right now
that

01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
are authorized to borrow and have been
 
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
approved for
 
01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
amounts to borrow from the u.s treasury
 
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
in order to pay out their weekly
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits 18 states are
 
01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
actively doing that
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
um here in new england connecticut and
 
01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:13.839 align:start position:0%
massachusetts are both borrowing
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
and when we compare that against
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
the great recession you you'll remember
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire did borrow during the
 
01:07:25.589 --> 01:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
great recession we borrowed twice
 
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
for a total of 120 million dollars we
 
01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:29.109 align:start position:0%
for a total of 120 million dollars we
were

01:07:29.109 --> 01:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
with about 33 other states uh 32 other
 
01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
states that borrowed
 
01:07:37.029 --> 01:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
during the great recession and
 
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
we're hoping to avoid that as we
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
continue to deal with the pandemic
 
01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
the the bullets that you see here i just
 
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
like to draw
 
01:07:49.589 --> 01:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
a distinction between um employer
 
01:07:49.599 --> 01:07:50.710 align:start position:0%
a distinction between um employer
experience

01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
during the great recession and employer
 
01:07:55.829 --> 01:07:55.839 align:start position:0%
experience thus far during the pandemic
 
01:07:55.839 --> 01:07:56.950 align:start position:0%
experience thus far during the pandemic
so

01:07:56.950 --> 01:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:59.829 --> 01:07:59.839 align:start position:0%
we certainly have seen an increase in
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance tax rates
 
01:08:06.309 --> 01:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
if i were to suggest anything else every
 
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
i know that several of the employers on
 
01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
would want to start throwing things at
 
01:08:13.029 --> 01:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
me because they've seen
 
01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
what their rates have done but
 
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
what i'll be able to explain here is
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
that we've been able to avoid
 
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
more significant increases that were
 
01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
experienced during the great recession
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
that have been able to be avoided thus
 
01:08:27.279 --> 01:08:28.309 align:start position:0%
that have been able to be avoided thus
far

01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
far
 
01:08:31.749 --> 01:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
so the immediate impact of the pandemic
 
01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
and the increase in unemployment was the
 
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
loss of the fund balance reductions
 
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
those are statutorily created those
 
01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
those are part of the solvency controls
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
in our law
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
um that uh reduce an employer's
 
01:08:48.309 --> 01:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
effective tax rate based upon the
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
balance in the fund and i'll work
 
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:50.870 align:start position:0%
balance in the fund and i'll work
backwards

01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
backwards
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
on those so we had started the the
 
01:08:53.279 --> 01:08:53.990 align:start position:0%
on those so we had started the the
pandemic

01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
at 300 million the fund balance
 
01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
reduction when the fund is at or above
 
01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
300 million is that full one and a half
 
01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
percent reduction
 
01:09:05.669 --> 01:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
uh to put that into perspective a new
 
01:09:07.749 --> 01:09:07.759 align:start position:0%
employer starts with a earned rate of
 
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
2.7 percent
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
they pay 2.7 percent on the first
 
01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
14 000 in annual um
 
01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
wages paid to each employee so when
 
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
you're looking at a one and a half
 
01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
percent reduction
 
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
when the fund is above 300 million that
 
01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
is a significant
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
savings to employers with that level of
 
01:09:30.719 --> 01:09:31.749 align:start position:0%
savings to employers with that level of
reduction

01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:31.759 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
what then what the statute then requires
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
is that when the fund falls below
 
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
300 million that reduction goes down to
 
01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:40.789 align:start position:0%
300 million that reduction goes down to
1

01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
1
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
and when the fund falls below 275
 
01:09:45.359 --> 01:09:46.149 align:start position:0%
and when the fund falls below 275
million

01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
that reduction goes to a half percent
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh lastly when that fund balance falls
 
01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:53.550 align:start position:0%
uh lastly when that fund balance falls
below

01:09:53.550 --> 01:09:53.560 align:start position:0%
below
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
250 million then employers
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
are back in neutral at their earned rate
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
um without the benefit of any fund
 
01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:04.070 align:start position:0%
um without the benefit of any fund
balance

01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
balance
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
reductions so that new employer that i
 
01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
had mentioned
 
01:10:10.229 --> 01:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
that new employer would have gone back
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
to their
 
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
earned rate of 2.7
 
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
um with the other on the other side of
 
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
the coin here with the solvency controls
 
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
are the surcharges um so the surcharges
 
01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:23.510 align:start position:0%
are the surcharges um so the surcharges
kick

01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
kick
 
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
in when the solvency of the of the trust
 
01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
fund is determined to be in jeopardy
 
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
um what happened in the um last two
 
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
calendar quarters of 2020
 
01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
was that the first 0.5
 
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
surcharge kicked in with the calendar
 
01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:41.750 align:start position:0%
surcharge kicked in with the calendar
corridor

01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
corridor
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
a third quarter for 2020
 
01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
then that surcharge stayed on for the
 
01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
fourth quarter
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
of 2020 but because
 
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
of the infusion of 50 million dollars
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
of karezak flex funds where governor
 
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
sununu had determined
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
that that was how the state was going to
 
01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:04.709 align:start position:0%
that that was how the state was going to
use

01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
that portion of those remaining funds
 
01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
then deposited into the trust fund and
 
01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
because of that
 
01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
and because of the forecast going
 
01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:17.270 align:start position:0%
and because of the forecast going
forward

01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
and the forecast showing that the fund
 
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
will remain solvent
 
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
what that allowed the department to do
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
and this is the real distinction
 
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
from the experience thus far in the
 
01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
pandemic versus the experience in the
 
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
great recession
 
01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
is that we were able to avoid the second
 
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
point five percent surcharge originally
 
01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
that had been scheduled to go on for the
 
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
fourth quarter
 
01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
we were able to avoid that and then for
 
01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
this first quarter the quarter that we
 
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
are in right now
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
we were able we were able to remove the
 
01:11:48.719 --> 01:11:49.189 align:start position:0%
we were able we were able to remove the
first

01:11:49.189 --> 01:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
surcharge so for this current quarter
 
01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
which tends to be the most expensive
 
01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
quarter for employers
 
01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
that have traditional flat employment
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
over the year
 
01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
obviously not true for some of our
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
seasonal employers
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
there is not a surcharge on this first
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
quarter so employers are at that
 
01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
that they're back at neutral at that
 
01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:11.910 align:start position:0%
that they're back at neutral at that
earned

01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
earned
 
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
rate um and what they'll be paying for
 
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
this first
 
01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
quarter and right now we forecast that
 
01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:18.870 align:start position:0%
quarter and right now we forecast that
that's

01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
where we will be at for the second third
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
and fourth quarters
 
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
of this year all in all with the
 
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
infusion of the 50 million dollars we
 
01:12:31.669 --> 01:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
then look at the savings that employers
 
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
were able to realize as a result of not
 
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
implementing the second surcharge and
 
01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
then removing those surcharges
 
01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
for 2021 that's a savings of about 65
 
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars for employers and then
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
our final bullet here
 
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
another significant area that
 
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
distinguishes the pandemic compared
 
01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
against the great recession
 
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
is that one of the pieces
 
01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
of the original emergency order that
 
01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
governor sununu
 
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
had implemented back in march the
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
the the pieces of that emergency order
 
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
that get the most discussion
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
are the expansion of eligibility um but
 
01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:11.990 align:start position:0%
are the expansion of eligibility um but
a

01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
um equally important uh piece of that
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
was that the benefits that we are being
 
01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:18.709 align:start position:0%
was that the benefits that we are being
paid

01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
paid
 
01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
that are being paid out right now are
 
01:13:23.189 --> 01:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
not being charged against an
 
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
employer's experience rating so those
 
01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
benefits are going as a direct
 
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
charge to the fund so that is another
 
01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:30.950 align:start position:0%
charge to the fund so that is another
way

01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
that we are controlling tax rates for
 
01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
employers going forward
 
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
likewise our reimbursers are our
 
01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:40.790 align:start position:0%
likewise our reimbursers are our
non-profits

01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
non-profits
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
hospitals and other non-profits that
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
would normally reimburse the fund for
 
01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
every dollar of benefits paid out to
 
01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
their former employees
 
01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
they have not been charged either but
 
01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
what is going to be done in order to
 
01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:55.910 align:start position:0%
what is going to be done in order to
avoid

01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
avoid
 
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
that impact on the trust fund because
 
01:13:59.590 --> 01:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
reimbursers don't contribute to the
 
01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:00.070 align:start position:0%
reimbursers don't contribute to the
growth

01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
growth
 
01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
of the trust fund like our for-profit
 
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
employers do
 
01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
the governor will be depositing an
 
01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:06.630 align:start position:0%
the governor will be depositing an
amount

01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
from the cares act flex funds into the
 
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
to offset the impact of having
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
allowed those non-profits not to have to
 
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
reimburse the fund
 
01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
as well so collectively those have had a
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
significant impact on
 
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
the experience of employers but
 
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
at the same time the tax rates for
 
01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:28.070 align:start position:0%
at the same time the tax rates for
employers

01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
employers
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
have gone up significantly compared to
 
01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
what was the experience or what had be
 
01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:34.310 align:start position:0%
what was the experience or what had be
come

01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
come
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
regarded as the norm of the one and a
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
half percent
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
full fund balance reduction prior to the
 
01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:41.669 align:start position:0%
full fund balance reduction prior to the
pandemic

01:14:41.669 --> 01:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
and lastly our trust fund forecast
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
you'll see here we are right now or just
 
01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
under 124 million is what is
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
in the new hampshire unemployment
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
compensation trust fund account
 
01:14:59.830 --> 01:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
um this is what we are projected out for
 
01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:01.189 align:start position:0%
um this is what we are projected out for
2021

01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
2021
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
um ending the year at about 98 million
 
01:15:04.719 --> 01:15:06.070 align:start position:0%
um ending the year at about 98 million
dollars

01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of assumptions um
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
that go into this forecast and
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
there are both good and bad impacts
 
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
on the trust fund forecast
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
that can be associated with the
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
extension that we just experienced with
 
01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:24.709 align:start position:0%
extension that we just experienced with
the

01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
the federal cares act programs and any
 
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
any subsequent extension that we might
 
01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:29.910 align:start position:0%
any subsequent extension that we might
see

01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
um the the good um for our positive
 
01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
impact that that has on the the trust
 
01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:36.950 align:start position:0%
impact that that has on the the trust
fund

01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
is that the individuals that we have
 
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
collecting unemployment benefits right
 
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
now through a federal program
 
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
there's there's a likelihood that a lot
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
of those individuals
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
would also have eligibility or could
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
have eligibility
 
01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
in state in the state unemployment
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
program depending on the circumstances
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
of their separation
 
01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
so if those programs hadn't been
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
extended there would have been a pr
 
01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
there would have been a large group of
 
01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
those individuals that would have
 
01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
transitioned on to the state
 
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
unemployment program thus drawing down
 
01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
the balance of our fund
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
so that has a significant positive
 
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
impact on when
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
when we revised our forecast following
 
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
the enactment of the continuing
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
assistance act
 
01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
the negative impact that that has
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
and this will is yet to be
 
01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
determined the the the total impact
 
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
is that the additional 300 that is
 
01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
provided through
 
01:16:34.709 --> 01:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
that extension that 300 now goes
 
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
through the middle part of march um
 
01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
what we saw um and and some um
 
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
there was quite a bit of research done
 
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
on this when the 600
 
01:16:48.630 --> 01:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
um was in effect there are
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
that obviously has impacts on your claim
 
01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
filing totals
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
when you increase the amount of benefits
 
01:16:58.149 --> 01:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
that every individual is able to get
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
um so that we'll be
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
looking at to see the impact that that
 
01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
has on the total number of people
 
01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
filing for benefits now with that
 
01:17:08.630 --> 01:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
reduced amount of 300
 
01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
so both positive and negative impacts
 
01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
from a trust fund solvency perspective
 
01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
for all of the programs that were
 
01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
extended um so with that being said i'll
 
01:17:18.630 --> 01:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
stop the share
 
01:17:21.669 --> 01:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
and i'll uh i'll stop talking
 
01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
and open it up to questions that
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner and i will hopefully be
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
good to see you again um excellent
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
presentation i love the the data and the
 
01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:40.950 align:start position:0%
presentation i love the the data and the
slides

01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
slides
 
01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
i think you said you're going to make
 
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
that available to us
 
01:17:46.709 --> 01:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll uh i'll send it to uh chairman
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
infantine and uh make sure
 
01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
it gets distributed out to everybody
 
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner library do you anticipate
 
01:17:58.630 --> 01:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
coming forth
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
to our community with any legislation
 
01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
having to
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
in security such as years ago when we
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
had to
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
you know refigure the amount of um
 
01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
payroll that taxes are going to be taken
 
01:18:22.229 --> 01:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
on or
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
is that too early to determine what if
 
01:18:25.199 --> 01:18:25.510 align:start position:0%
is that too early to determine what if
any

01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:18:28.950 --> 01:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
changes we may need um
 
01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
i think yeah i think it's a it's a great
 
01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:32.390 align:start position:0%
i think yeah i think it's a it's a great
question

01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
i i think there are there's certainly um
 
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
now is as good a time as any to have
 
01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
conversation around trust fund solvency
 
01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:43.110 align:start position:0%
conversation around trust fund solvency
um

01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:45.669 --> 01:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
you know new hampshire is not unique in
 
01:18:45.679 --> 01:18:46.950 align:start position:0%
you know new hampshire is not unique in
that

01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
the system is funded in a way that we
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
ask uh the most of employers
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
at the time that they can at least
 
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
afford it and we ask the least
 
01:18:57.669 --> 01:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
during times when they can most afford
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
it and that and that's how the solvency
 
01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
controls have been set up
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
i do think that it's worth having a
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
discussion about that be
 
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure there's going to be you'll
 
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
be hearing from your constituents with
 
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
with businesses that are looking at
 
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
their tax rates going up and wondering
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
how can that be
 
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
during a pandemic you know i you know
 
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
talked about the details of how we're
 
01:19:24.149 --> 01:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
controlling that
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
and how we've controlled it better i
 
01:19:28.149 --> 01:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
think now than then happened during the
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
great recession
 
01:19:30.630 --> 01:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
but there's there's certainly some
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
discussion to be had around solvency
 
01:19:35.590 --> 01:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
and looking at you know whether or not
 
01:19:36.790 --> 01:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
we are currently setting
 
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
those fund balance reductions at the
 
01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
right thresholds
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh do those need to be higher um and
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know when when we started the
 
01:19:46.630 --> 01:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
recession started the
 
01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
the pandemic recession we were
 
01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
had been determined to have a solvent
 
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
trust fund that was an independent
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
analysis by the u.s department of labor
 
01:19:59.510 --> 01:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
that happened in february of 2020
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
but they're judging solvency based on
 
01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:04.719 align:start position:0%
looking at your experience over the last
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
20 years and what type of recessions
 
01:20:08.149 --> 01:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
you've experienced they were not
 
01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
um anticipating a an impact like the
 
01:20:10.719 --> 01:20:11.750 align:start position:0%
um anticipating a an impact like the
pandemic

01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:20:13.669 --> 01:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
so i do think it's worthwhile to look at
 
01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
those solvency controls
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
um the other topic that um may come up
 
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
we're still trying to get some
 
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
definitive answers from the us
 
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
department of labor
 
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
is around fraud prevention
 
01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
the current section of our statute
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
around confidentiality
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
contains restrictions on our ability
 
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
very well-intentioned and necessary
 
01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
restrictions that limit the department's
 
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
ability on
 
01:20:44.950 --> 01:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
sharing of confidential information that
 
01:20:46.629 --> 01:20:46.639 align:start position:0%
obviously creates confidence in the
 
01:20:48.629 --> 01:20:48.639 align:start position:0%
system when people know that that their
 
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
claim information or an employer's
 
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
tax filing information is going to be
 
01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
held confidential
 
01:20:58.229 --> 01:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
um one area that we are looking at
 
01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
some expansion there would be with a
 
01:21:02.629 --> 01:21:02.639 align:start position:0%
system that's been created by the u.s
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
department of labor
 
01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:06.639 align:start position:0%
that allows states to collaborate in
 
01:21:06.639 --> 01:21:07.590 align:start position:0%
that allows states to collaborate in
preventing

01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
preventing
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
id theft related fraud in order to
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
participate in that system you do need
 
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
to share your claim filing information
 
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
we are currently looking at whether or
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
not the
 
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
provisions in our statute allow
 
01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:23.590 align:start position:0%
provisions in our statute allow
participation

01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
participation
 
01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
right now or whether or not we're going
 
01:21:29.590 --> 01:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
to need an amendment of that so
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
as we learn more that might be a topic
 
01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
that we would
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
look to possibly seek to have amended
 
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
into a
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
bill dealing with benefits in another
 
01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:40.950 align:start position:0%
bill dealing with benefits in another
way

01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
but it's something we're trying to get
 
01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:46.639 align:start position:0%
answers on and if we do need to make a
 
01:21:46.639 --> 01:21:47.830 align:start position:0%
answers on and if we do need to make a
change

01:21:47.830 --> 01:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:21:50.229 --> 01:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
we certainly will will have that
 
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
discussion with the committee
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
so you can look at what the options will
 
01:21:58.790 --> 01:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much i'm sure if we
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
do any other questions we will get them
 
01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
to you
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
and do our best to work as closely as we
 
01:22:12.629 --> 01:22:12.639 align:start position:0%
can with you through the first half of
 
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:17.189 --> 01:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
all right and uh thanks again for the

um thank you so it is good to see so
 
01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
many familiar faces um i've enjoyed
 
01:23:44.629 --> 01:23:44.639 align:start position:0%
coming to the committee in the past and
 
01:23:44.639 --> 01:23:44.950 align:start position:0%
coming to the committee in the past and
as

01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
chairman infantine said uh my plans are
 
01:23:48.149 --> 01:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
to be there
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
frequently this session um having seen
 
01:23:52.709 --> 01:23:52.719 align:start position:0%
so many familiar faces i'll keep the
 
01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
overview of the department fairly brief
 
01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
because i imagine most of you are very
 
01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:57.430 align:start position:0%
because i imagine most of you are very
familiar

01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
familiar
 
01:23:59.350 --> 01:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh with what we do but i think it's it's
 
01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
always good to come with a grounding or
 
01:24:02.790 --> 01:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
just an overall sense of the
 
01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
organization essentially the department
 
01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
of labor in new hampshire is made up of
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
two divisions the first being the
 
01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
workers compensation division
 
01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
and that actually is the bulk of our
 
01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
staff i mean the workers compensation
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
division is responsible for
 
01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
regulation and administration of workers
 
01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
comp in this state
 
01:24:22.229 --> 01:24:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh there's a whole host of activities
 
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
that go into that principally those that
 
01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
you'd be most familiar with
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
involve the fact that we work to ensure
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
that workplace injuries are properly
 
01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:30.550 align:start position:0%
that workplace injuries are properly
reported

01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
reported
 
01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
then we work that to see that those
 
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
injury injuries are either properly
 
01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:35.189 align:start position:0%
injury injuries are either properly
accepted

01:24:35.189 --> 01:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
accepted
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
or denied as claims if they rise to the
 
01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
level of a claim
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
and to the extent that there's a dispute
 
01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
between the employee and the carrier or
 
01:24:45.189 --> 01:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
the employee and their employer
 
01:24:47.189 --> 01:24:47.199 align:start position:0%
about any claim we would ultimately
 
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
provide the platform for the parties to
 
01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
adjudicate that matter inclusive of
 
01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
formal hearings
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
and we do about 2000 of those hearings a
 
01:24:54.719 --> 01:24:55.669 align:start position:0%
and we do about 2000 of those hearings a
year

01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:24:57.750 --> 01:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
in addition to administering or
 
01:24:59.830 --> 01:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
adjudicating claims
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
and for purposes of workers comp we work
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
very diligently to work
 
01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
to see that employers have workers
 
01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
compensation coverage in this state
 
01:25:10.149 --> 01:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
it's a requirement that everybody having
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
even one part-time employee
 
01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
in this state secure workers
 
01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
compensation coverage either through an
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
or through self-insurance in addition to
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
our and workers comp division we have
 
01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
what we
 
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
the inspection division the inspection
 
01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:26.709 align:start position:0%
the inspection division the inspection
division

01:25:26.709 --> 01:25:26.719 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
deals with wage and hour issues in terms
 
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
of what we deal with in wage and hour
 
01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:34.719 align:start position:0%
275 which is protective legislation
 
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
things such as saying that you have to
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
be paid on time and in full
 
01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
protective legislation also deals with
 
01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
such concept as notification or
 
01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:44.870 align:start position:0%
such concept as notification or
documentation

01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
those things underpinning a workplace in
 
01:25:49.350 --> 01:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
which employees are and employers are
 
01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:50.310 align:start position:0%
which employees are and employers are
protected

01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
protected
 
01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:52.719 align:start position:0%
in addition to protective legislation
 
01:25:52.719 --> 01:25:53.750 align:start position:0%
in addition to protective legislation
workers

01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
workers
 
01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
inspection division enforces minimum
 
01:25:56.950 --> 01:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
wage law rsa
 
01:25:59.910 --> 01:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
279 notably and i have seen there are
 
01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
many bills dealing with minimum wage or
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
a couple of bills dealing with minimum
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
wage this session already
 
01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire doesn't have a minimum
 
01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
wage per se
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
effectively what we do in new hampshire
 
01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
per 279 is we track to the federal
 
01:26:16.149 --> 01:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
minimum wage so again one thing to
 
01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
consider as we see those bills dealing
 
01:26:20.830 --> 01:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
or detailing new minimum wage
 
01:26:23.669 --> 01:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
um ideas is that
 
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
presently we track to the federal
 
01:26:27.990 --> 01:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
standard in addition to
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
protective legislation and minimum wage
 
01:26:32.550 --> 01:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
we also deal with youth labor
 
01:26:35.910 --> 01:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
under rsa 276a essentially in new
 
01:26:37.590 --> 01:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire there are certain provisions
 
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
put in place to protect youth labor
 
01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh the intent of those is to say that
 
01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
you know during certain periods
 
01:26:45.270 --> 01:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
specifically when youth
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
anyone under 18 is in school they should
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
only be working so many hours in a given
 
01:26:50.159 --> 01:26:51.350 align:start position:0%
only be working so many hours in a given
week

01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature additionally
 
01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
the inspection division
 
01:26:58.870 --> 01:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
provides safety enforcement
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
we do not handle safety for private
 
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
employers other than in limited
 
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances which i'll touch upon
 
01:27:07.510 --> 01:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
our primary safety interest or our
 
01:27:09.669 --> 01:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
safety focus is dealing on workplace
 
01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
safety for public and municipal
 
01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:12.629 align:start position:0%
safety for public and municipal
employers

01:27:12.629 --> 01:27:12.639 align:start position:0%
employers
 
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
for private employers our safety is
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
really centered on the idea that any
 
01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:18.390 align:start position:0%
really centered on the idea that any
employer

01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
employer
 
01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
of 15 or more individuals should be
 
01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
doing certain things such as having a
 
01:27:23.910 --> 01:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
joint loss management committee in
 
01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:24.550 align:start position:0%
joint loss management committee in
effect

01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
effect
 
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
and also having a safety summary plan
 
01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:27.990 align:start position:0%
and also having a safety summary plan
lastly

01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
lastly
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of the activities of the
 
01:27:32.229 --> 01:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
inspection division is we regulate
 
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
and enforce boiler and elevator
 
01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:35.270 align:start position:0%
and enforce boiler and elevator
protections

01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
protections
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh those are within rsa 157a and 157b
 
01:27:42.629 --> 01:27:42.639 align:start position:0%
in terms of talking about i i think that
 
01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
employment security did a wonderful job
 
01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
in touching upon what they've
 
01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
experienced through kovid
 
01:27:50.149 --> 01:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
not having anything to do with
 
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
unemployment we've not had the
 
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
experiences that they've had
 
01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
but we have had certain things come up
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
in coveter specific to covid
 
01:28:00.229 --> 01:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
namely if you're going by division in
 
01:28:01.669 --> 01:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
workers compensation
 
01:28:03.510 --> 01:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
early on a number of questions were
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
coming to us dealing with this
 
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
idea of is covid compensable under
 
01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
workers comp
 
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
the answer is it is um and then in terms
 
01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
of well is it just an
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
automatic the answer there is it's not
 
01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
so specifically
 
01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
individuals who are able to say that
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
they contracted covit and had
 
01:28:22.629 --> 01:28:22.639 align:start position:0%
certain either indemnity costs or
 
01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
medical costs
 
01:28:26.950 --> 01:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
associated with covid could be brought
 
01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
as a claim but they would ultimately
 
01:28:29.910 --> 01:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
have to demonstrate
 
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
that the covid came out of their course
 
01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
of the employment which is not always an
 
01:28:36.709 --> 01:28:36.719 align:start position:0%
easy thing to show by its very nature a
 
01:28:38.629 --> 01:28:38.639 align:start position:0%
pandemic is tough to pin down
 
01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
exactly where and when it happened so
 
01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's something
 
01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
to keep in mind in terms of covet claims
 
01:28:46.709 --> 01:28:46.719 align:start position:0%
the last time i checked which was about
 
01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
a week ago
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
we have received roughly 2 000 first
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
reports of injuries
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
denoting covid as the injury i would
 
01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
point out that a first report of injury
 
01:28:59.590 --> 01:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily an acknowledgement or
 
01:29:01.030 --> 01:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
acceptance of a claim
 
01:29:02.709 --> 01:29:02.719 align:start position:0%
and it's also not an acknowledgement and
 
01:29:04.390 --> 01:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
acceptance by the employer
 
01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
that the injury definitively happened at
 
01:29:07.669 --> 01:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
work but
 
01:29:09.990 --> 01:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
it is an indication that covet happened
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
and it possibly happened at work
 
01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
so i just point out that we've seen
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
roughly 2 000
 
01:29:18.070 --> 01:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
filings indicating first report of
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
injury as covid
 
01:29:22.709 --> 01:29:22.719 align:start position:0%
in terms of actual disputed claims we've
 
01:29:22.719 --> 01:29:23.110 align:start position:0%
in terms of actual disputed claims we've
had

01:29:23.110 --> 01:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
under 10 hearings go forward dealing
 
01:29:29.350 --> 01:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
with covid as the injury at issue
 
01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
so that's a fairly low amount i was
 
01:29:33.669 --> 01:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
actually somewhat surprised when i saw
 
01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
that but again i think that part of what
 
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
the issue is is understanding the
 
01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
the horrible things that are associated
 
01:29:40.390 --> 01:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
with kovid
 
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
absent those really horrible outcomes if
 
01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
you're talking about
 
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
covid type scenarios you're really in a
 
01:29:48.310 --> 01:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
context of workers comp would be saying
 
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
was their lost time
 
01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
were there medical bills so that's
 
01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps why we have not seen
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
a number of claims uh that have gone to
 
01:29:58.070 --> 01:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
the actual point of
 
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh full hearing as we haven't seen
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
people looking to assert that they have
 
01:30:03.110 --> 01:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
a long-term
 
01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh loss of work potential due to covid
 
01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
at least we have not seen it yet in
 
01:30:10.629 --> 01:30:10.639 align:start position:0%
terms of uh
 
01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
inspection division and covet or in
 
01:30:15.110 --> 01:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
issues that have come up in the context
 
01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
of kovid
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
a couple of big things one as you might
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
imagine is this idea that in covet a lot
 
01:30:22.149 --> 01:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
of people a lot of employers have had to
 
01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
change things
 
01:30:25.590 --> 01:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
quickly we've seen employers that have
 
01:30:27.830 --> 01:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
reduced individuals pay
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
we've seen employers that have reduced
 
01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
certain benefits or done different
 
01:30:34.229 --> 01:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
things in order to stay afloat
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
so we've had a number of issues come up
 
01:30:37.510 --> 01:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
where certain things happened
 
01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:38.550 align:start position:0%
where certain things happened
unilaterally

01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
unilaterally
 
01:30:40.709 --> 01:30:40.719 align:start position:0%
and without notice and while we're
 
01:30:42.709 --> 01:30:42.719 align:start position:0%
sympathetic and can understand that in
 
01:30:44.229 --> 01:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
the fast-paced world and in these
 
01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
unforeseen circumstances an employer
 
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
might not always have the wherewithal to
 
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:48.709 align:start position:0%
might not always have the wherewithal to
say

01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
okay i've documented that i've given in
 
01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:52.149 align:start position:0%
okay i've documented that i've given in
advance

01:30:52.149 --> 01:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
advance
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
the law does require that if you're
 
01:30:56.229 --> 01:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
changing pay if you're changing benefits
 
01:30:57.110 --> 01:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
if you're changing
 
01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
certain essential terms of employment
 
01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
you would have to give advance notice to
 
01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:02.629 align:start position:0%
you would have to give advance notice to
employees

01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:04.719 align:start position:0%
and when that's not happened there have
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
been issues that have come to us
 
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
i would note that throughout the
 
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic we
 
01:31:12.310 --> 01:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
tried to look at things and understand
 
01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
that us going into businesses
 
01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:16.719 align:start position:0%
might not be the best thing for some
 
01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:18.719 align:start position:0%
employers it might not also be the best
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
thing for certain of our employees from
 
01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
a safety perspective
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
but throughout we have maintained an
 
01:31:25.110 --> 01:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
inspection stance
 
01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
early on in covet a number of our
 
01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
inspectors actually
 
01:31:30.149 --> 01:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
were providing services to employment
 
01:31:33.430 --> 01:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
security for purposes of fraud detection
 
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
but throughout we have maintained
 
01:31:36.629 --> 01:31:36.639 align:start position:0%
inspection activities and we're
 
01:31:38.070 --> 01:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
continuing to do that
 
01:31:40.149 --> 01:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
we're continuing to go into businesses
 
01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
again being sensitive to spacing
 
01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
and not trying to further disrupt
 
01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
businesses but just understanding that
 
01:31:48.149 --> 01:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
while folks are working
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
they should be entitled to those
 
01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
protections um
 
01:31:53.189 --> 01:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
additionally in terms of issues
 
01:31:55.110 --> 01:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
reloading relating to
 
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
notifications or changing terms of
 
01:31:59.350 --> 01:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
employment one issue that's come up and
 
01:32:00.709 --> 01:32:00.719 align:start position:0%
we've spoken with the folks in
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
hospitality quite frequently on this
 
01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
is tips as you folks who've been on this
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
committee for some time might know
 
01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
tips are always a hot button issue
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
because the employees that receive tips
 
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
those are their wages
 
01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
and there's a whole host of concerns and
 
01:32:17.510 --> 01:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
considerations that go into that
 
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
we've not yet seen any legislation on
 
01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
this but one thing we have talked about
 
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
and again we've talked about this with
 
01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
folks in the hospitality industry
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
is that the existing laws and
 
01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
regulations on tips do not necessarily
 
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
work very well with these new models
 
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
that have come out in terms of
 
01:32:38.550 --> 01:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
all online ordering you know everyone
 
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
doing things
 
01:32:41.830 --> 01:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
through through an app and limited
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
people in the building it's been
 
01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
led to some issues where you know the
 
01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
question is who does the tip belong to
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
is the employer able to take all of
 
01:32:52.229 --> 01:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
those tips
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
is the employer able to take all of
 
01:32:56.709 --> 01:32:56.719 align:start position:0%
those tips and distribute them freely
 
01:32:59.430 --> 01:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
or are there certain employees in the
 
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
exercise that could directly claim that
 
01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
the tip is there so that's something
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
that's come up again we've not seen
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
legislation on it to date
 
01:33:09.669 --> 01:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
and i'll be quite honest i don't have
 
01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
the answer
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
to you know exactly how you would write
 
01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
a law that would perfectly fit present
 
01:33:17.430 --> 01:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
circumstance but i just pointed out
 
01:33:20.790 --> 01:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
as an issue that has come up relative to
 
01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:21.669 align:start position:0%
as an issue that has come up relative to
covid

01:33:21.669 --> 01:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
covid
 
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
and wage an hour um that's what i have
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
in terms of an
 
01:33:28.229 --> 01:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
overarching very general presentation of
 
01:33:29.669 --> 01:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
what we do
 
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
in some of the things we've encountered
 
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
in covid again
 
01:33:34.629 --> 01:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
i do understand that most of you have
 
01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
dealt with us before so
 
01:33:37.910 --> 01:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
i'm going on the assumption that a lot
 
01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
of you do have a pretty good
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
understanding of what we do and what
 
01:33:42.629 --> 01:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
we're involved in
 
01:33:48.149 --> 01:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
um commissioner ogden one of the
 
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
concerns that i have
 
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
going forward is
 
01:33:58.229 --> 01:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
related to getting the vaccine and
 
01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
work um you know employers putting it
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
across from
 
01:34:06.390 --> 01:34:06.400 align:start position:0%
some some things um because maybe
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
they're more uh
 
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
concerned with the the code than others
 
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
you can't come into the office you can't
 
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
come in unless you have a vaccine you
 
01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
can't do this you can't do these things
 
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh are you going to be having some
 
01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
training of sessions for employers
 
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
um so people don't violate the law
 
01:34:27.270 --> 01:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
here regarding um you know whether
 
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
you're the vaccine to come into my store
 
01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
or be working in my business
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
et cetera yeah one of the things we've
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
been working on it's an interesting
 
01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
point and thank you for the question
 
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh chairman infantine um a lot of those
 
01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:42.070 align:start position:0%
uh chairman infantine um a lot of those
uh

01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:44.709 --> 01:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
it's actually eeoc protections dealing
 
01:34:44.719 --> 01:34:45.430 align:start position:0%
it's actually eeoc protections dealing
with

01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
in a general sense in new hampshire an
 
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
employer has the right to
 
01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
to put in place those types of
 
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
conditions and by those types of
 
01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
conditions an employer could say
 
01:34:56.709 --> 01:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
you have to do this you have to do that
 
01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
where you'd want to have some concerns
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
is if you are in any way
 
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
tripping across somebody's uh protected
 
01:35:04.229 --> 01:35:04.239 align:start position:0%
rights in the sense of are you
 
01:35:06.149 --> 01:35:06.159 align:start position:0%
discriminating against them for either a
 
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
health reason
 
01:35:08.709 --> 01:35:08.719 align:start position:0%
or are you discriminating against them
 
01:35:11.109 --> 01:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
for some other reason i've seen certain
 
01:35:12.550 --> 01:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
literature out there that's
 
01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
heightened to the fact that some
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
religions might have
 
01:35:18.310 --> 01:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
aversions to vaccines which would lead
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
to a protected right but a big one would
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
be health or things of that nature
 
01:35:24.629 --> 01:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
what we are looking to do is put
 
01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
together some guidance for that that we
 
01:35:28.149 --> 01:35:28.159 align:start position:0%
could offer out i would say that
 
01:35:28.159 --> 01:35:29.109 align:start position:0%
could offer out i would say that
employers

01:35:29.109 --> 01:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
employers
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
that have asked us that question to date
 
01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
we've put them in contact
 
01:35:34.629 --> 01:35:34.639 align:start position:0%
with folks at eeoc and we've actually in
 
01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
a general sense said that in
 
01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
a from a basic standpoint an employer
 
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
would have the ability
 
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
to place those types of conditions
 
01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
relative to an individual working for
 
01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:45.189 align:start position:0%
relative to an individual working for
them

01:35:45.189 --> 01:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
but you'd have to just again look at am
 
01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
i in any way infringing upon someone's
 
01:35:52.950 --> 01:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
protected status whether it be their
 
01:35:55.030 --> 01:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
particular health conditions or
 
01:35:59.189 --> 01:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:01.669 --> 01:36:01.679 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for
 
01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
commercial representative
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:10.149 --> 01:36:10.159 align:start position:0%
representative feel free
 
01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you uh rudy
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
it's good to see you again
 
01:36:16.950 --> 01:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
um there was a question from one of my
 
01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
fellow business partners was um the mass
 
01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
mandate working in an open kitchen and
 
01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
has open flames
 
01:36:27.109 --> 01:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
would workmen's comp cover a facial burn
 
01:36:30.310 --> 01:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
related to that and
 
01:36:31.990 --> 01:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
i asked that question of my workman's
 
01:36:33.510 --> 01:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
comp people
 
01:36:36.070 --> 01:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
and they didn't have any information on
 
01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
that so i was just wondering if
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
people would be covered if they're under
 
01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:40.790 align:start position:0%
people would be covered if they're under
the

01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:36:44.070 --> 01:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
extended mass mandate if they're working
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
in an open kitchen with open flame if
 
01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
it happens to catch fire would work
 
01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
cover that in that instance being a
 
01:36:54.229 --> 01:36:54.239 align:start position:0%
mandate from the government
 
01:36:56.709 --> 01:36:56.719 align:start position:0%
um i would think so certainly and i know
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
this answer is not always the best it's
 
01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
certainly it depends you you'd always
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
look each type of claim comes up and is
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
is looked at individually and on the
 
01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
facts i would say that i could see a
 
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
claim like that succeeding
 
01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
when you talk about workers comp claims
 
01:37:12.550 --> 01:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh you always have to look at such
 
01:37:15.030 --> 01:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
things as this concept of neutral risk
 
01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
you know was the risk enhanced
 
01:37:19.270 --> 01:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh by the fact that the individual was
 
01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
at work or
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
engaged in their employment in the
 
01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
scenario and this is a gross
 
01:37:25.270 --> 01:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
oversimplification but in the scenario
 
01:37:27.030 --> 01:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
you've provided certainly everyone's
 
01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
being told they have to wear
 
01:37:31.270 --> 01:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
masks but not everyone is working with
 
01:37:34.470 --> 01:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
ovens or open flamed oven so again while
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not the
 
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not deciding that case right now i
 
01:37:39.590 --> 01:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
would see that there there is a possible
 
01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
claim there on the basis of again the
 
01:37:42.870 --> 01:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
fact yes everyone should be wearing
 
01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:43.510 align:start position:0%
fact yes everyone should be wearing
masks

01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
masks
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
or is being told they have to wear masks
 
01:37:47.189 --> 01:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh but not everyone
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
uh who's being told that has a job that
 
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
makes them work in front of oven so in a
 
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
i think that that claim could go forward
 
01:37:57.189 --> 01:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:59.430 --> 01:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you rudy
 
01:38:02.950 --> 01:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
