list HP 380 and I recognize
 
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
Representative Rhodess to make a motion
 
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman um I move ITL
 
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
second seconded by Representative Pru
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh sure um I I do apologize that is the
 
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
one bill that I do not have in front of
 
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
me but if I'm remembering correctly that
 
00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.470 align:start position:0%
me but if I'm remembering correctly that
bill

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:40.360 align:start position:0%
is taking away the penalty if you are
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
caught selling your medical cannabis
 
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
and the reason that that that penalty
 
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
was put at that level was
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
because the other body was not really in
 
00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
favor of of of the therapeutic cannabis
 
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
program and they set that penalty at
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
that level for a reason so um I know the
 
00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard is that nobody's
 
00:10:09.389 --> 00:10:09.399 align:start position:0%
doing that so the whole thing is
 
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
ridiculous at the end of the day if
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
nobody's doing it then I guess we don't
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
have anything to worry about if nobody's
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
being charged with it anyway it's just
 
00:10:17.829 --> 00:10:17.839 align:start position:0%
going to stay there and it's going to be
 
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
left alone
 
00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:21.519 align:start position:0%
representative Pru would you like to
 
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
speak to your second
 
00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
no thank you it's open for discussion um
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
Representative Newell
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh I do have an
 
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
amendment uh for this bill i just handed
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
it out um I'm not sure exactly how that
 
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
works if I can introduce it um we we um
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
we're in discussion so we can you can
 
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
discuss the amendment um and sure tell
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
us why it would be a good idea to adopt
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
it okay so um the the bill itself uh I
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
think that's a pretty accurate
 
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
description of what the bill does um
 
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
although you know as as uh my colleague
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
said we we have heard that this has not
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
been an issue and uh that there is a
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
difference um that uh this is
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
unnecessary for the uh for the penalties
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
to be that high um what the amendment
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
does is it it actually just uh
 
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
accommodates the rest of the bill so if
 
00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
this is going to be instituted there are
 
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
places in the statute where it needed to
 
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
be updated so really the amendment is
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
just kind of a a housekeeping saying if
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
if we were to change this if we were to
 
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
pass this bill we would need to update
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
other areas of the statute in order to
 
00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
do that so the the amendment doesn't
 
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily doesn't well really doesn't
 
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
change anything about the initial uh
 
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
intent or what the bill does in the
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
first place it's just housekeeping so
 
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
the the amendment is if we're going
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
there anyway let's do this while we're
 
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
here type of thing okay so did you want
 
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
to tell us about why the bill is a good
 
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
idea then sure yeah i I think it only
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
makes sense uh and we have only heard
 
00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:50.959 align:start position:0%
from folks who um we've only heard from
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
folks that this is not uh this has not
 
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
been an issue um I know last year or
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
maybe it was two years ago um we went
 
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
over uh very similar legislation and um
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
fundamentally the the idea was that
 
00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
these um these consequences were or
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
penalties were set so high because there
 
00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
was a fear um that that folks who uh
 
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
participated in the program uh might
 
00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
engage in in um you know profit off of
 
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
that and and take advantage of that
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
situation we have not seen that happen
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
um and so really I think this is just
 
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
kind of meeting the moment um and the
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
fact that that we really don't need to
 
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
hold uh them to such a high standard it
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
it it has not proven to be the case and
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
you know many people even who were
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
supportive of this uh being structured
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
in this way in the first place you know
 
00:12:38.949 --> 00:12:38.959 align:start position:0%
have looked back and said yeah we we
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
really haven't encountered any of these
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
issues and there's no need for us to set
 
00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:45.519 align:start position:0%
the penalties that high
 
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion represent
 
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
Muse and I don't have a question yeah a
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
person who actually does this is already
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
subject to the revocation of their
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
registry card and they're also subject
 
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh to a class fa class a felony for
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
violating the uh the control drug act so
 
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
to actually have a separate penalty on
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
top of that uh for something like this
 
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
seems excessive and as Representative
 
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
Newell said I I think back in the day
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
when we were you know first wondering
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
you know how people would behave uh when
 
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh when therapeutic cannabis became uh
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
legalized I think that there uh there it
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
was part of a compromise to actually
 
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
adopt that that that penalty uh but
 
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
because of the experience we've had over
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
the last few years it seems excessive
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
and even though there may not be a lot
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
of people who are actually charged with
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
it the idea of charging somebody with a
 
00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:45.200 align:start position:0%
class A felony and another felony on top
 
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
of that um seems extremely excessive for
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
a drug that we've actually agreed to
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
legalize in this committee this year so
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
I I would urge we take a a second look
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
at this
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
represent Murray
 
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um yeah I really want
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
to uplift what my um two colleagues have
 
00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
said already but this isn't removing
 
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
penalties entirely it's just eliminating
 
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
duplicative penalties and um when
 
00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:19.519 align:start position:0%
individuals were testifying basically
 
00:14:20.949 --> 00:14:20.959 align:start position:0%
all the testimony we got on this bill
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
was in support including from DHS who
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
believes the current statutes are
 
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
outdated and not relevant anymore and um
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
one member who came to testify described
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
this basically as the exact definition
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
of discrimination because we are uh
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
penalizing people because of their
 
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
status doing an extra penalty because of
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
their status as a therapeutic cannabis
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
patient and not anything to do with the
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
actual you know quote unquote crime
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
itself because they're already getting
 
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
the same penalty as everyone else for
 
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
for selling if they did and then like
 
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
Representative Muse said they would also
 
00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
be losing their medical card so this is
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
just giving another like felony just for
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
the sake of it um and that's why it's
 
00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
duplicative and not necessary at this
 
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
point um and I really hope yeah that
 
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
everyone can um give this another
 
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.990 align:start position:0%
everyone can um give this another
thought

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
thought
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
thank you any further discussion
 
00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
seeing none um I'm going to ask the
 
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:17.760 align:start position:0%

motion
 
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman thank you uh I move
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
second seconded by Representative Pru
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
yes this is the uh famous balloon bill
 
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:16:47.069 --> 00:16:47.079 align:start position:0%
um it's meant
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
to send a signal for folks who are
 
00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.550 align:start position:0%
to send a signal for folks who are
um

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
well-meaningly celebrating some sort of
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh uh occasion and turning loose uh 20
 
00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
or more helium filled
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
balloons to uh go up into the atmosphere
 
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
this this isn't meant
 
00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.079 align:start position:0%
to totally throw somebody in jail
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
because of this because we understand it
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
has become kind of a cultural thing but
 
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
we know that these balloons when they
 
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh bad for wildlife whether it be birds
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
or fish or whatever so I think this is a
 
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
good bill uh for uh sending a signal to
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
folks that it's not okay even though
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
it's pretty and it's fun and all that
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
sort of thing it's not okay to send all
 
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
these balloons up in the air because
 
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
they have to land somewhere
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Pru would you
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your second so I agree
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly uh especially the effect
 
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
wildlife in on the planet and I get it
 
00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:12.799 align:start position:0%
it's a nice thing to do but we really
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
need to start changing that to take care
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
of our environment
 
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
um and our wildlife we owe them that
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
thank you um I would just reiterate that
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
this bill the penalty is a violation
 
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
level offense with a fine and you have
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
to um release more than 20 of these
 
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
balloons so um to Representative Lel's
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
point we're not you know trying to throw
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
the book at anyone but we do want to
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
raise awareness and see if we can't curb
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
these these things being released into
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
the into the wildlife further discussion
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
represent Muse yeah I'd just like to add
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
this is an important bill to those of us
 
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919 align:start position:0%
who live in in coastal communities most
 
00:18:58.990 --> 00:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
of the states who have enacted this bill
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
already are coastal states like New
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we have uh a huge uh
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
estruary system we've got Great Bay uh
 
00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
we've got Segamore Creek um we don't
 
00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
have much coastline but what we have uh
 
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
is is worth protecting and the wildlife
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
in it is worth protecting too so I'm
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
happy we're moving in this direction
 
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.240 align:start position:0%

Yeah um we'll take five minutes for
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
everyone to go ahead and take a look at
 
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
that five minutes for everyone to take a
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
I want to unplug this thing
 
00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
19 balloons
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
well there's got to be a number
 
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
somewhere i mean five is just as
 
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so the amendment
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
has uh two parts it's it's the the whole
 
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
amendment as you can see is is rather
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
long um so the original this is a
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
replace all by the way so the original
 
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
bill came to us and it was to be a a
 
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
study commission for human trafficking
 
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
sex trafficking so we've really come to
 
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
the conclusion that this particular
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
subject has been studied it has been
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
intensely looked at over the last couple
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
of years and what we found is we have
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
all these different task force that are
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
all working on this they're doing great
 
00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
things but they're all doing it
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
individually so what we decided to do
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
was actually make a commission not a not
 
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
a study committee so now the commission
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
is going to bring all of those
 
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that have done all of this
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
intense work bring them to the same
 
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
table at the same time so that there can
 
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
be one or many written goals that
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
everybody agrees to and is working at
 
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
the at the same towards at the same time
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
towards that exact goal additionally we
 
00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
asked for the interim study report so if
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
we do have to bring out future
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
legislation the hope would be that we
 
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
can bring it out whenever we all come
 
00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:55.880 align:start position:0%
back at the beginning of next
 
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
year um the other piece is oh and if you
 
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
look we also made it say elicit massage
 
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
parlors we want to be very clear that we
 
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
are not saying that a person is running
 
00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
a massage parlor is doing that illegally
 
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
that is why it specifically says elicit
 
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
massage businesses we do not want
 
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
anybody to think that we're confusing
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
therapeutic massage businesses with
 
00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
elicit massage businesses um the other
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
piece is we have an increased penalty so
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
it is already it's a misdemeanor if you
 
00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
are allowing a person to use say a a a
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
front to do these kind of horrific
 
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
crimes so we have made that be instead
 
00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:39.039 align:start position:0%
of a misdemeanor it's going to be a
 
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
class B felony if the person that is
 
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
forced into this horrific life is a
 
00:30:48.669 --> 00:30:48.679 align:start position:0%
minor it is going to be a class A
 
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
felony and that's a very short synopsis
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
of all of this thank you representative
 
00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.440 align:start position:0%

Murray further discussion yes
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
00:32:05.509 --> 00:32:05.519 align:start position:0%
i I wanted to say that one of the things
 
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
that we are uh typically reluctant to do
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
is to increase a penalty and and one of
 
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
the things that I wanted to do is to
 
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
point out that the penalties in this
 
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
bill are not enhanced penalties or
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
increased penalties uh for anybody what
 
00:32:21.269 --> 00:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
we're doing is we're penalizing uh a
 
00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:23.519 align:start position:0%
different group of actors so under our
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
current statute um uh trafficking uh in
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
minors or forcing other people into
 
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
trafficking is already a class A felony
 
00:32:35.509 --> 00:32:35.519 align:start position:0%
uh what this particular uh penalty
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
clause would do is it would penalize the
 
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
operators of these illicit trafficking
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
facilities uh the people who secure the
 
00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
leases the people who make it easy for
 
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
these folks to jump around from place to
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
place to place in our communities um my
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
understanding is we have six places like
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
this a half a dozen places like this
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
already on the sea coast um and we have
 
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
to do something about it i think the
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
fact that Massachusetts has changed
 
00:33:05.909 --> 00:33:05.919 align:start position:0%
their law to something similar as New
 
00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh has really forced us to act
 
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
on this uh and I hope uh that this bill
 
00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
will have the effect that we want it to
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
have thank you thank you um I I would
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
add to that as well i I agree the um
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
this problem right now is is
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
particularly disturbing because it's
 
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
it's not just one of um prostitution
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
it's one of forced um trafficking and
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
prostitution and it bothers me greatly
 
00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:34.640 align:start position:0%
to know that you know every night when I
 
00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:36.559 align:start position:0%
go to bed that there's women in the
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire who are being
 
00:33:40.149 --> 00:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
held against their will and forced to do
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
this somewhere and I hope that this is a
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
first step towards eradicating this this
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
blight on our society and towards
 
00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
freeing these women um with that I ask
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
the clerk to call the role the motion is
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%

[Music]

00:34:34.109 --> 00:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
416 and this is um I recognize myself to
 
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
make a motion i I'm going to move that
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
we reconsider um House Bill 416 we
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
actually took action on this already um
 
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
and we held on to it and I had made a
 
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
commitment to the sponsor to wait for an
 
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
amendment and it totally got away from
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
me um and that amendment has since been
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
brought and I I believe this is a good
 
00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
bill that we should take a second look
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
at so um my motion is to reconsider need
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
a second seconded by Representative
 
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
Murphy um and I believe I just spoke to
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
it already so I would ask the clerk to
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
call the role the motion is to
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
reconsider House Bill 416
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%

clerk votes yes representative Newell
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
yes chairman Roy chair votes yes 150 150
 
00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
the motion to reconsider passes um at
 
00:35:49.440 --> 00:36:05.069 align:start position:0%
the motion to reconsider passes um at
this

00:36:05.069 --> 00:36:05.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
so the way this works now I believe is
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to um vote again the last
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
motion was to retain and we're going to
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
vote hopefully not to retain and then I
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
will make a new motion so um I'd ask the
 
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the role the motion is on
 
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
Cher votes no 15 the motion for
 
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
retaining fails i recognize myself to
 
00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
make a motion and I would
 
00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
0191H um
 
00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
second by representative PU sorry
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
um and this amendment was provided um to
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
me by the sponsor and it changes the um
 
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
the authority to enforce this is to all
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
officers in the state um we already
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
discussed what it does it um people
 
00:37:40.589 --> 00:37:40.599 align:start position:0%
throwing yard waste into the lakes and
 
00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
ponds um in the first offense any person
 
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
who purposely recklessly violates this
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
paragraph shall be guilty of a violation
 
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
it's just a violation it's um no one's
 
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
going to jail this is really again
 
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
almost like the balloons to raise public
 
00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
awareness so that people understand hey
 
00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
you can't be throwing the stuff from
 
00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
your yard into the pond or into the lake
 
00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
because it will cause these algae blooms
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
which are very expensive um for local
 
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
residents it's bad for the wildlife um
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
it's bad for tourism it's bad for a lot
 
00:38:12.349 --> 00:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
of things so um further
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Murphy thank
 
00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:17.839 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um I agree and fully
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
support this amendment i think this is a
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
step in one of the things that we're
 
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
trying to do as a state um in terms of
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
environmental and public health
 
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
protection and uh this just furthers it
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
i agree too about violation level um
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
status i you know education and
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
information provided to citizens is
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
important and I think that's a first
 
00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
step and this is would serve as a
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
reminder but also address the problem
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
when people don't care or don't uh uh re
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
respond appropriately so I think it's a
 
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
great bill uh and I fully support the
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
amendment and um we'll support it when
 
00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
we get a vote thank you Representative P
 
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
i think this is a good uh first step uh
 
00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:05.839 align:start position:0%
and I would like to hope that if this
 
00:39:08.829 --> 00:39:08.839 align:start position:0%
continues that we step up the penalties
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
to drive the PO point home because I
 
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
believe doing this is going to have a
 
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
large impact on our waterways if we
 
00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
don't stop it thank you Representative
 
00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
um Representative Lel
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
yes I would like to lend my support to
 
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
this also um I think it's a matter of
 
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
education and if if you can go to your
 
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:37.839 align:start position:0%
neighbor who has been thrown yard waste
 
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
in the lake forever and say "Hey have
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
you heard that this is no longer okay
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
it's against the law to do this." Most
 
00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
good neighbors would then say "Oh I
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
didn't realize that and I'll stop that."
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
So I think there's an attitudinal change
 
00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
a cultural change that has to take place
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
and uh like the balloon we're not going
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
to throw anybody in jail it's just a
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
matter of people understanding that it's
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
not okay to do this thank you
 
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
Representative um I I would also point
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
out that you know our immediately comes
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
to mind is you know your your neighbor
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
just doing but there's there's lawn care
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
people that come through and might do
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
you know nine or 10 houses are on a lake
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
and that's a lot of stuff if they decide
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
they're going to dump it in the in the
 
00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
in the water um versus go to the
 
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
landfill maybe have to pay so it's
 
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
important to do this further discussion
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'd ask the clerk to call
 
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%

second seconded by Representative
 
00:42:19.589 --> 00:42:19.599 align:start position:0%
Rhodess this bill um I brought this bill
 
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
because of a couple things i I've been
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
working with the um law enforcement now
 
00:42:26.069 --> 00:42:26.079 align:start position:0%
for a while in New Hampshire um as in
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
part as my role as a member of the
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
accreditation commission and also as a
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
head of this committee and one thing
 
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
that I think we all have become aware of
 
00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
the unbelievable lack of um law
 
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement people willing to work in
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
the field um every department I know is
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
having a hard time recruiting
 
00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
everybody's short and I think that we
 
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
need to come together um the various
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
agencies in the state and law
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement and put our heads together
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
and how we can address this and how we
 
00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
can increase recruitment and entice
 
00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:01.839 align:start position:0%
people um from the military from
 
00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:04.079 align:start position:0%
universities from high schools to think
 
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
about law enforcement as a career and
 
00:43:07.829 --> 00:43:07.839 align:start position:0%
look at what might be holding people
 
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
back from doing so um one of my ideas
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
that I had that I would like them to
 
00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
look at is cooperating with a university
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
system to help possibly get some type of
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
tuition waiverss for people who have
 
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
agreed to serve for a certain amount of
 
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
time and things of that nature so I I
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
this is a a very serious problem for our
 
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
law enforcement in the state right now
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
and I would ask for everyone's support
 
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your second
 
00:43:32.589 --> 00:43:32.599 align:start position:0%
and further
 
00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
discussion than um muse
 
00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
this is a time when it's increasingly
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
difficult uh to attract folks uh to
 
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
public service um and uh I think law
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh to a large extent is
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
bearing the brunt of this but we're also
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
seeing this uh increasingly in other
 
00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
areas too so I think that sending the
 
00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
message that public service has value uh
 
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
real value to our state uh and to our
 
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
country uh is a good thing so I'll be
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill thank you um
 
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
Representative Lel
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
yes I I also will be supporting this
 
00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:15.839 align:start position:0%
bill and I think it's important that we
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
expand the horizons with respect to our
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
recruiting efforts and if we can entice
 
00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.270 align:start position:0%
recruiting efforts and if we can entice
people

00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:24.280 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
who don't necessarily have a tie to New
 
00:44:31.589 --> 00:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but are from outside of the
 
00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
region then we we increase the um the
 
00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
ethnic the racial composite of the
 
00:44:44.589 --> 00:44:44.599 align:start position:0%
people that are uh are applying for our
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
positions and I think that's a good
 
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
thing and if we are so parochial that we
 
00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
restrict our our recruitment to just uh
 
00:44:58.630 --> 00:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
you know our nephews or something that's
 
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
not good we have to expand our horizons
 
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm in whole wholehearted support to
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%

session i open the executive session of
 
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
House Bill 466 recognize myself to make
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
a motion i move ought to pass second
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
seconded by Representative Rhodess um
 
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
I'll speak to my motion hb 466 was
 
00:46:08.069 --> 00:46:08.079 align:start position:0%
brought um at the request of the
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety uh Department of
 
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
Safety pointed out to us that we have
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
one of if not the lowest um rates of of
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
people consenting to take the
 
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
breathalyzer tests in the country um our
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
accidents and fatalities due to drunken
 
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
driving are are getting worse our roads
 
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
are getting more dangerous and we have
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
to do something our right now there's no
 
00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
difference between refusing to take the
 
00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
breath test or taking the breath test
 
00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
the penalty is the same so why would
 
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
anyone take the breath test and give the
 
00:46:43.349 --> 00:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
evidence of their of their uh in
 
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
insubriety to the police so what this
 
00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
does is it breaks that so that it
 
00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
is a more uh harsher penalty if you
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
refuse to take the test it also on the
 
00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
other end does away with the minimum
 
00:46:59.190 --> 00:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
mandatory sentence if you're convicted
 
00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
on one part of it so it it's a good
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
balancing act and it just makes it just
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
a little bit stiffer so that people are
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
incentivized to cooperate and take the
 
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
test and it's important to remind people
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
that as part of accepting the driver's
 
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
license they agree in advance to do this
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
and we need to remind them that they're
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
violating that agreement by not taking
 
00:47:23.829 --> 00:47:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the things about this
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
bill is that with the advent of body
 
00:47:34.829 --> 00:47:34.839 align:start position:0%
cams um
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh the advantage of breathalyzer consent
 
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
I think uh is a little bit more
 
00:47:43.349 --> 00:47:43.359 align:start position:0%
questionable than it's been in the past
 
00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
um body cams have become much more
 
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
prevalent um uh I also think that this
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
is taking somebody's license away uh in
 
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
a state like New Hampshire when we
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
already have penalties that allow their
 
00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:01.480 align:start position:0%
license to be taken away for for this
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
offense um it can be really be a
 
00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
life-changing type of a type of an
 
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
impact uh for people i know that one of
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
the things we've discussed when this
 
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
bill has come up before us before um is
 
00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
the need uh or the desiraability uh for
 
00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
the state police and other agencies to
 
00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:20.680 align:start position:0%
do more communication so people
 
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
understand the penalties for refusal um
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen that i've looked for it i
 
00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
look for it online um um I don't think
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
anything like that has been done and I
 
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
think all that's happened is the same
 
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
bill uh that came before us last year
 
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
was resubmitted again this year uh with
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
really not anything having been done so
 
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh it's hard for me to support this one
 
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
so I get it having your license taken
 
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
away because you're out driving
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
drunk affects your life what really
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
affects somebody's life is when that
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
drunk driver hits an innocent family
 
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
because they got let off easy because
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
they refused to take the test so taking
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
the test should be the deal um if you
 
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
choose not to it should be at least the
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
same penalty if not worse than taking
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
the test you at least have a chance of
 
00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
proving that you're innocent by taking
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
the test so I will be supporting this
 
00:49:27.119 --> 00:49:29.510 align:start position:0%
the test so I will be supporting this
110%

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
110%
 
00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:30.510 align:start position:0%
110%
thank

00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
you i will I'll close by saying that
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
this um as I said this was brought um
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
and the representatives correct it was
 
00:49:41.589 --> 00:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
brought last year um the same people at
 
00:49:44.309 --> 00:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
the department of safety um um Mr
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
edwards has asked me to file it again
 
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
and since last year there's been more
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
deaths and more accidents due to drunk
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
driving and that's why they they brought
 
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
it um and so really nothing's changed
 
00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
the only thing that's changed from now
 
00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
to then is that this year it's it's
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
going to pass so um I'd ask the clerk to
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
call the role the motion on the floor is
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%

session and we're going to take a
 
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:50.960 align:start position:0%

01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%

on House Bill 473 and I
 
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
recognize Representative Rhodess to make
 
01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
a motion thank you Mr chairman um I move
 
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
a second seconded by Representative
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
Murray would you like to speak to your
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
motion uh sure Mr chairman um so I have
 
01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
the the original bill here in front of
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
me and I and I do have a lot of notes
 
01:11:30.070 --> 01:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
but this specific amendment um we had a
 
01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.790 align:start position:0%
but this specific amendment um we had a
gentleman

01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
gentleman
 
01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
testify and he was talking about
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
whenever you have a minor that may have
 
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis um most likely the
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
adult is the one that is retrieving that
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
and then giving it to the child um he
 
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
brought up actually a a very good reason
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
of why he thought that that exception um
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
needed to be made and it would be put in
 
01:11:58.390 --> 01:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
it's uh on the page two of the original
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
bill it's line 26 that I have
 
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
highlighted in this amendment will
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
actually address that and uh I believe
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
the sponsor was here when that was being
 
01:12:08.709 --> 01:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
said i advised them if they wanted to
 
01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
make this happen and by God they did so
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
here we go
 
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your second
 
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
represent Murray
 
01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
um I think the vice chair spoke to it
 
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
very well but I think um it's
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate when passing this
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
legislation to make sure that we're
 
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
treating um therapeutic cannabis the
 
01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
same as we are treating other
 
01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:27.270 align:start position:0%
same as we are treating other
prescriptions

01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
prescriptions
 
01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
except it's not a prescription yes
 
01:12:32.669 --> 01:12:32.679 align:start position:0%

adopted i recognize Representative
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
Rhodess to make another motion
 
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
mr chairman I move uh to pass as amended
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
for House Bill 473
 
01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
seconded by Representative Murray would
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
you like to speak further on your motion
 
01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
um so the the bill in front of us um is
 
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
as all of us are aware in this committee
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
we're always hearing about more drugs
 
01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
that are introduced that so they
 
01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
continuously are adding to the
 
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
controlled drug substance list um so
 
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
basically what this bill does and you
 
01:13:47.229 --> 01:13:47.239 align:start position:0%
look all through here is anywhere
 
01:13:50.189 --> 01:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
methamphetamine related is written
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
they've they've edited that to say
 
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
control drugreated um they've also added
 
01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
to a person's vehicle to also be
 
01:14:04.510 --> 01:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
included with um uh property and I
 
01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
believe that is it but I'm I'm sure that
 
01:14:10.229 --> 01:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
I will be corrected if I'm wrong thank
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
you further discussion representative
 
01:14:12.719 --> 01:14:14.550 align:start position:0%
you further discussion representative
New

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
New
 
01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
um so I thank you Mr chair um I agree
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
with the the bill overall i do have some
 
01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
concerns mostly around the language and
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
and how we've expressed this and so
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
essentially what what we've done on or
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
what the existing language is um
 
01:14:33.270 --> 01:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
particularly as it was as it stood
 
01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
around methamphetamine um it talked
 
01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
about a variety of different situations
 
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
where this may make sense or where this
 
01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
would apply um so page one line 24 no
 
01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
person shall knowingly engage in any of
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
the following activities in the presence
 
01:14:50.709 --> 01:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
of a child or vulnerable adult and then
 
01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
it it gives this is one example right
 
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
and then the next example is in the
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
residence of a child or vulnerable adult
 
01:15:00.149 --> 01:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
and then the ne next example is in a
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
building blah blah blah so it does it is
 
01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
kind of separating it's not saying and
 
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
and it's not that like the in the
 
01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
presence applies to everything and one
 
01:15:09.669 --> 01:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
of the two of the um examples that it
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
gives is it says in a room being offered
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
to the public for overnight
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
accommodations or in any multiple unit
 
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
residential building and I I just have
 
01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
deep concerns that um that this is vague
 
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
enough to allow for you know someone who
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
is staying in a hotel room who you know
 
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
for example did not know that there was
 
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
residue from someone doing this before
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
that this might be um something that was
 
01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
left over it it leaves room in my
 
01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
opinion um it leaves room for uh
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings of the law because of
 
01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
just those those two particular things
 
01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
and those those two particular things
 
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
being um examples where this would apply
 
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
um so those are my concerns i haven't
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
decided yet whether I'm going to how I'm
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
going to vote on um the overall bill and
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
I I honestly wish that um that that
 
01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
could just be kind of sectioned out in a
 
01:15:58.950 --> 01:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
way that that really provides for uh a
 
01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
lack of misunderstanding in that
 
01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:02.070 align:start position:0%
lack of misunderstanding in that
situation

01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay that makes sense um I would say
 
01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
this this is a first a first committee
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to a second committee is
 
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
going to finance if you feel like you
 
01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
could support it with an amendment you
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
we just don't have time to do anything
 
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
further with it at this point um one
 
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
second Representative Rhodess thank you
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman ju just in in a response to
 
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
um Representative Null I think the
 
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
example that you gave I I think that's
 
01:16:28.229 --> 01:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
valid but when I when I actually step
 
01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
back for a second and imagine that
 
01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
scenario I think if I were to go into a
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
hotel room with my child and I were to
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
notice something like that the first
 
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
thing I'm I'm going to do is obviously
 
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
go to somebody at the front desk and ask
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
for another room and then I would think
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
at that point the authorities are
 
01:16:46.510 --> 01:16:46.520 align:start position:0%
probably going to be called so I I think
 
01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
it obviously this is going after someone
 
01:16:52.990 --> 01:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
that knows that they're doing that right
 
01:16:56.310 --> 01:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
and so I I with respect I don't I don't
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
really see the example that you're
 
01:16:59.669 --> 01:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
trying to give as even being something
 
01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
that would be remotely confused with
 
01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
that cuz you as the parent didn't do
 
01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
that like you went into a room and that
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
was happening and obviously you're
 
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
removing your child and yourself as soon
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
as you see that as a situation so but I
 
01:17:14.709 --> 01:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
I could be I misunderstand it doesn't
 
01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
Doesn't it say knowingly yeah it does
 
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
okay so yeah you'd have to prove that
 
01:17:21.550 --> 01:17:21.560 align:start position:0%
that Representative um Sher
 
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
um that was my point every all the
 
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
residences or types of rooms or
 
01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
buildings referred to in that section
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral one it starts out saying
 
01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
no person shall knowingly engage in any
 
01:17:39.189 --> 01:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
of the following activities and then at
 
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
the end of that section has a through d
 
01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
so somebody being knowingly present in a
 
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
place where there are drugs and there
 
01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
are kids but is not manufacturing or
 
01:17:52.229 --> 01:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
attempting to manufacture storing any
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
chemical substance etc as long as
 
01:17:56.149 --> 01:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
they're not doing any of those A through
 
01:17:58.870 --> 01:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
D they're not going to be in trouble so
 
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
if they come into a room that was rented
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
to somebody before and there is drug
 
01:18:06.870 --> 01:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
residue there um they're not going to be
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
in trouble unless they start doing any
 
01:18:12.510 --> 01:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
one of A through D thank you
 
01:18:16.630 --> 01:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
um okay representative Newman
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
so I have I just have a question while
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about this when this law
 
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
and it applies to the people and does
 
01:18:24.790 --> 01:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
all the things that it says what is the
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
kind of things of circumstances where
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
they're going to find this how how how
 
01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
will how will this come to the attention
 
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
of law
 
01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement in any of the circumstances
 
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
i would suggest probably through an
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
investigation of um like DCYF or
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
somebody's there uh social workers there
 
01:18:44.950 --> 01:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
and they see this and they report it to
 
01:18:48.030 --> 01:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
law enforcement um something like that
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
um let me see what you say i said
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
schools yeah or schools could tell
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
parents all the time yeah representative
 
01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
Murray or like what I've seen it come up
 
01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
before is if a uh minor has taken to the
 
01:19:01.510 --> 01:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
hospital because they've ingested
 
01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
something and then it's usually oh it's
 
01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
Yeah and then the healthcare workers I
 
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
assume I think are mandatory reporters
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
and there would then be investigation
 
01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
based on like how did this child get you
 
01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
know how were they able to ingest this
 
01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
stuff and then they would be able to
 
01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
prosecute the parents for exposing them
 
01:19:18.669 --> 01:19:18.679 align:start position:0%
to that
 
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
can ask one question so in this it seems
 
01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
to be the motel room situation so
 
01:19:27.189 --> 01:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
somebody goes there they go with their
 
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
kid there's there's drugs left by
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
somebody in a drawer somewhere they
 
01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
don't ever see it and they check out
 
01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
they clean the room the next day and
 
01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
then they find the drugs in the drawer
 
01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
there and the pre the own the previous
 
01:19:42.229 --> 01:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
person obviously spent the night in a
 
01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
room that had drugs in it but had no
 
01:19:46.630 --> 01:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
knowledge of it would would that happen
 
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
or would they have to go to court and
 
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
then defend themselves that goes back to
 
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
the knowingly and furthermore um the
 
01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
police in any scenario like that would
 
01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
have a really high bar to figure out to
 
01:19:58.790 --> 01:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
tie that that in a common used area like
 
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
that just wanted to No no no
 
01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
representative chair and also they're
 
01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
not doing any of the A through D
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
um it's no it's no secret that I believe
 
01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
that this case is um this this is tied
 
01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
to a specific case um the impetus for
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
this we um there was another suggested
 
01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
amendment that I'm not going to take up
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
it's not from the committee but it it
 
01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
would increase the statute of
 
01:20:32.229 --> 01:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
limitations um to 10 years and I'm I'm
 
01:20:34.630 --> 01:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
disincined to take that up because in my
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
mind that um it really borders on a bill
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
of attainer because that this is um
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
specific to a certain case and while it
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
may not technically be it certainly
 
01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
violates the spirit of that
 
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment where you put
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
something to get a certain person um and
 
01:20:53.910 --> 01:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
if we want to charge a certain person if
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
we have to extend the statute of
 
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
limitations to do that in my mind that's
 
01:20:58.870 --> 01:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
really walking the line of bill of
 
01:21:00.669 --> 01:21:00.679 align:start position:0%
attainers um which would be
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um I I know bill of
 
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
attainers where you actually charge
 
01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
someone but um I just don't like the
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
idea of doing that to get one person
 
01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
because you end up catching other people
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
in in your net that you've thrown and
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
whenever you extend statute limitations
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
it's not good um for either party you
 
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
end up with witnesses disappearing or
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
memories failing and testimony changing
 
01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
the every year that goes by the case
 
01:21:29.189 --> 01:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
gets worse um and 10 years is a long
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
time to have to keep be able to defend
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
yourself and remember where you were and
 
01:21:35.669 --> 01:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
who was there and who you spoke to um I
 
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
can barely remember yesterday so that's
 
01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
um why just for everyone's information
 
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
why I'm not taking that represent yep
 
01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
is that the January
 
01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
no it's one I got this morning someone
 
01:21:50.709 --> 01:21:50.719 align:start position:0%
handed me it's not from this committee
 
01:21:50.719 --> 01:21:53.830 align:start position:0%
handed me it's not from this committee
it's

01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:56.030 --> 01:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
Oh maybe yeah I don't know it's
 
01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
Yeah is anyone want to discuss that
 
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
further no okay seeing none the um
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor is ought to pass
 
01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:06.400 align:start position:0%

01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
HP482 and this I recognize myself for a
 
01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
motion i move ought to pass
 
01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
second second by Representative Rhodess
 
01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
this is another bill that was brought to
 
01:23:06.149 --> 01:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
me by the Department of Safety this is a
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
very important bill for them um and for
 
01:23:10.830 --> 01:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
all of us they
 
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
testified and told us how the accidents
 
01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
severity of the accidents and the deaths
 
01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
are are increasing on our highways for
 
01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
people driving over 100 miles an hour um
 
01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
you know I I like to go fast as much as
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
the next guy but when you're getting
 
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
over a 100 miles an hour the impact of a
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
vehicle collision against another
 
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle coming your way um is
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
astronomical and the chances of
 
01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
surviving it are pretty close to zero um
 
01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of these folks are from out of
 
01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
state they're coming up on the fast
 
01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
motorcycles and their their cars and and
 
01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
especially during the summer and it's
 
01:23:50.229 --> 01:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
causing people to die um so what that
 
01:23:52.830 --> 01:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
they've asked is to stiffen the penalty
 
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
um so it's going to say "Now whoever
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
upon any way drives a vehicle at a speed
 
01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
100 mph or greater and thereby violates
 
01:24:02.790 --> 01:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
any of the provisions of this title or
 
01:24:04.950 --> 01:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
any rule adopted by the director shall
 
01:24:06.669 --> 01:24:06.679 align:start position:0%
be notwithstanding the provisions of
 
01:24:10.149 --> 01:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
section Oh what is that lx11 come on."
 
01:24:12.149 --> 01:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
Somebody who has their uh Roman numerals
 
01:24:16.229 --> 01:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
down what is that 16 or 16
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
what's L lx is L LV
 
01:24:24.149 --> 01:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
kids if you're following pay attention
 
01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
in school um 62
 
01:24:31.390 --> 01:24:31.400 align:start position:0%
guilty of a violation fine not less than
 
01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
$750 plus a penalty assessment for the
 
01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
first offense and $1,000 plus penalty
 
01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
assessment for subsequent offenses and
 
01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
his or her license or operating
 
01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
privileges shall be revoked for a period
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
of 90 days for the first offense and
 
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
from 90 days to one year for a
 
01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:50.719 align:start position:0%
subsequent offense so you get caught
 
01:24:54.229 --> 01:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
going 100 you lose your license for 90
 
01:24:57.110 --> 01:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
days and you get a $750 fine you do it
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
again you get a $1,000 fine and you can
 
01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
lose it anywhere from 90 to a year
 
01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
depending on the judge i think this is
 
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh sending a serious message that if you
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
want to drive on our ways keep it to 99
 
01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
and under and further
 
01:25:12.629 --> 01:25:12.639 align:start position:0%
discussion I don't know if the state
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
police endorsed my last comment no
 
01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
yes represent Muse thank God for I just
 
01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
want to say that um this is really
 
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
egregious behavior so um I'm going to
 
01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
vote for it but one of the things that
 
01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
um that I that I do question is you know
 
01:25:32.189 --> 01:25:32.199 align:start position:0%
our continuing reliance on increasing uh
 
01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
penalties some of these people who are
 
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
driving over a 100 miles an hour have
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
$100,000 cars the fines aren't going to
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
make a great deal of difference to
 
01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
people like that
 
01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
um people like that are going to find
 
01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
other ways to get around while their
 
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
license is in suspension um so one of
 
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
the things that I would ask in the in
 
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
the future is that we think beyond
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
increasing penalties what are some of
 
01:25:56.709 --> 01:25:56.719 align:start position:0%
the other things that we could
 
01:25:59.430 --> 01:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
realistically do to to do something
 
01:26:02.709 --> 01:26:02.719 align:start position:0%
about this problem uh because our our
 
01:26:05.189 --> 01:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
solution always seems to be gee if we
 
01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
increase the penalties it'll send a
 
01:26:08.189 --> 01:26:08.199 align:start position:0%
message that we'll change
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
behavior but we'll we're still going to
 
01:26:12.149 --> 01:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
have people who are going to drive over
 
01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
100 miles an hour on our roads so you
 
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
know in a in a similar way to the way I
 
01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
think we've responded to fentanyl with
 
01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
kind of all of the above uh list of
 
01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
solutions is I think we kind of need a
 
01:26:28.709 --> 01:26:28.719 align:start position:0%
all of the above list of solutions to
 
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
problems like this and and so in in the
 
01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
future it would be great to see more
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
things like that come in front of us
 
01:26:39.030 --> 01:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
thank you any further discussion
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative Lels
 
01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
I I would like to uh back up what uh
 
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
Representative Muse just said and in my
 
01:26:50.910 --> 01:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
case I feel that we need increased
 
01:26:56.189 --> 01:26:56.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement on uh some of these uh uh
 
01:26:59.910 --> 01:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
situations and the way that I I feel it
 
01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
would be good and I I know other people
 
01:27:05.110 --> 01:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
do not agree but I noticed the other day
 
01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
that you can now buy a car off the
 
01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:10.189 align:start position:0%
that you can now buy a car off the
dealer's

01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
dealer's
 
01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
lot standard equipment more than 1,000
 
01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
horsepower and I would submit to you
 
01:27:21.990 --> 01:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
that no one needs a car with a,000
 
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
horsepower uh and what I would like to
 
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
see backing up what Representative Muse
 
01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
said is that at the point of
 
01:27:34.830 --> 01:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
registration that we
 
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
somehow put extra registration fees on
 
01:27:43.189 --> 01:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
these high horsepower vehicles and then
 
01:27:46.270 --> 01:27:46.280 align:start position:0%
give that to the to the public safety
 
01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
department to increase enforcement
 
01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
because I agree somebody that's that's
 
01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
driving a Ferrari or something is not
 
01:27:59.550 --> 01:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
going to be deterred by some
 
01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
$200 fine for uh speeding so I would
 
01:28:06.870 --> 01:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
like to see something uh uh tied to
 
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
horsepower at the point of registration
 
01:28:12.550 --> 01:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
and then give it to the state please
 
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um I look forward to your bill
 
01:28:17.430 --> 01:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
Representative Murphy
 
01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr mr chairman um I am
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
certainly going to support this bill i
 
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
think any of us paying attention any
 
01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
citizen paying attention only has to
 
01:28:29.669 --> 01:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
listen to the news look at a newspaper
 
01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
look online and daily we are seeing um
 
01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
impaired drivers killing people killing
 
01:28:38.709 --> 01:28:38.719 align:start position:0%
themselves causing accidents um we
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
certainly have a challenge with um
 
01:28:42.870 --> 01:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
staffing law enforcement so the
 
01:28:46.149 --> 01:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement is that much harder um
 
01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
enforcing it is certainly um important
 
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
but having people do the right thing is
 
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
equally important um and I you know I'm
 
01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
I understand um that you know we can't
 
01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
find our way out of this or um there's
 
01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
no one um solution but I think we have a
 
01:29:04.629 --> 01:29:04.639 align:start position:0%
number of bills before us some that
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
we've already um heard and some that
 
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
that we've not yet exeact that will go
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
to addressing this because it's a huge
 
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
problem it's not going away nothing
 
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
we're doing right now is working so I
 
01:29:18.709 --> 01:29:18.719 align:start position:0%
think it um this is it's a it's a step
 
01:29:22.709 --> 01:29:22.719 align:start position:0%
that we need to take thank you i agree
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
um with everything that's been said
 
01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
except for the part about not needing
 
01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
the thousand horsepower so I I I totally
 
01:29:30.790 --> 01:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
need a thousand horsepower um however
 
01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
that being said I I agree we need to
 
01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
look at um we need to look at everything
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
i I think that we should also look at
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
you know insurance um you know we get
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
penalized when we make a mistake but
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
there's not many benefits when you don't
 
01:29:44.709 --> 01:29:44.719 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see the insurance companies
 
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
incentivize good driving more than they
 
01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
do and bring some of our insurance rates
 
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
down um but that being said this is
 
01:29:52.709 --> 01:29:52.719 align:start position:0%
about speeding and going over 100 miles
 
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
an hour and it seems like everyone's in
 
01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
support so I'd ask the clerk to call the
 
01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:58.310 align:start position:0%
support so I'd ask the clerk to call the
role

01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%

consent i close the executive session

House Bill
 
01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
528 and I recognize Representative
 
01:30:48.149 --> 01:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
Shabone oh no it is Representative Pette
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
sorry um I move to pass with amendment
 
01:30:53.870 --> 01:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh 0488H
 
01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
seconded by Representative Murray um so
 
01:31:01.390 --> 01:31:01.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment changes the original bill
 
01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
um the first one was a felony this
 
01:31:07.510 --> 01:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
lessens the penalty to a uh violation
 
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
with a fine um it does not decriminalize
 
01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
the use of psilocybin but it changes it
 
01:31:16.229 --> 01:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
from a felony to a fine
 
01:31:18.550 --> 01:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
thank you would you like to speak to
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
Okay would you like to speak to the
 
01:31:22.229 --> 01:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
second represent Murray
 
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
sure thank you um I think it was clear
 
01:31:27.189 --> 01:31:27.199 align:start position:0%
from testimony that um you know not only
 
01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
is this not really um a dangerous drug
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
but it also has medicinal benefits that
 
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
people are unable to take advantage of
 
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
currently because of its classification
 
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
under the controlled drug act and while
 
01:31:41.110 --> 01:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
um entirely removing it might be too
 
01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
weak a step for this legislature to take
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
right now I think this is a good
 
01:31:46.229 --> 01:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
compromise to start with and um
 
01:31:51.310 --> 01:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
um treat you know their conditions if
 
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
they need to and not face um a felony um
 
01:32:00.510 --> 01:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
for doing so thank you for the
 
01:32:03.669 --> 01:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
discussion represent Muse
 
01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I would like to say that um you
 
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
know during the public hearing we
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
actually heard some pretty compelling
 
01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
testimony from one of our colleagues and
 
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
I think that really uh uh really helped
 
01:32:17.110 --> 01:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
in in the past um we've heard that uh
 
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
psilocybin is uh extremely useful for
 
01:32:24.149 --> 01:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
doing things like treating um uh PTSD uh
 
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
in in veterans um we've heard that it's
 
01:32:30.750 --> 01:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
actually been a breakthrough uh
 
01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
medication uh for folks who have dealt
 
01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
with mental illness issues for many many
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
years um I I think where I'm at on this
 
01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
is this particular uh this particular
 
01:32:45.270 --> 01:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
change to the bill allows it to be
 
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
treated more like uh more like cannabis
 
01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh from a penalty perspective and less
 
01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
like fentanyl which I think is is a good
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
thing given the therapeutic benefits it
 
01:32:59.030 --> 01:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
also gives us time to weigh and measure
 
01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
what the potential therapeutic value of
 
01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
this is to wait for studies to come out
 
01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
um uh before we make any additional uh
 
01:33:09.270 --> 01:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
decisions on what we're doing but at
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
this point uh it seems that if we
 
01:33:13.950 --> 01:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
already have folks like state
 
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
representatives who are taking it to um
 
01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
you know to to treat uh conditions that
 
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
they have and and we have constituents
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
who are also doing the same thing it
 
01:33:27.510 --> 01:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
it's to me it's increasingly analogous
 
01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
to uh to I think what we saw with
 
01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis you know a decade ago so uh
 
01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
it's time to to break the log jam and uh
 
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
and I hope we pass this
 
01:33:42.310 --> 01:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
thank you um Representative Rhodess
 
01:33:43.830 --> 01:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman i I just want to
 
01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:44.590 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman i I just want to
say

01:33:44.590 --> 01:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
I I told the sponsor that I that I would
 
01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
vote for his amendment he called he made
 
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
a a very compelling case um if if for
 
01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
anything other than the fact that I have
 
01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
tremendous respect for him and when he
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
testifies I he's the one person I ever
 
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
want to go up on the House floor against
 
01:34:03.510 --> 01:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
um but I just have to say for the record
 
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
that all this conversation about this
 
01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:06.990 align:start position:0%
that all this conversation about this
being

01:34:06.990 --> 01:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
medicine that's almost making me want to
 
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
say no i am not a doctor i don't know
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
that any of us in here are listen no
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
that's that's not right so if we're
 
01:34:18.149 --> 01:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
doing this cuz we're taking away the
 
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
penalty that's one thing but doing it
 
01:34:20.790 --> 01:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
cuz we're trying to say that we're
 
01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
making it be medicine that's the part
 
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
that I'm not okay with i will vote for
 
01:34:29.310 --> 01:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
it i'm saying that thank you further
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
discussion um I'm I'm torn on this i I
 
01:34:34.990 --> 01:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
generally do not agree in full
 
01:34:38.229 --> 01:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
legalization and as this does not do
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
that it reduces it from a felony which
 
01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
is in line with the bill I passed or or
 
01:34:45.910 --> 01:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
that I wrote that decriminalized or
 
01:34:48.510 --> 01:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
defelonized first um first offense
 
01:34:51.110 --> 01:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
possession um so I'm going to support
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
this i I do believe there is medicinal
 
01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
value in this the the VA is looking into
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
it um but in order for us to to look at
 
01:35:01.110 --> 01:35:01.120 align:start position:0%
it that way it's got to be done through
 
01:35:04.470 --> 01:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
the proper processes which doesn't mean
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
um having our citizens at home
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
experimenting to see what makes them
 
01:35:09.189 --> 01:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
feel better i'd like to see it done
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
through proper scientific channels
 
01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
through university studies and the VA um
 
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
but having said that I support this bill
 
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
lowering it from a felony um we don't
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
need more intoxicated people but we also
 
01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
don't need more felons so with that I'd
 
01:35:25.590 --> 01:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
ask the clerk to call the role the
 
01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
motions ought to pass with amendment or
 
01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
did we adopt or no adoption of amendment
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
oh we got to adopt the amendment excuse

Pru representative Pru to make a motion

i make a motion to move
 
01:37:30.990 --> 01:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
amendment 2025
 
01:37:33.149 --> 01:37:33.159 align:start position:0%
05H I mean
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
058 3H
 
01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
second second by Representative Rhodess
 
01:37:40.629 --> 01:37:40.639 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
01:37:44.310 --> 01:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
well uh as I understand there used to be
 
01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
a separate license before we had the uh
 
01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:51.679 align:start position:0%
instant check system that if you were
 
01:37:55.790 --> 01:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
selling to a person in the
 
01:37:58.390 --> 01:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
state they had to reach back to the
 
01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
local police department notify them that
 
01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
they were selling this pistol the police
 
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
department would have to reach back and
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
say "Yes you can sell it to them or
 
01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:06.550 align:start position:0%
say "Yes you can sell it to them or
not."

01:38:06.550 --> 01:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
not."
 
01:38:10.270 --> 01:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
Uh so that has become
 
01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
unnecessary there's still some
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
definitions about selling to an out
 
01:38:18.109 --> 01:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
ofstate person that are left in here
 
01:38:21.030 --> 01:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh again so I think it's just getting
 
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
rid of some an old law that is no longer
 
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
necessary or in use and uh removing that
 
01:38:31.270 --> 01:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
separate license uh to sell a pistol
 
01:38:35.189 --> 01:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
with all those things hanging over it
 
01:38:36.629 --> 01:38:36.639 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Rose would you
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your second sure thank
 
01:38:42.350 --> 01:38:42.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um so so the
 
01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
amendment so the amendment is is
 
01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
basically what Mr what Representative
 
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
Pru said um at the end of the day you
 
01:38:52.270 --> 01:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
already have to have an FFL to sell a
 
01:38:55.350 --> 01:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
firearm however you also still already
 
01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
have to go to your town um either to
 
01:38:59.189 --> 01:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
your planning board or your zoning board
 
01:39:03.109 --> 01:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
to put in a business so the what the
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
amendment does is still leaves the other
 
01:39:08.870 --> 01:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
part of the statute intact so you still
 
01:39:11.350 --> 01:39:11.360 align:start position:0%
have to go through a license dealer if
 
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
you want to transfer a firearm from
 
01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
someone out of state um there's always
 
01:39:18.310 --> 01:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
question there's always this like this
 
01:39:21.109 --> 01:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
this term this loophole but if I were to
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
go to say Pennsylvania and buy a firearm
 
01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
I can't just bring that back to
 
01:39:26.550 --> 01:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania it has to be transferred to
 
01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
an FFL here in New Hampshire i have to
 
01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
go there to pick it up this keeps all
 
01:39:33.750 --> 01:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
that still intact and it still keeps the
 
01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
part about only being able to sell to
 
01:39:39.669 --> 01:39:39.679 align:start position:0%
somebody you know personally um but the
 
01:39:42.629 --> 01:39:42.639 align:start position:0%
the the separate license is no longer
 
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
needed because it being a federal
 
01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:46.229 align:start position:0%
needed because it being a federal
license

01:39:46.229 --> 01:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:39:49.629 --> 01:39:49.639 align:start position:0%
thank you um yeah
 
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
this in New Hampshire you have to have
 
01:39:53.910 --> 01:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
two licenses if you want to sell guns
 
01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
one of them from the feds and one from
 
01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
local this just gets rid of the local
 
01:40:00.070 --> 01:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
the local is a as was said an antique
 
01:40:02.709 --> 01:40:02.719 align:start position:0%
left over from days before the the FFL
 
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
and the um instant background check
 
01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
procedure so we're just doing away with
 
01:40:10.229 --> 01:40:10.239 align:start position:0%
uh one and as Representative RH said the
 
01:40:12.390 --> 01:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
the police department still kept in the
 
01:40:13.590 --> 01:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
loop because you have to go to them
 
01:40:15.950 --> 01:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
first to get your FFL because the the
 
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
the federal government calls them to
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
make sure they're aware that you're
 
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
getting an FFL um with that I'm going to
 
01:40:24.149 --> 01:40:24.159 align:start position:0%
recess for 5 minutes so that um folks
 
01:40:27.109 --> 01:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
can look at the amendment um just to
 
01:40:46.270 --> 01:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:48.750 --> 01:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
minutes if
 
01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
you're making it okay because people
 
02:24:36.230 --> 02:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:38.429 --> 02:24:38.439 align:start position:0%
All right I'm opening the executive
 
02:24:42.469 --> 02:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 218 FN um I
 
02:24:44.150 --> 02:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
recognize Representative Rhodess making
 
02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:48.309 align:start position:0%
recognize Representative Rhodess making
a

02:24:48.309 --> 02:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:50.630 --> 02:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
Thank you Mr chairman i move ought to
 
02:24:56.910 --> 02:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:01.429 --> 02:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
second make your amendment thank you so
 
02:25:04.870 --> 02:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
we had a bill brought to us and um I
 
02:25:06.550 --> 02:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
understand it was up in Wolfboro
 
02:25:10.309 --> 02:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
somebody uh asked for an initial report
 
02:25:12.309 --> 02:25:12.319 align:start position:0%
and for whatever reason was not given
 
02:25:15.510 --> 02:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
that so since that original bill has
 
02:25:17.750 --> 02:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
been filed that police department has
 
02:25:20.630 --> 02:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
updated their policy so that they are
 
02:25:23.030 --> 02:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
going to give somebody a copy of an
 
02:25:26.630 --> 02:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
initial police report for a crime
 
02:25:30.469 --> 02:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
however if you Google different police
 
02:25:32.429 --> 02:25:32.439 align:start position:0%
departments in the state of New
 
02:25:35.429 --> 02:25:35.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire some police departments charge
 
02:25:38.590 --> 02:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
$5 per page some charge if it's
 
02:25:40.710 --> 02:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
electronic some don't charge anything at
 
02:25:43.990 --> 02:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
all some charge of flat $20 the point is
 
02:25:45.910 --> 02:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
that if you are the victim of a crime
 
02:25:47.910 --> 02:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
you should not have to pay for the
 
02:25:50.550 --> 02:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
police report that says you are the
 
02:25:53.349 --> 02:25:53.359 align:start position:0%
victim of a crime when you receive that
 
02:25:56.550 --> 02:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
you are able to start the process if you
 
02:25:58.950 --> 02:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
need any kind of assistance um if you
 
02:26:01.270 --> 02:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
need to hire an attorney some people
 
02:26:03.750 --> 02:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
need to possibly get out of their lease
 
02:26:05.750 --> 02:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
they have to move some people have to
 
02:26:08.870 --> 02:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
miss work this report is going to make
 
02:26:11.670 --> 02:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
it so that this amendment will make it
 
02:26:13.990 --> 02:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
so that everybody is able to receive
 
02:26:15.590 --> 02:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
something from the police department
 
02:26:18.150 --> 02:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
that says that they have that they have
 
02:26:20.230 --> 02:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
a police report that something happened
 
02:26:23.990 --> 02:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
to them and be uniform across the state
 
02:26:26.870 --> 02:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
it will all be free this is already in
 
02:26:29.270 --> 02:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
the victim's bill of rights we added the
 
02:26:31.750 --> 02:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
word initial report because we
 
02:26:34.710 --> 02:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
understand that that there's generally
 
02:26:37.590 --> 02:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
an investigation that follows after so
 
02:26:40.389 --> 02:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
that is we we took the the victim's bill
 
02:26:42.950 --> 02:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
of rights and we copied it into here and
 
02:26:45.910 --> 02:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
we put the the time frames in there
 
02:26:47.270 --> 02:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
because you know sometimes you have
 
02:26:49.349 --> 02:26:49.359 align:start position:0%
holidays uh maybe the person that that
 
02:26:51.190 --> 02:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
prints those things off is not there for
 
02:26:53.429 --> 02:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
the day we just gave time frames so the
 
02:26:55.429 --> 02:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
person knows that it will be coming the
 
02:26:58.550 --> 02:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
max it's going to take is the 15 days or
 
02:27:01.750 --> 02:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
the seven days
 
02:27:03.990 --> 02:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
02:27:05.990 --> 02:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
02:27:09.190 --> 02:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman i agree with um
 
02:27:12.950 --> 02:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
Representative Rhodess um I I think that
 
02:27:15.030 --> 02:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
most of us are on the same page as to
 
02:27:16.309 --> 02:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
recognizing that there's a need for
 
02:27:18.630 --> 02:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
victims to be able to access something
 
02:27:21.590 --> 02:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
in a very short time frame following a a
 
02:27:24.550 --> 02:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
crime um for all the whether it's a
 
02:27:27.190 --> 02:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
lease challenge or or for whatever
 
02:27:28.710 --> 02:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
reason that they need time off from work
 
02:27:30.070 --> 02:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
and they have to prove that there's a
 
02:27:34.309 --> 02:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
reason why um the challenge is um and um
 
02:27:38.349 --> 02:27:38.359 align:start position:0%
I have put out another amendment
 
02:27:43.670 --> 02:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
um the challenge comes for me in that um
 
02:27:46.790 --> 02:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
when I I asked for that first amendment
 
02:27:49.030 --> 02:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about now um to be
 
02:27:50.710 --> 02:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
written I didn't have some of the
 
02:27:52.950 --> 02:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
information that I have now And I've
 
02:27:55.429 --> 02:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
been told by as our my own chief of
 
02:27:58.230 --> 02:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
police that that passing the amendment
 
02:28:02.070 --> 02:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
as written would violate 91A it would
 
02:28:04.070 --> 02:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
remove the ability of law enforcement
 
02:28:08.910 --> 02:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
officers to withhold a that initial um
 
02:28:12.150 --> 02:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
report uh it would be in conflict um and
 
02:28:14.710 --> 02:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
his concern about that was that
 
02:28:16.469 --> 02:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
sometimes there are uh there's
 
02:28:18.790 --> 02:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
information in that report that if a
 
02:28:20.469 --> 02:28:20.479 align:start position:0%
crime victim was still living with the
 
02:28:22.710 --> 02:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
perpetrator the crime the perpetrator
 
02:28:24.309 --> 02:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
would have information that they might
 
02:28:28.550 --> 02:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
not the the um uh prosecuting uh agency
 
02:28:30.469 --> 02:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
may not want them to have because it it
 
02:28:32.469 --> 02:28:32.479 align:start position:0%
could mess up a case and the last thing
 
02:28:36.469 --> 02:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
I want to do is make it harder for law
 
02:28:39.190 --> 02:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement to prosecute cases and pro
 
02:28:42.750 --> 02:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
protect victims um
 
02:28:45.309 --> 02:28:45.319 align:start position:0%
so it it comes down
 
02:28:48.550 --> 02:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
to the we're on the same page I think so
 
02:28:50.309 --> 02:28:50.319 align:start position:0%
in in most of this and I think we're all
 
02:28:51.510 --> 02:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
trying to do the right thing and the
 
02:28:55.830 --> 02:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
same thing but I just can't support
 
02:29:01.030 --> 02:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
um my own amendment uh um if it if I'm
 
02:29:04.150 --> 02:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
being asked to to pass it knowing that
 
02:29:06.870 --> 02:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
it will complicate the ability of law
 
02:29:09.349 --> 02:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement and it will direct law
 
02:29:12.309 --> 02:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement um agencies to do something
 
02:29:15.830 --> 02:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
that 91A tells them that they have the
 
02:29:17.910 --> 02:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
right to withhold so I just I don't know
 
02:29:19.910 --> 02:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
how to without a different amendment I
 
02:29:23.590 --> 02:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
don't know how to to make that happen
 
02:29:27.670 --> 02:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
thank you um Representative Sher
 
02:29:30.230 --> 02:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you again i'm in support of the
 
02:29:32.550 --> 02:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
idea here the concept here i just want
 
02:29:34.950 --> 02:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
to make it as clear as possible
 
02:29:37.349 --> 02:29:37.359 align:start position:0%
certainly um my role as a police
 
02:29:40.150 --> 02:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner in Portsouth uh the police
 
02:29:40.160 --> 02:29:41.230 align:start position:0%
commissioner in Portsouth uh the police
hate

02:29:41.230 --> 02:29:41.240 align:start position:0%
hate
 
02:29:45.670 --> 02:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
ambiguity and I think um the ambiguity
 
02:29:50.070 --> 02:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
here is the word report
 
02:29:55.349 --> 02:29:55.359 align:start position:0%
some people read the word report to mean
 
02:29:59.389 --> 02:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
the report that the victim made to the
 
02:30:03.429 --> 02:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
police other people read the word report
 
02:30:07.349 --> 02:30:07.359 align:start position:0%
to mean a police report of what the
 
02:30:12.349 --> 02:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
victim said many many times in police um
 
02:30:16.710 --> 02:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
matters there is no written report
 
02:30:20.070 --> 02:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
authored by the victim about what
 
02:30:23.110 --> 02:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
happened the huge majority of reports
 
02:30:27.990 --> 02:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
are oral reports to a police officer who
 
02:30:31.270 --> 02:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
then writes a police report i go through
 
02:30:34.510 --> 02:30:34.520 align:start position:0%
this lengthy and boring distinction
 
02:30:37.750 --> 02:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
because there are police departments I
 
02:30:40.710 --> 02:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
also know there are police departments
 
02:30:44.750 --> 02:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
who view the word report in as it's
 
02:30:48.389 --> 02:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
written as meaning a police report and
 
02:30:51.510 --> 02:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
they see that covered by 91A
 
02:30:53.230 --> 02:30:53.240 align:start position:0%
if there were
 
02:30:57.030 --> 02:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
a Well I'll That's my problem here the
 
02:30:59.670 --> 02:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
The Second Amendment that uh
 
02:31:03.030 --> 02:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
Representative Mercy Murphy filed uh
 
02:31:07.630 --> 02:31:07.640 align:start position:0%
required simply a a right to get a
 
02:31:11.030 --> 02:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
confirmation that a crime was reported i
 
02:31:12.790 --> 02:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
know there's difficulty about the word
 
02:31:14.790 --> 02:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
alleged but you know I think that we can
 
02:31:17.750 --> 02:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
get rid of that if need be but if if if
 
02:31:20.910 --> 02:31:20.920 align:start position:0%
the if the victim is just asking for
 
02:31:23.830 --> 02:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
confirmation that they reported a crime
 
02:31:26.630 --> 02:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
on a particular date that occurred at a
 
02:31:28.710 --> 02:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
particular location then we don't have
 
02:31:32.230 --> 02:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
any problems but this word report just
 
02:31:35.270 --> 02:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
mucks things up for police departments
 
02:31:38.389 --> 02:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'm going to say this the
 
02:31:41.030 --> 02:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
the victim's bill of rights is existing
 
02:31:43.429 --> 02:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
law in that it says they have a right to
 
02:31:45.429 --> 02:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
the police report
 
02:31:47.190 --> 02:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
this says they have a replace to police
 
02:31:49.190 --> 02:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
report merely that it's free and they
 
02:31:52.230 --> 02:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
have so many days to give it the police
 
02:31:54.870 --> 02:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
under 91A have the ability and the
 
02:31:57.510 --> 02:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
authority to redact anything that they
 
02:32:00.790 --> 02:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
feel um is covered under 91A under the
 
02:32:03.190 --> 02:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
investigation exemption but they do not
 
02:32:04.630 --> 02:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
have the right to withhold the entire
 
02:32:06.950 --> 02:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
police report so I don't care if it's
 
02:32:08.630 --> 02:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
the officer's written report or the
 
02:32:10.230 --> 02:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
victim came in and gave them a written
 
02:32:12.790 --> 02:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
report it it the clearly the victim's
 
02:32:15.990 --> 02:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
right means the police report so this
 
02:32:18.790 --> 02:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
means the police report and if they need
 
02:32:20.950 --> 02:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
to redact it they can redact it and
 
02:32:22.870 --> 02:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
still turn over the report and then the
 
02:32:25.110 --> 02:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
victim is free to to pursue that further
 
02:32:27.030 --> 02:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
if they saying they're redacted too much
 
02:32:28.790 --> 02:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
we're just saying it's free and and I
 
02:32:30.870 --> 02:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
think that's the point is at the end of
 
02:32:32.550 --> 02:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
the day we copied the language of
 
02:32:35.190 --> 02:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
existing law now you got to give it free
 
02:32:36.550 --> 02:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
if the police say "Well that's a
 
02:32:39.190 --> 02:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
violation of 91A," they can redact what
 
02:32:40.950 --> 02:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
they feel is a violation that they don't
 
02:32:44.030 --> 02:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
have to turn over um further
 
02:32:46.469 --> 02:32:46.479 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none what
 
02:32:49.670 --> 02:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative um Newman I I just have a
 
02:32:51.990 --> 02:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
question about the victim's bill of
 
02:32:54.950 --> 02:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
rights that uses the word in the law of
 
02:32:56.550 --> 02:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
police report does it have any
 
02:32:58.870 --> 02:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
definition of that
 
02:33:01.830 --> 02:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
and my followup would be is is there not
 
02:33:04.150 --> 02:33:04.160 align:start position:0%
some way we can describe a short report
 
02:33:07.670 --> 02:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
that report that they that a victim has
 
02:33:09.349 --> 02:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
reported a crime and would that be
 
02:33:11.590 --> 02:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
sufficient that's almost getting into a
 
02:33:13.590 --> 02:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
um an unfunded mandate because they
 
02:33:15.510 --> 02:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
don't do that you're we're asking them
 
02:33:17.590 --> 02:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
in the amendment is asking them to
 
02:33:19.750 --> 02:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
create a report they don't already do so
 
02:33:22.469 --> 02:33:22.479 align:start position:0%
if a if a victim comes in and says "I
 
02:33:24.309 --> 02:33:24.319 align:start position:0%
need this." The police would at that
 
02:33:25.990 --> 02:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
point have to create a special report
 
02:33:27.830 --> 02:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
just for that victim to say "You came in
 
02:33:30.070 --> 02:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
on this date and and reported a crime."
 
02:33:31.270 --> 02:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
And that's not something they're already
 
02:33:33.510 --> 02:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
doing we'd asking them to create an
 
02:33:36.790 --> 02:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
extra report um and I don't I don't
 
02:33:38.070 --> 02:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
think that's what we're intending to do
 
02:33:39.670 --> 02:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
here we're just talking about the
 
02:33:41.590 --> 02:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
regular police report that goes to the
 
02:33:44.550 --> 02:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
prosecutor um and if they need to redact
 
02:33:46.469 --> 02:33:46.479 align:start position:0%
it they'll have to tell the victim
 
02:33:48.309 --> 02:33:48.319 align:start position:0%
here's a redacted report because we're
 
02:33:50.790 --> 02:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
it's still an open investigation um it's
 
02:33:53.830 --> 02:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
in the representative Pette as someone
 
02:33:55.830 --> 02:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
who's been a victim of crime and had to
 
02:34:00.309 --> 02:34:00.319 align:start position:0%
get documentation to prove so um if I
 
02:34:01.990 --> 02:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
asked for the police report I needed the
 
02:34:03.670 --> 02:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
police report and I needed specific
 
02:34:05.110 --> 02:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
information that was in the police
 
02:34:08.630 --> 02:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
report um having a paper that says that
 
02:34:10.270 --> 02:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
I was the victim of a
 
02:34:13.429 --> 02:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
crime allegedly wouldn't be of any help
 
02:34:15.110 --> 02:34:15.120 align:start position:0%

reopening executive session on House
 
03:18:31.550 --> 03:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
Bill 146 um if you recall we
 
03:18:34.950 --> 03:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
had an amendment and there was a
 
03:18:37.870 --> 03:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
question as to whether or not the
 
03:18:41.429 --> 03:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
amendment needed to be changed because
 
03:18:44.349 --> 03:18:44.359 align:start position:0%
of the ABC and the amendment said it
 
03:18:47.510 --> 03:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
replace section one with and it had a we
 
03:18:48.950 --> 03:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
checked with OS and they said the
 
03:18:50.630 --> 03:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
amendment is fine as it is it does not
 
03:18:53.070 --> 03:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
affect the existing law it will
 
03:18:55.830 --> 03:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
only replace the rest of the new bill
 
03:18:57.830 --> 03:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
with just that so the the amendment is
 
03:19:01.590 --> 03:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
fine as it is um according to all us if
 
03:19:28.630 --> 03:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:31.349 --> 03:19:31.359 align:start position:0%
which bill are we talking about now and
 
03:19:46.550 --> 03:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:53.930 --> 03:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:53.940 --> 03:19:55.670 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:19:55.670 --> 03:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:19:57.030 --> 03:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
you were talking about removing section
 
03:19:59.590 --> 03:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
C it was ABC so they're saying that
 
03:20:01.269 --> 03:20:01.279 align:start position:0%
because it says replace all of section
 
03:20:05.710 --> 03:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
one with just A it remove C so
 
03:20:08.150 --> 03:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
okay and this is the body one camera
 
03:20:11.510 --> 03:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
bill um so I'm going to I don't We
 
03:20:12.870 --> 03:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
didn't Didn't we didn't move this yet
 
03:20:15.269 --> 03:20:15.279 align:start position:0%
already right this amendment
 
03:20:18.389 --> 03:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
we did so then I'm going to leave it as
 
03:20:18.399 --> 03:20:20.550 align:start position:0%
we did so then I'm going to leave it as
is

03:20:20.550 --> 03:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:20:21.990 --> 03:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
yeah myself and Representative Rhodess
 
03:20:23.429 --> 03:20:23.439 align:start position:0%
already moved this amendment um last
 
03:20:25.110 --> 03:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
week or earlier this week and did it
 
03:20:26.870 --> 03:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
pass it's all good we did we vote moved
 
03:20:28.229 --> 03:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
it but we didn't vote on We didn't vote
 
03:20:30.550 --> 03:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
on it we stopped okay so what we're
 
03:20:31.990 --> 03:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
going to do now is we're going to vote
 
03:20:34.389 --> 03:20:34.399 align:start position:0%
on the amendment um that we already
 
03:20:36.790 --> 03:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
moved when I recessed um earlier in the
 
03:20:40.389 --> 03:20:40.399 align:start position:0%
week this amendment is good as is 0591h
 
03:20:40.399 --> 03:20:41.389 align:start position:0%
week this amendment is good as is 0591h
yeah

03:20:41.389 --> 03:20:41.399 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:20:41.399 --> 03:20:44.670 align:start position:0%
yeah
0591h

03:20:44.670 --> 03:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:47.590 --> 03:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
um and for those who are here probably
 
03:20:49.030 --> 03:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
wondering what are they talking about
 
03:20:52.790 --> 03:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
like our our replacements um we had a
 
03:20:56.030 --> 03:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
bill on body cameras
 
03:20:59.190 --> 03:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
because body camera footage is only kept
 
03:21:01.429 --> 03:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
for a certain amount of time and a
 
03:21:04.229 --> 03:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
constituent of someone appealed a
 
03:21:06.389 --> 03:21:06.399 align:start position:0%
traffic citation and by the time it got
 
03:21:07.990 --> 03:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
to appeal they'd already destroyed the
 
03:21:09.590 --> 03:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
evidence and he wanted to use it in his
 
03:21:11.990 --> 03:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
defense so what this bill is doing is
 
03:21:14.229 --> 03:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
saying if there is a violation level
 
03:21:15.750 --> 03:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
offense you have to hold on to that
 
03:21:17.910 --> 03:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
until it's resolved because prior to
 
03:21:20.070 --> 03:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
that they didn't
 
03:21:21.990 --> 03:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
okay all right with that I'll ask the
 
03:21:24.309 --> 03:21:24.319 align:start position:0%

clerk to call the role wait a minute
 
03:22:25.429 --> 03:22:25.439 align:start position:0%

this is the bill itself and the last
 
03:22:31.389 --> 03:22:31.399 align:start position:0%
turn on
 
03:22:34.790 --> 03:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
sorry when we talked about it earlier my
 
03:22:38.190 --> 03:22:38.200 align:start position:0%
understanding was that it was going to
 
03:22:42.469 --> 03:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
be section C was going to be removed
 
03:22:45.150 --> 03:22:45.160 align:start position:0%
where in the amendment the amendment
 
03:22:49.110 --> 03:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
says the amendment says amend the bill
 
03:22:51.349 --> 03:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
by replacing section one section one
 
03:22:54.309 --> 03:22:54.319 align:start position:0%
contains A B and C okay now it's only
 
03:22:59.750 --> 03:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
got A okay all right i guess but it says
 
03:23:01.590 --> 03:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
because there's a B there's a there's a
 
03:23:05.910 --> 03:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:07.750 --> 03:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
no C was going to be part of this new
 
03:23:10.389 --> 03:23:10.399 align:start position:0%
bill but it's not anymore so now the and
 
03:23:12.309 --> 03:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
refers just to the B that's already in
 
03:23:12.319 --> 03:23:15.110 align:start position:0%
refers just to the B that's already in
statute

03:23:15.110 --> 03:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:23:15.120 --> 03:23:17.030 align:start position:0%
statute
okay

03:23:17.030 --> 03:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:23:20.309 --> 03:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
i know got it
 
03:23:22.790 --> 03:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
it's a little confusing but it's what
 
03:23:24.550 --> 03:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
happens when you have to pull parts of
 
03:23:27.590 --> 03:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
statutes and replace them all right um
 
03:23:29.750 --> 03:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
Okay with that I'll ask the clerk to
 
03:23:31.429 --> 03:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
call the role motion is ought to pass as
 
03:23:31.439 --> 03:23:33.990 align:start position:0%

same amendment that I already handed you

03:26:04.150 --> 03:26:04.160 align:start position:0%

03:26:06.389 --> 03:26:06.399 align:start position:0%

Representative

03:26:07.950 --> 03:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
Representative
 
03:26:10.309 --> 03:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
um any further discussion i think we
 
03:26:11.910 --> 03:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
already talked about this this takes
 
03:26:15.110 --> 03:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
I'll just recap it again for our um our
 
03:26:18.070 --> 03:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
placement folks in New Hampshire statute
 
03:26:20.630 --> 03:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
there's a law requiring someone who's
 
03:26:21.910 --> 03:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
going to sell guns to get a New
 
03:26:24.870 --> 03:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license and there's also the
 
03:26:27.510 --> 03:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
federal license that you have to have um
 
03:26:28.950 --> 03:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
this does away with the New Hampshire
 
03:26:31.030 --> 03:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
license because why should we charge our
 
03:26:32.630 --> 03:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
citizens for something they already have
 
03:26:34.870 --> 03:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
to pay the federal government to get um
 
03:26:36.349 --> 03:26:36.359 align:start position:0%
and that's basically
 
03:26:38.630 --> 03:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
it um with that I'll ask the clerk to
 
03:26:39.990 --> 03:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
