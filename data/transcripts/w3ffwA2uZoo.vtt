she's a committee chair as well has a
 
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
conflict this morning and would be
 
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
unable to attend this morning
 
00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
so I if we come to a point in time where
 
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 align:start position:0%
we do have items to discuss I would
 
00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:55.259 align:start position:0%
perhaps discuss other items an executive
 
00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 align:start position:0%
session but I won't take any votes until
 
00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
this afternoon when I all the committee
 
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
are available here to take the votes
 
00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:05.699 align:start position:0%
the uh the other issue that we have is
 
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
we have a very large
 
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:09.590 align:start position:0%
we have a very large
um

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
number of
 
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
bills to be heard where and where have
 
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
basically halfway through our bills I've
 
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 align:start position:0%
gone through and uh each all the bills
 
00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.139 align:start position:0%
and it would appear that we would need
 
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
four hearing days and probably a a full
 
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 align:start position:0%
day to exec the remaining bills that we
 
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
have if we're able to get through all
 
00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139 align:start position:0%
our bills today to exec this afternoon
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
and which means five days
 
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 align:start position:0%
and we're supposed to have everything
 
00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
out by March 11th uh if you look at the
 
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 align:start position:0%
calendar that only provides us with
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
about nine days of actual time
 
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
uh work time available between now and
 
00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
March 11th to have hearings so I I have
 
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
informed the the speaker's office that
 
00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
we do need time and we need
 
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 align:start position:0%

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
they did get back yesterday and
 
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
indicated that this coming Friday would
 
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
not not we we're having hearings this
 
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
Friday but the following Friday is
 
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:20.340 align:start position:0%
available and asked if we would uh take
 
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:22.740 align:start position:0%
that day
 
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:25.740 align:start position:0%
um I was reluctant because we're
 
00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:27.419 align:start position:0%
scheduled to be have hearings on the
 
00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
23rd which is Tuesday we're scheduled to
 
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
be in session on the 24th and 25th and
 
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
then that Friday is the 26th and that
 
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
would mean four days that week of
 
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.060 align:start position:0%
legislative duties
 
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0%
but I don't know uh that there's really
 
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
uh an option I probably need to take
 
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
that day
 
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh realizing that that's that's a big
 
00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
burden for lots of people
 
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:54.300 align:start position:0%
and some people just may not be able to
 
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
be able to make it for the hearings
 
00:07:59.210 --> 00:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
themselves but we wouldn't we wouldn't
 
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:02.340 align:start position:0%
exec anything and if in fact you found
 
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
yourself in circumstances where you
 
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
couldn't attend so I'm going to commit
 
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:09.060 align:start position:0%
to do that Friday I think because we
 
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:11.060 align:start position:0%
really need to do it
 
00:08:13.969 --> 00:08:13.979 align:start position:0%
and hold hearings that day
 
00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
and try to end a little bit at least a
 
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
little bit early in the afternoon so it
 
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:20.940 align:start position:0%
doesn't mess up your weekends
 
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
so uh just so you know Mr chairman I
 
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
have a county executive committee
 
00:08:27.409 --> 00:08:27.419 align:start position:0%
meeting that morning
 
00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:29.879 align:start position:0%
yeah from nine to eleven I have it on my
 
00:08:32.329 --> 00:08:32.339 align:start position:0%
calendar from 9 to 11 and probably take
 
00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:34.919 align:start position:0%
at least that long so you'll have to
 
00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
have a substitute Clerk
 
00:08:36.839 --> 00:08:39.230 align:start position:0%
have a substitute Clerk
okay

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
well that that that is that that that's
 
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
probably the biggest problem I face so
 
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
far is committee chairs getting somebody
 
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:49.860 align:start position:0%
else to do it so
 
00:08:51.769 --> 00:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
um we'd have to find somebody else to do
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
it I think
 
00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
yep I don't have to be I don't have to
 
00:09:00.889 --> 00:09:00.899 align:start position:0%
be part of this hearing business but
 
00:09:07.329 --> 00:09:07.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
we are in the minority and uh
 
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
okay who's probably going to be um less
 
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
consequential than it might be here or
 
00:09:18.769 --> 00:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
my import my my you get what I'm saying
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
I don't but you do I'm I'm uh I'm also
 
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
on the Stratford county executive
 
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
committee I'll have the same issue on
 
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:29.700 align:start position:0%
that Friday the 26th
 
00:09:33.769 --> 00:09:33.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
okay uh we have three hearings scheduled
 
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:37.800 align:start position:0%

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:40.440 align:start position:0%

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:30.260 align:start position:0%
channel I had it on was on an
 
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
infomercial that had to do with a
 
00:12:38.569 --> 00:12:38.579 align:start position:0%
non-stick non-stick frying pan and they
 
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
showed a bunch of eggs
 
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
roaming around inside the the pan and it
 
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
was real nice to see those eggs none of
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
us want our eggs to stick to the fry pan
 
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
when we fry our our eggs in the morning
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
uh it's a wonderful thing
 
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:01.260 align:start position:0%

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:05.100 align:start position:0%
with respect to wonderful products that
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
will help us out around our home and our
 
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.690 align:start position:0%
will help us out around our home and our
businesses

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:08.700 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
we have a situation here in Litchfield I
 
00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:18.380 align:start position:0%
represent Litchfield
 
00:13:20.449 --> 00:13:20.459 align:start position:0%

Hillsborough 20.
and

00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
when people moved into this wonderful
 
00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
town that we call home
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
they built their homes or they purchased
 
00:13:34.009 --> 00:13:34.019 align:start position:0%
their homes and many of them there's a
 
00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
lot of Litchfield at least there used to
 
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
be that was not serviced by city water
 
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
and a lot of people in the northern end
 
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:47.700 align:start position:0%
of Litchfield toward Manchester
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
um there was there was no City water in
 
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
that area of town so everyone invested
 
00:13:58.810 --> 00:13:58.820 align:start position:0%
or purchased a home uh with a well
 
00:14:02.769 --> 00:14:02.779 align:start position:0%
everything was fine after that initial
 
00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
purchase or putting in the well they had
 
00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
very little expense other than
 
00:14:13.129 --> 00:14:13.139 align:start position:0%
the electricity to run their pump
 
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
little did they know that we have an
 
00:14:19.129 --> 00:14:19.139 align:start position:0%
industry just across the river
 
00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
um that has been polluting
 
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.670 align:start position:0%
um that has been polluting
for

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
several years
 
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:32.220 align:start position:0%
and in fact continue to pollute today
 
00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
now when it was discovered that this
 
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
company was polluted
 
00:14:41.329 --> 00:14:41.339 align:start position:0%
there was provision made to supply these
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
folks with water so they didn't have to
 
00:14:47.329 --> 00:14:47.339 align:start position:0%
drink the polluted water this is people
 
00:14:49.009 --> 00:14:49.019 align:start position:0%
that have wells
 
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
which was most of the people in the
 
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:53.820 align:start position:0%
North End of Litchfield
 
00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
and then over a period of a couple of
 
00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.310 align:start position:0%
and then over a period of a couple of
years

00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
there was water lines that were that
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
were brought in so the people would have
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
now these folks that live up there
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
expenses just went from virtually
 
00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:21.500 align:start position:0%
nothing which was the electric cost of
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
uh running their world pump
 
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
to in many cases almost a hundred
 
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
dollars a month
 
00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
for water
 
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
we have we have three problems with
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
water in Litchfield one is the
 
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
contamination one is the quality of
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
water but also the cost of the water
 
00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
and it's not unheard of for people here
 
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
in Litchfield that have a hundred
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
dollars a month water bills we're in the
 
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
midst of a of a rate increase
 
00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:57.060 align:start position:0%
fight right now but that's a different
 
00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.030 align:start position:0%
fight right now but that's a different
story

00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
story
 
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:03.180 align:start position:0%
seems to me that if a company is going
 
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
to produce a product
 
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
that they're going to sell to the public
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
like this non-stick fry pan
 
00:16:15.769 --> 00:16:15.779 align:start position:0%
that you can purchase for 19.95
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's a certain amount of profit that's
 
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
built into that
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have it have to be a
 
00:16:24.829 --> 00:16:24.839 align:start position:0%
non-stick fry pan it could be some
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
product unforeseen at this point
 
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
but some product in the future
 
00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
it seems to me we need to build in a
 
00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:38.759 align:start position:0%
certain amount of cost to that
 
00:16:41.569 --> 00:16:41.579 align:start position:0%
if it turns out
 
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
that the process
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
that it needs to make this non-stick fry
 
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
that it pollutes
 
00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:56.100 align:start position:0%
the air the water
 
00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.550 align:start position:0%
the air the water
whatever

00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:17:02.269 --> 00:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
so the the purpose of this bill
 
00:17:03.949 --> 00:17:03.959 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
to make it so
 
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
that people who are who did not have a
 
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
water bill and now find themselves
 
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
through no fault of their own
 
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
to have upwards of a hundred dollars a
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
month in water bill
 
00:17:26.049 --> 00:17:26.059 align:start position:0%
so that's the whole purpose of the bill
 
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
we limited it to five years because we
 
00:17:33.289 --> 00:17:33.299 align:start position:0%
know there has to be some sort of a
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
limit I suppose
 
00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.190 align:start position:0%
limit I suppose
and

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
if the home is sold then the person who
 
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
purchases it all knows what they're
 
00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:45.230 align:start position:0%
getting into
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:46.549 align:start position:0%
getting into
[Music]

00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
so it's built into the value of the home
 
00:17:54.409 --> 00:17:54.419 align:start position:0%
so with that all that all being said
 
00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your time and I will take
 
00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:01.160 align:start position:0%
questions uh
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:08.029 --> 00:18:08.039 align:start position:0%
uh representative McLean
 
00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:10.140 align:start position:0%
discover how Riders Supply Chain
 
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
Solutions thank you Mr chair and uh nice
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
to see you representative let's Alice
 
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
um just just a quick question under the
 
00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:22.740 align:start position:0%
provisions of this bill how is the
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
responsible party determined how is it
 
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
real I arrived at that this is the
 
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
responsible party and not the another
 
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.450 align:start position:0%
responsible party and not the another
entity

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:34.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
first let me say I didn't realize you
 
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
yeah we we can see you you have an older
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
version of Zoom so we had to promote you
 
00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
the panelists okay if I would have known
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
you were able to see me I would have uh
 
00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:56.780 align:start position:0%
primped up a little bit but but anyway
 
00:19:00.529 --> 00:19:00.539 align:start position:0%
the the uh
 
00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:01.090 align:start position:0%
the the uh
the

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:01.100 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
provisions of the bill don't in the case
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
of saint gobane
 
00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:09.130 align:start position:0%
of saint gobane
away

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:09.140 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
a name that is Infamous here in
 
00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.010 align:start position:0%
a name that is Infamous here in
Litchfield

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
Litchfield
 
00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
that they have they have owned up to
 
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:17.870 align:start position:0%
that they have they have owned up to
their

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
to their pollution
 
00:19:24.409 --> 00:19:24.419 align:start position:0%
in the case of of another party
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
you want to follow up on that
 
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative McLean
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
well yeah I was just I was just
 
00:19:39.529 --> 00:19:39.539 align:start position:0%
wondering is it Des makes that
 
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
determination or is it arrived at
 
00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:43.860 align:start position:0%
through litigations
 
00:19:45.289 --> 00:19:45.299 align:start position:0%
um I think I read in the bill that
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
there's already a provision that the
 
00:19:48.049 --> 00:19:48.059 align:start position:0%
commissioner would make that
 
00:19:48.059 --> 00:19:50.029 align:start position:0%
commissioner would make that
determination

00:19:50.029 --> 00:19:50.039 align:start position:0%
determination
 
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
 
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
project I guess representative the
 
00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:07.460 align:start position:0%
question I have is can can this be done
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
retroactively in other words will the
 
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
law apply to somebody who has done this
 
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
in the past as opposed to only
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
prospectively somebody who does it in
 
00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:23.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
well the provision of the bill in this
 
00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:32.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:37.559 align:start position:0%
uh so that would include ones in that
 
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
and I guess as a follow-up question I
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
have on it is
 
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that
 
00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:55.220 align:start position:0%
you've decided what the remedy has to be
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
I'm presuming that this potentially
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
it would seem that
 
00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:06.780 align:start position:0%
a homeowner might have different
 
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
remedies that they might want instead of
 
00:21:12.169 --> 00:21:12.179 align:start position:0%
having water supplied they might want to
 
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
be compensated or have their house taken
 
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
and that they might apply to the court
 
00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:24.500 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:26.820 align:start position:0%
for a different remedy than this
 
00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.190 align:start position:0%
for a different remedy than this
provides

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
provides
 
00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
concerned at all it just has a one
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
specific remedy and not other remedies
 
00:21:36.529 --> 00:21:36.539 align:start position:0%
that might be available to somebody who
 
00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:37.820 align:start position:0%
is harmed
 
00:21:39.909 --> 00:21:39.919 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:42.900 align:start position:0%
well judge I'm not qualified to answer
 
00:21:45.049 --> 00:21:45.059 align:start position:0%
that but uh
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sure it would have to be it would
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
have to be uh
 
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:55.909 align:start position:0%
have to be uh
litigated

00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
are there other questions for
 
00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.350 align:start position:0%
are there other questions for
representative

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
however taking my question
 
00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:11.220 align:start position:0%
I hear that this applies to Litchfield
 
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if it applies to other
 
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
communities across the state if you've
 
00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:17.820 align:start position:0%
talked to anyone any representatives in
 
00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
other communities where this might apply
 
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:21.970 align:start position:0%
other communities where this might apply
um

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:21.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
tell us about that
 
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
although although uh representative and
 
00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
I both represent Litchfield and we do
 
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
have a certain polluter in mind it
 
00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:38.700 align:start position:0%
wasn't meant certainly there are this
 
00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
would also apply to to the Merrimack
 
00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
which is an adjoining community in
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester at Bedford anyone who's
 
00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:51.059 align:start position:0%
polluted but we're not restricting it to
 
00:22:54.409 --> 00:22:54.419 align:start position:0%
just a single polluter any polluter
 
00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:56.940 align:start position:0%
across the state when a when a business
 
00:22:59.630 --> 00:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
comes into the state and they pollute
 
00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
they should be held uh liable for any
 
00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
damages that they do and that's the
 
00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill had a really
 
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
um you know from from God I think other
 
00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:17.529 align:start position:0%
um you know from from God I think other
questions

00:23:17.529 --> 00:23:17.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the testimony today well
 
00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
thank you take care next time I'll dress
 
00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.549 align:start position:0%
thank you take care next time I'll dress
up

00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:25.559 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
the uh that is the only person who
 
00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
signed up are there other people who
 
00:23:42.529 --> 00:23:42.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.510 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
and I see
 
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:10.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:15.649 --> 00:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
um good morning I actually did not
 
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
register to testify on this bill okay I
 
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
thought I saw your hand now nope if I
 
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
did I apologize I may have hit it by
 
00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:27.590 align:start position:0%
did I apologize I may have hit it by
accident

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.770 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
and

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:39.049 --> 00:24:39.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
yes good morning uh Mr chair can you
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:47.220 align:start position:0%
okay I can hear you
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
um my name is for the record my name is
 
00:24:51.409 --> 00:24:51.419 align:start position:0%
Mike wimsat I uh work as serve as
 
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
director of the Des Waste Management
 
00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
Division and I'm here to testify today
 
00:24:58.610 --> 00:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 135 on behalf of the
 
00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:00.350 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 135 on behalf of the
department

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
um the department is not taking a
 
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
position on this bill
 
00:25:06.529 --> 00:25:06.539 align:start position:0%
however upon review of the bill
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
um we did note that we thought it would
 
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
be helpful for committee members to
 
00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
understand what the existing
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
requirements are and how that relative
 
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
to this issue and how they're
 
00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:17.700 align:start position:0%
implemented and also to share some
 
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
concerns regarding some potential
 
00:25:21.169 --> 00:25:21.179 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences that we think
 
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
might be associated with this bill
 
00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
first of all under current law and
 
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
administrative rules parties that are
 
00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:29.940 align:start position:0%
responsible for releases of regulated
 
00:25:31.789 --> 00:25:31.799 align:start position:0%
contaminants that impact a drinking
 
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
water well are required to provide Safe
 
00:25:36.649 --> 00:25:36.659 align:start position:0%
Drinking Water to those impacted
 
00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:38.700 align:start position:0%
residences or businesses
 
00:25:41.149 --> 00:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
and that includes uh providing and
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
paying for bottled water until the more
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
permanent solution can be developed also
 
00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
um in cases where it's uh technically
 
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
and financially feasible to connect to a
 
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
nearby public water system we do see
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
that as the as the superior and
 
00:25:57.529 --> 00:25:57.539 align:start position:0%
preferred alternative because it really
 
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
ensures that the impacted party will
 
00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
have safe clean drinking water for the
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
foreseeable future but living in New
 
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is rural as we are there are
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
lots and lots of residents who are not
 
00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:10.500 align:start position:0%
whose homes and businesses are not
 
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:13.740 align:start position:0%
located near a public water system so in
 
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
those cases there is an opportunity to
 
00:26:18.649 --> 00:26:18.659 align:start position:0%
trying to connect
 
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
public water system to actually put in
 
00:26:24.409 --> 00:26:24.419 align:start position:0%
what we call point of entry treatment
 
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:26.220 align:start position:0%
which I think the bill refers to as
 
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
whole house treatment where a filtration
 
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
full of water coming into the home from
 
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:33.900 align:start position:0%
the well is provided to to remove the
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
contaminant of concern and we need to
 
00:26:39.769 --> 00:26:39.779 align:start position:0%
have that as an option because in many
 
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
cases if a water supply is a public
 
00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
water supply is not nearby the cost of
 
00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:46.860 align:start position:0%
extending a public water system can be
 
00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
very very expensive right now we've been
 
00:26:51.169 --> 00:26:51.179 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of work in the department on
 
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
water line extensions and we're finding
 
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.730 align:start position:0%
water line extensions and we're finding
that

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:54.740 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:57.769 --> 00:26:57.779 align:start position:0%
basically a mile of extending a water
 
00:26:59.810 --> 00:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
main a mile is on the order of a million
 
00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:01.860 align:start position:0%
dollars or more per mile so it's a very
 
00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:04.860 align:start position:0%
expensive endeavor so um
 
00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
and if so if someone does in install
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
in-home treatment
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
the responsible party under current law
 
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
and rules is required to pay for the
 
00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
installation of that treatment as well
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
as paying the ongoing operation and
 
00:27:19.549 --> 00:27:19.559 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the filters or whatever
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
the system might be for the um for the
 
00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
duration of treatment
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
um so we have I guess some concerns
 
00:27:30.169 --> 00:27:30.179 align:start position:0%
about potential anatomic consequences
 
00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
and they're really three that we
 
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:32.630 align:start position:0%
and they're really three that we
identified

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
identified
 
00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
the first one is related to the
 
00:27:37.549 --> 00:27:37.559 align:start position:0%
requirement to install the point of
 
00:27:39.289 --> 00:27:39.299 align:start position:0%
entry treatment
 
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
um if if connection to a public water
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
supply system can be completed within
 
00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
six months and um there's really two
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
reasons we have some concerns about that
 
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
first it's unclear from our read of the
 
00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
bill whether that requirement is
 
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
intended to be a temporary remedy and
 
00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:56.220 align:start position:0%
that in all cases connection to a public
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
water supply system is still going to be
 
00:27:58.559 --> 00:28:00.230 align:start position:0%
water supply system is still going to be
required

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
required
 
00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
um but but we don't think that that's
 
00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:04.020 align:start position:0%
practicable for the reasons stated
 
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
earlier a second when a connection to a
 
00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
public water supply system is determined
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
to be the preferred solution it often
 
00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:13.140 align:start position:0%
takes more than six months to do the
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
necessary design work there may be a
 
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
short extension of the water main and
 
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
then of course the connection from the
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
current to the home and the in-house
 
00:28:23.149 --> 00:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
Plumbing this needed to be done so we
 
00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:24.900 align:start position:0%
think it's very common that it will take
 
00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
more than six months in our experience
 
00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:29.100 align:start position:0%
to connect to a public water supply
 
00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:30.900 align:start position:0%
and the concern we have is that the bill
 
00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:32.700 align:start position:0%
would require them that in-home
 
00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:35.940 align:start position:0%
treatment also be installed and we're
 
00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:37.980 align:start position:0%
concerned that if that were the case in
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
many cases even even if there is a
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
nearby water system it is more expensive
 
00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
to connect to the water system than to
 
00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:46.980 align:start position:0%
install in-home treatment
 
00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:49.140 align:start position:0%
many times responsible parties will
 
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
elect to to
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
to basically select this more expensive
 
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
option because they want to really put a
 
00:28:57.409 --> 00:28:57.419 align:start position:0%
period on their responsibilities they
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
want to they don't want to have a
 
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
long-term lingering administrative and
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
and uh and and caretaking responsibility
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
to uh pay for in a range for uh uh
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
operation maintenance and filter changes
 
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
and that sort of thing so they're
 
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
willing to spend more money up front to
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
put a period on it if you will and you
 
00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:19.140 align:start position:0%
know put in a clear end to their
 
00:29:21.169 --> 00:29:21.179 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to comply
 
00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:23.700 align:start position:0%
so we have a concern that if the if the
 
00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
six-month rule were to be implemented
 
00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
that if they're going to have to put on
 
00:29:30.289 --> 00:29:30.299 align:start position:0%
in-home treatment anyways
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
um that they may just say well we put on
 
00:29:33.289 --> 00:29:33.299 align:start position:0%
in-home treatment we're not going to
 
00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
elect to do a connection to a public
 
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
water system and we think that would be
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
an inferior solution over time for
 
00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:41.940 align:start position:0%
people whose Wells have been impacted
 
00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:43.380 align:start position:0%
um and we think that that requirement
 
00:29:45.289 --> 00:29:45.299 align:start position:0%
might kind of reduce their willingness
 
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
to comply and be be cooperative
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
the second concern we have is that the
 
00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
five years month of monthly water usage
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
bills and we're very familiar with this
 
00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:57.020 align:start position:0%
the agency was intimately involved with
 
00:29:59.870 --> 00:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
you know requiring single Bain to
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
provide Connections in Litchfield and
 
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
Merrimack and Bedford and they spent uh
 
00:30:06.769 --> 00:30:06.779 align:start position:0%
uh tens of millions of dollars to design
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
and Implement that system
 
00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.190 align:start position:0%
and Implement that system
um

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
but I think that it's important to
 
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.730 align:start position:0%
but I think that it's important to
understand

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:14.930 align:start position:0%
understand
um

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:14.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
The Five-Year water bill may be a
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
significant distance Center for parties
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
to comply and part of that is that while
 
00:30:23.149 --> 00:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
we do have a large corporation that had
 
00:30:25.549 --> 00:30:25.559 align:start position:0%
the means to design and Implement and
 
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
construct a water line system for
 
00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
hundreds of homes in Southern New
 
00:30:29.159 --> 00:30:29.990 align:start position:0%
hundreds of homes in Southern New
Hampshire

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
the more common example is a small
 
00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:34.740 align:start position:0%
number of homes impacted by a small
 
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
business or in many cases a municipality
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
and so concern we have is that um when
 
00:30:42.529 --> 00:30:42.539 align:start position:0%
you with those folks we we've
 
00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
manipulating this this requirement these
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
requirements for many years and we
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
actually get pretty good compliance but
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
it is a significant burden for these
 
00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
small businesses or municipalities to
 
00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
comply with the expenses associated with
 
00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
connecting to water or providing in-home
 
00:30:59.149 --> 00:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
treatment and paying for the long-term
 
00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
operation of Maintenance are a
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
significant financial burden if you add
 
00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
on top of that they also have to pay
 
00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
five years of the water bills we're a
 
00:31:09.169 --> 00:31:09.179 align:start position:0%
little bit concerned that some folks
 
00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
just may say well we're going to fight
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
this so we're just not going to be
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
cooperative or we're simply going to
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
walk away because it's just too big of
 
00:31:18.529 --> 00:31:18.539 align:start position:0%
an ask so we are very pleased that we do
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
have a pretty good record of getting
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
responsible parties to comply with the
 
00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
existing requirements and we do have
 
00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:25.380 align:start position:0%
some concerns that adding this
 
00:31:27.889 --> 00:31:27.899 align:start position:0%
additional significant expense
 
00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
um to the to their responsibilities may
 
00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
have the you know the unintended
 
00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
consequence of causing them to be on
 
00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
cooperative so um we're certainly we
 
00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
understand where this bill is coming
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
from and we are certainly be willing to
 
00:31:42.769 --> 00:31:42.779 align:start position:0%
work with the bill sponsors so
 
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
try to address some of the concerns that
 
00:31:47.149 --> 00:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
we've raised uh but we wanted to share
 
00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:49.140 align:start position:0%
that with you this morning and with that
 
00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
I'll uh be happy to take any questions
 
00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
yes representative Silber thank you uh
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:02.220 align:start position:0%
question I noticed that in the on line
 
00:32:05.389 --> 00:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
15 it talks about 14 15 it talks about
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
the installation of a whole house water
 
00:32:09.529 --> 00:32:09.539 align:start position:0%
filter and the maintenance of such
 
00:32:09.539 --> 00:32:10.789 align:start position:0%
filter and the maintenance of such
filter

00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
filter
 
00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
without any standards isn't there some
 
00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:18.179 align:start position:0%
incentive for whoever is the the uh the
 
00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:19.860 align:start position:0%
pro person or the entity that's caused
 
00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
this problem to go out and get the
 
00:32:24.529 --> 00:32:24.539 align:start position:0%
absolute cheapest whole house water
 
00:32:27.169 --> 00:32:27.179 align:start position:0%
filter as opposed to a high-end Reverse
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
Osmosis System
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
well in practice with the contaminants
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
that we're usually dealing with there's
 
00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
usually sort of a presumptive technology
 
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
that will do the job and we do work with
 
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
um the homeowners and the responsible
 
00:32:44.029 --> 00:32:44.039 align:start position:0%
parties to make sure that you know
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
Quality Systems that are capable of
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
treating the effective contaminant of
 
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:50.220 align:start position:0%
the involved contaminants are installed
 
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
we haven't I I would not say that we've
 
00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:55.860 align:start position:0%
experienced that that situation in in in
 
00:32:58.370 --> 00:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
our experience in implementing this are
 
00:33:00.169 --> 00:33:00.179 align:start position:0%
there any rules of the discussion to a
 
00:33:00.179 --> 00:33:01.190 align:start position:0%
there any rules of the discussion to a
follow-up

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
follow up is there any rules of the
 
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
department that set the standards for a
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
whole house water filter that would
 
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
comply with this
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
I don't think there are any rules that
 
00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
are explicit that talk about that I mean
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
basically the rules require that safe
 
00:33:17.389 --> 00:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
alternate water be provided by the
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
responsible party and so what that
 
00:33:21.889 --> 00:33:21.899 align:start position:0%
typically means is that if it's going to
 
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
be in-home treatment if the treatment
 
00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
technology and the equipment be capable
 
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
of effectively treating and there is
 
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
there is a requirement and as part of
 
00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919 align:start position:0%
that operation of Maintenance that the
 
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
responsible party is required to pay for
 
00:33:36.889 --> 00:33:36.899 align:start position:0%
on an ongoing basis that also includes
 
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
sampling of those treated water to make
 
00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
sure that it is being effectively
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
treated so that that does get confirmed
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
through the implementation of these
 
00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.330 align:start position:0%
through the implementation of these
requirements

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
taking my question so when it comes to
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
the determination of responsibility
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
um just to follow up on that a little
 
00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:02.700 align:start position:0%
bit so the commissioner will make the
 
00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:05.700 align:start position:0%
the finding as to who the responsible
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
party is and does that responsible party
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
have a right of of repeal uh in in the
 
00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
system or do they have to go to court to
 
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:16.490 align:start position:0%
do that
yeah

00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:16.500 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
so sure so the um I mean under the bill
 
00:34:22.129 --> 00:34:22.139 align:start position:0%
it does say the commission would make
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
that determination in practice under
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
current law and Rule
 
00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:27.419 align:start position:0%
um these requirements are typically
 
00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
administered through my division the
 
00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
waste management Division and any
 
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
decision that we make in the division is
 
00:34:37.609 --> 00:34:37.619 align:start position:0%
subject to appeal by the uh to be heard
 
00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
before the waste management Council and
 
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:41.940 align:start position:0%
then if the party is unsatisfied with
 
00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:43.980 align:start position:0%
the with the disposition of it by the
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
council they can appeal to the New
 
00:34:47.089 --> 00:34:47.099 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court that's that's
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
how appeals of our division decisions
 
00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:55.370 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:56.750 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
like right now you say this is deferred
 
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
to waste management if this bill went
 
00:35:14.089 --> 00:35:14.099 align:start position:0%
through and then it would be given to
 
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
the commissioner to D redeem that is
 
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
that going to cause problems for you or
 
00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
are you going to have to work together
 
00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:26.460 align:start position:0%
what's that going to do for a change and
 
00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
that the way things are working right
 
00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.089 align:start position:0%
that the way things are working right
now

00:35:29.089 --> 00:35:29.099 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
well that that may be going someplace
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not qualified to comment on I will
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
tell you that lots of statutes um in in
 
00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
state government in New Hampshire do
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
refer to the commissioner of the
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
department but in practice the work of
 
00:35:43.849 --> 00:35:43.859 align:start position:0%
the department gets administered through
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
its divisions and there are explicit as
 
00:35:50.089 --> 00:35:50.099 align:start position:0%
that gets divided up essentially
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
um as those divisions make their
 
00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
decisions the appeals of those decisions
 
00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
typically go through you know in in the
 
00:35:58.849 --> 00:35:58.859 align:start position:0%
case we have three divisions and
 
00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
essentially each one has a council
 
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
associated with it in the appeals of the
 
00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
decisions with some exceptions for
 
00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:07.740 align:start position:0%
specific laws are typically heard by
 
00:36:10.849 --> 00:36:10.859 align:start position:0%
their respective councils so I I I'm not
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
sure the answer to that but I I think
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
there are lots of examples of where the
 
00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
statute cites the commissioner as a way
 
00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
of describing the department but in
 
00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
practice the the decisions that get made
 
00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:23.820 align:start position:0%
get made at the division level and the
 
00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
appeals of those decisions go through
 
00:36:32.329 --> 00:36:32.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:32.339 --> 00:36:33.170 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:33.180 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
yes representative Simpson
 
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
hello thank you for taking my question
 
00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
um how long does it typically take to go
 
00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:44.820 align:start position:0%
through the process from start to finish
 
00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:51.300 align:start position:0%
well I I would say that it varies you
 
00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:52.980 align:start position:0%
know and part of it depends upon the
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
level of cooperation by the responsible
 
00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:55.790 align:start position:0%
level of cooperation by the responsible
party

00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
party
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
um if we if we take out if we assume
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
that we've already identified a
 
00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
responsible party and that they they
 
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
have accepted that they are a
 
00:37:04.849 --> 00:37:04.859 align:start position:0%
responsible party once we make a request
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
or once we I guess the thing that
 
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
happens immediately is if we typically
 
00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
what happens is we we identify that we
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
have contaminated groundwater somewhere
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
and we look around to see what
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
residential or businesses Wells might be
 
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
impacted and we immediately go out we
 
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
either require the responsible party or
 
00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:23.940 align:start position:0%
we go out and do the sampling to to see
 
00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
if those Wells are impacted once we
 
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
identify that a well is impacted above
 
00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.450 align:start position:0%
identify that a well is impacted above
standards

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:31.380 align:start position:0%
um we basically require that bottle of
 
00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
water be provided immediately to the
 
00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:34.740 align:start position:0%
people who are impacted so that
 
00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
generally happens very very quickly
 
00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
um but once that happens we also say
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
well now that you've got bottled water
 
00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:42.180 align:start position:0%
and you've addressed the immediate
 
00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
concern about the Wild Water being over
 
00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
standards you now need to provide
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
alternate water under the law and so
 
00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
then that you know first thing to do is
 
00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
look around and say well is there a
 
00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
public water system that can easily be
 
00:37:56.329 --> 00:37:56.339 align:start position:0%
connected to the home
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
um and if that happens if the answer to
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
that is yes that often takes several
 
00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:01.260 align:start position:0%
months because it means that now you've
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
got to get an engineer to concise well
 
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
where is the water line do we have to do
 
00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:07.380 align:start position:0%
a short water line extension we need to
 
00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:09.180 align:start position:0%
design uh you know figure out how we're
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
going to run from the curb stop through
 
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
the home through the property
 
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
um to the home and then get contractors
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
on board to do that so if everyone's
 
00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
really Cooperative you can do that in a
 
00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:21.300 align:start position:0%
couple of two in probably two to six
 
00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:23.220 align:start position:0%
months I would say
 
00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:24.780 align:start position:0%
um if there isn't cooperation then
 
00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:27.060 align:start position:0%
obviously it gets delayed in other cases
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
we you know I guess if we take the sink
 
00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:31.980 align:start position:0%
of an example that was a huge water line
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
project that was many many miles of the
 
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
water main that had to go through a
 
00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
process success of design reviewing the
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
whole route you know an engineering
 
00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
design and then going out to bid and
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
getting contractors it took a couple
 
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
years from the time that we and again
 
00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
single Mains was a little complicated
 
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
because we were negotiating with them a
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
huge project they were going to spend a
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
whole lot of money to address a whole
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
lot of wells and we were still
 
00:38:58.490 --> 00:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
collecting data from Wells we're still
 
00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
collecting data from Wells today because
 
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
the water line projects that occurred
 
00:39:06.109 --> 00:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
um in the in the early going as a result
 
00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:07.740 align:start position:0%
of that project were based on the
 
00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:09.660 align:start position:0%
standard of 70 parts per trillion for
 
00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:11.940 align:start position:0%
the contaminant of concern but last
 
00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
summer our standard was lower for the
 
00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:16.740 align:start position:0%
same contaminant to 12 parts per
 
00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
trillion so now they're doing further
 
00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
sampling to evaluate Wells that that are
 
00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
impacted so that that's kind of a that's
 
00:39:25.849 --> 00:39:25.859 align:start position:0%
an outsized project that perhaps is not
 
00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:28.079 align:start position:0%
a good example if you set that aside
 
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's very unusual in our program we
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
didn't have anything like that I mean we
 
00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:34.140 align:start position:0%
had over 65 square miles of Aqua for
 
00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
impacted by that site which is just
 
00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:37.380 align:start position:0%
unheard of in the state
 
00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
more typically we're talking about you
 
00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
know one to ten homes that may be
 
00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
impacted by a contaminated site so but
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
even for that if you had a water system
 
00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
that was nearby but not already right in
 
00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
front of the street in front of the
 
00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
homes there would be several months you
 
00:39:56.109 --> 00:39:56.119 align:start position:0%
know perhaps a year even involved in
 
00:39:59.089 --> 00:39:59.099 align:start position:0%
designing the uh the water line and then
 
00:40:00.589 --> 00:40:00.599 align:start position:0%
going out to bids and getting it
 
00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:03.180 align:start position:0%
construction so probably you know eight
 
00:40:05.329 --> 00:40:05.339 align:start position:0%
months to two years for a significant
 
00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from Mr
 
00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.490 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from Mr
Wilson

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
Wilson
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
had the sponsor of this bill
 
00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
um consulted with you on the writing of
 
00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
the Bill of the drafting of the bill
 
00:40:34.849 --> 00:40:34.859 align:start position:0%
no I don't believe that the department
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
had any Communications with the
 
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
sponsored service okay thank you
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
seeing then thank you Mr wimsat for your
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you
 
00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh the next person I see with their hand
 
00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:58.730 --> 00:40:58.740 align:start position:0%
hi good morning uh thank you for letting
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
me speak David Greer I am director of
 
00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
public policy at the business and
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
industry Association uh Bia uh sorry I
 
00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:09.660 align:start position:0%
couldn't uh sign up in time to get on
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
the official list uh thank you for
 
00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
letting me speak now uh so Bia is
 
00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:16.079 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill
 
00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
um because of a number of issues that we
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
see that present uh unfair burdens thank
 
00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:24.290 align:start position:0%
see that present uh unfair burdens thank
you

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
first and I think probably the the most
 
00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:30.180 align:start position:0%
glaring issue that we have uh has kind
 
00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:32.700 align:start position:0%
of alluded to earlier is that the bill
 
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
states that whenever the commissioner
 
00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
finds that a public or private
 
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
Corporation or other entity has violated
 
00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:41.460 align:start position:0%
the provisions of this chapter uh that's
 
00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
when they become subject uh the issue
 
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
with this is that it allows the
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services to
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
conduct their own investigation
 
00:41:53.109 --> 00:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
determine what has happened and then
 
00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
issue a violation and a remedy require a
 
00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:00.180 align:start position:0%
remedy without any due process so
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
there's no adjudicative proceeding uh
 
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:05.460 align:start position:0%
before any of that occurs
 
00:42:07.609 --> 00:42:07.619 align:start position:0%
um you know as alluded to before by Mr
 
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:10.980 align:start position:0%
wimsat if the business uh doesn't like
 
00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
the outcome of that they have to then
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
appeal uh and if they don't like that
 
00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:16.140 align:start position:0%
they have to appeal again to the Supreme
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
Court so there's no due process before
 
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
um the violation is found uh
 
00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:23.450 align:start position:0%
um the violation is found uh
additionally

00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:23.460 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:24.470 align:start position:0%
additionally
um

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh has also alluded to the six-month
 
00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
requirements in the bill uh is pretty
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
unrealistic for a lot of areas in New
 
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it would be tight even if they
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
are close uh to a public or private
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
water supply system so that would make
 
00:42:43.849 --> 00:42:43.859 align:start position:0%
it pretty uh close to Impossible in many
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
situations for businesses
 
00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:48.050 align:start position:0%
situations for businesses
um

00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
what else um
 
00:42:53.089 --> 00:42:53.099 align:start position:0%
there's also uh the issue where
 
00:42:56.089 --> 00:42:56.099 align:start position:0%
running a private uh well in your house
 
00:42:59.210 --> 00:42:59.220 align:start position:0%
is at not free it does actually have
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
costs associated it with maintenance and
 
00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:04.500 align:start position:0%
I think alluded to electricity bills
 
00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:07.140 align:start position:0%
this bill does not account for the
 
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
difference between what you would
 
00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:11.220 align:start position:0%
normally pay for your water on a private
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
system versus the water bills that would
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
be part of a public or private water
 
00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:18.740 align:start position:0%
supply system
 
00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
so those are just a few of you know the
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
bigger issues that we saw that would
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
create unfair burdens on New Hampshire
 
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
businesses so we appreciate you letting
 
00:43:32.569 --> 00:43:32.579 align:start position:0%
us provide our testimony and I'd be
 
00:43:35.569 --> 00:43:35.579 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
yeah are there any questions
 
00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
from the members
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions thank you for your
 
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
testimony today thank you

next person with their hand up is
 
00:43:56.089 --> 00:43:56.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%

support of house bill 135.
 
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
as time has gone by researchers are
 
00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
finding that these forever chemicals are
 
00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:20.300 align:start position:0%
causing more and more harm to people
 
00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:22.980 align:start position:0%
they have found potential adverse Health
 
00:44:25.569 --> 00:44:25.579 align:start position:0%
impacts associated with pfas exposure
 
00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:29.240 align:start position:0%
including liver damage thyroid damage

00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
also these chemicals can pass through
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
the placental barrier thus passing to
 
00:44:43.849 --> 00:44:43.859 align:start position:0%
The Unborn and can be passed through

00:44:47.569 --> 00:44:47.579 align:start position:0%
Merrimack and the surrounding
 
00:44:49.309 --> 00:44:49.319 align:start position:0%
communities of Bedford Litchfield and
 
00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
Londonderry have been dealing with the
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
pfas contamination issues in the
 
00:44:56.089 --> 00:44:56.099 align:start position:0%
surrounding areas of Saint gobain
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
performance Plastics since 2016. this
 
00:45:02.050 --> 00:45:02.060 align:start position:0%
contamination has been found in our air
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
soil drinking water surface water and
 
00:45:06.599 --> 00:45:07.970 align:start position:0%

groundwater

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:07.980 align:start position:0%
groundwater
 
00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
we have had to deal with our private
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
Wells and our town being deemed unusable
 
00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
along with the wells belonging to the
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
Merrimack Village District which
 
00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:19.140 align:start position:0%
supplies the water to merrimat and being
 
00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
shut down for high contamination rates
 
00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
some private well owners have been
 
00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
hooked up to public water but many are
 
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
still receiving bottled water after five
 
00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:34.740 align:start position:0%
years with no insight as to when they
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
will have any remediation
 
00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
I speak in favor of House Bill 135 today
 
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
especially regarding section three if
 
00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
the connection required in paragraph one
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
cannot be made in six months or less the
 
00:45:50.569 --> 00:45:50.579 align:start position:0%
public or private Corporation individual
 
00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:53.220 align:start position:0%
partnership and or other entities shall
 
00:45:55.370 --> 00:45:55.380 align:start position:0%
pay for the installation of a whole
 
00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
house filter and maintenance of such
 
00:45:59.930 --> 00:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
filter people with contaminated wells
 
00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
should not have to make do and live on
 
00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
bottled water for five years or more
 
00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:07.980 align:start position:0%
waiting for a corporation to make a
 
00:46:10.609 --> 00:46:10.619 align:start position:0%
decision understand that this means
 
00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
storing and disposing of pallets of
 
00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:15.660 align:start position:0%
water bottles when delivered
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
timely action needs to happen so that
 
00:46:20.809 --> 00:46:20.819 align:start position:0%
the water coming out of their faucets is
 
00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:22.740 align:start position:0%
clean and drinkable
 
00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:26.700 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible again thank you for
 
00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions for
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:38.089 --> 00:46:38.099 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:46.849 --> 00:46:46.859 align:start position:0%
there is someone whose name is Laureen
 
00:46:50.089 --> 00:46:50.099 align:start position:0%
who has their hand up and wishes to
 
00:46:50.099 --> 00:46:51.849 align:start position:0%
who has their hand up and wishes to
speak

00:46:51.849 --> 00:46:51.859 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
hi good morning
 
00:46:56.809 --> 00:46:56.819 align:start position:0%
um thank you Barbara for speaking um I
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
was listening I hadn't signed up to
 
00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
speak for this bill but I was kind of
 
00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
surprised because here in Merrimack we
 
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
have a rep Jose sponsor a co-sponsor
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
this bill she's not present and I
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
thought she would be giving a little bit
 
00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:13.140 align:start position:0%
more of the Merrimack story and I also
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
have a rep who I believe is part of this
 
00:47:18.109 --> 00:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
committee who is not present so given
 
00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
that I felt compelled to speak so I
 
00:47:23.089 --> 00:47:23.099 align:start position:0%
wrote in support of this bill could you
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
could you just identify yourself first
 
00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
so we know who you are so sorry I'm so
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
sorry it's just that kind of morning
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
isn't it Laureen Allen I'm a Merrimack
 
00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
resident of many many years I'm also the
 
00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:35.700 align:start position:0%
co-founder of Merrimack citizens for
 
00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
clean water which brings citizens and
 
00:47:41.089 --> 00:47:41.099 align:start position:0%
legislators and town people and or water
 
00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:42.660 align:start position:0%
department all together to talk about
 
00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
this problem as we've done since 2016.
 
00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
many of you are familiar we've been all
 
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
over the news so um my thoughts on this
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
bill is when I read it you know it's a
 
00:47:55.069 --> 00:47:55.079 align:start position:0%
good attempt I I can see the intent it's
 
00:47:56.690 --> 00:47:56.700 align:start position:0%
far from perfect the six months as
 
00:47:59.089 --> 00:47:59.099 align:start position:0%
Barbara said it's not realistic
 
00:48:01.609 --> 00:48:01.619 align:start position:0%
um The Five-Year you know it's almost
 
00:48:03.530 --> 00:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
like a wish list Stick it to him wish
 
00:48:05.569 --> 00:48:05.579 align:start position:0%
list but my point is
 
00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
um we need to find a way to work with
 
00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:48:11.089 --> 00:48:11.099 align:start position:0%
um maybe to amend it because the point
 
00:48:11.099 --> 00:48:11.930 align:start position:0%
um maybe to amend it because the point
is

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:11.940 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
um responsibility
 
00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:16.740 align:start position:0%
so senko Bain has always promoted all
 
00:48:18.349 --> 00:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
the things they've done but what you
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
don't hear is there's been this
 
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
continual pushback this denial of
 
00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:25.140 align:start position:0%
responsibility for both public Wells and
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
private Wells uh in October 2019
 
00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:31.740 align:start position:0%
seven to eight hundred Wells were
 
00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
identified as their responsibility those
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
homes are the latest chapter of homes
 
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
that are without remediation plan uh
 
00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:43.740 align:start position:0%
last month over 300 more private Wells
 
00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:46.740 align:start position:0%
were just added primarily in Bedford in
 
00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:51.060 align:start position:0%
Londonderry so we have over 1100 maybe
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
1300 at least Wells that they have on
 
00:48:57.890 --> 00:48:57.900 align:start position:0%
the list at this point there is no plan
 
00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
in sight we have asked them in a
 
00:49:02.809 --> 00:49:02.819 align:start position:0%
community advisory committee meeting a
 
00:49:05.089 --> 00:49:05.099 align:start position:0%
rough timeline anything and they say
 
00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
things like we're still assessing the
 
00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
situation so it's very frustrating to
 
00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:11.700 align:start position:0%
Residents and my goal here is just to
 
00:49:13.609 --> 00:49:13.619 align:start position:0%
speak for all these people because
 
00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
maybe they don't know how to log on or
 
00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
that this process is even taking place I
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
try to inform them but It's Tricky so
 
00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:23.220 align:start position:0%
this this bill
 
00:49:25.609 --> 00:49:25.619 align:start position:0%
um in theory seeks to send a message
 
00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
that we do expect not only
 
00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:30.180 align:start position:0%
responsibility for What the residents
 
00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
did not cause we know who caused this
 
00:49:35.569 --> 00:49:35.579 align:start position:0%
problem in this particular area but in a
 
00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
timely manner to fix this to connect
 
00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
these folks to a safe drinking water
 
00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
supply there are people one family I
 
00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
heard from gets hundreds of gallons of
 
00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
bottled water every month the Plastics
 
00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:51.380 align:start position:0%
the storage the disposal it's absolutely
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
not okay for people to live like this
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
for so many years currently there is a
 
00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
vast vast area of contention that they
 
00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
are reducing liability by stating that
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
they don't want to take responsibility
 
00:50:08.809 --> 00:50:08.819 align:start position:0%
for hundreds more Wells so again this
 
00:50:11.089 --> 00:50:11.099 align:start position:0%
bill is less than perfect uh Mike
 
00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:12.900 align:start position:0%
brought out some very good points
 
00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
Barbara out another point but I think
 
00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:18.660 align:start position:0%
you know I would ask that perhaps you
 
00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
work with it and you look at this and
 
00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
reach out and um and find a bill that
 
00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
you can put forward that sends a message
 
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
to responsible parties that we expect
 
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
them in some what of a timely matter you
 
00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
know Mike said two to six months uh a
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
project could be complete a good example
 
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
of that is Amherst uh in 2016 a company
 
00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
named TCI a competitor of Saint Cobain
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
also working in fabric coding was deemed
 
00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
responsible for over a hundred private
 
00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:51.300 align:start position:0%
Wells they were hooked up to pennichuck
 
00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
water in a very very Swift manner here
 
00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:56.700 align:start position:0%
in Merrimack Bedford Litchfield
 
00:50:59.690 --> 00:50:59.700 align:start position:0%
Londonderry parts of Hudson parts of
 
00:51:03.049 --> 00:51:03.059 align:start position:0%
Manchester hundreds of homeowners are
 
00:51:05.809 --> 00:51:05.819 align:start position:0%
still waiting and we have no commitment
 
00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
to a plan thank you
 
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:10.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today are
 
00:51:14.329 --> 00:51:14.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative Chase
 
00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question at this point has
 
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
anything been resolved with any of the
 
00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
well save in the first seven eight
 
00:51:32.530 --> 00:51:32.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:35.569 --> 00:51:35.579 align:start position:0%
to help the situation right now in in
 
00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:37.140 align:start position:0%
the Merrimack area
 
00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
Des is awaiting Saint Albans
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
um analysis of the data is what we've
 
00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:44.220 align:start position:0%
heard month after month after month so
 
00:51:47.809 --> 00:51:47.819 align:start position:0%
in October in 2019 we had the new mcls
 
00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:50.700 align:start position:0%
in the state which put pfoa at 12 parts
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
per trillion which was fabulous uh what
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
happened at the end of that year uh by
 
00:51:58.609 --> 00:51:58.619 align:start position:0%
December 31st Sanko Bain sent out a
 
00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
notice to the state saying that they
 
00:52:03.049 --> 00:52:03.059 align:start position:0%
were stopping their investigation and
 
00:52:05.089 --> 00:52:05.099 align:start position:0%
stopping their water sampling so
 
00:52:07.609 --> 00:52:07.619 align:start position:0%
everything came to a halt because the
 
00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
mcls as you may recall were challenged
 
00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:13.020 align:start position:0%
in court and the judge put a stay so our
 
00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
Senate did work on that issue last
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
summer thankfully and they have just
 
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
recently picked up
 
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
um you know so they spent over a year
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
doing absolutely nothing when they knew
 
00:52:25.309 --> 00:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
they knew what they were going to have
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
to do so the issue is you know I'm not a
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
real big believer in overly you know
 
00:52:31.549 --> 00:52:31.559 align:start position:0%
we're New Hampshire we don't want to
 
00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:33.300 align:start position:0%
kill people with laws we all agree on
 
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
that but um they have too much wiggle
 
00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
room here
 
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
uh and this can go on at least all of
 
00:52:41.329 --> 00:52:41.339 align:start position:0%
this year I think we're looking at well
 
00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
into 2022 before they have an action
 
00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:45.540 align:start position:0%
plan and then it's going to be another
 
00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:47.220 align:start position:0%
year before they start to implement it
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
so that two to six months you know has
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
been done in the past the original round
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
in Merrimack back in 2017 they pushed
 
00:52:59.210 --> 00:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
that out two years before they worked on
 
00:53:01.549 --> 00:53:01.559 align:start position:0%
it and we had 45 homes with private
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
wells in this town that weren't even on
 
00:53:06.109 --> 00:53:06.119 align:start position:0%
the list despite Des stating clearly
 
00:53:07.849 --> 00:53:07.859 align:start position:0%
desanko Bane that they were their
 
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility those homeowners were not
 
00:53:13.089 --> 00:53:13.099 align:start position:0%
hooked up to public water till early
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
2020. absolutely not acceptable so our
 
00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:19.140 align:start position:0%
journey has been if you knew it you'd be
 
00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:25.370 align:start position:0%
journey has been if you knew it you'd be
astonished

00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:28.849 --> 00:53:28.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:31.069 --> 00:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
saying none again thank you for your
 
00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:37.730 --> 00:53:37.740 align:start position:0%
and I don't see any other hands up
 
00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:42.300 align:start position:0%
people to testify
 
00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
though I will call the uh I will close
 
00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:49.740 align:start position:0%
the hearing on House Bill 135.
 
00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
I would note that
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
there were nine then 91 people who did
 
00:53:58.490 --> 00:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
sign up in support of the bill
 
00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:01.980 align:start position:0%
and only two people who signed up in
 
00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
we just have a couple of minutes and
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
we'll call the hearing together on our
 
00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:02.809 --> 00:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
I will just know before we begin on
 
00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
House Bill 236
 
00:56:38.809 --> 00:56:38.819 align:start position:0%
that on this bill there were 99 people
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
who signed up and support and 11 people
 
00:56:45.170 --> 00:56:45.180 align:start position:0%
who signed up in opposition
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
we do have eight people who have signed
 
00:56:50.089 --> 00:56:50.099 align:start position:0%
up to testify
 
00:56:52.609 --> 00:56:52.619 align:start position:0%
and none has asked for more than five
 
00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
minutes so I will do my best to hold
 
00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:57.660 align:start position:0%
them to the five minute
 
00:57:09.609 --> 00:57:09.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
and I'll call the hearing to order on
 
00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:15.180 align:start position:0%
House Bill 236.
 
00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
this is an act creating a statute of
 
00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:19.980 align:start position:0%
limitation on civil actions relative to
 
00:57:24.069 --> 00:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
damage caused by parafloric
 
00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
alkyl and poly
 
00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
oral alkyl substances
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
the primary sponsor is representative
 
00:57:36.109 --> 00:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
Vale as representative Vale
 
00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:39.180 align:start position:0%
available to testify
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
yes I am can you hear me as well thank

you okay great thank you good morning Mr
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of members of the
 
00:57:50.329 --> 00:57:50.339 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee thank you for your
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
consideration of House Bill 236 this
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
bill was previously filed and had broad
 
00:57:59.210 --> 00:57:59.220 align:start position:0%
support in the house last year it never
 
00:58:01.069 --> 00:58:01.079 align:start position:0%
made it to the Senate due to the state
 
00:58:03.309 --> 00:58:03.319 align:start position:0%
of emergency
 
00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:06.180 align:start position:0%
pfas chemicals are groups of thousands
 
00:58:08.829 --> 00:58:08.839 align:start position:0%
of compounds that are biocumulative
 
00:58:11.809 --> 00:58:11.819 align:start position:0%
environmentally persistent they are used
 
00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
to repel water and oil by an industry
 
00:58:17.650 --> 00:58:17.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
non-stick Coatings such as Teflon and
 
00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
waterproof Fabrics such as Gore-Tex and
 
00:58:26.569 --> 00:58:26.579 align:start position:0%
also the creation of firefighting
 
00:58:30.109 --> 00:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
turnout gear and firefighting foam these
 
00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
compounds pres are also present in
 
00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
carpeting food packaging and many other
 
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
products that require water to be
 
00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:38.150 align:start position:0%
products that require water to be
repelled

00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
repelled
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
because of the slippery nature of these
 
00:58:44.210 --> 00:58:44.220 align:start position:0%
particles they quickly enter the soil
 
00:58:46.849 --> 00:58:46.859 align:start position:0%
they do not dissolve and they're called
 
00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
Forever chemicals for that reason the
 
00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
town abiding my district is in Nashua
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
um is within a
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
has within it a zone of contamination
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
where pfas is present
 
00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:04.020 align:start position:0%
this is presently
 
00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
a 4.5 mile radius around the
 
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
saint-gobain performance plastic plant
 
00:59:12.770 --> 00:59:12.780 align:start position:0%
on DW Highway in Merrimack people who
 
00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:14.940 align:start position:0%
live within the zone are not able to use
 
00:59:16.849 --> 00:59:16.859 align:start position:0%
drinking water from their well or from
 
00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
certain Municipal Wells that are
 
00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:21.180 align:start position:0%
currently being upgraded with filtration
 
00:59:24.970 --> 00:59:24.980 align:start position:0%
systems in longitudinal studies evidence
 
00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:28.260 align:start position:0%
implicates that pfas impacts fetal
 
00:59:30.289 --> 00:59:30.299 align:start position:0%
development increases risk of
 
00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:32.579 align:start position:0%
Developmental and endocrine disorders
 
00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:35.540 align:start position:0%
where home hormones depression occurs

polluters are seeking permission to keep

01:00:49.849 --> 01:00:49.859 align:start position:0%
polluters have somehow been able to
 
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
manipulate and dominate the EPA for
 
01:00:55.549 --> 01:00:55.559 align:start position:0%
varying weeks of time over many decades
 
01:00:59.030 --> 01:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
this allows manufacturing with pfas to

continue with no end in sight
 
01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
why expand the statute of limitations we
 
01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:07.740 align:start position:0%
need more time
 
01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
to calculate the scope of harm that has
 
01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
been done to townspeople and to address
 
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
impact on specific vulnerable groups
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
such as elderly children pregnant women
 
01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
and women who are nursing this is
 
01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:20.940 align:start position:0%
particularly important due to the
 
01:01:24.010 --> 01:01:24.020 align:start position:0%
latency of illness onset
 
01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:27.420 align:start position:0%

Hampshire
 
01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:34.140 align:start position:0%
to protect municipalities from bearing
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
the cost and health effects of
 
01:01:37.849 --> 01:01:37.859 align:start position:0%
industrial pollution
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
to delineate a true zone of
 
01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
contamination defined by a perimeter of
 
01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
Wells that are clear of toxic levels of
 
01:01:48.829 --> 01:01:48.839 align:start position:0%
pfas in other words levels that are
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
within the current allowable maximum
 
01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
contaminant level
 
01:01:55.789 --> 01:01:55.799 align:start position:0%
and also to provide vital education to
 
01:01:58.010 --> 01:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
Citizens and medical providers of this
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
region and to help them understand how
 
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
to reduce harm and evaluate individual
 
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
extent for future care
 
01:02:07.789 --> 01:02:07.799 align:start position:0%
before I close I want to say that the
 
01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:09.660 align:start position:0%
most impelling argument and support of
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is a position that our
 
01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
nation's nation's firefighters are now
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
in due to pfas exposure in their turnout
 
01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:20.700 align:start position:0%
gear and firefighting foam
 
01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
we have one million one hundred and
 
01:02:25.490 --> 01:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand firefighters in the
 
01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
United States we have thousands of fire
 
01:02:30.770 --> 01:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
stations in America and we have not
 
01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
begun to test and to study and to begin
 
01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:35.150 align:start position:0%
begun to test and to study and to begin
remediation

01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
remediation
 
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
with the exception of
 
01:02:40.730 --> 01:02:40.740 align:start position:0%
the um the site at the former peace Air
 
01:02:43.549 --> 01:02:43.559 align:start position:0%
Force Base which was addressed through
 
01:02:45.890 --> 01:02:45.900 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense funds
 
01:02:48.289 --> 01:02:48.299 align:start position:0%
there is a long way to go before we know
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
what is needed and who it who needs it
 
01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
especially we when we consider the cost
 
01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
of the camp contamination and for that
 
01:02:59.150 --> 01:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
reason we'd like to
 
01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
extend the pfas injury to six years the
 
01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:05.960 align:start position:0%
statute at this time
 
01:03:08.990 --> 01:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative Maureen Mooney is also
 
01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:11.220 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak and she will be
 
01:03:13.849 --> 01:03:13.859 align:start position:0%
arriving after she presents her bill in
 
01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:15.180 align:start position:0%
another committee
 
01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:17.700 align:start position:0%
so I would ask that you please
 
01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:18.530 align:start position:0%
so I would ask that you please
um

01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
be aware that she'll be coming in late
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
with that I will take any questions you
 
01:03:26.030 --> 01:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
may have but I in part that the
 
01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
following speakers
 
01:03:30.349 --> 01:03:30.359 align:start position:0%
may be about to address the questions in
 
01:03:33.049 --> 01:03:33.059 align:start position:0%
their testimony and if not may be able
 
01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
to answer your questions with better
 
01:03:37.849 --> 01:03:37.859 align:start position:0%
death and as I said I'd be happy to take
 
01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
any questions you may have
 
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Alexander do
 
01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:45.650 --> 01:03:45.660 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
representative Vale for taking my
 
01:03:46.799 --> 01:03:47.510 align:start position:0%
representative Vale for taking my
question

01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned this past
 
01:03:51.289 --> 01:03:51.299 align:start position:0%
um the house last year can you just give
 
01:03:55.490 --> 01:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:58.490 --> 01:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
I don't actually have the bill number
 
01:04:01.549 --> 01:04:01.559 align:start position:0%
right here I it was not my bill it was
 
01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:10.849 --> 01:04:10.859 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Kenny
 
01:04:12.410 --> 01:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:17.460 align:start position:0%
um so you you made the case that uh the
 
01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
statue of limitation should be increased
 
01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:20.940 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry if I missed it uh what is
 
01:04:23.809 --> 01:04:23.819 align:start position:0%
the current statute of limitations
 
01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
as in any personal injury
 
01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:29.220 align:start position:0%
if we would assume that it would be
 
01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:30.780 align:start position:0%
three years
 
01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:31.430 align:start position:0%
three years
um

01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:35.690 --> 01:04:35.700 align:start position:0%
as as any other personal injury
 
01:04:38.690 --> 01:04:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
you have any other questions for
 
01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:45.660 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:46.910 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
today

01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:49.140 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman and and
 
01:04:51.650 --> 01:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:13.980 align:start position:0%
you may proceed
 
01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:16.380 align:start position:0%
thank you very much my name is
 
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative David Muse I'm from
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth and I'm here today to speak
 
01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
in favor of HB uh 236.
 
01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:25.250 align:start position:0%
in favor of HB uh 236.
um

01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:28.609 --> 01:05:28.619 align:start position:0%
I'm not a lawyer uh but I have seen over
 
01:05:30.289 --> 01:05:30.299 align:start position:0%
the course of my life how our legal
 
01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
system uh definitely can skew in the
 
01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:36.260 align:start position:0%
favor of large well-heeled corporations
 
01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:38.700 align:start position:0%
to the detriment to people who are
 
01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
exposed to contamination that was caused
 
01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:43.260 align:start position:0%
by some of these companies
 
01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
in the late 1960s I lived in Woburn
 
01:05:47.870 --> 01:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts at a time when tap water
 
01:05:50.089 --> 01:05:50.099 align:start position:0%
in our neighborhood turned brown and
 
01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
started smelling like chemicals
 
01:05:53.930 --> 01:05:53.940 align:start position:0%
unlike a lot of the other mothers in the
 
01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
neighborhood my mom absolutely refused
 
01:06:00.049 --> 01:06:00.059 align:start position:0%
to let us drink it we wound up all
 
01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
gaining a little bit of weight over the
 
01:06:03.770 --> 01:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
course of the next two years because we
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
drank a lot of fruit juice that had a
 
01:06:07.490 --> 01:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
lot of sugar in it
 
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
um but these were the 1960s and many of
 
01:06:14.329 --> 01:06:14.339 align:start position:0%
my friends mothers mixed the water with
 
01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
Kool-Aid to hide The Taste and to hide
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
the smell
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
so in my neighborhood kids kept drinking
 
01:06:23.329 --> 01:06:23.339 align:start position:0%
that water and it's the 1970s started to
 
01:06:25.609 --> 01:06:25.619 align:start position:0%
Dawn kids in my neighborhood started to
 
01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
get leukemia
 
01:06:29.329 --> 01:06:29.339 align:start position:0%
the litigation that rose out of the
 
01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
deaths in Woburn was based around
 
01:06:32.930 --> 01:06:32.940 align:start position:0%
allegations that companies disposed of a
 
01:06:36.170 --> 01:06:36.180 align:start position:0%
chemical called tce illegally
 
01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
but in the case of pfas plaintiffs are
 
01:06:41.450 --> 01:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
often trying to recover damages from
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
companies that sold or used these
 
01:06:47.089 --> 01:06:47.099 align:start position:0%
chemicals in the broad light of day for
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
applications like firefighting foam for
 
01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
things like Scotchgard for things that
 
01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:54.660 align:start position:0%
just are part of our everyday lives but
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
they did that with the knowledge that
 
01:06:59.809 --> 01:06:59.819 align:start position:0%
these chemicals were toxic and that they
 
01:07:02.809 --> 01:07:02.819 align:start position:0%
had the potential to to contaminate
 
01:07:02.819 --> 01:07:05.029 align:start position:0%
had the potential to to contaminate
groundwater

01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
groundwater
 
01:07:08.569 --> 01:07:08.579 align:start position:0%
um both tce and pfas can prompt acute
 
01:07:11.329 --> 01:07:11.339 align:start position:0%
reactions when you when you ingest a
 
01:07:14.569 --> 01:07:14.579 align:start position:0%
large amount but pfas is actually more
 
01:07:17.089 --> 01:07:17.099 align:start position:0%
Insidious because extremely small
 
01:07:19.930 --> 01:07:19.940 align:start position:0%
amounts can do a great deal of harm
 
01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
worse as representative Dale mentioned
 
01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
the human body has no way of actually
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
getting rid of pfas once it's been
 
01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:28.010 align:start position:0%
getting rid of pfas once it's been
ingested

01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
ingested
 
01:07:31.309 --> 01:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
so even if you're just dealing with a
 
01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
few parts per trillion uh over time and
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
over a period of years uh a situation
 
01:07:40.010 --> 01:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
arises where you just accumulate more
 
01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
and more and more pfas in your body
 
01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
this is actually why so many people in
 
01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
my community are concerned about the
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
contamination at peace for many years
 
01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
people in Portsmouth and surrounding
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
communities worked at the trade point
 
01:07:55.069 --> 01:07:55.079 align:start position:0%
and brought their kids to daycare there
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
only to learn that the simple Act of
 
01:07:59.210 --> 01:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
drinking water put them at risk for
 
01:08:02.029 --> 01:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
health conditions with timelines that
 
01:08:04.730 --> 01:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
can vary and that sometimes can take
 
01:08:06.410 --> 01:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
years to develop
 
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
in just a few weeks a testing program
 
01:08:10.490 --> 01:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
run by the federal government is going
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
to resume and that's going to let many
 
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
more people know conclusively uh and
 
01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:17.100 align:start position:0%
some of them for the first time what
 
01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
levels of exposure to pfest they
 
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
actually have in the systems and the
 
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
systems of your kids
 
01:08:25.849 --> 01:08:25.859 align:start position:0%
so with HB 236 if these people
 
01:08:27.709 --> 01:08:27.719 align:start position:0%
eventually suffer Health damage as a
 
01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
result of their exposure the clock of
 
01:08:32.410 --> 01:08:32.420 align:start position:0%
litigation wouldn't start from the time
 
01:08:35.689 --> 01:08:35.699 align:start position:0%
when uh the water was first contaminated
 
01:08:37.249 --> 01:08:37.259 align:start position:0%
it would actually start from the date
 
01:08:39.530 --> 01:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
that the plaintiff discovers that he or
 
01:08:41.050 --> 01:08:41.060 align:start position:0%
she has been harmed
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
extending the statute of limitations to
 
01:08:47.329 --> 01:08:47.339 align:start position:0%
six years is also appropriate for a type
 
01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:49.020 align:start position:0%
of chemical exposure where the physical
 
01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
consequences of harm can take years to
 
01:08:54.769 --> 01:08:54.779 align:start position:0%
manifest themselves one of the things
 
01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
that's come to light just recently is
 
01:08:59.930 --> 01:08:59.940 align:start position:0%
that the harm that pfas or some types of
 
01:09:01.610 --> 01:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
pfas can do to your immune system
 
01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
actually make you more vulnerable to
 
01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
cobit so we have people who may be
 
01:09:08.329 --> 01:09:08.339 align:start position:0%
living with a long-term consequences of
 
01:09:10.030 --> 01:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
covet should they catch it
 
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
that may be much more severe than other
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
people might experience and it's because
 
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
their immune system may have been harmed
 
01:09:20.209 --> 01:09:20.219 align:start position:0%
by these chemicals uh to my knowledge at
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
least two other states have passed a
 
01:09:25.010 --> 01:09:25.020 align:start position:0%
similar law and I would love it if you
 
01:09:26.749 --> 01:09:26.759 align:start position:0%
put us on the road to making New
 
01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:29.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh the Third thank you very
 
01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:32.030 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh the Third thank you very
much

01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
01:09:35.090 --> 01:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative Muse
 
01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:36.349 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative Muse
yes

01:09:36.349 --> 01:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:09:38.809 --> 01:09:38.819 align:start position:0%
representative McLean
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
taking my question so in in the the a
 
01:09:47.090 --> 01:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
question asked of the prior speaker was
 
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
um answered in that the statute of
 
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
limitations has gone from three years to
 
01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
six years
 
01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
um but can you answer does the current
 
01:09:58.850 --> 01:09:58.860 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations also begin with
 
01:10:01.729 --> 01:10:01.739 align:start position:0%
discovery of harm or resist something as
 
01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
well that's new with this bill
 
01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
I believe it I believe in the case of
 
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
this bill it begins with a discovery of
 
01:10:10.610 --> 01:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
harm so that's when that's when the
 
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
clock starts uh so for instance with
 
01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:16.010 align:start position:0%
clock starts uh so for instance with
pfas

01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
pfas
 
01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
um one of the issues is you may not know
 
01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:19.980 align:start position:0%
for years that you've actually been
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
exposed you may not feel physical
 
01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:23.270 align:start position:0%
exposed you may not feel physical
symptoms

01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
symptoms
 
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
um but then one day uh uh you wind up
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
going to the doctor uh with it with a
 
01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
condition uh that's making you ill
 
01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
that's making you sick they start
 
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
running some tests and one of the things
 
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
that they discover is not only do you
 
01:10:39.770 --> 01:10:39.780 align:start position:0%
have a condition that's associated with
 
01:10:42.169 --> 01:10:42.179 align:start position:0%
with pfas but you also have high levels
 
01:10:44.090 --> 01:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
of chemicals of these chemicals in your
 
01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
blood what what's different in many
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
cases about pfas exposure is there isn't
 
01:10:52.189 --> 01:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily an immediate toxic reaction
 
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
so unlike the 1960s when when I was
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
living in Woburn and we could actually
 
01:10:59.570 --> 01:10:59.580 align:start position:0%
see the water coming through the Taps
 
01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
was brown and it smelled bad uh and it
 
01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
even it even uh made the sheets that my
 
01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
mother hung out in the clothesline it
 
01:11:10.189 --> 01:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
actually made made them blow apart in
 
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
the wind it would actually deteriorate
 
01:11:14.689 --> 01:11:14.699 align:start position:0%
the uh the materials that the Sheets
 
01:11:16.669 --> 01:11:16.679 align:start position:0%
Were Made of so we could see that it was
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
doing harm and what's Insidious about
 
01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
these chemicals is that in so many cases
 
01:11:24.050 --> 01:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
you can't see the harm that they're
 
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
doing and that and the quantities can be
 
01:11:29.810 --> 01:11:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:33.130 --> 01:11:33.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:35.149 --> 01:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
01:11:37.250 --> 01:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I can see that in the
 
01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
legislation as presented
 
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
um the clock starts ticking with the
 
01:11:44.090 --> 01:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
onset of the harm and the discovery my
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
question was just is that in itself a
 
01:11:49.610 --> 01:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
departure from the existing law
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
um or is that in in in does that go
 
01:11:55.610 --> 01:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
along with where the existing law is
 
01:11:58.729 --> 01:11:58.739 align:start position:0%
already my understanding is that it is
 
01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
but uh that's something I think that I I
 
01:12:05.570 --> 01:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
may not fully understand so uh I would
 
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
suggest asking maybe some of the
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up speakers that question
 
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm not 100 sure so I don't want to
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
give you a flat out yes that it is my
 
01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
assumption is that's the case though
 
01:12:19.370 --> 01:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:21.780 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
 
01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:24.110 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
Muse

01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:26.990 --> 01:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today
 
01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you we also have representative
 
01:12:39.050 --> 01:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
yes I'm available can you hear me we can
 
01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:45.649 --> 01:12:45.659 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
01:12:48.050 --> 01:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee I'm Representative
 
01:12:50.330 --> 01:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
Bob Healey of Merrimack and I am
 
01:12:52.130 --> 01:12:52.140 align:start position:0%
speaking as a co-sponsor and in support
 
01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:54.780 align:start position:0%
of house bill 236.
 
01:12:56.270 --> 01:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
Merrimack and the surrounding
 
01:12:58.250 --> 01:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
communities of Bedford Litchfield and
 
01:12:59.810 --> 01:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
Londonderry have been dealing with the
 
01:13:01.729 --> 01:13:01.739 align:start position:0%
pfas contamination issues in the areas
 
01:13:03.229 --> 01:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
surrounding this a Cobain performance
 
01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
Plastics facility since 2016.
 
01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
this contamination has been found in our
 
01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
air soil ground and drinking water
 
01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
we haven't
 
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
had to deal with the private Wells being
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
deemed unusable and Wells belongings of
 
01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
Merrimack Village District being shut
 
01:13:22.729 --> 01:13:22.739 align:start position:0%
down for high pfas contamination rates
 
01:13:24.649 --> 01:13:24.659 align:start position:0%
while Saint Cobain has agreed to pay
 
01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
thank you public Wells and provide
 
01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
bottled water or connect Wells
 
01:13:36.770 --> 01:13:36.780 align:start position:0%
well owners public water this has been a
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
long and laborious process for those
 
01:13:41.530 --> 01:13:41.540 align:start position:0%
affected people and many are receiving
 
01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
bottled water at this time
 
01:13:46.250 --> 01:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
as time has gone by
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
researchers are finding that these four
 
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
other chemicals are causing more and
 
01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
more harm to people
 
01:13:52.370 --> 01:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
they have found
 
01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
potential adverse Health impacts
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
associated with pfas exposure include
 
01:13:58.850 --> 01:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
liver damage thyroid disease decreased
 
01:14:02.050 --> 01:14:02.060 align:start position:0%
fertility high cholesterol obesity
 
01:14:05.630 --> 01:14:05.640 align:start position:0%
hormones oppression and cancer
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
as further study of Maximum contaminant
 
01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
levels of these chemicals evolves our
 
01:14:11.930 --> 01:14:11.940 align:start position:0%
Citizens need additional time to
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
identify the physical damage to their
 
01:14:13.679 --> 01:14:14.750 align:start position:0%
identify the physical damage to their
bodies

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
bodies
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
protections under the law
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
so today I speak in favor of House Bill
 
01:14:21.229 --> 01:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
236 extending the statute of limitations
 
01:14:23.450 --> 01:14:23.460 align:start position:0%
to six years after the damage is
 
01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
discovered thank you for allowing me to
 
01:14:27.169 --> 01:14:27.179 align:start position:0%
testify today
 
01:14:28.729 --> 01:14:28.739 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions for
 
01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:41.090 --> 01:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
we don't see representative Mooney has
 
01:14:45.050 --> 01:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
so we'll call on the other witnesses
 
01:14:48.970 --> 01:14:48.980 align:start position:0%
that I have
 
01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
is Wendy Thomas available
 
01:15:13.490 --> 01:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
yes I am now
 
01:15:16.370 --> 01:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
can you hear me we can all right thank
 
01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
you uh Mr chair esteemed colleagues of
 
01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary Committee
 
01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh I am former representative Wendy
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
Thomas from Merrimack
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
and I come before you in support of
 
01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
House Bill 236 a bill that will lengthen
 
01:15:32.689 --> 01:15:32.699 align:start position:0%
the statute of limitations for pfas
 
01:15:35.209 --> 01:15:35.219 align:start position:0%
related injuries I just want to clarify
 
01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
one thing before I begin this bill was
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
filed last year while I was a State Rep
 
01:15:42.770 --> 01:15:42.780 align:start position:0%
but it was not heard
 
01:15:44.810 --> 01:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
so um there seems to be a little
 
01:15:47.450 --> 01:15:47.460 align:start position:0%
confusion about that it was filed um in
 
01:15:48.490 --> 01:15:48.500 align:start position:0%
last year
 
01:15:51.770 --> 01:15:51.780 align:start position:0%
this bill arose from participating in
 
01:15:54.530 --> 01:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
and testifying at the hearing for Maine
 
01:15:57.770 --> 01:15:57.780 align:start position:0%
Bill 1544 which extends the statute of
 
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
limitations for pfas related injuries
 
01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
from three years to six years
 
01:16:05.810 --> 01:16:05.820 align:start position:0%
the main bill is based on a
 
01:16:08.090 --> 01:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
recommendation from the governor's pfas
 
01:16:09.890 --> 01:16:09.900 align:start position:0%
task force
 
01:16:12.290 --> 01:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
bill in Maine came about because of a
 
01:16:14.890 --> 01:16:14.900 align:start position:0%
local farmer who used pfas contaminated
 
01:16:17.209 --> 01:16:17.219 align:start position:0%
biosolids which is another name for
 
01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
fertilizer on his farm
 
01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:22.020 align:start position:0%
he didn't know it was in the solids his
 
01:16:24.169 --> 01:16:24.179 align:start position:0%
cows didn't know pfas was in the grass
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
That Grew From the solids and they only
 
01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
realized it when the cow's milk was
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
tested and it was found to contain high
 
01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
levels of pfas
 
01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
the farmer lost his herd his farm and
 
01:16:37.850 --> 01:16:37.860 align:start position:0%
his business because it had been more
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
than three years since he had used the
 
01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
solids and there was no Financial
 
01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:43.010 align:start position:0%
solids and there was no Financial
recourse

01:16:43.010 --> 01:16:43.020 align:start position:0%
recourse
 
01:16:45.530 --> 01:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
many farms and even family gardens in
 
01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
Maine where a sludge had been spread
 
01:16:50.450 --> 01:16:50.460 align:start position:0%
have also not been tested the extent of
 
01:16:52.729 --> 01:16:52.739 align:start position:0%
the damage remains unclear
 
01:16:54.890 --> 01:16:54.900 align:start position:0%
and when they were contaminated is even
 
01:16:56.689 --> 01:16:56.699 align:start position:0%
more unclear
 
01:16:59.810 --> 01:16:59.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire house bill 236 attempts to
 
01:17:02.209 --> 01:17:02.219 align:start position:0%
correct this problem particularly in
 
01:17:04.130 --> 01:17:04.140 align:start position:0%
areas most hard hit with pfas
 
01:17:06.530 --> 01:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
contamination those being the Seacoast
 
01:17:09.890 --> 01:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
and Merrimack it extends a statute of
 
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
limitations for pfas-related injuries
 
01:17:15.290 --> 01:17:15.300 align:start position:0%
only from three to six years
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
the legislation would provide plaintiffs
 
01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:19.980 align:start position:0%
six years to file a lawsuit from the
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
time they knew or should have known that
 
01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
pfas could re could be responsible for
 
01:17:26.930 --> 01:17:26.940 align:start position:0%
their injuries or damages
 
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
before he died The Honorable dick Hench
 
01:17:32.209 --> 01:17:32.219 align:start position:0%
and I worked on the wording of this bill
 
01:17:34.610 --> 01:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
honorable hinge signed on as a
 
01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor living in a pfest impacted
 
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
Community he knew how important it was
 
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
to let science catch up with what was
 
01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:42.410 align:start position:0%
to let science catch up with what was
happening

01:17:42.410 --> 01:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:17:45.169 --> 01:17:45.179 align:start position:0%
when I was not re-elected representative
 
01:17:46.729 --> 01:17:46.739 align:start position:0%
hinch made sure that two other
 
01:17:48.169 --> 01:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
representatives from our town
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored and supported this bill
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
pfas is measured in parts per trillion
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
it bioaccumulates which means that it
 
01:17:57.950 --> 01:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
collects in your body
 
01:17:59.630 --> 01:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
much like the straw that breaks the
 
01:18:02.330 --> 01:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
camel's back too much pfest tips your
 
01:18:05.149 --> 01:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
body over into illness it may take a
 
01:18:08.209 --> 01:18:08.219 align:start position:0%
little bit of time it may take years
 
01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:10.860 align:start position:0%
pfas injuries can also be passed On to
 
01:18:12.169 --> 01:18:12.179 align:start position:0%
the Next Generation
 
01:18:14.450 --> 01:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
babies can be born with learning
 
01:18:17.209 --> 01:18:17.219 align:start position:0%
disabilities and medical illnesses as a
 
01:18:19.010 --> 01:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
result of the mom-drinking contaminated
 
01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:20.940 align:start position:0%
water during pregnancy
 
01:18:23.810 --> 01:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
here's what we do know about pfas there
 
01:18:25.130 --> 01:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
are many thousands of different
 
01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
compounds it is historically released in
 
01:18:30.770 --> 01:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
large quantities pfas chemicals are very
 
01:18:33.770 --> 01:18:33.780 align:start position:0%
mobile through water Pathways pfas is
 
01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:35.940 align:start position:0%
highly persistent in the environment
 
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
he fast degrades into more toxic forms
 
01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
pfas bioaccumulates in plants and
 
01:18:44.689 --> 01:18:44.699 align:start position:0%
animals but there is so much more that
 
01:18:46.010 --> 01:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
we don't know
 
01:18:49.370 --> 01:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
there are over 6 000 pfas chemicals
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
towns that have had Water Supplies
 
01:18:54.410 --> 01:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
contaminated by pfas may not have the
 
01:18:56.689 --> 01:18:56.699 align:start position:0%
testing of it available to identify all
 
01:18:58.130 --> 01:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
of what is in the water
 
01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
yes but we are getting there
 
01:19:03.290 --> 01:19:03.300 align:start position:0%
I would like to see no statute of
 
01:19:05.209 --> 01:19:05.219 align:start position:0%
limitations for injuries resulting for
 
01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
forever chemicals in our bodies as the
 
01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
result of industrial pollution but this
 
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
bill has my support nonetheless because
 
01:19:14.209 --> 01:19:14.219 align:start position:0%
we need more time than what is being
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
offered right now
 
01:19:18.530 --> 01:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
this bill allows science to catch up to
 
01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:21.300 align:start position:0%
the situation it buys us the necessary
 
01:19:23.450 --> 01:19:23.460 align:start position:0%
time so that damage can be properly
 
01:19:25.610 --> 01:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
assessed and polluters can be held
 
01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
accountable for their actions and the
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
impact of those actions on our lives
 
01:19:32.209 --> 01:19:32.219 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
are there questions for uh former
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
see none thank you for your testimony
 
01:19:43.729 --> 01:19:43.739 align:start position:0%
today thank you
 
01:19:51.190 --> 01:19:51.200 align:start position:0%

want to thank the panel for allowing me
 
01:20:05.090 --> 01:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:09.050 --> 01:20:09.060 align:start position:0%

you folks hear me okay
 
01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
I think we were getting some background
 
01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
noise in your call
 
01:20:33.090 --> 01:20:33.100 align:start position:0%
um is it any better now
 
01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:35.149 align:start position:0%
um is it any better now

01:20:36.890 --> 01:20:36.900 align:start position:0%
we're getting a little bit of echo but I
 
01:20:38.330 --> 01:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
think we can hear you if you want to
 
01:20:41.630 --> 01:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
testify yes sir I'd like to testify if
 
01:20:44.930 --> 01:20:44.940 align:start position:0%
you can't hear me well I can redial back
 
01:20:47.810 --> 01:20:47.820 align:start position:0%
in shall I try down

that creating a statute of limitations

on civil actions relative to pfas
 
01:21:48.649 --> 01:21:48.659 align:start position:0%
I want to express my wholehearted
 
01:21:51.169 --> 01:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
support for this bill
 
01:21:53.630 --> 01:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
to give you some background on my
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
involvement with this bill the late
 
01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:00.300 align:start position:0%
speaker dick hinch ask that I work with
 
01:22:03.070 --> 01:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
the Merrimack citizens for clean water
 
01:22:07.010 --> 01:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
on two legislative issues
 
01:22:09.709 --> 01:22:09.719 align:start position:0%
as a result I am a co-sponsor of House
 
01:22:13.490 --> 01:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
Bill 236 as this was one of his two
 
01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
initiatives we were working on uh prior
 
01:22:21.169 --> 01:22:21.179 align:start position:0%
to his unexpected passing
 
01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
of Merrimack is victim to possibly the
 
01:22:27.530 --> 01:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
worst case of environmental pollution in
 
01:22:29.630 --> 01:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
the state's history with the discovery
 
01:22:33.410 --> 01:22:33.420 align:start position:0%
of pfas contaminants in the drinking
 
01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:34.850 align:start position:0%
of pfas contaminants in the drinking
water

01:22:34.850 --> 01:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
water
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
the town has spent years reacting to
 
01:22:42.189 --> 01:22:42.199 align:start position:0%
this news and determining the effects
 
01:22:46.270 --> 01:22:46.280 align:start position:0%
long-term and short term on clean air
 
01:22:49.990 --> 01:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
drinking water groundwater waste water
 
01:22:52.850 --> 01:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
and soil
 
01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
this statute of limitations bill is a
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
much needed measure to ensure a
 
01:23:01.490 --> 01:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
guideline for Resident reaction to the
 
01:23:04.010 --> 01:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
effects of pfas
 
01:23:06.890 --> 01:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
in 2005
 
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
I co-sponsored Senate Bill 75
 
01:23:14.530 --> 01:23:14.540 align:start position:0%
which created the new section in law
 
01:23:18.649 --> 01:23:18.659 align:start position:0%
extending the statute of limitations in
 
01:23:22.010 --> 01:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
civil actions based upon a sexual
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
assault case
 
01:23:28.490 --> 01:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
an extended statute of limitations is
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
critical for those suffering injury and
 
01:23:35.649 --> 01:23:35.659 align:start position:0%
find themselves balancing their health
 
01:23:39.649 --> 01:23:39.659 align:start position:0%
and well-being along with the
 
01:23:43.850 --> 01:23:43.860 align:start position:0%
complications of legal recourse
 
01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
six years after the date of discovery is
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
sufficient and the bill is written well
 
01:23:54.169 --> 01:23:54.179 align:start position:0%
to clearly provide Direction
 
01:23:57.530 --> 01:23:57.540 align:start position:0%
the citizens of Merrimack ask for its
 
01:23:57.540 --> 01:23:58.669 align:start position:0%
the citizens of Merrimack ask for its
Passage

01:23:58.669 --> 01:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
Passage
 
01:24:00.890 --> 01:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
and so with that I'll conclude my
 
01:24:03.169 --> 01:24:03.179 align:start position:0%
remarks and ask that you vote ought to
 
01:24:05.649 --> 01:24:05.659 align:start position:0%
pass on House Bill
 
01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
236. thank you
 
01:24:10.490 --> 01:24:10.500 align:start position:0%

in support of House Bill 236 I'm an
 
01:24:48.110 --> 01:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
advocate for firefighters who are

exposed to pfas through their equipment
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
and their a triple F in their turnout
 
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.330 align:start position:0%
and their a triple F in their turnout
gear

01:24:55.330 --> 01:24:55.340 align:start position:0%
gear
 
01:24:57.890 --> 01:24:57.900 align:start position:0%
my statement I'll read to you if you
 
01:25:00.649 --> 01:25:00.659 align:start position:0%
don't mind please it it does have some
 
01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
tongue twisters in there that that I
 
01:25:03.890 --> 01:25:03.900 align:start position:0%
stumble on
 
01:25:07.850 --> 01:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
May our 20 years in what we call the
 
01:25:10.669 --> 01:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
greatest deception ever at the hands of
 
01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:13.920 align:start position:0%

serve as a cautionary tale for anyone
 
01:25:26.930 --> 01:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
wishing and hoping that corporations
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
will do the right thing for their
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
impacted communities
 
01:25:34.250 --> 01:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
the past weeks I've had the opportunity
 
01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
to speak with Congressional members from
 
01:25:39.890 --> 01:25:39.900 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and New Hampshire to share
 
01:25:42.110 --> 01:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
the issue of pfas within the fire
 
01:25:45.410 --> 01:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
service many of these discussions took
 
01:25:47.390 --> 01:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
place with the efforts of The Honorable

our turnout gear is made up of three

layers the outer shell is the material
 
01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:54.420 align:start position:0%
that the public sees it is the most

highly fluorinated textile ever seen by
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
science Dr Graham Peasley conducted our
 
01:27:05.629 --> 01:27:05.639 align:start position:0%
own independent study done on turnout
 
01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
gear the study was orchestrated by
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
myself the wife of a firefighter with
 
01:27:13.850 --> 01:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
cancer and a group of firefighters from
 
01:27:16.490 --> 01:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
Salem Massachusetts Northern California
 
01:27:19.790 --> 01:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
and Chicago we had no help from
 
01:27:23.330 --> 01:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
institutions we had no prior skills this
 
01:27:25.729 --> 01:27:25.739 align:start position:0%
was the first in the world study of
 
01:27:28.010 --> 01:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
chemicals used on the protective
 
01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
material of the gear the safety
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
institution and FPA had 20 years to do
 
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
this study they never did they and our
 
01:27:39.550 --> 01:27:39.560 align:start position:0%
labor force the International
 
01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
Association of firefighters only sought
 
01:27:45.830 --> 01:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
and supported studies on the products of
 
01:27:49.610 --> 01:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
combustion or toxic smoke which was fed
 
01:27:52.189 --> 01:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
to them by the chemical industry itself
 
01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
they willingly went along while Dupont
 
01:27:58.910 --> 01:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
Honeywell Gore knew of the health
 
01:28:02.990 --> 01:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
effects of pfoa and Teflon they remained
 
01:28:06.290 --> 01:28:06.300 align:start position:0%
silent while voting on the materials to
 
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
be used for the gear not miss Potter I
 
01:28:13.310 --> 01:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
don't want to cut you short but I I
 
01:28:16.250 --> 01:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
didn't indicate to everybody that they
 
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
limit them to five minutes and
 
01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
and the issue here is whether or not to
 
01:28:23.450 --> 01:28:23.460 align:start position:0%
extend the statute of limits and statute
 
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
of limitations so
 
01:28:27.050 --> 01:28:27.060 align:start position:0%
if you you only have a couple of minutes
 
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
left if you want to just address that
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
issue that might be helpful oh yes okay
 
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
I'll cut I'll cut right to um
 
01:28:36.709 --> 01:28:36.719 align:start position:0%
right to our
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
very relative to Merrimack because
 
01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
Merrimack as we know makes
 
01:28:45.169 --> 01:28:45.179 align:start position:0%
cbrn material
 
01:28:48.770 --> 01:28:48.780 align:start position:0%
and this is why we're so adamant that
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
this bill be sponsored and supported
 
01:28:54.410 --> 01:28:54.420 align:start position:0%
um because the chemicals used in turnout
 
01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
gear uh being used to make the cbrn
 
01:29:01.790 --> 01:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
material that is being made in Merrimac
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
um what we'd like to actually indicate
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
to you today is that we want our
 
01:29:10.910 --> 01:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
legislators to hold the line for the for
 
01:29:13.550 --> 01:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
the firefighters who've trusted that
 
01:29:17.090 --> 01:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
this in our institutions and
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
specifically that we ask for the passage
 
01:29:23.450 --> 01:29:23.460 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 236 to hold open the door
 
01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
for those like us who had to find our
 
01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
own scientists to discover how long
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:47.810 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:29:47.810 --> 01:29:47.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions for Ms
 
01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:53.149 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions for Ms
Carter

01:29:53.149 --> 01:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:55.010 --> 01:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
I seen on thank you for your testimony

the next person that signed up is
 
01:30:25.850 --> 01:30:25.860 align:start position:0%
Laureen Allen
 
01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:32.870 align:start position:0%
Laureen Allen
no

01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:30:37.729 --> 01:30:37.739 align:start position:0%
yes my name is I'm a little more
 
01:30:40.669 --> 01:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
prepared to speak here my name is uh
 
01:30:42.590 --> 01:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
Laureen Allen I am a resident of
 
01:30:45.169 --> 01:30:45.179 align:start position:0%
Merrimack I'm also a co-founder of a
 
01:30:47.090 --> 01:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
citizen group called neuromax citizens
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
for clean water uh I'd like to ask for
 
01:30:53.810 --> 01:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
your support this morning for HB 236 I
 
01:30:56.450 --> 01:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
will not speak long because I think that
 
01:30:58.689 --> 01:30:58.699 align:start position:0%
the points made by previous
 
01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
testifiers are superb excellent and I
 
01:31:03.470 --> 01:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
agree with all of them
 
01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
um I think what you heard this morning
 
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
in the earlier bill was just a little
 
01:31:10.669 --> 01:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
sense of how laborious and how lengthy
 
01:31:13.729 --> 01:31:13.739 align:start position:0%
the process is for impacted communities
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
I think that point has been made also I
 
01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
think you heard in some of the earlier
 
01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill that these
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
chemicals forever persist they
 
01:31:25.129 --> 01:31:25.139 align:start position:0%
bioaccumulate in our body they affect
 
01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
every organ I have actually read
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds of health studies
 
01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
from around the world one of them that
 
01:31:34.970 --> 01:31:34.980 align:start position:0%
really sticks with me is there was study
 
01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
out of Denmark and it was autopsy
 
01:31:39.229 --> 01:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
studies and it was absolutely
 
01:31:41.270 --> 01:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
astonishing because what they found I
 
01:31:43.189 --> 01:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
have no idea how you do an autopsy study
 
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
by the way but what they found is pfas
 
01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
chemicals including many many short
 
01:31:51.410 --> 01:31:51.420 align:start position:0%
chain replacement ones that we know are
 
01:31:55.189 --> 01:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
in the mix here in our community in
 
01:31:57.470 --> 01:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
every organ of the body the brain the
 
01:32:00.050 --> 01:32:00.060 align:start position:0%
liver you know the heart everything you
 
01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
could think of had it and they
 
01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
delineated by by pop out so what we know
 
01:32:08.930 --> 01:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
about these compounds is they are toxic
 
01:32:11.570 --> 01:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
the federal government is years if not
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
decades behind and it really is up to
 
01:32:16.010 --> 01:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
the states to try to give some rights to
 
01:32:18.350 --> 01:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
people so the statute of limitations is
 
01:32:20.810 --> 01:32:20.820 align:start position:0%
very important especially this concept
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
of when you realize there's harm in the
 
01:32:26.810 --> 01:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
area of children in particular I hear
 
01:32:28.490 --> 01:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
every week from parents in this
 
01:32:30.290 --> 01:32:30.300 align:start position:0%
community who are looking for physician
 
01:32:33.169 --> 01:32:33.179 align:start position:0%
guidance and we can't go back you know
 
01:32:35.450 --> 01:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
we can't make this right what's done is
 
01:32:37.729 --> 01:32:37.739 align:start position:0%
done but they're realizing that there
 
01:32:39.890 --> 01:32:39.900 align:start position:0%
are Health disruptions uh to their
 
01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:42.300 align:start position:0%
children's lives mothers are born with
 
01:32:44.810 --> 01:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
you know placenta transfer and mothers
 
01:32:46.970 --> 01:32:46.980 align:start position:0%
who are breastfeeding are very unaware
 
01:32:48.770 --> 01:32:48.780 align:start position:0%
that they will decrease their body
 
01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
burden significantly by excreting pfas
 
01:32:54.290 --> 01:32:54.300 align:start position:0%
chemicals that's in their blood serum to
 
01:32:56.990 --> 01:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
their infants in breast milk Hoosick
 
01:32:59.870 --> 01:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
Falls just came out with a report this
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
week that was appalling there was a
 
01:33:03.649 --> 01:33:03.659 align:start position:0%
mother there so this speaks to this
 
01:33:05.570 --> 01:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
issue of when do you learn of of harm
 
01:33:07.669 --> 01:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
who has a two-year-old who's had many
 
01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
many issues with his teeth in some
 
01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
developmental Milestones so teeth
 
01:33:15.050 --> 01:33:15.060 align:start position:0%
cracking and teeth having issues at two
 
01:33:17.570 --> 01:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
when the teeth are new they said what
 
01:33:20.450 --> 01:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
could this be about well pfas impacts
 
01:33:22.970 --> 01:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
your bones and your bone health is
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
definitely one of the target points so
 
01:33:27.770 --> 01:33:27.780 align:start position:0%
this little boy actually was able to
 
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
have his blood drawn the mother's levels
 
01:33:33.770 --> 01:33:33.780 align:start position:0%
from 2016 were significantly lower who6
 
01:33:36.169 --> 01:33:36.179 align:start position:0%
stopped all their exposure to pfas and
 
01:33:39.050 --> 01:33:39.060 align:start position:0%
drinking water with full filtration in
 
01:33:41.870 --> 01:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
the beginning of 2016. she did not have
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
exposure throughout her pregnancy he's
 
01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
two years old his blood levels were 22
 
01:33:49.970 --> 01:33:49.980 align:start position:0%
000 parts per trillion for pfoa alone
 
01:33:53.689 --> 01:33:53.699 align:start position:0%
that is astonishing here in Southern New
 
01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we do not have uh the capacity
 
01:33:57.770 --> 01:33:57.780 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to do full
 
01:34:00.410 --> 01:34:00.420 align:start position:0%
biomonitoring and blood test
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
um that we should have but we do know
 
01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
that there are health issues that will
 
01:34:07.970 --> 01:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
occur so this statute of limitations is
 
01:34:10.129 --> 01:34:10.139 align:start position:0%
very important I think the sponsors were
 
01:34:12.290 --> 01:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
being very sensible when they realized
 
01:34:14.090 --> 01:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
that three years has been the standard
 
01:34:16.129 --> 01:34:16.139 align:start position:0%
so let's you know not push it too much
 
01:34:18.350 --> 01:34:18.360 align:start position:0%
let's extend it to six and give more
 
01:34:20.990 --> 01:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
time uh there was a discussion that the
 
01:34:22.850 --> 01:34:22.860 align:start position:0%
Merrimack Town Council had last Thursday
 
01:34:25.850 --> 01:34:25.860 align:start position:0%
night when representative Mooney uh gave
 
01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
a legislative update and she presented
 
01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
the gist of this bill until questions or
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
town counselors who were very very
 
01:34:36.169 --> 01:34:36.179 align:start position:0%
formed and very conservative and very
 
01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
sensible made an interesting point they
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
said why does this bill set a limit at
 
01:34:44.930 --> 01:34:44.940 align:start position:0%
all of six years they should be no limit
 
01:34:47.570 --> 01:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
because this goes on and on and on so I
 
01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
will just leave you with that point from
 
01:34:52.430 --> 01:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
Our Town Council and in my opinion it's
 
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
a great Bill and of course it doesn't go
 
01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
far enough but we have to be sensible
 
01:34:59.149 --> 01:34:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:59.159 --> 01:35:10.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony uh are
 
01:35:17.629 --> 01:35:17.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you again
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
01:35:23.570 --> 01:35:23.580 align:start position:0%
are there other people who would like to
 
01:35:27.770 --> 01:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
speak today if there are in your in
 
01:35:29.870 --> 01:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
attendance please raise your hand yes
 
01:35:43.250 --> 01:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:45.890 --> 01:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
hi thank you for letting me speak uh
 
01:35:48.890 --> 01:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
once again I missed the deadline to uh
 
01:35:50.930 --> 01:35:50.940 align:start position:0%
sign up to speak but again appreciate
 
01:35:53.450 --> 01:35:53.460 align:start position:0%
the opportunity my name is David Creer I
 
01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
am director of public policy at the
 
01:35:57.709 --> 01:35:57.719 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association uh we
 
01:35:59.330 --> 01:35:59.340 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill
 
01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
um and I'll make it pretty simple and
 
01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
short uh it's just unnecessary I think
 
01:36:05.149 --> 01:36:05.159 align:start position:0%
there's some confusion about how
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
statutes of limitations work uh under
 
01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
current law I think this came up with
 
01:36:13.790 --> 01:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
representative McLean under current law
 
01:36:15.890 --> 01:36:15.900 align:start position:0%
your statute of limitations is three
 
01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:17.390 align:start position:0%
your statute of limitations is three
years

01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:36:18.830 --> 01:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
um it's generally from when the harm
 
01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
occurs but in cases of latent defects or
 
01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
latent harm that clock doesn't begin to
 
01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
tick until you discover the injury so
 
01:36:32.450 --> 01:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
for instance in the issue of pfas and
 
01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
this happens a lot with like medical
 
01:36:36.110 --> 01:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
malpractice things
 
01:36:38.090 --> 01:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
um once you discover that you're injured
 
01:36:40.370 --> 01:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
so you start getting ill and you find
 
01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
out oh this was because of pfas exposure
 
01:36:45.410 --> 01:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
that's when the three year starts to
 
01:36:47.149 --> 01:36:47.159 align:start position:0%
begin it's not when you were exposed to
 
01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
the pfas it's when that injury actually
 
01:36:51.050 --> 01:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
occurs and you discover that link to
 
01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
pfast so three years is ample time to
 
01:36:57.950 --> 01:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
start your investigation to discover uh
 
01:37:00.709 --> 01:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
if you should file suit you know this
 
01:37:03.470 --> 01:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
works pretty well in most other areas
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's why it is the standard three
 
01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:06.830 align:start position:0%
that's why it is the standard three
years

01:37:06.830 --> 01:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
and that would apply here so the
 
01:37:11.330 --> 01:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
additional six years would just
 
01:37:14.810 --> 01:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
um really have uh no extra benefits but
 
01:37:17.209 --> 01:37:17.219 align:start position:0%
it would require businesses to store
 
01:37:19.729 --> 01:37:19.739 align:start position:0%
records and things even longer than they
 
01:37:21.649 --> 01:37:21.659 align:start position:0%
normally would giving them extra burdens
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
and fear of uh increased litigation
 
01:37:28.610 --> 01:37:28.620 align:start position:0%
um like I said you know the statute of
 
01:37:31.010 --> 01:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
limitations as it works with three years
 
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
is plenty of time to bring lawsuits you
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
don't even need to have all of the
 
01:37:37.729 --> 01:37:37.739 align:start position:0%
information before you file suit you are
 
01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
allowed some extra time during the suit
 
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
during the discovery process
 
01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
um and so there there is plenty of time
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
to file a suit once you have discovered
 
01:37:50.149 --> 01:37:50.159 align:start position:0%
that harm exists with that I'm happy to
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
01:37:54.530 --> 01:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
hey representative silver
 
01:37:56.450 --> 01:37:56.460 align:start position:0%
yes oh thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:37:59.209 --> 01:37:59.219 align:start position:0%
Mr crew for taking my question uh
 
01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
are you aware of what the statute of
 
01:38:04.490 --> 01:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
limitations in New Hampshire for actions
 
01:38:06.110 --> 01:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
under the Uniform Commercial Code might
 
01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:08.990 align:start position:0%
under the Uniform Commercial Code might
be

01:38:08.990 --> 01:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:12.590 --> 01:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh unfortunately not specifically to the
 
01:38:15.470 --> 01:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
universe Universal Commercial Code it's
 
01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
actually the I'm sorry UCC has a general
 
01:38:21.709 --> 01:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations of four years for
 
01:38:24.410 --> 01:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
commercial transactions so four years is
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
actually a year beyond what RSA 508
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
colon 4 on personal action stats
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
well thank you I I wasn't aware of that
 
01:38:36.890 --> 01:38:36.900 align:start position:0%
um but I think you know this bill is
 
01:38:39.530 --> 01:38:39.540 align:start position:0%
more closely to related to 5084 which
 
01:38:41.870 --> 01:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
deals with personal injury
 
01:38:44.990 --> 01:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
um which is where you know most other
 
01:38:46.850 --> 01:38:46.860 align:start position:0%
um personal injury suits would fall
 
01:38:51.169 --> 01:38:51.179 align:start position:0%
including medical malpractice thank you
 
01:38:53.870 --> 01:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan uh yes thank you
 
01:38:55.370 --> 01:38:55.380 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair thank you very much
 
01:38:58.970 --> 01:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
Mr career and I appreciate the hard work
 
01:39:01.610 --> 01:39:01.620 align:start position:0%
the Bai Bai does even if I don't
 
01:39:02.689 --> 01:39:02.699 align:start position:0%
necessarily agree with you on every
 
01:39:03.950 --> 01:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
issue but
 
01:39:06.169 --> 01:39:06.179 align:start position:0%
my question is um
 
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
this cause of action basically this is
 
01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:10.070 align:start position:0%
this cause of action basically this is
about

01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:10.729 align:start position:0%
about
um

01:39:10.729 --> 01:39:10.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
giving those who are injured by pfas
 
01:39:15.890 --> 01:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
contamination more time to uh
 
01:39:19.129 --> 01:39:19.139 align:start position:0%
get the people who did it uh rectified
 
01:39:22.129 --> 01:39:22.139 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering like uh yes these are
 
01:39:24.770 --> 01:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
mostly business these are all businesses
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
mostly large businesses discharging the
 
01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
pfas and the water supply but isn't that
 
01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:30.050 align:start position:0%
pfas and the water supply but isn't that
um

01:39:30.050 --> 01:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:32.510 --> 01:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
bad not just for
 
01:39:34.850 --> 01:39:34.860 align:start position:0%
the households which use the water
 
01:39:36.649 --> 01:39:36.659 align:start position:0%
supply but also the businesses which
 
01:39:38.330 --> 01:39:38.340 align:start position:0%
works the water supply so I'm wondering
 
01:39:40.490 --> 01:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
like um how
 
01:39:42.290 --> 01:39:42.300 align:start position:0%
oh you think we should balance out the
 
01:39:43.790 --> 01:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
interest of the businesses who are
 
01:39:45.890 --> 01:39:45.900 align:start position:0%
harmed by the pollution
 
01:39:48.050 --> 01:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
um versus those of the businesses which
 
01:39:50.090 --> 01:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
caused the pollution
 
01:39:52.370 --> 01:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for the question
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
um yeah absolutely businesses that would
 
01:39:57.169 --> 01:39:57.179 align:start position:0%
be harmed by this um also should have
 
01:39:59.870 --> 01:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
their uh ability to
 
01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:01.679 align:start position:0%
um you know make make themselves whole
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
just like um you know a resident or
 
01:40:07.010 --> 01:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
anyone else but the current statute of
 
01:40:08.990 --> 01:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
limitations three years is still ample
 
01:40:11.890 --> 01:40:11.900 align:start position:0%
time to do that because again it that
 
01:40:14.510 --> 01:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations wouldn't start to
 
01:40:17.689 --> 01:40:17.699 align:start position:0%
run until that harm is discovered which
 
01:40:19.370 --> 01:40:19.380 align:start position:0%
then gives them three years to do enough
 
01:40:22.910 --> 01:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
investigative work to uh figure out how
 
01:40:24.830 --> 01:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
to file that lawsuit and get that
 
01:40:27.649 --> 01:40:27.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
oh okay thank you very much Mr chair and
 
01:40:35.810 --> 01:40:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:37.129 --> 01:40:37.139 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other questions
 
01:40:39.709 --> 01:40:39.719 align:start position:0%
for Mr career
 
01:40:42.530 --> 01:40:42.540 align:start position:0%

01:40:45.770 --> 01:40:45.780 align:start position:0%

01:40:54.530 --> 01:40:54.540 align:start position:0%

01:57:04.910 --> 01:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
this morning is House Bill 360 egg
 
01:57:06.530 --> 01:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
relative to claims for medical
 
01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:09.590 align:start position:0%

and free sign up in opposition
 
01:57:28.729 --> 01:57:28.739 align:start position:0%
and only to testify today although I
 
01:57:30.050 --> 01:57:30.060 align:start position:0%
note that the primary sponsor
 
01:57:32.750 --> 01:57:32.760 align:start position:0%

representative Cushing to give his
 
01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:43.310 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman members of the
committee

01:57:48.050 --> 01:57:48.060 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:57:49.790 --> 01:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:58:04.669 --> 01:58:04.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:06.649 --> 01:58:06.659 align:start position:0%
I don't mean to be rude um membership
 
01:58:07.729 --> 01:58:07.739 align:start position:0%
committee for the record I'm
 
01:58:09.169 --> 01:58:09.179 align:start position:0%
representative Renee Cushing from
 
01:58:12.229 --> 01:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
Rockingham district 21 in Hampton and
 
01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
I'm here in support of house bill 368.
 
01:58:19.010 --> 01:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
is relative to claims to Medical
 
01:58:22.070 --> 01:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
monitoring this bill should be somewhat
 
01:58:24.830 --> 01:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
familiar to this committee since it was
 
01:58:27.109 --> 01:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
before the committee the past two years
 
01:58:30.890 --> 01:58:30.900 align:start position:0%
as House Bill 661 which
 
01:58:33.229 --> 01:58:33.239 align:start position:0%
um I will just applaud the committee for
 
01:58:37.010 --> 01:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
all of the work that it did to uh craft
 
01:58:39.970 --> 01:58:39.980 align:start position:0%
the language that appears before you
 
01:58:43.970 --> 01:58:43.980 align:start position:0%
I can think of no other I'm tempted just
 
01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
to read the uh the ought to pass with
 
01:58:49.070 --> 01:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment majority report from
 
01:58:52.669 --> 01:58:52.679 align:start position:0%
representative Mark McLean of last year
 
01:58:55.430 --> 01:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
um which I think explains
 
01:58:58.850 --> 01:58:58.860 align:start position:0%
what this bill sets out to do uh it
 
01:59:00.770 --> 01:59:00.780 align:start position:0%
provides a private right of action for
 
01:59:04.129 --> 01:59:04.139 align:start position:0%
toxic exposure and while this is an area
 
01:59:07.490 --> 01:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
of law that currently requires review
 
01:59:11.330 --> 01:59:11.340 align:start position:0%
um the committee thought that it would
 
01:59:14.030 --> 01:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
be important to narrow this to provide a
 
01:59:17.649 --> 01:59:17.659 align:start position:0%
right of action to seek medical
 
01:59:19.550 --> 01:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
monitoring for someone who's been
 
01:59:23.270 --> 01:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
damaged by exposure to toxic chemicals
 
01:59:27.169 --> 01:59:27.179 align:start position:0%
it uh it makes it easier if you will to
 
01:59:30.350 --> 01:59:30.360 align:start position:0%
people who have been exposed to toxic
 
01:59:34.669 --> 01:59:34.679 align:start position:0%
substances to get monitoring for their
 
01:59:39.770 --> 01:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
health before the onset of any disease
 
01:59:42.530 --> 01:59:42.540 align:start position:0%
becomes manifest in a way to it would
 
01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
provide the opportunity to do
 
01:59:46.370 --> 01:59:46.380 align:start position:0%
appropriate intervention
 
01:59:49.070 --> 01:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
um and I just would urge the committee
 
01:59:52.070 --> 01:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
to pass the bill
 
01:59:54.410 --> 01:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
are there questions for representative
 
01:59:54.420 --> 01:59:58.129 align:start position:0%
are there questions for representative
Cushing

01:59:58.129 --> 01:59:58.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:00.890 --> 02:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
yes representative Alexander
 
02:00:02.570 --> 02:00:02.580 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair and thank you um
 
02:00:04.970 --> 02:00:04.980 align:start position:0%
leader Cushing for taking my question
 
02:00:07.189 --> 02:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
um is this an exact carbon copy of what
 
02:00:08.689 --> 02:00:08.699 align:start position:0%
the committee passed thought to pass
 
02:00:10.189 --> 02:00:10.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment last year
 
02:00:13.129 --> 02:00:13.139 align:start position:0%
it is except for the effective date okay
 
02:00:14.870 --> 02:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
it is the it is this is the language
 
02:00:17.689 --> 02:00:17.699 align:start position:0%
that the you know the house Judiciary
 
02:00:20.030 --> 02:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
Committee passed 16-3
 
02:00:27.350 --> 02:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:28.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:00:31.669 --> 02:00:31.679 align:start position:0%
representative McLean
 
02:00:33.950 --> 02:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and and thank you for
 
02:00:36.350 --> 02:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question I mean obviously I
 
02:00:39.050 --> 02:00:39.060 align:start position:0%
have a lot of sympathy for this bill
 
02:00:41.570 --> 02:00:41.580 align:start position:0%
um but in in the last session we took
 
02:00:46.070 --> 02:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
this bill to uh the five yard line and
 
02:00:49.010 --> 02:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
um the governor vetoed it and that veto
 
02:00:52.910 --> 02:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
was upheld so are there any new develops
 
02:00:54.709 --> 02:00:54.719 align:start position:0%
or any new developments or anything that
 
02:00:57.169 --> 02:00:57.179 align:start position:0%
you could share with the committee
 
02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
um that you think might lead to a
 
02:01:01.729 --> 02:01:01.739 align:start position:0%
different outcome this time around
 
02:01:04.490 --> 02:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
I just think that there's a growing
 
02:01:07.250 --> 02:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
Consciousness and awareness of the
 
02:01:09.229 --> 02:01:09.239 align:start position:0%
damage that is being done to the
 
02:01:12.050 --> 02:01:12.060 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state by uh entities
 
02:01:15.290 --> 02:01:15.300 align:start position:0%
that uh that knowingly
 
02:01:18.589 --> 02:01:18.599 align:start position:0%
um provide knowingly expose uh citizens
 
02:01:22.070 --> 02:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
to toxic chemicals I think we're we're
 
02:01:25.310 --> 02:01:25.320 align:start position:0%
not seeing a decline in cancer rates
 
02:01:27.709 --> 02:01:27.719 align:start position:0%
we're not seeing a decline in health
 
02:01:30.229 --> 02:01:30.239 align:start position:0%
impacts from chemical exposure if
 
02:01:31.850 --> 02:01:31.860 align:start position:0%
anything I think the passage of time
 
02:01:36.109 --> 02:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:39.229 --> 02:01:39.239 align:start position:0%
foreign Corrigan
 
02:01:42.649 --> 02:01:42.659 align:start position:0%
um yes well my question is similar to uh
 
02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
previous ones so the Billet hb661 per se
 
02:01:48.709 --> 02:01:48.719 align:start position:0%
was tabled by the Senate I was checking
 
02:01:50.990 --> 02:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
the docket but it was uh
 
02:01:53.089 --> 02:01:53.099 align:start position:0%
unless it was in one of the Omnibus
 
02:01:55.250 --> 02:01:55.260 align:start position:0%
bills and I'm embarrassed to say I don't
 
02:01:58.850 --> 02:01:58.860 align:start position:0%
remember exactly which one so um
 
02:02:00.470 --> 02:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
so do you want to comment more in the
 
02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:02.229 align:start position:0%
so do you want to comment more in the
legislation

02:02:02.229 --> 02:02:02.239 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:02:04.729 --> 02:02:04.739 align:start position:0%
on the bus bill here thank you
 
02:02:06.589 --> 02:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
representative Corrigan that's my
 
02:02:08.570 --> 02:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
recollection too I know I I get the
 
02:02:10.550 --> 02:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
numbers mixed up as we moved to the
 
02:02:13.790 --> 02:02:13.800 align:start position:0%
pandemic and there were bills that uh
 
02:02:15.890 --> 02:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
we're taken and included in other bills
 
02:02:18.770 --> 02:02:18.780 align:start position:0%
uh that having been said I I think
 
02:02:21.410 --> 02:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
what's important to remember is how hard
 
02:02:24.890 --> 02:02:24.900 align:start position:0%
this Judiciary Committee worked on this
 
02:02:26.629 --> 02:02:26.639 align:start position:0%
particular piece of legislation I mean
 
02:02:28.490 --> 02:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
you invited in stakeholders it was not
 
02:02:30.370 --> 02:02:30.380 align:start position:0%
done yet I just I I don't know how many
 
02:02:32.330 --> 02:02:32.340 align:start position:0%
subcommittees I don't know how many
 
02:02:34.910 --> 02:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
wordsmithing sessions there were
 
02:02:37.609 --> 02:02:37.619 align:start position:0%
um at the end I think what the what he
 
02:02:40.129 --> 02:02:40.139 align:start position:0%
came up with is a really good and
 
02:02:42.109 --> 02:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
important piece of legislation and I I
 
02:02:44.750 --> 02:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
would I would urge you to pass it again
 
02:02:47.030 --> 02:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
oh thank you yeah thank you Mr leader
 
02:02:48.950 --> 02:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair yes I I I
 
02:02:51.589 --> 02:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
agree and um of course the fact is
 
02:02:54.050 --> 02:02:54.060 align:start position:0%
vetoed that means the Senate supported
 
02:02:56.629 --> 02:02:56.639 align:start position:0%
it too it's just a governor uh the
 
02:02:58.490 --> 02:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
governor objectives of something in the
 
02:03:00.050 --> 02:03:00.060 align:start position:0%
Omnibus Bill so
 
02:03:01.209 --> 02:03:01.219 align:start position:0%
um thanks
 
02:03:03.709 --> 02:03:03.719 align:start position:0%
that was then this was now of course so
 
02:03:03.719 --> 02:03:04.990 align:start position:0%
that was then this was now of course so
like

02:03:04.990 --> 02:03:05.000 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:03:06.950 --> 02:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
let's hope for a different outcome of
 
02:03:09.770 --> 02:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
this time at 2021. I would not
 
02:03:12.589 --> 02:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
necessarily preclude you know the
 
02:03:15.530 --> 02:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
someone re-examining a legislation in a
 
02:03:17.450 --> 02:03:17.460 align:start position:0%
different session and seeing it in a
 
02:03:19.189 --> 02:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
different light of new information
 
02:03:22.970 --> 02:03:22.980 align:start position:0%
recognizing a new urgency perhaps
 
02:03:25.010 --> 02:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
thank you uh are there any other
 
02:03:26.689 --> 02:03:26.699 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
02:03:30.350 --> 02:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:32.149 --> 02:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you for your testimony
 
02:03:32.159 --> 02:03:33.050 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you for your testimony
today

02:03:33.050 --> 02:03:33.060 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:03:36.290 --> 02:03:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:39.890 --> 02:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
other persons who indicated their desire
 
02:03:42.229 --> 02:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
02:03:49.270 --> 02:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:53.930 --> 02:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
yes hello yes we can hear you oh great
 
02:03:56.450 --> 02:03:56.460 align:start position:0%
sorry this is new to me too the virtual
 
02:03:56.460 --> 02:03:57.890 align:start position:0%
sorry this is new to me too the virtual
testifying

02:03:57.890 --> 02:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
02:03:59.750 --> 02:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
um well thank you Mr chairman I can't
 
02:04:02.030 --> 02:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
tell if you can see me or not
 
02:04:02.040 --> 02:04:02.870 align:start position:0%
tell if you can see me or not
um

02:04:02.870 --> 02:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:04.970 --> 02:04:04.980 align:start position:0%
but I first of all just wanted to thank
 
02:04:07.070 --> 02:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
you for uh you and the committee for the
 
02:04:08.689 --> 02:04:08.699 align:start position:0%
privilege of allowing me to testify
 
02:04:12.229 --> 02:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
today even virtually uh again my name is
 
02:04:14.149 --> 02:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
Chris Apel I'm an attorney at the law
 
02:04:16.250 --> 02:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
firm of shoecardian bacon in Washington
 
02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
D.C and I'm testifying on behalf of the
 
02:04:22.070 --> 02:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
American Court reform Association in
 
02:04:25.550 --> 02:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
opposition to HB 368. and my goal here
 
02:04:26.870 --> 02:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
is to provide more of a national
 
02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
perspective on medical monitoring and to
 
02:04:31.129 --> 02:04:31.139 align:start position:0%
discuss some of the specific concerns
 
02:04:32.330 --> 02:04:32.340 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
02:04:34.729 --> 02:04:34.739 align:start position:0%
I also submitted written testimony
 
02:04:37.370 --> 02:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
detailing some of these concerns and I
 
02:04:39.189 --> 02:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
thought I would just Begin by
 
02:04:41.450 --> 02:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
re-emphasizing what medical monitoring
 
02:04:41.460 --> 02:04:42.649 align:start position:0%
re-emphasizing what medical monitoring
entails

02:04:42.649 --> 02:04:42.659 align:start position:0%
entails
 
02:04:44.870 --> 02:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
it allows a claimant to recover damages
 
02:04:47.270 --> 02:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
where he or she has no present injury
 
02:04:50.330 --> 02:04:50.340 align:start position:0%
and will likely never develop an injury
 
02:04:52.790 --> 02:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
and that basic idea is a fairly radical
 
02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
Concept in tort law the existence of an
 
02:04:57.709 --> 02:04:57.719 align:start position:0%
actual injury has traditionally been the
 
02:04:59.930 --> 02:04:59.940 align:start position:0%
linchpin for tort liability
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
and one of the basic problems with
 
02:05:03.410 --> 02:05:03.420 align:start position:0%
allowing the unimpaired to recover
 
02:05:06.050 --> 02:05:06.060 align:start position:0%
damages is that it depletes the pool of
 
02:05:08.330 --> 02:05:08.340 align:start position:0%
resources available for those who have
 
02:05:10.790 --> 02:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
actually suffered a serious injury and
 
02:05:12.589 --> 02:05:12.599 align:start position:0%
this isn't just hypothetical asset
 
02:05:14.930 --> 02:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
depletion either the history of asbestos
 
02:05:17.089 --> 02:05:17.099 align:start position:0%
litigation in America provides a helpful
 
02:05:17.099 --> 02:05:18.169 align:start position:0%
litigation in America provides a helpful
example

02:05:18.169 --> 02:05:18.179 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:05:19.910 --> 02:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
there are a few courts around the
 
02:05:21.830 --> 02:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
country allowed tens of thousands of
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
unimpaired claimants to recover based on
 
02:05:26.990 --> 02:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
their mere exposure to Asbestos and the
 
02:05:28.810 --> 02:05:28.820 align:start position:0%
result in my view is fairly predictable
 
02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
unimpaired claimants flocked to these
 
02:05:32.750 --> 02:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions draining the available
 
02:05:34.729 --> 02:05:34.739 align:start position:0%
assets for individuals who developed
 
02:05:36.850 --> 02:05:36.860 align:start position:0%
mesothelioma and other cancers
 
02:05:38.510 --> 02:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturers were forced into
 
02:05:40.790 --> 02:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy leading to the creation of
 
02:05:43.129 --> 02:05:43.139 align:start position:0%
asbestos trusts many of which now only
 
02:05:44.750 --> 02:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
pay pennies on the dollar to the
 
02:05:47.209 --> 02:05:47.219 align:start position:0%
seriously impaired and this type of
 
02:05:49.189 --> 02:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
concern led the U.S Supreme Court to
 
02:05:51.530 --> 02:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
reject medical monitoring albeit under a
 
02:05:53.629 --> 02:05:53.639 align:start position:0%
federal statute and most State high
 
02:05:55.010 --> 02:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
courts that have considered medical
 
02:05:56.990 --> 02:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
monitoring in the past 20 years have
 
02:05:59.089 --> 02:05:59.099 align:start position:0%
expressly rejected it including for
 
02:06:00.770 --> 02:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
example the Illinois Supreme Court just
 
02:06:02.450 --> 02:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
last year
 
02:06:05.750 --> 02:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
and HP 368 would not only adopt a new
 
02:06:07.790 --> 02:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
cause of action for medical monitoring
 
02:06:09.709 --> 02:06:09.719 align:start position:0%
which I can explain as a minority
 
02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
approach among the minority of states
 
02:06:14.030 --> 02:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
that do allow medical monitoring but the
 
02:06:15.830 --> 02:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
legislation would do so in an extremely
 
02:06:17.330 --> 02:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
broad manner based on other
 
02:06:17.340 --> 02:06:18.890 align:start position:0%
broad manner based on other
considerations

02:06:18.890 --> 02:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
considerations
 
02:06:20.450 --> 02:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
and here I thought it would be helpful
 
02:06:22.729 --> 02:06:22.739 align:start position:0%
to just go through some of the bills uh
 
02:06:25.310 --> 02:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
provisions of course the bill states
 
02:06:27.290 --> 02:06:27.300 align:start position:0%
that any chemical or biological
 
02:06:29.209 --> 02:06:29.219 align:start position:0%
substance that can be shown to be
 
02:06:31.189 --> 02:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
hazardous or toxic can give rise to a
 
02:06:31.199 --> 02:06:32.089 align:start position:0%
hazardous or toxic can give rise to a
lawsuit

02:06:32.089 --> 02:06:32.099 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
 
02:06:34.189 --> 02:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
the bill therefore would apply to
 
02:06:35.890 --> 02:06:35.900 align:start position:0%
exposure to countless substances
 
02:06:38.089 --> 02:06:38.099 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether a substance is
 
02:06:40.370 --> 02:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
recognized under state or federal law as
 
02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
hazardous basically an attorney just
 
02:06:44.689 --> 02:06:44.699 align:start position:0%
needs to find an expert willing to opine
 
02:06:47.149 --> 02:06:47.159 align:start position:0%
that something is hazardous which is not
 
02:06:48.770 --> 02:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
really a tall order
 
02:06:51.470 --> 02:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
a plaintiff only needs to show a
 
02:06:53.629 --> 02:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
significant exposure created an
 
02:06:56.270 --> 02:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
increased risk of illness there's no
 
02:06:58.609 --> 02:06:58.619 align:start position:0%
threshold for how significant or
 
02:07:00.830 --> 02:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
insignificant that increased risk must
 
02:07:00.840 --> 02:07:01.550 align:start position:0%
insignificant that increased risk must
be

02:07:01.550 --> 02:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:07:03.709 --> 02:07:03.719 align:start position:0%
the bill also expressly says that a
 
02:07:05.510 --> 02:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
person does not need to prove that
 
02:07:07.490 --> 02:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
illness is certain or likely to develop
 
02:07:09.890 --> 02:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
as a result of the exposure the only
 
02:07:11.870 --> 02:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
real Safeguard here is whether a doctor
 
02:07:14.209 --> 02:07:14.219 align:start position:0%
would agree that diagnostic testing is
 
02:07:15.890 --> 02:07:15.900 align:start position:0%
reasonably necessary
 
02:07:17.930 --> 02:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
and this is a bit of editorializing
 
02:07:19.550 --> 02:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
immediately but in my experience many
 
02:07:21.410 --> 02:07:21.420 align:start position:0%
doctors believe the practice of
 
02:07:23.209 --> 02:07:23.219 align:start position:0%
defensive medicine is a very real thing
 
02:07:25.430 --> 02:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
so some doctors may be inclined okay
 
02:07:28.010 --> 02:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
testing based on marginal exposures
 
02:07:29.990 --> 02:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
which creates a potential for abuse
 
02:07:32.149 --> 02:07:32.159 align:start position:0%
especially if they're say like pressed
 
02:07:35.810 --> 02:07:35.820 align:start position:0%
by an attorney to to authorize medical
 
02:07:35.820 --> 02:07:37.070 align:start position:0%
by an attorney to to authorize medical
monitoring

02:07:37.070 --> 02:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
monitoring
 
02:07:40.089 --> 02:07:40.099 align:start position:0%
the bill also says that a claimant's
 
02:07:43.550 --> 02:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
present or past health status shall not
 
02:07:44.930 --> 02:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
be at issue in a claim for medical
 
02:07:47.149 --> 02:07:47.159 align:start position:0%
monitoring so if a person has a
 
02:07:49.550 --> 02:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
pre-existing condition for example a
 
02:07:51.109 --> 02:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
genetic predisposition to something like
 
02:07:53.810 --> 02:07:53.820 align:start position:0%
breast cancer that information would
 
02:07:55.729 --> 02:07:55.739 align:start position:0%
appear to be unavailable for use by a
 
02:07:57.649 --> 02:07:57.659 align:start position:0%
defendant in a medical monitoring case
 
02:07:59.450 --> 02:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
in other words a defendant could not
 
02:08:01.669 --> 02:08:01.679 align:start position:0%
argue that a plaintiff's increased risk
 
02:08:03.229 --> 02:08:03.239 align:start position:0%
of disease was due to factors such as
 
02:08:06.169 --> 02:08:06.179 align:start position:0%
genetics and not an alleged exposure and
 
02:08:07.729 --> 02:08:07.739 align:start position:0%
I would submit that stripping away such
 
02:08:10.430 --> 02:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
basic defenses would allow liability to
 
02:08:11.870 --> 02:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
be imposed in a fundamentally unfair
 
02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:12.950 align:start position:0%
be imposed in a fundamentally unfair
manner

02:08:12.950 --> 02:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
manner
 
02:08:15.709 --> 02:08:15.719 align:start position:0%
the bill also expressly authorizes
 
02:08:18.770 --> 02:08:18.780 align:start position:0%
Awards of attorney fees and would give
 
02:08:21.470 --> 02:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
courts the option of awarding Damages
 
02:08:24.109 --> 02:08:24.119 align:start position:0%
for meta for monitoring as a lump sum
 
02:08:26.390 --> 02:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
instead of requiring that funds be
 
02:08:28.450 --> 02:08:28.460 align:start position:0%
placed in a court supervised program
 
02:08:30.649 --> 02:08:30.659 align:start position:0%
administered by medical professionals
 
02:08:32.810 --> 02:08:32.820 align:start position:0%
and this combination could be a recipe
 
02:08:34.970 --> 02:08:34.980 align:start position:0%
for Mischief because it provides an
 
02:08:36.770 --> 02:08:36.780 align:start position:0%
incentive for attorneys to actively seek
 
02:08:39.109 --> 02:08:39.119 align:start position:0%
out litigation and recover medical
 
02:08:41.330 --> 02:08:41.340 align:start position:0%
monitoring damages on behalf of a group
 
02:08:44.149 --> 02:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
or a class without any requirement that
 
02:08:45.830 --> 02:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
any of the unimpaired claimants actually
 
02:08:48.770 --> 02:08:48.780 align:start position:0%
use the funds for monitoring purposes so
 
02:08:50.270 --> 02:08:50.280 align:start position:0%
there doesn't appear to be anything in
 
02:08:51.890 --> 02:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
the bill prohibiting a successful
 
02:08:54.169 --> 02:08:54.179 align:start position:0%
claimant who receives a lump sum damage
 
02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
award uh for their future monitoring
 
02:09:00.350 --> 02:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
from saying going out and buying a TV
 
02:09:02.990 --> 02:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
finally the Bill's three-year statute of
 
02:09:05.689 --> 02:09:05.699 align:start position:0%
limitations appears to adopt a purely
 
02:09:08.209 --> 02:09:08.219 align:start position:0%
subjective standard as opposed to an
 
02:09:10.790 --> 02:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
objective standard which is antithetical
 
02:09:12.410 --> 02:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
to the purpose of a statute of
 
02:09:14.870 --> 02:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
limitations to establish a definite
 
02:09:16.850 --> 02:09:16.860 align:start position:0%
period after which Claims can no longer
 
02:09:17.990 --> 02:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
be brought
 
02:09:20.270 --> 02:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
the limitations period appears to be
 
02:09:22.310 --> 02:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
triggered only by a claimant's actual
 
02:09:25.189 --> 02:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
discovery of his or her exposure not
 
02:09:26.810 --> 02:09:26.820 align:start position:0%
when the claimant reasonably should have
 
02:09:28.370 --> 02:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
discovered the exposure
 
02:09:30.350 --> 02:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
the bill provision stating that the date
 
02:09:31.970 --> 02:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
when the hazardous substance was
 
02:09:34.370 --> 02:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
released is immaterial further suggests
 
02:09:37.010 --> 02:09:37.020 align:start position:0%
a purely subjective limitations period
 
02:09:38.750 --> 02:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
in which claims may be brought based on
 
02:09:40.970 --> 02:09:40.980 align:start position:0%
alleged exposures occurring many years
 
02:09:43.609 --> 02:09:43.619 align:start position:0%
or decades in the past and so the end
 
02:09:45.290 --> 02:09:45.300 align:start position:0%
result is a bill that would subject
 
02:09:47.450 --> 02:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
businesses and other entities to
 
02:09:49.189 --> 02:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
potentially massive new liability
 
02:09:52.129 --> 02:09:52.139 align:start position:0%
exposure overnight at a time when many
 
02:09:53.450 --> 02:09:53.460 align:start position:0%
are still struggling to keep the lights
 
02:09:55.729 --> 02:09:55.739 align:start position:0%
on during the pandemic and for these
 
02:09:57.890 --> 02:09:57.900 align:start position:0%
reasons all of these reasons I
 
02:09:59.510 --> 02:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
respectfully urge this committee to
 
02:10:00.950 --> 02:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
reject this bill and I'd be pleased to
 
02:10:02.830 --> 02:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
02:10:05.689 --> 02:10:05.699 align:start position:0%
there are some questions representative
 
02:10:05.699 --> 02:10:08.990 align:start position:0%
there are some questions representative

02:10:08.990 --> 02:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:11.450 --> 02:10:11.460 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman thank
 
02:10:15.169 --> 02:10:15.179 align:start position:0%
you um Mr Appel for your testimony I
 
02:10:19.250 --> 02:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
noticed that um you represent 60 of the
 
02:10:22.490 --> 02:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
U.S property Casualty Insurance Market
 
02:10:25.790 --> 02:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what percent of the New
 
02:10:28.850 --> 02:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh property Casualty Insurance

Market you represent uh sorry I don't
 
02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
represent the insurance Market I
 
02:10:36.470 --> 02:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
represent the American tort reform
 
02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:38.030 align:start position:0%
represent the American tort reform
Association

02:10:38.030 --> 02:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
Association
 
02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
which is a broad-based group of
 
02:10:42.589 --> 02:10:42.599 align:start position:0%
businesses concerned about abuse in the
 
02:10:45.830 --> 02:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:49.370 --> 02:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
I I'm sorry I guess I misread the
 
02:10:53.390 --> 02:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
testimony that came in I I really do um
 
02:10:56.810 --> 02:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:00.470 --> 02:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
I see this testimony is from
 
02:11:03.950 --> 02:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
um apcia I thought it was uh your
 
02:11:08.330 --> 02:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
testimony I apologize no no worries
 
02:11:10.189 --> 02:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
I guess if I could just follow up on
 
02:11:12.410 --> 02:11:12.420 align:start position:0%
either members of your Association who
 
02:11:15.250 --> 02:11:15.260 align:start position:0%
are new hampshire-based companies
 
02:11:19.129 --> 02:11:19.139 align:start position:0%
uh I believe so I I mean it's a big
 
02:11:21.470 --> 02:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
organization so I would I would I don't
 
02:11:23.209 --> 02:11:23.219 align:start position:0%
want to say a hundred percent but I
 
02:11:24.709 --> 02:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
would I would be very surprised I don't
 
02:11:26.930 --> 02:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
know the exact membership list of
 
02:11:28.910 --> 02:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
everyone in atra so
 
02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:29.750 align:start position:0%
everyone in atra so
um

02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:31.250 --> 02:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:34.189 --> 02:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
represent representative page
 
02:11:36.050 --> 02:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
02:11:38.990 --> 02:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
Pell for um taking my question I'm I'm
 
02:11:41.330 --> 02:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
reading your written testimony
 
02:11:44.270 --> 02:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
um and I noticed that you've cited and
 
02:11:46.250 --> 02:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
in your testimony here today you've
 
02:11:50.810 --> 02:11:50.820 align:start position:0%
cited state courts that you suggest have
 
02:11:50.820 --> 02:11:51.950 align:start position:0%
cited state courts that you suggest have
rejected

02:11:51.950 --> 02:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
rejected
 
02:11:54.530 --> 02:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
um similar bills I I noticed there was a
 
02:11:56.390 --> 02:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
quote from a Supreme Court case that
 
02:11:58.189 --> 02:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
didn't have a citation
 
02:12:01.129 --> 02:12:01.139 align:start position:0%
in the letter and I'm not sure I see a
 
02:12:04.669 --> 02:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
citation to any State Court decisions
 
02:12:07.250 --> 02:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
um am I missing something
 
02:12:11.209 --> 02:12:11.219 align:start position:0%
um well my testimony does refer to only
 
02:12:15.709 --> 02:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
one Court decision which is the U.S
 
02:12:17.930 --> 02:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
Supreme Courts and it it you're right I
 
02:12:20.510 --> 02:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
didn't include the site to Metro north
 
02:12:22.729 --> 02:12:22.739 align:start position:0%
um first Buckley but that's the that's
 
02:12:25.910 --> 02:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
the U.S Supreme Court it just took out a
 
02:12:28.729 --> 02:12:28.739 align:start position:0%
few uh sentence uh statements by the
 
02:12:30.050 --> 02:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
court of just expressing concern about
 
02:12:32.209 --> 02:12:32.219 align:start position:0%
the flood and unpredictable liability
 
02:12:33.770 --> 02:12:33.780 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:12:35.750 --> 02:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
a theme throughout all the courts
 
02:12:37.669 --> 02:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
rejecting medical monitoring I mean this
 
02:12:40.010 --> 02:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
is again this is the majority of courts
 
02:12:41.570 --> 02:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
in the country
 
02:12:44.149 --> 02:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
um medical monitoring is a minority
 
02:12:46.669 --> 02:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
position and as I alluded to in my
 
02:12:49.069 --> 02:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
testimony the this approach of adopting
 
02:12:51.770 --> 02:12:51.780 align:start position:0%
a cause of action a separate cause of
 
02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
action is a minority approach even among
 
02:12:56.689 --> 02:12:56.699 align:start position:0%
the minority of states that adopt
 
02:12:59.149 --> 02:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
medical monitoring only five states in
 
02:13:01.490 --> 02:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
America adopt a cause of action a
 
02:13:02.810 --> 02:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
private cause of action for medical
 
02:13:04.850 --> 02:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
monitoring the other states actually
 
02:13:06.950 --> 02:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
that have allowed medical monitoring
 
02:13:08.569 --> 02:13:08.579 align:start position:0%
have done so as an element of Damages
 
02:13:11.689 --> 02:13:11.699 align:start position:0%
for an existing torque claim
 
02:13:13.609 --> 02:13:13.619 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman can I have a follow-up
 
02:13:17.330 --> 02:13:17.340 align:start position:0%
question you certainly may uh Mr Pell so
 
02:13:19.310 --> 02:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
could you provide the committee with
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
those I believe in you your oral
 
02:13:23.209 --> 02:13:23.219 align:start position:0%
testimony you mentioned a court in
 
02:13:25.910 --> 02:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
Illinois and other courts so I'm
 
02:13:27.410 --> 02:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could provide citations
 
02:13:29.510 --> 02:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
to the to the committee or I don't I
 
02:13:30.709 --> 02:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
don't see them
 
02:13:34.490 --> 02:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I mean do you want a citation
 
02:13:35.750 --> 02:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
for every
 
02:13:37.850 --> 02:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
State that's rejected medical monitoring
 
02:13:40.490 --> 02:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
I guess which whatever you had cited in
 
02:13:43.729 --> 02:13:43.739 align:start position:0%
your in your testimony here today
 
02:13:47.569 --> 02:13:47.579 align:start position:0%
um oh okay I mean I I can give a I can
 
02:13:49.129 --> 02:13:49.139 align:start position:0%
provide a list of citations I mean
 
02:13:50.990 --> 02:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of courts that have done
 
02:13:52.970 --> 02:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
02:13:56.330 --> 02:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Horrigan oh
 
02:13:58.010 --> 02:13:58.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair thank you
 
02:14:00.350 --> 02:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
very much Mr Rappel um
 
02:14:02.569 --> 02:14:02.579 align:start position:0%
uh well one thing that struck me strange
 
02:14:03.950 --> 02:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
was you you complained about the
 
02:14:05.930 --> 02:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
possibility of plaintiff's buying TV
 
02:14:08.030 --> 02:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
sets with your clients money and TV sets
 
02:14:08.990 --> 02:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
are actually
 
02:14:11.629 --> 02:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
uh thanks to technology so if you've
 
02:14:13.189 --> 02:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
been to Best Buy in the last 10 years
 
02:14:14.629 --> 02:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
you'll find they're much cheaper than
 
02:14:16.430 --> 02:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
they used to be but that's and of course
 
02:14:18.530 --> 02:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
some some of this does apply to class
 
02:14:20.089 --> 02:14:20.099 align:start position:0%
action suits which often pay off
 
02:14:22.069 --> 02:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
relatively small amounts of money but my
 
02:14:24.830 --> 02:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
main question is um just wanted to
 
02:14:26.870 --> 02:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
clarify you're not saying that medical
 
02:14:30.350 --> 02:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
monitoring is bad per se just that your
 
02:14:32.930 --> 02:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
your argument's about who should pay for
 
02:14:35.209 --> 02:14:35.219 align:start position:0%
when it's necessary is that the is that
 
02:14:37.069 --> 02:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
a correct summary of your position or if
 
02:14:39.229 --> 02:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
not maybe you can straighten me out well
 
02:14:40.970 --> 02:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
my my position would be that medical
 
02:14:43.370 --> 02:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
monitoring I mean the tort system has
 
02:14:46.189 --> 02:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
existed for Centuries with a fundamental
 
02:14:48.950 --> 02:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
principle that an injury is required for
 
02:14:51.410 --> 02:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
a tort recovery it's been it's really
 
02:14:53.030 --> 02:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
what's guided tort law it's been like
 
02:14:56.169 --> 02:14:56.179 align:start position:0%
the rudder in tort law this bill
 
02:14:59.930 --> 02:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
reverses that and to be clear other as I
 
02:15:01.609 --> 02:15:01.619 align:start position:0%
mentioned a few other states have have
 
02:15:03.470 --> 02:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
gone that route
 
02:15:06.649 --> 02:15:06.659 align:start position:0%
um but I I it's a public policy choice
 
02:15:09.050 --> 02:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
and I would argue that the public policy
 
02:15:09.060 --> 02:15:10.729 align:start position:0%
and I would argue that the public policy
favors

02:15:10.729 --> 02:15:10.739 align:start position:0%
favors
 
02:15:13.189 --> 02:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
retaining assets for those who actually
 
02:15:15.830 --> 02:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
develop a serious injury so you're not
 
02:15:18.109 --> 02:15:18.119 align:start position:0%
depleting the pool of resources for when
 
02:15:20.810 --> 02:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
they develop a very serious illness and
 
02:15:22.669 --> 02:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
because that's what I mean that's the
 
02:15:24.109 --> 02:15:24.119 align:start position:0%
history of asbestos litigation in
 
02:15:26.569 --> 02:15:26.579 align:start position:0%
America has taught us that lesson that
 
02:15:28.430 --> 02:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
you what happens when you open the
 
02:15:31.310 --> 02:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
doorway to unimpaired claimants is that
 
02:15:34.330 --> 02:15:34.340 align:start position:0%
the resources get drained from
 
02:15:37.430 --> 02:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
like the asbestos defendants for forcing
 
02:15:40.669 --> 02:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
many of them 120 of them into bankruptcy
 
02:15:42.410 --> 02:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
um and then what you have as a result
 
02:15:44.450 --> 02:15:44.460 align:start position:0%
and this took years this took a decade
 
02:15:46.850 --> 02:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
or two to actually occur but what you
 
02:15:48.410 --> 02:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
happen at the end of the day is you have
 
02:15:50.870 --> 02:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
people that now have developed a serious
 
02:15:53.569 --> 02:15:53.579 align:start position:0%
illness and are dying who don't get a
 
02:15:56.510 --> 02:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
full recovery because of this
 
02:15:59.569 --> 02:15:59.579 align:start position:0%
follow up yes you may follow up well
 
02:16:01.069 --> 02:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
first of all I guess maybe I should
 
02:16:02.569 --> 02:16:02.579 align:start position:0%
admit I mean I think I could still vote
 
02:16:05.270 --> 02:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
on this bill objectively but my uh late
 
02:16:07.850 --> 02:16:07.860 align:start position:0%
father who died uh 10 years ago some of
 
02:16:09.709 --> 02:16:09.719 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee uh
 
02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
probably knew him um he he was one of
 
02:16:15.530 --> 02:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
the I think it's hundreds of thousands
 
02:16:18.050 --> 02:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
or even millions of victims of the uh of
 
02:16:20.450 --> 02:16:20.460 align:start position:0%
the asbestos because he served in the uh
 
02:16:22.850 --> 02:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
served in the Navy in the 1950s when
 
02:16:24.830 --> 02:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
there's asbestos on everything so that's
 
02:16:26.209 --> 02:16:26.219 align:start position:0%
just sort of uh
 
02:16:29.209 --> 02:16:29.219 align:start position:0%
uh my I have a family member who had
 
02:16:31.129 --> 02:16:31.139 align:start position:0%
lost he was one of the victims of that
 
02:16:32.870 --> 02:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
and we
 
02:16:34.910 --> 02:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
we got a small amount of money of it but
 
02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:36.230 align:start position:0%
we got a small amount of money of it but
uh

02:16:36.230 --> 02:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:16:38.690 --> 02:16:38.700 align:start position:0%
but also my question is going through
 
02:16:40.610 --> 02:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
the monitoring is doesn't that help
 
02:16:44.030 --> 02:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
prevent uh a minor problem one that
 
02:16:46.549 --> 02:16:46.559 align:start position:0%
hasn't manifested itself from becoming
 
02:16:46.559 --> 02:16:47.509 align:start position:0%
hasn't manifested itself from becoming
something

02:16:47.509 --> 02:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:16:49.490 --> 02:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
like what killed my father which was
 
02:16:53.089 --> 02:16:53.099 align:start position:0%
mesothelioma so when
 
02:16:55.969 --> 02:16:55.979 align:start position:0%
would it be good would it better I mean
 
02:16:57.589 --> 02:16:57.599 align:start position:0%
put inside the question who pays for it
 
02:16:59.209 --> 02:16:59.219 align:start position:0%
but isn't it still a good thing to have
 
02:17:02.030 --> 02:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
medical monitoring so that uh small
 
02:17:05.990 --> 02:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
problems don't develop into fatal ones
 
02:17:07.790 --> 02:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
well I mean when you look at when you
 
02:17:09.049 --> 02:17:09.059 align:start position:0%
look at it like that again it's a
 
02:17:11.750 --> 02:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
balancing of interests it's whether or
 
02:17:14.270 --> 02:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
not it's worth it to pay for monitoring
 
02:17:17.270 --> 02:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
up front and I should point out that if
 
02:17:19.429 --> 02:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
someone gets an illness they can recover
 
02:17:22.610 --> 02:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
all the monitoring that they've as part
 
02:17:24.110 --> 02:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
of their injuries all the monitoring
 
02:17:25.790 --> 02:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
they've incurred to that point when
 
02:17:27.290 --> 02:17:27.300 align:start position:0%
they're when they actually have a
 
02:17:29.810 --> 02:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
physical injury but the idea that you're
 
02:17:32.690 --> 02:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
paying for a lot most people who won't
 
02:17:34.910 --> 02:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
even ever develop an injury and you're
 
02:17:37.370 --> 02:17:37.380 align:start position:0%
just giving them funds I would argue
 
02:17:39.110 --> 02:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
that the public policy does not favor
 
02:17:41.509 --> 02:17:41.519 align:start position:0%
that and that you're actually you're
 
02:17:43.549 --> 02:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
going to end up doing a disservice to
 
02:17:47.089 --> 02:17:47.099 align:start position:0%
those who die of a Syria or who contract
 
02:17:49.070 --> 02:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
a very serious illness later on because
 
02:17:51.169 --> 02:17:51.179 align:start position:0%
the resources might not be available for
 
02:17:51.179 --> 02:17:51.889 align:start position:0%
the resources might not be available for
them

02:17:51.889 --> 02:17:51.899 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:17:54.530 --> 02:17:54.540 align:start position:0%
no I mean yeah in all fairness in my
 
02:17:56.330 --> 02:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
case follow-up well
 
02:17:58.190 --> 02:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
not to get in debate I can save some of
 
02:18:00.650 --> 02:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
these excessive but of course in life
 
02:18:03.290 --> 02:18:03.300 align:start position:0%
our situation and uh it's probably true
 
02:18:06.110 --> 02:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
for almost all the families uh
 
02:18:08.330 --> 02:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
the money is not much of a consolation
 
02:18:09.770 --> 02:18:09.780 align:start position:0%
for what happened you know like we're
 
02:18:11.929 --> 02:18:11.939 align:start position:0%
our you know we are amazing is this a
 
02:18:11.939 --> 02:18:13.070 align:start position:0%
our you know we are amazing is this a
question

02:18:13.070 --> 02:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:18:13.080 --> 02:18:14.450 align:start position:0%
question
well

02:18:14.450 --> 02:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:18:15.709 --> 02:18:15.719 align:start position:0%
um do you find that the money makes much
 
02:18:17.870 --> 02:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
difference to the uh families who are
 
02:18:22.030 --> 02:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:25.910 --> 02:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
the tort system is compensating someone
 
02:18:27.770 --> 02:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
for a death of a loved one is never
 
02:18:29.270 --> 02:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
going to be enough I mean there's no
 
02:18:31.790 --> 02:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
amount that can replace that the tort
 
02:18:34.190 --> 02:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
system tries to do the best it can to
 
02:18:36.889 --> 02:18:36.899 align:start position:0%
right or wrong and that's what it and
 
02:18:38.509 --> 02:18:38.519 align:start position:0%
that's the goal and
 
02:18:38.519 --> 02:18:40.030 align:start position:0%
that's the goal and
yes

02:18:40.030 --> 02:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
but millions of dollars for some people
 
02:18:44.570 --> 02:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
they value it differently some people
 
02:18:45.889 --> 02:18:45.899 align:start position:0%
they would find it to be an adequate
 
02:18:47.389 --> 02:18:47.399 align:start position:0%
recovery some people would say it's
 
02:18:49.549 --> 02:18:49.559 align:start position:0%
never enough so the tort system kind of
 
02:18:51.830 --> 02:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
splits the difference there and and does
 
02:18:53.690 --> 02:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
the the best it can but when you have
 
02:18:56.509 --> 02:18:56.519 align:start position:0%
unimpaired claimants recovering for an
 
02:18:58.669 --> 02:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
entry they might never develop that
 
02:19:00.830 --> 02:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
really puts a huge strain on the system
 
02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
and when you have a bill that's
 
02:19:05.509 --> 02:19:05.519 align:start position:0%
expansive as this one you really put all
 
02:19:08.270 --> 02:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
businesses uh Under Pressure I mean I
 
02:19:10.490 --> 02:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
earned her uh enormous strain and again
 
02:19:12.889 --> 02:19:12.899 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned it's a this is a trying
 
02:19:15.889 --> 02:19:15.899 align:start position:0%
time for the American economy in general
 
02:19:18.410 --> 02:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
um and so putting an extra strain right
 
02:19:20.330 --> 02:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
now I I would just argue is the public
 
02:19:22.490 --> 02:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
policy doesn't support that but again
 
02:19:24.770 --> 02:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
it's it it is a it's a topic where
 
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable Minds have different so I
 
02:19:27.770 --> 02:19:27.780 align:start position:0%
won't pretend that it's not
 
02:19:30.169 --> 02:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McLean
 
02:19:32.450 --> 02:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and if you'll indulge
 
02:19:33.589 --> 02:19:33.599 align:start position:0%
me I just have a couple of quick
 
02:19:36.049 --> 02:19:36.059 align:start position:0%
questions and thank you Mr Appel for
 
02:19:38.209 --> 02:19:38.219 align:start position:0%
taking my questions my first question is
 
02:19:43.790 --> 02:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
in the case uh of the asbestos asbestos
 
02:19:46.250 --> 02:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
um litigation that you cite where 120
 
02:19:49.250 --> 02:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
companies were put out of business was
 
02:19:51.590 --> 02:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
was there a negligence component to
 
02:19:54.410 --> 02:19:54.420 align:start position:0%
those 120 people uh or companies being
 
02:19:56.150 --> 02:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
put out of business or was it a strict
 
02:19:56.160 --> 02:19:57.770 align:start position:0%
put out of business or was it a strict
liability

02:19:57.770 --> 02:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
liability
 
02:19:59.150 --> 02:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
um or was there a negligence component
 
02:20:01.190 --> 02:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
in that case
 
02:20:03.170 --> 02:20:03.180 align:start position:0%
um I mean I can't speak to all the cases
 
02:20:04.550 --> 02:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
obviously but I would I would imagine
 
02:20:07.010 --> 02:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
there's there's strict liability claims
 
02:20:09.349 --> 02:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
and negligence claims included in many
 
02:20:12.469 --> 02:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
of them okay so and just a quick
 
02:20:14.330 --> 02:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
follow-up subsequent to the Metro North
 
02:20:16.670 --> 02:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
decision there have been
 
02:20:20.090 --> 02:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
um many times in state courts
 
02:20:22.370 --> 02:20:22.380 align:start position:0%
um where there has been negligence that
 
02:20:25.610 --> 02:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
the the case has been successful
 
02:20:27.290 --> 02:20:27.300 align:start position:0%
um you know Bauer versus Westinghouse
 
02:20:30.710 --> 02:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
and uh Donovan versus Philip Morris and
 
02:20:32.810 --> 02:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
and I think those have not had any
 
02:20:36.170 --> 02:20:36.180 align:start position:0%
issues but you did mention an Illinois
 
02:20:36.180 --> 02:20:37.790 align:start position:0%
issues but you did mention an Illinois
case

02:20:37.790 --> 02:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:20:40.070 --> 02:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
um just last year where the court
 
02:20:41.809 --> 02:20:41.819 align:start position:0%
overturned it
 
02:20:44.090 --> 02:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
um now was was there a negligent
 
02:20:46.010 --> 02:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
component to that or can you share any
 
02:20:48.710 --> 02:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
of the details of that case with us uh
 
02:20:51.469 --> 02:20:51.479 align:start position:0%
yeah uh so there was uh I believe there
 
02:20:53.150 --> 02:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
was a negligent component to it it was
 
02:20:55.849 --> 02:20:55.859 align:start position:0%
uh I actually have a
 
02:20:59.809 --> 02:20:59.819 align:start position:0%
it was a with um lead exposure in
 
02:21:02.210 --> 02:21:02.220 align:start position:0%
alleged lead poisoning in the city water
 
02:21:06.349 --> 02:21:06.359 align:start position:0%
lines uh in Illinois so uh the city of
 
02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
Chicago sued
 
02:21:10.910 --> 02:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
um on behalf of City residents to
 
02:21:13.010 --> 02:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
replace the water mains essentially and
 
02:21:15.410 --> 02:21:15.420 align:start position:0%
wanted medical monitoring for
 
02:21:18.110 --> 02:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
I I mean a broad group maybe the whole
 
02:21:20.210 --> 02:21:20.220 align:start position:0%
city of Chicago or whatever affected
 
02:21:22.849 --> 02:21:22.859 align:start position:0%
area that was in Chicago
 
02:21:22.859 --> 02:21:23.510 align:start position:0%
area that was in Chicago
um

02:21:23.510 --> 02:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:26.450 --> 02:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
and then uh the court rejected it and
 
02:21:30.650 --> 02:21:30.660 align:start position:0%
among other things the court said uh
 
02:21:33.770 --> 02:21:33.780 align:start position:0%
that uh the court reaffirmed the present
 
02:21:35.570 --> 02:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
injury require physical present physical
 
02:21:37.550 --> 02:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
injury requirements that it establishes
 
02:21:39.530 --> 02:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
a workable standard for judges and
 
02:21:41.570 --> 02:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
juries who must determine liability
 
02:21:44.030 --> 02:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
protects court dockets from becoming
 
02:21:46.610 --> 02:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
clogged with comparatively unimportant
 
02:21:49.250 --> 02:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
or trivial claims and reduces the threat
 
02:21:52.849 --> 02:21:52.859 align:start position:0%
of unlimited and unpredictable liability
 
02:21:54.590 --> 02:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
um so they the court said there are very
 
02:21:57.110 --> 02:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
practical reasons for requiring a
 
02:21:59.090 --> 02:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
showing of actual or realized harm
 
02:22:01.610 --> 02:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
before permitting recovery and tort that
 
02:22:04.010 --> 02:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
was the that in the case is City of
 
02:22:06.410 --> 02:22:06.420 align:start position:0%
Chicago versus Barry
 
02:22:08.750 --> 02:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
um which is September of last year
 
02:22:12.050 --> 02:22:12.060 align:start position:0%
and I can include that uh I know I
 
02:22:14.270 --> 02:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
said I was going to put the some sites
 
02:22:15.770 --> 02:22:15.780 align:start position:0%
to at least the state High courts and
 
02:22:18.410 --> 02:22:18.420 align:start position:0%
you mentioned Bauer in West Virginia and
 
02:22:21.290 --> 02:22:21.300 align:start position:0%
Donovan in Massachusetts
 
02:22:21.300 --> 02:22:22.250 align:start position:0%
Donovan in Massachusetts
um

02:22:22.250 --> 02:22:22.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:24.889 --> 02:22:24.899 align:start position:0%
though I mean power is probably it will
 
02:22:26.630 --> 02:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
probably the most criticized medical
 
02:22:29.690 --> 02:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
monitoring case in American history but
 
02:22:32.630 --> 02:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
um those are some of the broad uh Bauer
 
02:22:34.370 --> 02:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
in particular is probably the broadest
 
02:22:37.250 --> 02:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
of of medical monitoring and in the case
 
02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
of asbestos
 
02:22:42.230 --> 02:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
the the state legislature adopted
 
02:22:45.349 --> 02:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
specific asbestos reforms later because
 
02:22:49.070 --> 02:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
of the uh the abusive nature of it
 
02:22:52.250 --> 02:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
um there's I believe West Virginia and
 
02:22:54.650 --> 02:22:54.660 align:start position:0%
of the five states that allow a cause of
 
02:22:57.110 --> 02:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
action for medical monitoring uh I know
 
02:22:59.750 --> 02:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
West Virginia and Florida have both
 
02:23:01.969 --> 02:23:01.979 align:start position:0%
adopted medical asbestos medical
 
02:23:04.969 --> 02:23:04.979 align:start position:0%
criteria laws which effectively require
 
02:23:07.010 --> 02:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
a present showing of a present injury
 
02:23:09.349 --> 02:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
before they can proceed in the tort
 
02:23:09.359 --> 02:23:10.309 align:start position:0%
before they can proceed in the tort
system

02:23:10.309 --> 02:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:23:13.190 --> 02:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you are there any other
 
02:23:17.590 --> 02:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:20.090 --> 02:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:23:28.130 --> 02:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:30.230 --> 02:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:23:32.570 --> 02:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
um I got a text and it said there that
 
02:23:34.969 --> 02:23:34.979 align:start position:0%
perhaps I did not recognize uh
 
02:23:37.070 --> 02:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
representative D Lorenzo with the last
 
02:23:38.809 --> 02:23:38.819 align:start position:0%
speaker would representative Cushing for
 
02:23:41.630 --> 02:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
her question and do you still have a
 
02:23:43.490 --> 02:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
question for representative Cushing if
 
02:23:45.469 --> 02:23:45.479 align:start position:0%
he's available
 
02:23:48.710 --> 02:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
I almost said Mr chairman thank you okay
 
02:23:53.090 --> 02:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
I apologize if I if I missed you sorry
 
02:23:53.100 --> 02:23:54.530 align:start position:0%
I apologize if I if I missed you sorry

the next speaker is uh when uh Wendy
 
02:23:57.720 --> 02:24:06.889 align:start position:0%
the next speaker is uh when uh Wendy
Thomas

02:24:06.889 --> 02:24:06.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:10.370 --> 02:24:10.380 align:start position:0%

inviting me to this well thank you for
 
02:24:19.370 --> 02:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
having me at this committee uh Mr chair
 
02:24:21.469 --> 02:24:21.479 align:start position:0%
esteemed colleagues of the Judiciary
 
02:24:23.929 --> 02:24:23.939 align:start position:0%
Committee I am former representative
 
02:24:26.030 --> 02:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas for Merrimack and I come
 
02:24:29.630 --> 02:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
before you in support of House Bill 368
 
02:24:31.969 --> 02:24:31.979 align:start position:0%
a bill that will allow a claim for
 
02:24:34.550 --> 02:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
medical monitoring to be made if a
 
02:24:36.770 --> 02:24:36.780 align:start position:0%
specific if specific conditions are met
 
02:24:39.370 --> 02:24:39.380 align:start position:0%
if a party has been found to cause
 
02:24:42.830 --> 02:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
exposure to a designated hazardous or
 
02:24:45.110 --> 02:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
toxic substance which increases risk of
 
02:24:46.610 --> 02:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
illness or disease
 
02:24:49.309 --> 02:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
I live in Merrimack we have a private
 
02:24:53.090 --> 02:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
well that in 2016 tested so high with
 
02:24:55.429 --> 02:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
pfas chemicals that we had to stop using
 
02:24:56.809 --> 02:24:56.819 align:start position:0%
our water
 
02:24:58.910 --> 02:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
we have been on bottled water for the
 
02:25:02.450 --> 02:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
last five years every month we get 164
 
02:25:04.550 --> 02:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
gallons of water delivered to our house
 
02:25:07.070 --> 02:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
and that's what we use for drinking
 
02:25:09.950 --> 02:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
cooking and water for our pets
 
02:25:12.349 --> 02:25:12.359 align:start position:0%
five years later our well was recently
 
02:25:15.530 --> 02:25:15.540 align:start position:0%
tested in this past January and our well
 
02:25:17.510 --> 02:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
is still testing at three times the
 
02:25:20.150 --> 02:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
level of allowable contamination
 
02:25:22.730 --> 02:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
our well has been contaminated that we
 
02:25:25.730 --> 02:25:25.740 align:start position:0%
know about for half a decade
 
02:25:28.250 --> 02:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
and yet I and my six children have never
 
02:25:31.130 --> 02:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
been evaluated for pfas contamination in
 
02:25:33.469 --> 02:25:33.479 align:start position:0%
our bodies we have never had a blood
 
02:25:35.389 --> 02:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
test to see if these chemicals exist
 
02:25:37.550 --> 02:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
inside of us
 
02:25:40.450 --> 02:25:40.460 align:start position:0%
pfas chemicals are a hormone disrupter
 
02:25:43.190 --> 02:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
my daughters may have fertility issues
 
02:25:46.010 --> 02:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
if we knew how much pfas is in their
 
02:25:48.410 --> 02:25:48.420 align:start position:0%
bodies we could be on the lookout for
 
02:25:51.950 --> 02:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
fertility issues and breast cancer
 
02:25:54.110 --> 02:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
pfas chemicals can cause learning
 
02:25:54.120 --> 02:25:55.250 align:start position:0%
pfas chemicals can cause learning
disabilities

02:25:55.250 --> 02:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
02:25:57.290 --> 02:25:57.300 align:start position:0%
if we know a child with a learning
 
02:25:59.889 --> 02:25:59.899 align:start position:0%
disability has pfas in their system
 
02:26:02.030 --> 02:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could offer them different
 
02:26:04.550 --> 02:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
services or a different approach to
 
02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:05.950 align:start position:0%
services or a different approach to
teaching

02:26:05.950 --> 02:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
teaching
 
02:26:09.830 --> 02:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
pfas causes kidney damage as a woman who
 
02:26:12.349 --> 02:26:12.359 align:start position:0%
has nursed all six of her children and
 
02:26:14.630 --> 02:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
ended and ended up drinking a lot of our
 
02:26:17.690 --> 02:26:17.700 align:start position:0%
wells contaminated water I may end up
 
02:26:20.450 --> 02:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
with kidney disease if I know the extent
 
02:26:22.670 --> 02:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
of the chemicals in my body my doctor
 
02:26:26.690 --> 02:26:26.700 align:start position:0%
might request increased kidney testing
 
02:26:30.170 --> 02:26:30.180 align:start position:0%
and more significantly pfas is an
 
02:26:32.210 --> 02:26:32.220 align:start position:0%
emerging contaminant which means that we
 
02:26:33.889 --> 02:26:33.899 align:start position:0%
are still learning about it
 
02:26:36.170 --> 02:26:36.180 align:start position:0%
tancobain considers it important enough
 
02:26:38.750 --> 02:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
to test our well water but we have no
 
02:26:41.090 --> 02:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
way of testing our bodies
 
02:26:43.610 --> 02:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
this is particularly critical now
 
02:26:46.429 --> 02:26:46.439 align:start position:0%
because there are new reports that
 
02:26:48.889 --> 02:26:48.899 align:start position:0%
populations contaminated contaminated
 
02:26:51.469 --> 02:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
with pfas seem to have more
 
02:26:54.469 --> 02:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
susceptibility to the covid virus and
 
02:26:57.110 --> 02:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
alarmingly pfas in the blood seems to
 
02:27:00.050 --> 02:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
interfere with the efficacy of the covid
 
02:27:00.060 --> 02:27:01.610 align:start position:0%
interfere with the efficacy of the covid
vaccine

02:27:01.610 --> 02:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
02:27:04.190 --> 02:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
communities that are hard hit by pfest
 
02:27:07.730 --> 02:27:07.740 align:start position:0%
may need to have additional vaccines or
 
02:27:09.950 --> 02:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
regular boosters in order for them to
 
02:27:11.270 --> 02:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
remain healthy
 
02:27:13.610 --> 02:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
we need this information gathered from
 
02:27:15.590 --> 02:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
medical monitoring to make our health
 
02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:16.849 align:start position:0%
medical monitoring to make our health
decisions

02:27:16.849 --> 02:27:16.859 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
02:27:19.309 --> 02:27:19.319 align:start position:0%
no one should get sick simply because of
 
02:27:20.570 --> 02:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
where they live
 
02:27:23.630 --> 02:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
medical monitoring gives us control over
 
02:27:25.610 --> 02:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
our own health
 
02:27:27.889 --> 02:27:27.899 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is that we did not put
 
02:27:30.770 --> 02:27:30.780 align:start position:0%
these chemicals into our bodies we have
 
02:27:32.870 --> 02:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
them because we ingested chemicals from
 
02:27:36.110 --> 02:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
from industrial contaminated water
 
02:27:38.030 --> 02:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
if we have a right to see how much of
 
02:27:40.610 --> 02:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
these chemicals are in our water surely
 
02:27:42.349 --> 02:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
we have a right to know how much of
 
02:27:44.750 --> 02:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
these chemicals are in our bodies
 
02:27:46.730 --> 02:27:46.740 align:start position:0%
this bill which provides medical
 
02:27:49.969 --> 02:27:49.979 align:start position:0%
monitoring for pfas is an important step
 
02:27:51.950 --> 02:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
to protect the rights and health of New
 
02:27:54.650 --> 02:27:54.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents affected by pfas
 
02:27:57.170 --> 02:27:57.180 align:start position:0%
contamination from industrial pollution
 
02:28:01.730 --> 02:28:01.740 align:start position:0%
I urge you to vote OTP thank you
 
02:28:03.349 --> 02:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:28:06.830 --> 02:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative Sylvia
 
02:28:08.690 --> 02:28:08.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:28:12.170 --> 02:28:12.180 align:start position:0%
taking my question honorable Thomas
 
02:28:12.180 --> 02:28:13.910 align:start position:0%
taking my question honorable Thomas
um

02:28:13.910 --> 02:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:17.090 --> 02:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
I you say that
 
02:28:20.330 --> 02:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
testing is not available to find out how
 
02:28:23.150 --> 02:28:23.160 align:start position:0%
much pfas is in your body I I assume
 
02:28:24.950 --> 02:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
there is a test that would see how much
 
02:28:27.650 --> 02:28:27.660 align:start position:0%
is in your blood do you know what the
 
02:28:31.130 --> 02:28:31.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:33.170 --> 02:28:33.180 align:start position:0%
I don't have that information I think
 
02:28:35.030 --> 02:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
the last time that people talked about
 
02:28:37.550 --> 02:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
this it was around 400
 
02:28:37.560 --> 02:28:38.090 align:start position:0%
this it was around 400
.

02:28:38.090 --> 02:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
.
 
02:28:39.530 --> 02:28:39.540 align:start position:0%
um but
 
02:28:41.570 --> 02:28:41.580 align:start position:0%
I am not going to say that that's that's
 
02:28:43.130 --> 02:28:43.140 align:start position:0%
the price because I don't have it in
 
02:28:44.450 --> 02:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
front of me
 
02:28:44.460 --> 02:28:45.410 align:start position:0%
front of me
um

02:28:45.410 --> 02:28:45.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:48.349 --> 02:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
but what one of the issues is that a lot
 
02:28:50.210 --> 02:28:50.220 align:start position:0%
of Physicians don't even know what test
 
02:28:52.130 --> 02:28:52.140 align:start position:0%
to order and that's that's the bigger
 
02:28:52.140 --> 02:28:53.450 align:start position:0%
to order and that's that's the bigger
issue

02:28:53.450 --> 02:28:53.460 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:28:55.610 --> 02:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
um they you know if you go many
 
02:28:57.170 --> 02:28:57.180 align:start position:0%
Physicians don't don't know anything
 
02:28:59.210 --> 02:28:59.220 align:start position:0%
about pfas and this is something we keep
 
02:29:02.150 --> 02:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
bumping up to bumping up against in in
 
02:29:04.670 --> 02:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
Merrimack you know our residents go to
 
02:29:07.130 --> 02:29:07.140 align:start position:0%
doctors and they talk about uh pfas
 
02:29:08.809 --> 02:29:08.819 align:start position:0%
contamination and the doctors simply
 
02:29:11.450 --> 02:29:11.460 align:start position:0%
don't know what to order or how to to
 
02:29:13.730 --> 02:29:13.740 align:start position:0%
monitor the conditions and potential
 
02:29:16.849 --> 02:29:16.859 align:start position:0%
conditions follow-up Miss chairman yep
 
02:29:19.610 --> 02:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
go ahead so
 
02:29:22.750 --> 02:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
you're asking for medical monitoring but
 
02:29:25.370 --> 02:29:25.380 align:start position:0%
you're you're also saying that doctors
 
02:29:27.230 --> 02:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
don't know what to look for I'm I'm
 
02:29:30.050 --> 02:29:30.060 align:start position:0%
confused by that can you help clarify
 
02:29:32.630 --> 02:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
um well Matt I'm assuming that medical
 
02:29:34.610 --> 02:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
monitoring would be a standardized
 
02:29:37.610 --> 02:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
approach to testing blood and and body
 
02:29:41.510 --> 02:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
tissue for pfat contamination so so part
 
02:29:42.469 --> 02:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
of this
 
02:29:45.170 --> 02:29:45.180 align:start position:0%
um medical monitoring would be educating
 
02:29:47.389 --> 02:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
the medical community on which tests to
 
02:29:47.399 --> 02:29:48.710 align:start position:0%
the medical community on which tests to
perform

02:29:48.710 --> 02:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
perform
 
02:29:51.050 --> 02:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:29:53.210 --> 02:29:53.220 align:start position:0%
are there
 
02:29:55.250 --> 02:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
any other questions for former
 
02:29:58.550 --> 02:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:00.349 --> 02:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:30:02.570 --> 02:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
today thank you very much
 
02:30:04.730 --> 02:30:04.740 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
02:30:07.670 --> 02:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
testify today if so please raise your
 
02:30:07.680 --> 02:30:08.690 align:start position:0%
testify today if so please raise your
hand

02:30:08.690 --> 02:30:08.700 align:start position:0%
hand
 
02:30:10.969 --> 02:30:10.979 align:start position:0%
someone from New Hampshire safe water
 
02:30:14.090 --> 02:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
has raised their hand
 
02:30:16.490 --> 02:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
yes hi this is uh former representative
 
02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
Mindy Mesmer uh of rye and I am grateful
 
02:30:22.490 --> 02:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
to the committee for hearing this bill
 
02:30:25.630 --> 02:30:25.640 align:start position:0%
as representative Cushing stated this is
 
02:30:33.650 --> 02:30:33.660 align:start position:0%
HB 368 is a submittal of HB 661 and a
 
02:30:36.550 --> 02:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
prior bill that was submitted in 2017
 
02:30:39.670 --> 02:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
that looks to
 
02:30:42.590 --> 02:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
have medical monitoring be part of an
 
02:30:45.230 --> 02:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
award and by a judge and it signals to
 
02:30:47.750 --> 02:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
signal to the court that the general
 
02:30:51.070 --> 02:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
court agrees that this is necessary
 
02:30:53.690 --> 02:30:53.700 align:start position:0%
and I would like to say you know this is
 
02:30:55.610 --> 02:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
an important issue for many communities
 
02:30:57.349 --> 02:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire not just
 
02:30:59.450 --> 02:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
with respect to pfas which is something
 
02:31:01.969 --> 02:31:01.979 align:start position:0%
you've heard about prior to this to my
 
02:31:04.730 --> 02:31:04.740 align:start position:0%
testimony but also with respect to
 
02:31:06.650 --> 02:31:06.660 align:start position:0%
people that are suffering from exposure
 
02:31:10.370 --> 02:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
to gasoline mtbe which is a big issue
 
02:31:12.650 --> 02:31:12.660 align:start position:0%
which we all know about here in the
 
02:31:14.990 --> 02:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire but it's also a
 
02:31:16.250 --> 02:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
question of whether or not the people
 
02:31:18.230 --> 02:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
should have the ability to know how
 
02:31:20.090 --> 02:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
their health can be monitored when
 
02:31:22.130 --> 02:31:22.140 align:start position:0%
they've been unknowingly exposed to
 
02:31:25.130 --> 02:31:25.140 align:start position:0%
chemicals that could impact their health
 
02:31:27.550 --> 02:31:27.560 align:start position:0%
and what those long-term impacts may be
 
02:31:30.770 --> 02:31:30.780 align:start position:0%
and to avoid the burden on our Health
 
02:31:33.889 --> 02:31:33.899 align:start position:0%
Care system for these Health impacts
 
02:31:35.870 --> 02:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
that may get out of control without
 
02:31:38.590 --> 02:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
earlier interventions
 
02:31:42.230 --> 02:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
as uh you may have heard there was a big
 
02:31:44.929 --> 02:31:44.939 align:start position:0%
study done with respect to pfas these
 
02:31:47.809 --> 02:31:47.819 align:start position:0%
teflon-like chemicals that have impacted
 
02:31:49.330 --> 02:31:49.340 align:start position:0%
a lot of the State of New Hampshire
 
02:31:52.010 --> 02:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
called the C8 science panel study which
 
02:31:54.429 --> 02:31:54.439 align:start position:0%
was done in 70 000 people which showed
 
02:31:57.110 --> 02:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
probable connections between six
 
02:31:59.150 --> 02:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
different outcomes kidney and testicular
 
02:32:01.730 --> 02:32:01.740 align:start position:0%
cancer ulcerative colitis thyroid
 
02:32:03.969 --> 02:32:03.979 align:start position:0%
disease high cholesterol and
 
02:32:06.469 --> 02:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
pregnancy-induced hypertension in fact
 
02:32:08.990 --> 02:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
the latter of which concerningly causes
 
02:32:10.790 --> 02:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
low birth weight it's been tied to
 
02:32:13.309 --> 02:32:13.319 align:start position:0%
limited nutrient and oxygen supply to
 
02:32:16.270 --> 02:32:16.280 align:start position:0%
unborn babies and results in other
 
02:32:19.670 --> 02:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
complications through birth many of
 
02:32:22.309 --> 02:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
these things if monitored early on or if
 
02:32:24.349 --> 02:32:24.359 align:start position:0%
we know about them could improve
 
02:32:26.929 --> 02:32:26.939 align:start position:0%
outcomes and reduce the cost burden on
 
02:32:28.790 --> 02:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
the Health Care system
 
02:32:33.650 --> 02:32:33.660 align:start position:0%
I am intimately familiar uh being from
 
02:32:36.889 --> 02:32:36.899 align:start position:0%
the Seacoast area uh related to the peas
 
02:32:38.929 --> 02:32:38.939 align:start position:0%
exposure where the peas Air Force Base
 
02:32:41.630 --> 02:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
the former Air Force uh the use of pfas
 
02:32:43.969 --> 02:32:43.979 align:start position:0%
containing chemicals has impacted
 
02:32:46.190 --> 02:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
severely the drinking water system on
 
02:32:48.349 --> 02:32:48.359 align:start position:0%
the Seacoast where 3 000 people
 
02:32:51.170 --> 02:32:51.180 align:start position:0%
including 250 children were proven to
 
02:32:53.750 --> 02:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
have been exposed to pfas and now have
 
02:32:55.910 --> 02:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
elevated levels of pfas in their serum
 
02:32:58.730 --> 02:32:58.740 align:start position:0%
and unknown health effects for the
 
02:33:01.309 --> 02:33:01.319 align:start position:0%
future for these children and families
 
02:33:03.170 --> 02:33:03.180 align:start position:0%
and one of the things I was mentioned
 
02:33:05.330 --> 02:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
prior is we are now starting to
 
02:33:08.210 --> 02:33:08.220 align:start position:0%
understand that people exposed to pfas
 
02:33:10.010 --> 02:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
with high burdens of pfas in their
 
02:33:12.530 --> 02:33:12.540 align:start position:0%
bodies or elevated levels could
 
02:33:14.929 --> 02:33:14.939 align:start position:0%
experience more severe impacts from
 
02:33:17.990 --> 02:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
covid-19 if they are if they can
 
02:33:20.570 --> 02:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
contract it there's also now emerging
 
02:33:22.969 --> 02:33:22.979 align:start position:0%
information about the efficacy of
 
02:33:24.950 --> 02:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
vaccines not just the coveted vaccine
 
02:33:28.730 --> 02:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
but many childhood vaccines and the uh
 
02:33:31.309 --> 02:33:31.319 align:start position:0%
exposure to these chemicals in
 
02:33:33.650 --> 02:33:33.660 align:start position:0%
children's bodies and particularly one
 
02:33:36.469 --> 02:33:36.479 align:start position:0%
of the pfas chemicals with respect to
 
02:33:39.290 --> 02:33:39.300 align:start position:0%
the efficacy of the covid-19 vaccine has
 
02:33:41.870 --> 02:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
just emerged so this is a very real
 
02:33:44.210 --> 02:33:44.220 align:start position:0%
issue I want to turn your attention also
 
02:33:47.090 --> 02:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
to the town of Merrimack where in
 
02:33:50.929 --> 02:33:50.939 align:start position:0%
response to my bill in 2017 they had to
 
02:33:54.230 --> 02:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
put in for an air permit saint-gobain
 
02:33:57.530 --> 02:33:57.540 align:start position:0%
performs Plastics they as part of that
 
02:34:00.650 --> 02:34:00.660 align:start position:0%
permit they were required to install a
 
02:34:03.469 --> 02:34:03.479 align:start position:0%
thermal oxidation unit on their
 
02:34:05.929 --> 02:34:05.939 align:start position:0%
emissions to control the contamination
 
02:34:07.969 --> 02:34:07.979 align:start position:0%
that they've caused across the southern
 
02:34:11.750 --> 02:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
portion of the state unfortunately that
 
02:34:14.750 --> 02:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
deadline to install that passed on
 
02:34:17.030 --> 02:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
February 10th and the town of Merrimack
 
02:34:20.330 --> 02:34:20.340 align:start position:0%
has indicated in our HB 737 statutory
 
02:34:22.250 --> 02:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
commission that they are looking at
 
02:34:24.349 --> 02:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
within days filing suit against
 
02:34:27.110 --> 02:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
cincobain to stop the collusion of our
 
02:34:28.730 --> 02:34:28.740 align:start position:0%
communities in New Hampshire
 
02:34:31.130 --> 02:34:31.140 align:start position:0%
that's great but the people of Merrimack
 
02:34:33.530 --> 02:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
deserve to know the impacts that this is
 
02:34:36.170 --> 02:34:36.180 align:start position:0%
and has caused to their health there's
 
02:34:38.630 --> 02:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
only been a random sample of about 218
 
02:34:40.550 --> 02:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
residents in the Merrimack area who have
 
02:34:43.849 --> 02:34:43.859 align:start position:0%
been able to get their blood tested for
 
02:34:47.270 --> 02:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
pfac pfas exposure and what we did learn
 
02:34:49.610 --> 02:34:49.620 align:start position:0%
from that small sample of random people
 
02:34:52.910 --> 02:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
is that the people of Merrimack have
 
02:34:55.070 --> 02:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
twice the national average of pfas in
 
02:34:56.510 --> 02:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
their blood
 
02:34:59.750 --> 02:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
and a paper which has now been accepted
 
02:35:02.750 --> 02:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
for a National Conference will detail
 
02:35:05.389 --> 02:35:05.399 align:start position:0%
how the people of Merrimack are subject
 
02:35:07.490 --> 02:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
to increased risk of adult developing
 
02:35:10.490 --> 02:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
colon cancer laryngitis laryngeal cancer
 
02:35:12.889 --> 02:35:12.899 align:start position:0%
kidney and renal cancer brain and
 
02:35:15.830 --> 02:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
Central Nervous cancer and Leukemia and
 
02:35:17.929 --> 02:35:17.939 align:start position:0%
when compared to national averages the
 
02:35:19.910 --> 02:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
residents of Merrimack are statistically
 
02:35:19.920 --> 02:35:22.389 align:start position:0%
residents of Merrimack are statistically
significantly

02:35:22.389 --> 02:35:22.399 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
02:35:26.330 --> 02:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
at risk for mesothelioma as a esophageal
 
02:35:28.070 --> 02:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
cancer bladder cancer and thyroid
 
02:35:30.349 --> 02:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
cancers this will all be presented at a
 
02:35:33.710 --> 02:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
National Conference in in April uh so
 
02:35:36.469 --> 02:35:36.479 align:start position:0%
this bill is really about uh as uh
 
02:35:39.410 --> 02:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
representative McLean pointed out uh
 
02:35:44.330 --> 02:35:44.340 align:start position:0%
proving that there is uh online a under
 
02:35:47.929 --> 02:35:47.939 align:start position:0%
um 125 t31a that the defendant has
 
02:35:50.809 --> 02:35:50.819 align:start position:0%
negligently caused exposure and that the
 
02:35:53.270 --> 02:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
plaintiff now suffers an increased risk
 
02:35:55.490 --> 02:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
of illness or disease and as I've
 
02:35:57.349 --> 02:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
outlined there are several of these
 
02:35:59.090 --> 02:35:59.100 align:start position:0%
diseases associated with exposure just
 
02:36:02.750 --> 02:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
to pfast that if detected early on could
 
02:36:04.670 --> 02:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
save the Health Care System a
 
02:36:07.370 --> 02:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
significant cost and also perhaps change
 
02:36:10.490 --> 02:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
the um the outcome of the health of
 
02:36:12.770 --> 02:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
these people in the future as someone
 
02:36:14.710 --> 02:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
who has been
 
02:36:18.050 --> 02:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
directly impacted now not only by the
 
02:36:20.870 --> 02:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
kova 19 issue in our communities but
 
02:36:23.389 --> 02:36:23.399 align:start position:0%
also have a family member that has
 
02:36:24.950 --> 02:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
suffered is suffering from an
 
02:36:27.290 --> 02:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
environmentally triggered cancer I find
 
02:36:29.590 --> 02:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
this to be an extremely
 
02:36:31.910 --> 02:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
important bill and I asked the committee
 
02:36:34.070 --> 02:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
to seriously consider passing it once
 
02:36:37.370 --> 02:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
again and ask for your support thank you
 
02:36:38.389 --> 02:36:38.399 align:start position:0%
very much
 
02:36:40.730 --> 02:36:40.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:36:45.469 --> 02:36:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:48.710 --> 02:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:36:51.050 --> 02:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
um The Honorable uh Master for taking my
 
02:36:51.060 --> 02:36:52.429 align:start position:0%
um The Honorable uh Master for taking my
question

02:36:52.429 --> 02:36:52.439 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:36:54.770 --> 02:36:54.780 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering we'd had some testimony
 
02:36:57.830 --> 02:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
earlier about the high cost of testing
 
02:36:59.870 --> 02:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh broad spectrum of New Hampshire
 
02:37:01.969 --> 02:37:01.979 align:start position:0%
citizens prior to them being identified
 
02:37:05.330 --> 02:37:05.340 align:start position:0%
as having high levels of pfas I'm
 
02:37:08.330 --> 02:37:08.340 align:start position:0%
wondering if uh you have any data on the
 
02:37:10.849 --> 02:37:10.859 align:start position:0%
cost of you know early detection and
 
02:37:13.309 --> 02:37:13.319 align:start position:0%
early treatment outcomes
 
02:37:16.610 --> 02:37:16.620 align:start position:0%
um so if the medical monitoring is done
 
02:37:19.190 --> 02:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
um does that cost as both in lost of
 
02:37:20.750 --> 02:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
life and medical costs does it
 
02:37:23.090 --> 02:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
compensate for that broad testing cost
 
02:37:24.590 --> 02:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:37:26.510 --> 02:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
I would thank you for the question
 
02:37:28.969 --> 02:37:28.979 align:start position:0%
representative mcbeath I I do believe
 
02:37:30.950 --> 02:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
that you know if things like
 
02:37:32.870 --> 02:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
hypertension during pregnancy can be
 
02:37:35.270 --> 02:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
controlled certainly the outcome of that
 
02:37:37.670 --> 02:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
birth could be affected in a positive
 
02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:38.750 align:start position:0%
birth could be affected in a positive
way

02:37:38.750 --> 02:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:37:40.250 --> 02:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
um things like thyroid disease and high
 
02:37:42.650 --> 02:37:42.660 align:start position:0%
cholesterol I can assume that those also
 
02:37:45.110 --> 02:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
detected early and controlled early on
 
02:37:48.170 --> 02:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
could result in much better outcomes for
 
02:37:50.450 --> 02:37:50.460 align:start position:0%
those people but in terms of the cancers
 
02:37:52.490 --> 02:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
I would have to go back and try to
 
02:37:54.889 --> 02:37:54.899 align:start position:0%
monetize some of these but um I'm sure
 
02:37:56.690 --> 02:37:56.700 align:start position:0%
there there is some information
 
02:37:58.910 --> 02:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
available about early intervention I
 
02:38:00.110 --> 02:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
mean that's why we do screening for
 
02:38:01.969 --> 02:38:01.979 align:start position:0%
breast cancer it's better to catch
 
02:38:03.770 --> 02:38:03.780 align:start position:0%
breast cancer at stage one than at stage
 
02:38:05.750 --> 02:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
four in terms of the outcome and the
 
02:38:07.190 --> 02:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
cost associated with treating with that
 
02:38:08.870 --> 02:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate your question and
 
02:38:11.270 --> 02:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely I mean I can I don't have
 
02:38:12.950 --> 02:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
numbers to tell you about the cost
 
02:38:15.650 --> 02:38:15.660 align:start position:0%
savings but I can certainly understand
 
02:38:18.530 --> 02:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
that those costs would be significant
 
02:38:21.530 --> 02:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much good
 
02:38:23.330 --> 02:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
are there
 
02:38:23.340 --> 02:38:25.790 align:start position:0%
are there
questions

02:38:25.790 --> 02:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:38:31.150 --> 02:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:33.950 --> 02:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today thank
 
02:38:35.630 --> 02:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
02:38:37.790 --> 02:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
02:38:39.770 --> 02:38:39.780 align:start position:0%
testify today who hasn't had that
 
02:38:39.780 --> 02:38:44.090 align:start position:0%
testify today who hasn't had that
opportunity

02:38:44.090 --> 02:38:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:47.809 --> 02:38:47.819 align:start position:0%
I don't see any hands up and therefore I
 
02:38:49.790 --> 02:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
will declare the hearing closed on House
 
02:38:54.710 --> 02:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:57.530 --> 02:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
and unless there's something else we
 
02:39:01.370 --> 02:39:01.380 align:start position:0%
need to address I will recess at this
 
02:39:02.570 --> 02:39:02.580 align:start position:0%
point in time indicate that the
 
02:39:03.950 --> 02:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee will oh
 
02:39:13.670 --> 02:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:16.190 --> 02:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
can't hear you representative Chase for
 
02:39:32.510 --> 02:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:34.429 --> 02:39:34.439 align:start position:0%
she sometimes struggles with the sound
 
02:39:39.590 --> 02:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:41.929 --> 02:39:41.939 align:start position:0%
there you go I don't know what happens
 
02:39:44.270 --> 02:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
here just quickly
 
02:39:44.280 --> 02:39:44.870 align:start position:0%
here just quickly
um

02:39:44.870 --> 02:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:47.389 --> 02:39:47.399 align:start position:0%
Mr chair you had told us there were 109
 
02:39:49.730 --> 02:39:49.740 align:start position:0%
oppositions did you say how many support
 
02:39:51.170 --> 02:39:51.180 align:start position:0%
there was
 
02:39:55.190 --> 02:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
no there was 109 in support three in
 
02:39:57.170 --> 02:39:57.180 align:start position:0%
opposition today thank you I missed that
 
02:40:00.710 --> 02:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:03.410 --> 02:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
uh Mr guest representative Horrigan well
 
02:40:05.210 --> 02:40:05.220 align:start position:0%
this is a pretty minor point it doesn't
 
02:40:07.490 --> 02:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
affect me but um my recollection is and
 
02:40:09.670 --> 02:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
we called the bowl we skipped over
 
02:40:11.570 --> 02:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
representative page who would have been
 
02:40:14.090 --> 02:40:14.100 align:start position:0%
the next to last person on the rotation
 
02:40:17.330 --> 02:40:17.340 align:start position:0%
aside from yourself so he uh he first is
 
02:40:17.340 --> 02:40:18.170 align:start position:0%
aside from yourself so he uh he first is
here

02:40:18.170 --> 02:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:40:19.550 --> 02:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if he's spoken but he
 
02:40:21.230 --> 02:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
has been here when I actually checked
 
02:40:23.030 --> 02:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
rolled back to me in the YouTube video
 
02:40:24.530 --> 02:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
and he was there right when they started
 
02:40:26.570 --> 02:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
recording so he's been here all along so
 
02:40:28.790 --> 02:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
certainly uh he should be checked off as
 
02:40:30.469 --> 02:40:30.479 align:start position:0%
present if he has not been checked off
 
02:40:31.910 --> 02:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
already so
 
02:40:34.130 --> 02:40:34.140 align:start position:0%
thank you thank him for his patience too
 
02:40:34.140 --> 02:40:36.469 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
02:40:41.110 --> 02:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
I thought he was checked off so
 
02:40:43.490 --> 02:40:43.500 align:start position:0%
that's probably you're probably correct
 
02:40:45.530 --> 02:40:45.540 align:start position:0%

we have four early bills which need to
 
03:57:20.090 --> 03:57:20.100 align:start position:0%
be addressed today for sure and then
 
03:57:22.010 --> 03:57:22.020 align:start position:0%
we'll get through as many other bills as
 
03:57:25.790 --> 03:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
I think we can do
 
03:57:29.450 --> 03:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
before we begin I just want to say that
 
03:57:29.460 --> 03:57:30.290 align:start position:0%
before we begin I just want to say that
um

03:57:30.290 --> 03:57:30.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:32.150 --> 03:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
this committee has been a pleasure to
 
03:57:35.809 --> 03:57:35.819 align:start position:0%
work with and up until this point
 
03:57:38.689 --> 03:57:38.699 align:start position:0%
uh We've
 
03:57:42.590 --> 03:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
had no reasons to have various dew point
 
03:57:45.229 --> 03:57:45.239 align:start position:0%
viewpoints or opinions and and to
 
03:57:47.269 --> 03:57:47.279 align:start position:0%
express them and we've worked together
 
03:57:48.650 --> 03:57:48.660 align:start position:0%
very well
 
03:57:50.510 --> 03:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
today probably will be the first time
 
03:57:52.429 --> 03:57:52.439 align:start position:0%
where people will have different points
 
03:57:54.110 --> 03:57:54.120 align:start position:0%
of view and different perspectives on
 
03:57:54.120 --> 03:57:55.309 align:start position:0%
of view and different perspectives on
items

03:57:55.309 --> 03:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
items
 
03:58:00.650 --> 03:58:00.660 align:start position:0%

03:58:03.410 --> 03:58:03.420 align:start position:0%
continue to work together cooperatively
 
03:58:05.990 --> 03:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
and even though we may have differences
 
03:58:09.189 --> 03:58:09.199 align:start position:0%
of opinions we'll work together
 
03:58:13.490 --> 03:58:13.500 align:start position:0%
uh well efficiently and cooperatively
 
03:58:15.530 --> 03:58:15.540 align:start position:0%
and respectfully and I and I know
 
03:58:17.210 --> 03:58:17.220 align:start position:0%
everybody will
 
03:58:21.950 --> 03:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:21.960 --> 03:58:22.729 align:start position:0%

03:58:22.729 --> 03:58:22.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:22.739 --> 03:58:24.469 align:start position:0%
um
the

03:58:24.469 --> 03:58:24.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:58:28.130 --> 03:58:28.140 align:start position:0%
we already have voted on four four bills
 
03:58:31.729 --> 03:58:31.739 align:start position:0%
which I have reported out the committee
 
03:58:35.030 --> 03:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
reports have been done and forwarded
 
03:58:38.210 --> 03:58:38.220 align:start position:0%
to the clerk's office
 
03:58:38.220 --> 03:58:41.150 align:start position:0%
to the clerk's office
the

03:58:41.150 --> 03:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:43.729 --> 03:58:43.739 align:start position:0%
and what I'll do is uh try to go through
 
03:58:47.990 --> 03:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
the bills as we have heard them the
 
03:58:50.150 --> 03:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
first bill we heard of course was House
 
03:58:55.370 --> 03:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
Bill 248 which we elected to retain
 
03:59:00.889 --> 03:59:00.899 align:start position:0%
the next bill was a cacr six
 
03:59:00.899 --> 03:59:03.170 align:start position:0%
the next bill was a cacr six
and

03:59:03.170 --> 03:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:59:06.590 --> 03:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
that is uh the bill
 
03:59:10.969 --> 03:59:10.979 align:start position:0%
with regard to extending the age for
 
03:59:16.729 --> 03:59:16.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:19.189 --> 03:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
and I guess I'd ask if anyone has a
 
03:59:19.199 --> 03:59:20.210 align:start position:0%
and I guess I'd ask if anyone has a
motion

03:59:59.269 --> 03:59:59.279 align:start position:0%
um a recommendation before you can move
 
04:00:01.610 --> 04:00:01.620 align:start position:0%

04:00:05.929 --> 04:00:05.939 align:start position:0%

foreign

04:00:08.929 --> 04:00:08.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:08.939 --> 04:00:10.670 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:00:10.670 --> 04:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:00:13.309 --> 04:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
do you want to make a motion with regard
 
04:00:17.030 --> 04:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
to a specific recommendation
 
04:00:19.010 --> 04:00:19.020 align:start position:0%
um sure I'll
 
04:00:21.290 --> 04:00:21.300 align:start position:0%
so to confirm so I would have to make
 
04:00:22.610 --> 04:00:22.620 align:start position:0%
the motion
 
04:00:26.090 --> 04:00:26.100 align:start position:0%
OTP in order to move an amendment
 
04:00:28.969 --> 04:00:28.979 align:start position:0%
I believe that's true okay um then yeah
 
04:00:31.550 --> 04:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
I'll move OTP
 
04:00:35.330 --> 04:00:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:41.210 --> 04:00:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:45.849 --> 04:00:45.859 align:start position:0%
and would you like to address your
 
04:00:48.590 --> 04:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
sure so I at this point I wouldn't speak
 
04:00:50.510 --> 04:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
to the amendment just the original Bill
 
04:00:50.520 --> 04:00:52.630 align:start position:0%
to the amendment just the original Bill
correct

04:00:52.630 --> 04:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:00:56.269 --> 04:00:56.279 align:start position:0%
Mr chair would it not be proper for
 
04:01:01.610 --> 04:01:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:04.610 --> 04:01:04.620 align:start position:0%
I believe that is the proper motion
 
04:01:07.070 --> 04:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative rise and then
 
04:01:09.050 --> 04:01:09.060 align:start position:0%
because he has to introduce the
 
04:01:11.090 --> 04:01:11.100 align:start position:0%
amendment and we have to vote on it
 
04:01:14.990 --> 04:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
before we can bring forward otpa that is
 
04:01:15.000 --> 04:01:18.229 align:start position:0%
before we can bring forward otpa that is
correct

04:01:18.229 --> 04:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:20.389 --> 04:01:20.399 align:start position:0%
and now he's going to introduce his
 
04:01:22.370 --> 04:01:22.380 align:start position:0%
Amendment then we will vote on the
 
04:01:25.670 --> 04:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
amendment and if it passes then he will
 
04:01:29.269 --> 04:01:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:31.670 --> 04:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
right well he he's going to introduce
 
04:01:34.130 --> 04:01:34.140 align:start position:0%
his Amendment now
 
04:01:37.250 --> 04:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
and so basically representative Kenny
 
04:01:38.870 --> 04:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
you're moving your amendment is that
 
04:01:38.880 --> 04:01:39.950 align:start position:0%
you're moving your amendment is that
correct

04:01:39.950 --> 04:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:01:42.650 --> 04:01:42.660 align:start position:0%
uh yes Mr chairman
 
04:01:46.250 --> 04:01:46.260 align:start position:0%
why don't you and is there a second on
 
04:01:48.889 --> 04:01:48.899 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
04:01:50.570 --> 04:01:50.580 align:start position:0%
representative Chase will second the
 
04:01:52.490 --> 04:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
amendment as well and do you want to
 
04:01:53.990 --> 04:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
address your Amendment
 
04:01:55.969 --> 04:01:55.979 align:start position:0%
uh yes please Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:01:57.590 --> 04:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
to representative rice and
 
04:01:58.910 --> 04:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative Smith for the guidance
 
04:01:59.990 --> 04:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's been a little bit since I've
 
04:02:01.670 --> 04:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
introduced an amendment
 
04:02:04.610 --> 04:02:04.620 align:start position:0%
um so basically it's a pretty simple
 
04:02:04.620 --> 04:02:05.870 align:start position:0%
um so basically it's a pretty simple
um Amendment

04:02:05.870 --> 04:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
um Amendment
 
04:02:09.530 --> 04:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
that kind of just uh takes out the part
 
04:02:12.530 --> 04:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
including the governor and the uh
 
04:02:12.540 --> 04:02:13.750 align:start position:0%
including the governor and the uh
Council

04:02:13.750 --> 04:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
Council
 
04:02:16.969 --> 04:02:16.979 align:start position:0%
approving the judge to continue at at
 
04:02:19.010 --> 04:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
the age of 70 and Beyond
 
04:02:21.769 --> 04:02:21.779 align:start position:0%
um I take that out and I'll I'll raise
 
04:02:24.290 --> 04:02:24.300 align:start position:0%
three points for you to consider
 
04:02:26.750 --> 04:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
um first I think that it is possible
 
04:02:29.630 --> 04:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
um unintended consequences could come uh
 
04:02:31.790 --> 04:02:31.800 align:start position:0%
with leaving the governor and the
 
04:02:33.229 --> 04:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
council involved
 
04:02:34.849 --> 04:02:34.859 align:start position:0%
um I don't think
 
04:02:36.590 --> 04:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
that you need too strong of an
 
04:02:38.750 --> 04:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
imagination to see uh where political
 
04:02:40.610 --> 04:02:40.620 align:start position:0%
pressure could come from uh the
 
04:02:43.490 --> 04:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
possibility that a judge at the age of
 
04:02:46.490 --> 04:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
68 69 70
 
04:02:49.550 --> 04:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
um could feel pressure to uh judge in a
 
04:02:52.729 --> 04:02:52.739 align:start position:0%
certain manner to stay on a politician's
 
04:02:54.950 --> 04:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
um good side I just think that it is
 
04:02:56.450 --> 04:02:56.460 align:start position:0%
very important
 
04:02:59.210 --> 04:02:59.220 align:start position:0%
to um make sure that there is no
 
04:03:02.030 --> 04:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
pressure on the judicial branch
 
04:03:03.889 --> 04:03:03.899 align:start position:0%
um number two I just I don't think that
 
04:03:05.689 --> 04:03:05.699 align:start position:0%
part of the bill is needed
 
04:03:08.450 --> 04:03:08.460 align:start position:0%
um at all I I think that we can find
 
04:03:11.809 --> 04:03:11.819 align:start position:0%
many of examples of Judges who if they
 
04:03:13.969 --> 04:03:13.979 align:start position:0%
decided to continue after 70
 
04:03:15.590 --> 04:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
should have had the right to do so no
 
04:03:17.809 --> 04:03:17.819 align:start position:0%
strings attached
 
04:03:19.490 --> 04:03:19.500 align:start position:0%
um and if you want to look at examples
 
04:03:21.170 --> 04:03:21.180 align:start position:0%
of individuals like that you can look at
 
04:03:22.729 --> 04:03:22.739 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor the chairman of this
 
04:03:25.790 --> 04:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
committee individuals who testified
 
04:03:25.800 --> 04:03:26.870 align:start position:0%
committee individuals who testified
um

04:03:26.870 --> 04:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:29.510 --> 04:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
and lastly
 
04:03:29.520 --> 04:03:30.110 align:start position:0%
and lastly
um

04:03:30.110 --> 04:03:30.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:33.590 --> 04:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
I I do believe that it makes the bill
 
04:03:36.530 --> 04:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
um stronger as as a whole so I I would
 
04:03:39.530 --> 04:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
urge my colleagues to support this
 
04:03:45.830 --> 04:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:49.610 --> 04:03:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:52.550 --> 04:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and uh thank you
 
04:03:54.229 --> 04:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
representative Kenny for the amendment
 
04:03:56.630 --> 04:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
one of the things also stated in the
 
04:03:59.090 --> 04:03:59.100 align:start position:0%
amendment is that no person shall hold
 
04:04:01.670 --> 04:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
the office or judge or serve as a judge
 
04:04:05.150 --> 04:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
of any Court in any case or controversy
 
04:04:09.050 --> 04:04:09.060 align:start position:0%
after he has attained uh the age of 75
 
04:04:12.229 --> 04:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
years so what exactly does that language
 
04:04:12.239 --> 04:04:16.030 align:start position:0%
years so what exactly does that language
mean

04:04:16.030 --> 04:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:19.610 --> 04:04:19.620 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so to my understanding
 
04:04:23.330 --> 04:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
um it would basically mean that after a
 
04:04:26.809 --> 04:04:26.819 align:start position:0%
judge hits 75 that
 
04:04:29.150 --> 04:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
um they would have to follow the same
 
04:04:30.769 --> 04:04:30.779 align:start position:0%
process that they follow now at the age
 
04:04:35.630 --> 04:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:35.640 --> 04:04:38.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:04:38.630 --> 04:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:42.590 --> 04:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
representative Macbeth okay
 
04:04:44.809 --> 04:04:44.819 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair
 
04:04:48.410 --> 04:04:48.420 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to uh speak to the motion in
 
04:04:51.050 --> 04:04:51.060 align:start position:0%
in favor of ought to pass
 
04:04:53.150 --> 04:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
um because I I feel and I think we've
 
04:04:55.250 --> 04:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
just recently been made aware again of
 
04:04:58.670 --> 04:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
how our judicial conduct uh committee uh
 
04:05:00.710 --> 04:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
works very well accepts complaints from
 
04:05:02.809 --> 04:05:02.819 align:start position:0%
publics at the public and does a good
 
04:05:06.950 --> 04:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
job of uh supervising and disciplining
 
04:05:08.750 --> 04:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
um and removing judges that aren't
 
04:05:10.729 --> 04:05:10.739 align:start position:0%
appropriate for all sorts of reasons so
 
04:05:13.250 --> 04:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
we don't need a special counsel or
 
04:05:16.429 --> 04:05:16.439 align:start position:0%
separate group to be looking over judges
 
04:05:18.830 --> 04:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
for just one particular category thank
 
04:05:18.840 --> 04:05:22.610 align:start position:0%
for just one particular category thank
you

04:05:22.610 --> 04:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:25.490 --> 04:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
third discussion
 
04:05:29.929 --> 04:05:29.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:32.150 --> 04:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
I'm still getting used to the new button
 
04:05:34.849 --> 04:05:34.859 align:start position:0%
um um I agree with uh representative
 
04:05:37.370 --> 04:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
Macbeth's comments however there was
 
04:05:39.170 --> 04:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
also testimony
 
04:05:43.130 --> 04:05:43.140 align:start position:0%
um that going beyond the age of 70 might
 
04:05:46.010 --> 04:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
inhibit the bringing of of fresh blood
 
04:05:49.010 --> 04:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
onto the court and also I don't think
 
04:05:51.889 --> 04:05:51.899 align:start position:0%
that there was any testimony
 
04:05:53.809 --> 04:05:53.819 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
04:05:58.670 --> 04:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh that really established a need uh
 
04:06:00.950 --> 04:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
compelling enough to bring forth a
 
04:06:03.410 --> 04:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment we have lots of
 
04:06:05.750 --> 04:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
judges in the pipeline
 
04:06:08.030 --> 04:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
um so I really don't see anything in
 
04:06:08.040 --> 04:06:08.750 align:start position:0%
um so I really don't see anything in
this

04:06:08.750 --> 04:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:06:11.389 --> 04:06:11.399 align:start position:0%
particular casr where there's a need
 
04:06:13.910 --> 04:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
that would drive uh doing a
 
04:06:19.070 --> 04:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:21.170 --> 04:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
president Macbeth
 
04:06:23.750 --> 04:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you your honor um if I could just
 
04:06:26.090 --> 04:06:26.100 align:start position:0%
speak to representative McLean's um I I
 
04:06:29.630 --> 04:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
agree with you that um maybe when you
 
04:06:31.309 --> 04:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
talk about fresh blood if you're just
 
04:06:33.710 --> 04:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
looking for young blood uh you might be
 
04:06:36.290 --> 04:06:36.300 align:start position:0%
correct but this day and age there are a
 
04:06:37.969 --> 04:06:37.979 align:start position:0%
lot of non-traditional people that are
 
04:06:40.309 --> 04:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
going to law school later or people that
 
04:06:43.070 --> 04:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
are coming into New Hampshire later in
 
04:06:44.689 --> 04:06:44.699 align:start position:0%
their careers and just in general it's
 
04:06:46.370 --> 04:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
not just attorneys it's everyone that's
 
04:06:48.830 --> 04:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
kind of changing careers so I think that
 
04:06:50.210 --> 04:06:50.220 align:start position:0%
there really is a need as people
 
04:06:51.889 --> 04:06:51.899 align:start position:0%
individuals particularly in New
 
04:06:54.050 --> 04:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are aging and people are
 
04:06:56.090 --> 04:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
working longer that you can still get
 
04:06:59.389 --> 04:06:59.399 align:start position:0%
fresh blood in the Judiciary by raising
 
04:07:01.790 --> 04:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
the um age of judges and allowing people
 
04:07:04.010 --> 04:07:04.020 align:start position:0%
in the latter part of their careers or
 
04:07:05.450 --> 04:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
non-traditional people that come in
 
04:07:08.090 --> 04:07:08.100 align:start position:0%
later to law or to the bench
 
04:07:09.530 --> 04:07:09.540 align:start position:0%
um take the plates
 
04:07:11.510 --> 04:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
um there and you know serve the
 
04:07:14.469 --> 04:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
constituency thank you
 
04:07:23.990 --> 04:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:25.610 --> 04:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan I think you have
 
04:07:29.090 --> 04:07:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:31.309 --> 04:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
um I think well recruiting the judges I
 
04:07:32.689 --> 04:07:32.699 align:start position:0%
think it's not as easy as people think
 
04:07:34.189 --> 04:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
it is so there aren't that many people
 
04:07:36.469 --> 04:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
it's a very special take a very special
 
04:07:38.990 --> 04:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
skill set with actually not that many
 
04:07:41.090 --> 04:07:41.100 align:start position:0%
people necessarily have
 
04:07:43.189 --> 04:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
um and also
 
04:07:44.990 --> 04:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
we don't really have much of a pipeline
 
04:07:47.929 --> 04:07:47.939 align:start position:0%
for them we've uh we Consolidated a lot
 
04:07:50.210 --> 04:07:50.220 align:start position:0%
of part-time judges into full-time jobs
 
04:07:52.130 --> 04:07:52.140 align:start position:0%
and also every budget cycle including
 
04:07:54.170 --> 04:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
this one we've always been limiting the
 
04:07:56.269 --> 04:07:56.279 align:start position:0%
number of Judges so the number of
 
04:07:58.849 --> 04:07:58.859 align:start position:0%
Superior and circuit court judges if you
 
04:08:00.410 --> 04:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
have is less than there might be a
 
04:08:03.170 --> 04:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
demand for because there's a large
 
04:08:05.689 --> 04:08:05.699 align:start position:0%
pretty significant backlog in both those
 
04:08:08.269 --> 04:08:08.279 align:start position:0%
court systems partially because uh
 
04:08:10.010 --> 04:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
especially because we've limited the
 
04:08:11.929 --> 04:08:11.939 align:start position:0%
number of number of Judges that the
 
04:08:13.370 --> 04:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
Judiciary can hire so we don't have
 
04:08:15.710 --> 04:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
actually that much of a pipeline in the
 
04:08:17.870 --> 04:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
lower courts those are pretty much
 
04:08:17.880 --> 04:08:19.130 align:start position:0%
lower courts those are pretty much
um

04:08:19.130 --> 04:08:19.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:21.290 --> 04:08:21.300 align:start position:0%
those those are pretty much filled up
 
04:08:23.269 --> 04:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
and of course those courts are also uh
 
04:08:25.309 --> 04:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
subject to the same 70-year age limit as
 
04:08:26.929 --> 04:08:26.939 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court we usually think about
 
04:08:28.610 --> 04:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court but this also applies
 
04:08:30.710 --> 04:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
to the Circuit Court and the Superior
 
04:08:33.290 --> 04:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
Court judges um
 
04:08:35.809 --> 04:08:35.819 align:start position:0%
and uh certainly there's lots of people
 
04:08:39.530 --> 04:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
who are Cape over 70 who are certainly
 
04:08:41.030 --> 04:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
capable of serving including yourself Mr
 
04:08:42.769 --> 04:08:42.779 align:start position:0%
chair we have representative Landon
 
04:08:45.469 --> 04:08:45.479 align:start position:0%
former Justice Convoy all of whom you
 
04:08:47.090 --> 04:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
know certainly
 
04:08:48.590 --> 04:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
you can tell they're fully capable of
 
04:08:50.510 --> 04:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
serving on the state supreme court or
 
04:08:53.510 --> 04:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
any judge obviously still very Divine
 
04:08:55.189 --> 04:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
somebody their minds are still very
 
04:08:56.450 --> 04:08:56.460 align:start position:0%
strong you know they're still like very
 
04:08:58.250 --> 04:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
engaged so and then the other hand is
 
04:08:59.870 --> 04:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
probably some people much younger than
 
04:09:01.969 --> 04:09:01.979 align:start position:0%
70 who can't do
 
04:09:04.370 --> 04:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
that job anymore so I would I would say
 
04:09:07.309 --> 04:09:07.319 align:start position:0%
raising it five five years is a
 
04:09:08.809 --> 04:09:08.819 align:start position:0%
that's a very simple thing which should
 
04:09:11.510 --> 04:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
have been done uh years ago so
 
04:09:14.630 --> 04:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
and and really there is and Jessica my
 
04:09:15.830 --> 04:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
first point they really aren't you know
 
04:09:17.870 --> 04:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
these a good judge is actually very
 
04:09:20.090 --> 04:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
scarce scarce commodity so we shouldn't
 
04:09:22.969 --> 04:09:22.979 align:start position:0%
be taking people out of the Court just
 
04:09:26.150 --> 04:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
because they've passed the age of 70. so
 
04:09:26.160 --> 04:09:29.570 align:start position:0%
because they've passed the age of 70. so
thanks

04:09:29.570 --> 04:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:34.370 --> 04:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:37.189 --> 04:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
at first I I think I agreed it was a
 
04:09:40.670 --> 04:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
no-brainer but then since then I've
 
04:09:44.330 --> 04:09:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:46.670 --> 04:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
and I was impressed by the testimony we
 
04:09:49.610 --> 04:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
received from representative Piedra uh
 
04:09:53.630 --> 04:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:58.010 --> 04:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
a couple of things first of all I'm not
 
04:09:59.809 --> 04:09:59.819 align:start position:0%
the question is what what what's the
 
04:10:01.610 --> 04:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
problem that we're trying to solve here
 
04:10:04.130 --> 04:10:04.140 align:start position:0%
I guess is the question
 
04:10:04.140 --> 04:10:06.410 align:start position:0%
I guess is the question
and

04:10:06.410 --> 04:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:10:09.170 --> 04:10:09.180 align:start position:0%
is there a shortage of judges and do we
 
04:10:11.570 --> 04:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
need to raise the age in order to
 
04:10:13.309 --> 04:10:13.319 align:start position:0%
accommodate them I don't think there's
 
04:10:15.650 --> 04:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
any shortage of people who apply for
 
04:10:19.309 --> 04:10:19.319 align:start position:0%
judgeships in the state and frankly when
 
04:10:22.490 --> 04:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
you're looking at a job that pays 164
 
04:10:25.969 --> 04:10:25.979 align:start position:0%
000 a year and probably has the most
 
04:10:29.150 --> 04:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
lucrative retirement plan of any state
 
04:10:29.160 --> 04:10:30.429 align:start position:0%
lucrative retirement plan of any state
employee

04:10:30.429 --> 04:10:30.439 align:start position:0%
employee
 
04:10:34.870 --> 04:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
where you retire with 75 of
 
04:10:37.849 --> 04:10:37.859 align:start position:0%
what you were earning on your last year
 
04:10:37.859 --> 04:10:39.650 align:start position:0%
what you were earning on your last year
working

04:10:39.650 --> 04:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
working
 
04:10:39.660 --> 04:10:40.490 align:start position:0%
working
um

04:10:40.490 --> 04:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:42.769 --> 04:10:42.779 align:start position:0%
I I don't think there will be any
 
04:10:46.090 --> 04:10:46.100 align:start position:0%
shortage and in fact judges
 
04:10:49.189 --> 04:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
I would say that most of the judges who
 
04:10:51.530 --> 04:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
become judges get paid more as judges
 
04:10:53.750 --> 04:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
than they were being paid as attorneys
 
04:10:58.490 --> 04:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
before they became judges in this state
 
04:11:00.950 --> 04:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
so I don't think there's any shortage
 
04:11:02.389 --> 04:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
and I don't think we need to do it for
 
04:11:04.729 --> 04:11:04.739 align:start position:0%
that reason and I got to thinking about
 
04:11:08.150 --> 04:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh the issue of and because everybody
 
04:11:11.030 --> 04:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
says the same thing about age and that
 
04:11:14.570 --> 04:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
is well when in the 1790s when this was
 
04:11:16.969 --> 04:11:16.979 align:start position:0%
created people died at an earlier age
 
04:11:20.389 --> 04:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
and now people live longer therefore
 
04:11:22.969 --> 04:11:22.979 align:start position:0%
therefore it makes sense to extend the
 
04:11:26.150 --> 04:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
age but I don't think the age of 70 was
 
04:11:28.849 --> 04:11:28.859 align:start position:0%
done based upon life expectancy at the
 
04:11:31.250 --> 04:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
time I think the age was done based upon
 
04:11:31.260 --> 04:11:32.450 align:start position:0%
time I think the age was done based upon
competency

04:11:32.450 --> 04:11:32.460 align:start position:0%
competency
 
04:11:32.460 --> 04:11:33.769 align:start position:0%
competency
and

04:11:33.769 --> 04:11:33.779 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:36.830 --> 04:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
and the question was at what age do you
 
04:11:40.790 --> 04:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
no longer become competent to
 
04:11:44.050 --> 04:11:44.060 align:start position:0%
and I I don't honestly know if between
 
04:11:47.150 --> 04:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
1790 and today people who turn 70 are
 
04:11:50.450 --> 04:11:50.460 align:start position:0%
any more or less competent than they
 
04:11:53.110 --> 04:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
were back then
 
04:11:56.990 --> 04:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
the another point I think is
 
04:11:57.000 --> 04:11:58.490 align:start position:0%
the another point I think is
is

04:11:58.490 --> 04:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:12:01.250 --> 04:12:01.260 align:start position:0%
why 75
 
04:12:06.349 --> 04:12:06.359 align:start position:0%
isn't 75 just as arbitrary as 70. why
 
04:12:08.090 --> 04:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be 80.
 
04:12:10.910 --> 04:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
or 85 or why would we put a limit on it
 
04:12:13.070 --> 04:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
at all
 
04:12:15.710 --> 04:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
and I guess the other the other the
 
04:12:18.950 --> 04:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
other consideration I might have is
 
04:12:21.410 --> 04:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
the idea term limits I believe in term
 
04:12:22.790 --> 04:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
limits I think we ought to have term
 
04:12:26.290 --> 04:12:26.300 align:start position:0%
limits for legislators as and and but
 
04:12:30.429 --> 04:12:30.439 align:start position:0%
the idea that uh you know fresh blood
 
04:12:34.130 --> 04:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
isn't a bad idea new ideas aren't a bad
 
04:12:37.370 --> 04:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
idea and the fact is that people do get
 
04:12:40.610 --> 04:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
stale when they stay in one job for a
 
04:12:43.010 --> 04:12:43.020 align:start position:0%
long period of time so
 
04:12:46.189 --> 04:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
my perspective on the bill I think has
 
04:12:50.389 --> 04:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
changed a bit since because I was
 
04:12:53.389 --> 04:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
eager to co-sponsor originally
 
04:12:56.090 --> 04:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
I certainly and along in the short
 
04:12:57.410 --> 04:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
because I should be addressing the
 
04:13:00.110 --> 04:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
amendment and and that is
 
04:13:01.670 --> 04:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
04:13:04.070 --> 04:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
I don't agree with the amendment I think
 
04:13:06.530 --> 04:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
if the issue is if the issue really is
 
04:13:09.290 --> 04:13:09.300 align:start position:0%
an issue of Competency then I think a
 
04:13:10.969 --> 04:13:10.979 align:start position:0%
determination ought to be made with
 
04:13:12.950 --> 04:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
regard to competency at the time and I
 
04:13:15.229 --> 04:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
understand it's a political process but
 
04:13:17.030 --> 04:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
I got to tell you
 
04:13:18.590 --> 04:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
if you look at the judges that are
 
04:13:20.750 --> 04:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
appointed the appointment is a political
 
04:13:20.760 --> 04:13:25.090 align:start position:0%
appointed the appointment is a political
process

04:13:25.090 --> 04:13:25.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:32.809 --> 04:13:32.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:34.849 --> 04:13:34.859 align:start position:0%
anybody else want to speak to the
 
04:13:34.859 --> 04:13:38.450 align:start position:0%
anybody else want to speak to the
amendment

04:13:38.450 --> 04:13:38.460 align:start position:0%

04:13:47.269 --> 04:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
um excuse me before we do we still have
 
04:13:50.630 --> 04:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
a couple folks that need to be on camera
 
04:13:52.670 --> 04:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
yes if they're going to vote they need
 
04:13:54.469 --> 04:13:54.479 align:start position:0%
to be on camera
 
04:13:57.769 --> 04:13:57.779 align:start position:0%

and
 
04:14:11.570 --> 04:14:11.580 align:start position:0%
I guess I asked the clerk to take the
 
04:14:11.580 --> 04:14:23.269 align:start position:0%
I guess I asked the clerk to take the
roles

04:14:23.269 --> 04:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:29.400 --> 04:14:29.410 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:29.410 --> 04:14:31.750 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

04:14:54.469 --> 04:14:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:58.130 --> 04:14:58.140 align:start position:0%
well Jen do you have you heard from Kurt

trying to give him a call
 
04:15:06.290 --> 04:15:06.300 align:start position:0%

04:15:11.990 --> 04:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:12.000 --> 04:15:55.370 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:15:55.370 --> 04:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:58.309 --> 04:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes
 
04:16:00.710 --> 04:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
um while we're waiting for
 
04:16:03.469 --> 04:16:03.479 align:start position:0%
um the clerk to
 
04:16:03.479 --> 04:16:04.910 align:start position:0%

04:16:04.910 --> 04:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:07.130 --> 04:16:07.140 align:start position:0%
appear one hopes
 
04:16:08.929 --> 04:16:08.939 align:start position:0%
um I just want I have a couple of
 
04:16:11.689 --> 04:16:11.699 align:start position:0%
questions is the way you are going to
 
04:16:14.689 --> 04:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
proceed you're not going to do the early
 
04:16:16.610 --> 04:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
Bills first you're just going to go
 
04:16:19.130 --> 04:16:19.140 align:start position:0%
through in order
 
04:16:22.670 --> 04:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
yeah well the early bills were two of
 
04:16:25.130 --> 04:16:25.140 align:start position:0%
the early bills were
 
04:16:27.290 --> 04:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
we would do quickly
 
04:16:29.450 --> 04:16:29.460 align:start position:0%
and I thought we probably would end up
 
04:16:32.330 --> 04:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
with a lot of discussion on the
 
04:16:35.630 --> 04:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:38.870 --> 04:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
okay if you would prefer I would be
 
04:16:42.110 --> 04:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
happy to do the early bills Mr chair I
 
04:16:42.120 --> 04:16:44.090 align:start position:0%
happy to do the early bills Mr chair I
prefer

04:16:44.090 --> 04:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
prefer
 
04:16:46.490 --> 04:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
for us this to unfold the way you want
 
04:16:50.269 --> 04:16:50.279 align:start position:0%
it to unfold I just hold on for a second
 
04:16:52.490 --> 04:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
04:16:52.500 --> 04:16:53.809 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
yeah

04:16:53.809 --> 04:16:53.819 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:16:56.809 --> 04:16:56.819 align:start position:0%
go go ahead representative Smith
 
04:16:59.630 --> 04:16:59.640 align:start position:0%
um I I just wanted to know to make sure
 
04:16:59.640 --> 04:17:00.950 align:start position:0%
um I I just wanted to know to make sure
that

04:17:00.950 --> 04:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:17:04.250 --> 04:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
um we we got to the early bills even if
 
04:17:06.950 --> 04:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
we didn't quite finish all the others so
 
04:17:09.170 --> 04:17:09.180 align:start position:0%
that's the one thing and then the next
 
04:17:11.750 --> 04:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
are you proceeding
 
04:17:14.990 --> 04:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
um with when you call a bill the first
 
04:17:18.710 --> 04:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
person you call on would make a motion
 
04:17:21.950 --> 04:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
or to pass or itl or whatever
 
04:17:25.429 --> 04:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
and uh then they would SEC it would be
 
04:17:28.550 --> 04:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
seconded and then that person would
 
04:17:28.560 --> 04:17:30.110 align:start position:0%
seconded and then that person would
explain

04:17:30.110 --> 04:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
explain
 
04:17:33.469 --> 04:17:33.479 align:start position:0%
why he or she made the motion and then
 
04:17:36.110 --> 04:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
other people would speak is that how
 
04:17:38.570 --> 04:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
you're going to go on I think that makes
 
04:17:42.229 --> 04:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
sense okay good thank you very much for
 
04:17:46.010 --> 04:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
clarifying that thank you
 
04:17:52.429 --> 04:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:56.330 --> 04:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:58.729 --> 04:17:58.739 align:start position:0%
hold on one second
 
04:18:00.710 --> 04:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
um so the problem is that representative
 
04:18:04.429 --> 04:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
wolper has lost power at his home
 
04:18:07.490 --> 04:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
so he is on his phone trying to connect
 
04:18:09.889 --> 04:18:09.899 align:start position:0%
through the zoom link but because he
 
04:18:11.570 --> 04:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
doesn't have Internet it's giving him a
 
04:18:15.950 --> 04:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:15.960 --> 04:18:18.229 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:18:18.229 --> 04:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:18:20.689 --> 04:18:20.699 align:start position:0%
then Welker could connect by telephone
 
04:18:23.510 --> 04:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
only and using that he has to be on
 
04:18:25.849 --> 04:18:25.859 align:start position:0%
video to be able to vote that's correct
 
04:18:25.859 --> 04:18:30.050 align:start position:0%
video to be able to vote that's correct
yeah

04:18:30.050 --> 04:18:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:34.590 --> 04:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:34.600 --> 04:18:35.030 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:18:35.030 --> 04:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:18:35.040 --> 04:18:37.610 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:18:37.610 --> 04:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:37.620 --> 04:18:40.670 align:start position:0%
 
nothing

04:18:40.670 --> 04:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:42.889 --> 04:18:42.899 align:start position:0%
there's no way you can do video on his
 
04:18:42.899 --> 04:18:43.790 align:start position:0%
there's no way you can do video on his
phone

04:18:43.790 --> 04:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
phone
 
04:18:50.630 --> 04:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:54.410 --> 04:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
okay he's trying to connect via his
 
04:18:57.650 --> 04:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
phone because he has the Zoom app on his
 
04:19:00.710 --> 04:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
phone but it keeps telling him he's not
 
04:19:03.590 --> 04:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
connected to the internet Jen do you
 
04:19:05.450 --> 04:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
have any suggestions should I have him
 
04:19:09.290 --> 04:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
call he may need to his phone may be
 
04:19:12.590 --> 04:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
like defaulting to his Wi-Fi so he may
 
04:19:15.530 --> 04:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
just need to turn on cellular at home
 
04:19:18.229 --> 04:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
did you hear that turn off your Wi-Fi on
 
04:19:19.849 --> 04:19:19.859 align:start position:0%
your phone
 
04:19:19.859 --> 04:19:21.469 align:start position:0%
your phone
okay

04:19:21.469 --> 04:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:19:24.349 --> 04:19:24.359 align:start position:0%
go under your settings
 
04:19:24.359 --> 04:19:30.469 align:start position:0%
go under your settings
okay

04:19:30.469 --> 04:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:33.530 --> 04:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
he might also have to enable cellular
 
04:19:35.510 --> 04:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
for the Zoom app
 
04:19:37.729 --> 04:19:37.739 align:start position:0%
okay they go under to the apps where you
 
04:19:39.830 --> 04:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
enable for cellular you may have to
 
04:19:42.469 --> 04:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
enable cellular under the Zoom app so if
 
04:19:45.110 --> 04:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
you scroll down you'll find Zoom click
 
04:19:47.929 --> 04:19:47.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:47.939 --> 04:19:49.370 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:19:49.370 --> 04:19:49.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:19:51.349 --> 04:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
well it'll it'll be under your settings
 
04:19:53.929 --> 04:19:53.939 align:start position:0%
though not the app itself it'll be under
 
04:19:57.590 --> 04:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:57.600 --> 04:20:01.849 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:20:01.849 --> 04:20:01.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:04.429 --> 04:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
and make sure that you have cellular
 
04:20:07.010 --> 04:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
data on there
 
04:20:19.370 --> 04:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:21.889 --> 04:20:21.899 align:start position:0%
I have to quote Warren Zevon
 
04:20:30.830 --> 04:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:34.670 --> 04:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I I have the roll call sheets
 
04:20:38.150 --> 04:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
so that in an emergency once we get
 
04:20:42.229 --> 04:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
representative walber on line so we can
 
04:20:45.349 --> 04:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
see his face and he can vote
 
04:20:48.229 --> 04:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
um if it helps I can record on the roll
 
04:20:51.889 --> 04:20:51.899 align:start position:0%
call sheets and then give that to him
 
04:20:57.469 --> 04:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:00.590 --> 04:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
he still needs to be able to vote Yes I
 
04:21:02.330 --> 04:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
understand that but in other words we
 
04:21:04.490 --> 04:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
might he might be able to get his
 
04:21:08.750 --> 04:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
face but not have all the
 
04:21:11.870 --> 04:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
um additional tools he would need
 
04:21:15.290 --> 04:21:15.300 align:start position:0%
to record the Roll Call yeah
 
04:21:18.110 --> 04:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
just an offer
 
04:22:04.969 --> 04:22:04.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:30.950 --> 04:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:30.960 --> 04:22:47.269 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:22:47.269 --> 04:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:50.389 --> 04:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
Jen what's the number that Kurt can call
 
04:22:52.670 --> 04:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
maybe they can help him connect
 
04:22:56.030 --> 04:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
so we're not holding everybody up
 
04:22:58.429 --> 04:22:58.439 align:start position:0%

that number and see if they can help him
 
04:24:40.070 --> 04:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
get connected
 
04:24:42.950 --> 04:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
but I mean he just nothing he can do he
 
04:24:46.010 --> 04:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't have he doesn't have electricity
 
04:24:48.050 --> 04:24:48.060 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I just gave you the number for
 
04:24:51.110 --> 04:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
him to connect to the meeting by phone
 
04:24:53.510 --> 04:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
is that that that's what I thought he
 
04:24:55.670 --> 04:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
wanted that's why I gave you the webinar
 
04:24:58.849 --> 04:24:58.859 align:start position:0%
ID nope I need the number that he calls
 
04:25:01.309 --> 04:25:01.319 align:start position:0%
for if there's a problem and you can't
 
04:25:03.530 --> 04:25:03.540 align:start position:0%
connect I wanted to see if someone can
 
04:25:05.630 --> 04:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
help him talk him through it to connect
 
04:25:07.969 --> 04:25:07.979 align:start position:0%
that would be me
 
04:25:07.979 --> 04:25:11.530 align:start position:0%
that would be me
271-3099

04:25:11.530 --> 04:25:11.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:06.229 --> 04:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:10.010 --> 04:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
we could wait uh we could
 
04:26:14.570 --> 04:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
uh we could go ahead and
 
04:26:17.210 --> 04:26:17.220 align:start position:0%
the representative Smith taking votes
 
04:26:18.710 --> 04:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
and recording them but unfortunately
 
04:26:21.349 --> 04:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
that always representative wolper out
 
04:26:23.269 --> 04:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
and unable to vote
 
04:26:26.870 --> 04:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you want to
 
04:26:29.330 --> 04:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
take a recess let's say until two
 
04:26:33.229 --> 04:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
o'clock and come back and
 
04:26:35.110 --> 04:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
and reconvene
 
04:26:38.990 --> 04:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
rather than us all waiting here
 
04:26:42.290 --> 04:26:42.300 align:start position:0%
that's something you'd prefer to do
 
04:26:44.389 --> 04:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
see if we can get represented so we're
 
04:26:46.790 --> 04:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
in the voting modes well I mean are we
 
04:26:48.170 --> 04:26:48.180 align:start position:0%
in the voting mode because there's a
 
04:26:50.750 --> 04:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
motion on the table so I'm not sure if
 
04:26:53.990 --> 04:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
we are allowed to recess right yet we
 
04:26:57.229 --> 04:26:57.239 align:start position:0%
may have to vote on this one and then we
 
04:26:58.969 --> 04:26:58.979 align:start position:0%
can recess
 
04:27:00.170 --> 04:27:00.180 align:start position:0%
I think
 
04:27:01.790 --> 04:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
I don't think we've started the vote yet
 
04:27:04.010 --> 04:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
the Kurt the confusion started because
 
04:27:06.050 --> 04:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
when Kurt we really realized Kurt wasn't
 
04:27:10.030 --> 04:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:12.649 --> 04:27:12.659 align:start position:0%
the actual starting of the vote voting
 
04:27:17.410 --> 04:27:17.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:21.530 --> 04:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
we recess until two o'clock and maybe uh
 
04:27:23.809 --> 04:27:23.819 align:start position:0%
Kurt can get up and be available to us
 
04:27:26.269 --> 04:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
and then other people we can get some
 
04:27:28.370 --> 04:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
other other things done in the meantime
 
04:27:30.950 --> 04:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
all right thank you okay why don't we
 
04:27:33.050 --> 04:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
recess till two o'clock you would too
 
04:29:30.590 --> 04:29:30.600 align:start position:0%

04:49:03.180 --> 04:49:35.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:49:35.150 --> 04:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:50.868 --> 04:50:50.878 align:start position:0%

04:52:48.410 --> 04:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:48.420 --> 04:54:18.410 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:54:18.410 --> 04:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:05.208 --> 04:55:05.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:11.750 --> 04:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:13.490 --> 04:56:13.500 align:start position:0%
so I've been working with representative
 
04:56:16.190 --> 04:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
welper he's been able to connect to the
 
04:56:18.110 --> 04:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
meeting twice
 
04:56:20.390 --> 04:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
but he hasn't been able to maintain the
 
04:56:20.400 --> 04:56:21.650 align:start position:0%
but he hasn't been able to maintain the
connection

04:56:21.650 --> 04:56:21.660 align:start position:0%
connection
 
04:56:23.208 --> 04:56:23.218 align:start position:0%
so he's going to be trying one more time
 
04:56:25.730 --> 04:56:25.740 align:start position:0%
I'm keeping an eye out to see if I see
 
04:56:28.430 --> 04:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
him come in as an attendee
 
04:56:28.440 --> 04:56:29.208 align:start position:0%
him come in as an attendee
um

04:56:29.208 --> 04:56:29.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:31.310 --> 04:56:31.320 align:start position:0%
but that's the status for now he's got
 
04:56:33.650 --> 04:56:33.660 align:start position:0%
all his settings right he can do it
 
04:56:39.650 --> 04:56:39.660 align:start position:0%
it just sounds like a weak connection
 
04:56:56.650 --> 04:56:56.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:00.230 --> 04:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes
 
04:57:02.090 --> 04:57:02.100 align:start position:0%
um good afternoon are you having a good
 
04:57:02.100 --> 04:57:03.230 align:start position:0%
um good afternoon are you having a good
time

04:57:03.230 --> 04:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:57:07.490 --> 04:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
so far I knew you were I
 
04:57:10.430 --> 04:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
um had occasions since I had idle time
 
04:57:13.970 --> 04:57:13.980 align:start position:0%
to talk with the clerk
 
04:57:16.010 --> 04:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
um about the question that came up
 
04:57:20.090 --> 04:57:20.100 align:start position:0%
earlier when representative Kenny wasn't
 
04:57:23.868 --> 04:57:23.878 align:start position:0%
sure how to proceed and what the clerk
 
04:57:27.530 --> 04:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
said is that uh the correct terminology
 
04:57:29.990 --> 04:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
would be to say
 
04:57:34.150 --> 04:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
I move or to pass
 
04:57:39.050 --> 04:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
and I have an amendment
 
04:57:43.550 --> 04:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
and handling it that way we get both the
 
04:57:46.368 --> 04:57:46.378 align:start position:0%
auto pass and the amendment on the table
 
04:57:48.550 --> 04:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
and then the first
 
04:57:51.230 --> 04:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
discussion of course would be on the
 
04:57:51.240 --> 04:57:52.670 align:start position:0%
discussion of course would be on the
amendment

04:57:52.670 --> 04:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:57:57.050 --> 04:57:57.060 align:start position:0%
and um but that is the way to handle it
 
04:57:59.390 --> 04:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
and I
 
04:58:01.788 --> 04:58:01.798 align:start position:0%
thanked him for that and I thought I
 
04:58:06.230 --> 04:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:06.240 --> 04:58:09.948 align:start position:0%
 
sharing

04:58:09.948 --> 04:58:09.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:15.590 --> 04:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:17.510 --> 04:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that we can get Kurt
 
04:58:19.250 --> 04:58:19.260 align:start position:0%
connected if we can't get him connected
 
04:58:21.350 --> 04:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
the one thing that we do need to do
 
04:58:25.010 --> 04:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
today is get out before early bills
 
04:58:27.590 --> 04:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
so we'll deal with the four early bills
 
04:58:30.410 --> 04:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
if he's unable to participate is going
 
04:58:31.970 --> 04:58:31.980 align:start position:0%
to be unfortunate but I really don't
 
04:58:35.810 --> 04:58:35.820 align:start position:0%
have a choice since they need to be
 
04:58:39.708 --> 04:58:39.718 align:start position:0%
reported out no later than this Thursday
 
04:58:39.718 --> 04:58:40.430 align:start position:0%
reported out no later than this Thursday
yeah

04:58:40.430 --> 04:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:58:43.070 --> 04:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
and Mr chair it's representative Smith
 
04:58:45.770 --> 04:58:45.780 align:start position:0%
again causing trouble for you right now
 
04:58:48.788 --> 04:58:48.798 align:start position:0%
I I have
 
04:58:52.490 --> 04:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
I have a problem
 
04:58:55.368 --> 04:58:55.378 align:start position:0%
um I think we can vote on a lot of bills
 
04:58:57.550 --> 04:58:57.560 align:start position:0%
and it would be sad not to have
 
04:59:01.310 --> 04:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
representative wolper involved but I
 
04:59:03.770 --> 04:59:03.780 align:start position:0%
have a moral
 
04:59:07.128 --> 04:59:07.138 align:start position:0%
problem with us voting on any
 
04:59:10.128 --> 04:59:10.138 align:start position:0%
Reproductive Rights bill without
 
04:59:12.890 --> 04:59:12.900 align:start position:0%
representative Loper being present
 
04:59:15.650 --> 04:59:15.660 align:start position:0%
because it is
 
04:59:20.448 --> 04:59:20.458 align:start position:0%
um Central to his sense of his
 
04:59:25.010 --> 04:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
role as a legislator and I believe that
 
04:59:27.110 --> 04:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
there are
 
04:59:27.120 --> 04:59:28.550 align:start position:0%
there are
um

04:59:28.550 --> 04:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:28.560 --> 04:59:36.350 align:start position:0%
um
uh

04:59:36.350 --> 04:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:40.208 --> 04:59:40.218 align:start position:0%
so that's I just want to listen
 
04:59:44.230 --> 04:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:49.010 --> 04:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
while Iron's hot right okay okay let's
 
04:59:49.020 --> 04:59:50.288 align:start position:0%
while Iron's hot right okay okay let's
go

04:59:50.288 --> 04:59:50.298 align:start position:0%
go
 
04:59:53.030 --> 04:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
I'd like to thank Marjorie very much for
 
04:59:58.610 --> 04:59:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:00.410 --> 05:00:00.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure we all agree with them as
 
05:00:00.420 --> 05:00:02.030 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure we all agree with them as
well

05:00:02.030 --> 05:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:00:04.240 --> 05:00:04.250 align:start position:0%

05:00:04.250 --> 05:00:06.050 align:start position:0%

[Applause]
 
05:00:10.070 --> 05:00:10.080 align:start position:0%

and I have a role
 
05:00:25.788 --> 05:00:25.798 align:start position:0%

05:00:30.708 --> 05:00:30.718 align:start position:0%

05:00:49.990 --> 05:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:00:52.430 --> 05:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
05:00:53.990 --> 05:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
would just like to have some information
 
05:00:55.550 --> 05:00:55.560 align:start position:0%
for my own
 
05:00:58.670 --> 05:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
our records
 
05:01:03.708 --> 05:01:03.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:07.490 --> 05:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
right we were voting on the amendment
 
05:01:10.610 --> 05:01:10.620 align:start position:0%
I thought the motion was Mr chair ought
 
05:01:13.190 --> 05:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
to pass as amended by zero two nine one
 
05:01:13.200 --> 05:01:14.390 align:start position:0%
to pass as amended by zero two nine one
h

05:01:14.390 --> 05:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
h
 
05:01:17.868 --> 05:01:17.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:20.448 --> 05:01:20.458 align:start position:0%
I think we vote on the amendment first
 
05:01:23.390 --> 05:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
and then we vote on
 
05:01:25.190 --> 05:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended if the
 
05:01:27.970 --> 05:01:27.980 align:start position:0%
amendment is adopted correct
 
05:01:32.208 --> 05:01:32.218 align:start position:0%

05:01:48.288 --> 05:01:48.298 align:start position:0%
you need to do a roll call to adopt
 
05:01:50.990 --> 05:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment we need to do a roll call
 
05:01:53.570 --> 05:01:53.580 align:start position:0%
to adopt the amendment if in fact we're
 
05:01:57.170 --> 05:01:57.180 align:start position:0%

uh

05:02:57.050 --> 05:02:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:58.310 --> 05:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
when the amendment took out the
 
05:02:59.750 --> 05:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
executive Council
 
05:03:04.448 --> 05:03:04.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:06.890 --> 05:03:06.900 align:start position:0%

05:03:19.970 --> 05:03:19.980 align:start position:0%
do we lose Kurt again
 
05:03:25.190 --> 05:03:25.200 align:start position:0%

I'm calling the rule I have to use my
 
05:03:27.240 --> 05:03:27.948 align:start position:0%
I'm calling the rule I have to use my
phone

05:03:27.948 --> 05:03:27.958 align:start position:0%
phone
 
05:03:30.050 --> 05:03:30.060 align:start position:0%
I don't dare put my phone on Bluetooth
 
05:03:32.810 --> 05:03:32.820 align:start position:0%
because it's connected again
 
05:03:37.368 --> 05:03:37.378 align:start position:0%
so I have to to my ear in order to heat
 
05:03:41.810 --> 05:03:41.820 align:start position:0%
here and when I vote I will hold me and
 
05:03:44.628 --> 05:03:44.638 align:start position:0%
you can see me at the time
 
05:04:00.170 --> 05:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:05.208 --> 05:04:05.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:11.750 --> 05:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:14.868 --> 05:04:14.878 align:start position:0%

05:04:17.090 --> 05:04:17.100 align:start position:0%
unable to hear you at times for some
 
05:04:17.100 --> 05:04:22.610 align:start position:0%
unable to hear you at times for some
reason

05:04:22.610 --> 05:04:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:25.610 --> 05:04:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:29.810 --> 05:04:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:33.050 --> 05:04:33.060 align:start position:0%
uh well we need you to call the roll if
 
05:04:42.948 --> 05:04:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:44.750 --> 05:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
05:04:48.050 --> 05:04:48.060 align:start position:0%
I mean Mr chair uh earlier on uh
 
05:04:50.030 --> 05:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative Smith said that he she
 
05:04:52.670 --> 05:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
had the sheets so
 
05:04:54.788 --> 05:04:54.798 align:start position:0%
would it be more workable
 
05:04:57.948 --> 05:04:57.958 align:start position:0%
so that representative wolfer could
 
05:04:57.958 --> 05:05:01.070 align:start position:0%
so that representative wolfer could
participate

05:05:01.070 --> 05:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:03.948 --> 05:05:03.958 align:start position:0%
right actually uh the way it's working
 
05:05:06.230 --> 05:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
right now maybe
 
05:05:10.670 --> 05:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
we could have her call the roll on the
 
05:05:13.430 --> 05:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
sheets and representative wolper could
 
05:05:16.570 --> 05:05:16.580 align:start position:0%
listen and record
 
05:05:18.288 --> 05:05:18.298 align:start position:0%
for me
 
05:05:18.298 --> 05:05:19.610 align:start position:0%
for me
okay

05:05:19.610 --> 05:05:19.620 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:05:22.250 --> 05:05:22.260 align:start position:0%

has been in law for quite a long time
 
05:08:52.850 --> 05:08:52.860 align:start position:0%
and there's no need to change it now and
 
05:08:54.470 --> 05:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
it also brings up a question about
 
05:08:57.170 --> 05:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
sheriffs who would then be
 
05:09:02.208 --> 05:09:02.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:05.930 --> 05:09:05.940 align:start position:0%

okay we will take a vote and
 
05:09:11.510 --> 05:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative Smith representative

representative Sylvia just said so
 
05:09:26.570 --> 05:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
sheriffs I know we discussed that but
 
05:09:29.750 --> 05:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
they're the same as a judge their
 
05:09:33.230 --> 05:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:35.570 --> 05:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
so can we even change one without
 
05:09:38.990 --> 05:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:43.430 --> 05:09:43.440 align:start position:0%

representative Horrigan
 
05:12:51.708 --> 05:12:51.718 align:start position:0%
um I opened the Nord to say I think
 
05:12:51.718 --> 05:12:53.030 align:start position:0%
um I opened the Nord to say I think
probably

05:12:53.030 --> 05:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
probably
 
05:12:53.040 --> 05:12:53.810 align:start position:0%
probably
um

05:12:53.810 --> 05:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:55.368 --> 05:12:55.378 align:start position:0%
retaining it would have been a better
 
05:12:57.230 --> 05:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
solution than itlling it at this point
 
05:12:58.970 --> 05:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
just because uh
 
05:13:01.430 --> 05:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't nobody is going to vote on it
 
05:13:03.890 --> 05:13:03.900 align:start position:0%
until November 2022 anyway so even
 
05:13:05.090 --> 05:13:05.100 align:start position:0%
though we're
 
05:13:06.530 --> 05:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
even though we don't want to have any
 
05:13:08.570 --> 05:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
more retained Bill hearings as well then
 
05:13:09.948 --> 05:13:09.958 align:start position:0%
we have to
 
05:13:13.070 --> 05:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
um that might be that uh that might be
 
05:13:14.810 --> 05:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
the best solution at this point
 
05:13:16.250 --> 05:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
um but
 
05:13:19.368 --> 05:13:19.378 align:start position:0%
we do have a motion to vote on yeah and
 
05:13:21.410 --> 05:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander
 
05:13:23.868 --> 05:13:23.878 align:start position:0%
um thank you just to um uh respond to
 
05:13:25.190 --> 05:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative Oregon I think the
 
05:13:26.868 --> 05:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
committee or um at least part of the
 
05:13:27.890 --> 05:13:27.900 align:start position:0%
committee understands that there's
 
05:13:29.390 --> 05:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
really no compelling need right now and
 
05:13:31.128 --> 05:13:31.138 align:start position:0%
the sponsors did not outline a
 
05:13:32.990 --> 05:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
compelling need to um pass this right
 
05:13:34.910 --> 05:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
now so I don't even think retaining this
 
05:13:36.770 --> 05:13:36.780 align:start position:0%
um would help solve the problem so I
 
05:13:39.288 --> 05:13:39.298 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to vote itl
 
05:13:40.610 --> 05:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
and there is
 
05:13:42.350 --> 05:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
and there is a similar resolution being
 
05:13:45.410 --> 05:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
considered in the other body
 
05:13:45.420 --> 05:13:46.910 align:start position:0%
considered in the other body
I

05:13:46.910 --> 05:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:13:49.850 --> 05:13:49.860 align:start position:0%
okay are you ready to vote
 
05:13:52.850 --> 05:13:52.860 align:start position:0%

05:16:56.208 --> 05:16:56.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:01.980 --> 05:17:01.990 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:01.990 --> 05:17:52.730 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

05:17:52.730 --> 05:17:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:54.410 --> 05:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
apparently somebody must care
 
05:17:59.330 --> 05:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:01.190 --> 05:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
I'll move on to pass
 
05:18:01.200 --> 05:18:02.990 align:start position:0%
I'll move on to pass
oh

05:18:02.990 --> 05:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
oh
 
05:18:06.288 --> 05:18:06.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:06.298 --> 05:18:09.708 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:18:09.708 --> 05:18:09.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:09.718 --> 05:18:10.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:18:10.990 --> 05:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:18:13.310 --> 05:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
and would you like to address your
 
05:18:15.708 --> 05:18:15.718 align:start position:0%
motion representative McLean
 
05:18:19.030 --> 05:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
um I I just think that um
 
05:18:19.040 --> 05:18:21.230 align:start position:0%
um I I just think that um
[Music]

05:18:21.230 --> 05:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:18:23.570 --> 05:18:23.580 align:start position:0%
right now we're in a place where we're
 
05:18:26.448 --> 05:18:26.458 align:start position:0%
trying to build up trust uh between the
 
05:18:28.970 --> 05:18:28.980 align:start position:0%
police and the community
 
05:18:31.730 --> 05:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
um this I think is a good thing and we
 
05:18:35.150 --> 05:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
want to I think eliminate the illusion
 
05:18:37.010 --> 05:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
if there's any policing for profit going
 
05:18:38.270 --> 05:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
on here
 
05:18:39.470 --> 05:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
um the amount of money that we're
 
05:18:41.448 --> 05:18:41.458 align:start position:0%
talking about is
 
05:18:44.628 --> 05:18:44.638 align:start position:0%
um not a huge amount of money so um I
 
05:18:46.730 --> 05:18:46.740 align:start position:0%
think if there are any drug programs
 
05:18:48.470 --> 05:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
that you know might be in Jeopardy that
 
05:18:50.750 --> 05:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
are funded by this they could be made up
 
05:18:52.788 --> 05:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
by other means but the most important
 
05:18:55.010 --> 05:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
thing for me is building up that
 
05:18:57.110 --> 05:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
relationship between the police and the
 
05:18:57.120 --> 05:19:01.430 align:start position:0%
relationship between the police and the
community

05:19:01.430 --> 05:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:03.530 --> 05:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan
 
05:19:06.708 --> 05:19:06.718 align:start position:0%
um yes I just believe the opposite I
 
05:19:06.718 --> 05:19:07.368 align:start position:0%
um yes I just believe the opposite I
think

05:19:07.368 --> 05:19:07.378 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:19:11.208 --> 05:19:11.218 align:start position:0%
the uh generally the police uh during
 
05:19:12.470 --> 05:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
the level of trust between the police
 
05:19:14.030 --> 05:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
and those who police is not as high as
 
05:19:16.250 --> 05:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
it should be but I still think um the
 
05:19:17.810 --> 05:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
current program is a good one and I
 
05:19:19.250 --> 05:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
think this is the appropriate use for
 
05:19:21.770 --> 05:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
that small and somewhat very amount of
 
05:19:24.230 --> 05:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
money I.E to use it for uh
 
05:19:26.628 --> 05:19:26.638 align:start position:0%
prevention and also for uh for
 
05:19:29.150 --> 05:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement and so there's a
 
05:19:32.270 --> 05:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
I think that's this isn't uh the need
 
05:19:34.010 --> 05:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
for treatment a lot larger than the
 
05:19:36.590 --> 05:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
small uh there's a small fund so I don't
 
05:19:38.868 --> 05:19:38.878 align:start position:0%
think we should uh rate it just for just
 
05:19:40.010 --> 05:19:40.020 align:start position:0%
for the treatment we should have
 
05:19:42.050 --> 05:19:42.060 align:start position:0%
different sources and more uh more
 
05:19:44.868 --> 05:19:44.878 align:start position:0%
stable sources for the treatment so um
 
05:19:46.010 --> 05:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna
 
05:19:48.230 --> 05:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to go
 
05:19:52.670 --> 05:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:54.650 --> 05:19:54.660 align:start position:0%
this is yeah this is the same bill we
 
05:19:56.448 --> 05:19:56.458 align:start position:0%
had a rather memorable floor fight where
 
05:19:58.910 --> 05:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
I think they called for a roll call and
 
05:20:01.670 --> 05:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
I was on the itl side they got 19 votes
 
05:20:03.530 --> 05:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
and uh but I'm still undeterred I still
 
05:20:05.868 --> 05:20:05.878 align:start position:0%
think the other 18 members you voted
 
05:20:08.150 --> 05:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
against it were right and
 
05:20:08.160 --> 05:20:11.570 align:start position:0%
against it were right and
okay

05:20:11.570 --> 05:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:17.810 --> 05:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:22.330 --> 05:20:22.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:27.650 --> 05:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:29.890 --> 05:20:29.900 align:start position:0%
um I listened to what representative
 
05:20:33.190 --> 05:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
McLean said
 
05:20:33.200 --> 05:20:34.850 align:start position:0%
McLean said
and

05:20:34.850 --> 05:20:34.860 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:20:39.288 --> 05:20:39.298 align:start position:0%
because I hold him in such high regard I
 
05:20:41.570 --> 05:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
take what he says
 
05:20:46.190 --> 05:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
with a high degree of support but
 
05:20:49.430 --> 05:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
if I understood correctly
 
05:20:51.110 --> 05:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
he moved
 
05:20:53.810 --> 05:20:53.820 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
05:20:57.948 --> 05:20:57.958 align:start position:0%
on a bill that is changing
 
05:21:01.010 --> 05:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:04.128 --> 05:21:04.138 align:start position:0%
we do things
 
05:21:04.138 --> 05:21:04.910 align:start position:0%
we do things
um

05:21:04.910 --> 05:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:08.030 --> 05:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
and yet he spoke as if
 
05:21:10.970 --> 05:21:10.980 align:start position:0%
we were keeping in place the way we were
 
05:21:14.750 --> 05:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
doing things so clearly I'm confused and
 
05:21:17.690 --> 05:21:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:19.670 --> 05:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
you're going to Mclean do you want to
 
05:21:20.990 --> 05:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
address that
 
05:21:22.730 --> 05:21:22.740 align:start position:0%
yeah certainly
 
05:21:25.510 --> 05:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
um the the intention of this legislation
 
05:21:28.310 --> 05:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
and I wasn't at the public hearing
 
05:21:30.830 --> 05:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately because I had to introduce
 
05:21:32.448 --> 05:21:32.458 align:start position:0%
a different Bill and a different
 
05:21:36.410 --> 05:21:36.420 align:start position:0%
committee but as I understand the intent
 
05:21:41.750 --> 05:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
of this bill is to take the money that
 
05:21:48.230 --> 05:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
is collected seized and to put it into a
 
05:21:48.240 --> 05:21:49.570 align:start position:0%
is collected seized and to put it into a
place

05:21:49.570 --> 05:21:49.580 align:start position:0%
place
 
05:21:54.050 --> 05:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
a drug a forfeiture fund
 
05:21:54.060 --> 05:21:55.730 align:start position:0%
a drug a forfeiture fund
that

05:21:55.730 --> 05:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:21:58.670 --> 05:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
the the police would not have access to
 
05:22:00.910 --> 05:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
and it would be used for drug treatment
 
05:22:04.490 --> 05:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
and so because of that
 
05:22:08.090 --> 05:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
um it is basically an independent fund
 
05:22:11.030 --> 05:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
and what that does is that eliminates
 
05:22:14.390 --> 05:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
the perception of any policing for
 
05:22:17.270 --> 05:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
profit or anything of that nature
 
05:22:19.788 --> 05:22:19.798 align:start position:0%
um and so that is how I read the bill so
 
05:22:21.770 --> 05:22:21.780 align:start position:0%
that is a departure from where things
 
05:22:23.750 --> 05:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
stand right now and that is why I'm
 
05:22:25.310 --> 05:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
supporting the bill I hope that answered
 
05:22:27.350 --> 05:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
your question uh representative Smith
 
05:22:31.010 --> 05:22:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:33.288 --> 05:22:33.298 align:start position:0%
I just want to add I was one of the
 
05:22:35.930 --> 05:22:35.940 align:start position:0%
three that voted against this bill in
 
05:22:37.430 --> 05:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
the last session
 
05:22:42.890 --> 05:22:42.900 align:start position:0%
uh it it passed and uh as I said I was
 
05:22:44.390 --> 05:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
one of the three that voted against it
 
05:22:44.400 --> 05:22:46.190 align:start position:0%
one of the three that voted against it
and

05:22:46.190 --> 05:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:22:46.200 --> 05:22:47.350 align:start position:0%
and
and

05:22:47.350 --> 05:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:22:51.170 --> 05:22:51.180 align:start position:0%
my recollection in the last session was
 
05:22:53.270 --> 05:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
we had testimony particularly from the
 
05:22:55.368 --> 05:22:55.378 align:start position:0%
Nashua police and being supportive of
 
05:22:56.510 --> 05:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
the police
 
05:22:59.750 --> 05:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
they said this bill was all about us
 
05:23:01.910 --> 05:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
being able to interdict drugs coming
 
05:23:04.010 --> 05:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
over the Border yes
 
05:23:06.170 --> 05:23:06.180 align:start position:0%
that was their testimony but when we
 
05:23:08.330 --> 05:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
heard the testimony from the people who
 
05:23:10.070 --> 05:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
opposed it from the police that opposed
 
05:23:12.230 --> 05:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
it this year it's all about the money
 
05:23:15.890 --> 05:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
that we give out to other Charities as
 
05:23:17.750 --> 05:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to money that they were using
 
05:23:21.590 --> 05:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:21.600 --> 05:23:24.110 align:start position:0%
 
um I

05:23:24.110 --> 05:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
um I
 
05:23:26.750 --> 05:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
I guess I found myself torn on the bill
 
05:23:28.190 --> 05:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
this year as to whether that's
 
05:23:28.200 --> 05:23:30.110 align:start position:0%
this year as to whether that's
appropriate

05:23:30.110 --> 05:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
05:23:32.150 --> 05:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
representative Birch
 
05:23:34.190 --> 05:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:23:37.670 --> 05:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
um it's my reading of the bill that
 
05:23:40.670 --> 05:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
there's no mandatory
 
05:23:44.090 --> 05:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
change of spending in this bill this
 
05:23:47.090 --> 05:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
bill does not require one single extra
 
05:23:51.410 --> 05:23:51.420 align:start position:0%
dime to go to uh mental health core
 
05:23:54.530 --> 05:23:54.540 align:start position:0%
mental health or social programs or the
 
05:23:54.540 --> 05:23:55.430 align:start position:0%
mental health or social programs or the
like

05:23:55.430 --> 05:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:23:55.440 --> 05:23:56.930 align:start position:0%
like
so

05:23:56.930 --> 05:23:56.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:23:59.930 --> 05:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
um it may be aspirational but I'm not
 
05:24:03.050 --> 05:24:03.060 align:start position:0%
sure it accomplishes what what good
 
05:24:05.628 --> 05:24:05.638 align:start position:0%
representative McLean suggests that it
 
05:24:10.910 --> 05:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:14.930 --> 05:24:14.940 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative Langley
 
05:24:16.910 --> 05:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair
 
05:24:19.788 --> 05:24:19.798 align:start position:0%
um yesterday in the meeting I I spoke in
 
05:24:22.128 --> 05:24:22.138 align:start position:0%
support of this bill and I guess for my
 
05:24:24.050 --> 05:24:24.060 align:start position:0%
colleagues I think I had this confused
 
05:24:26.628 --> 05:24:26.638 align:start position:0%
with one of the other bills I'm going to
 
05:24:28.490 --> 05:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
vote to oppose this bill and the reason
 
05:24:31.250 --> 05:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
I am is because I'm concerned
 
05:24:34.490 --> 05:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
that using this money which I agree with
 
05:24:37.128 --> 05:24:37.138 align:start position:0%
representative McLean is a
 
05:24:40.190 --> 05:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
small a very small amount of money and I
 
05:24:42.890 --> 05:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
don't want it to be seen as a mechanism
 
05:24:45.530 --> 05:24:45.540 align:start position:0%
ultimately that could be used to fund
 
05:24:47.448 --> 05:24:47.458 align:start position:0%
some of these programs that are
 
05:24:50.810 --> 05:24:50.820 align:start position:0%
desperately in need of funding but not
 
05:24:53.330 --> 05:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
tiny bits of funding there are need
 
05:24:55.670 --> 05:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
they're in need of substantial funding
 
05:24:59.448 --> 05:24:59.458 align:start position:0%
and I would hate to see it used as a
 
05:25:01.730 --> 05:25:01.740 align:start position:0%
mechanism that just was suddenly going
 
05:25:04.730 --> 05:25:04.740 align:start position:0%
to be uh of
 
05:25:06.948 --> 05:25:06.958 align:start position:0%
considered a way to support those
 
05:25:11.448 --> 05:25:11.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:16.490 --> 05:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:18.890 --> 05:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
I guess you're ready to vote so the
 
05:25:21.650 --> 05:25:21.660 align:start position:0%
motion is an occupast motion
 
05:25:21.660 --> 05:25:23.708 align:start position:0%
motion is an occupast motion
and

05:25:23.708 --> 05:25:23.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:25:25.850 --> 05:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
representative Smith again would you be
 
05:25:28.788 --> 05:25:28.798 align:start position:0%
willing to call the roll my pleasure on
 
05:25:31.190 --> 05:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
behalf of the clerk hold up hold on I
 
05:25:33.110 --> 05:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
think we need to get Kurt on camera here
 
05:25:38.690 --> 05:25:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:38.700 --> 05:25:44.930 align:start position:0%
 
together

05:25:44.930 --> 05:25:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:58.910 --> 05:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:02.270 --> 05:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chair should I can call the roll and
 
05:26:05.150 --> 05:26:05.160 align:start position:0%
come back to representative Welker
 
05:26:06.590 --> 05:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
I think
 
05:26:09.050 --> 05:26:09.060 align:start position:0%
um I think we need to do that actually
 
05:26:11.390 --> 05:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
if that's acceptable to everyone we
 
05:26:11.400 --> 05:26:12.470 align:start position:0%
if that's acceptable to everyone we
won't

Aaron Goulet
 
05:27:53.628 --> 05:27:53.638 align:start position:0%
informed Ann Fitzgerald that should he
 
05:27:56.570 --> 05:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
not be able to get on video on Via video
 
05:27:59.690 --> 05:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
the speaker's ruling is that since his
 
05:28:02.570 --> 05:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
identity was verified when he was on by
 
05:28:04.788 --> 05:28:04.798 align:start position:0%
video this morning and lost service due
 
05:28:07.070 --> 05:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
to inclement weather he will be allowed
 
05:28:09.350 --> 05:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
to participate the replacement policy
 
05:28:11.510 --> 05:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
will be updated to reflect this one
 
05:28:15.590 --> 05:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:18.050 --> 05:28:18.060 align:start position:0%
um could I ask what one exception for
 
05:28:21.350 --> 05:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
everyone means this I guess what I just
 
05:28:22.850 --> 05:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
read that
 
05:28:24.770 --> 05:28:24.780 align:start position:0%
I don't know all I'm telling you is what
 
05:28:27.770 --> 05:28:27.780 align:start position:0%
I was told I'm just reading it word for
 
05:28:27.780 --> 05:28:28.930 align:start position:0%
I was told I'm just reading it word for
word

05:28:28.930 --> 05:28:28.940 align:start position:0%
word
 
05:28:31.788 --> 05:28:31.798 align:start position:0%
yes he still needs to be able to vote
 
05:28:34.490 --> 05:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
right he needs to be able to hear us but
 
05:28:37.610 --> 05:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
if his video this is what
 
05:28:40.850 --> 05:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
um and maybe Jen can verify that with
 
05:28:43.430 --> 05:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
Anne so that I'm not like the lone
 
05:28:45.410 --> 05:28:45.420 align:start position:0%
person saying this well I don't think
 
05:28:47.208 --> 05:28:47.218 align:start position:0%
anyone questions your veracity
 
05:28:47.218 --> 05:28:48.830 align:start position:0%
anyone questions your veracity
representative

05:28:48.830 --> 05:28:48.840 align:start position:0%

welper
 
05:29:02.868 --> 05:29:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:04.430 --> 05:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
I'll try to
 
05:29:07.070 --> 05:29:07.080 align:start position:0%

05:29:20.820 --> 05:29:23.990 align:start position:0%
um
uh

05:29:23.990 --> 05:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:27.470 --> 05:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
and the I would report the
 
05:29:29.948 --> 05:29:29.958 align:start position:0%
the assistant clerk here would report
 
05:29:38.150 --> 05:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
that there are 14 Nays six yays and one
 
05:29:40.390 --> 05:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
um not voting
 
05:29:44.448 --> 05:29:44.458 align:start position:0%
representative wolper just joined us ah
 
05:29:48.490 --> 05:29:48.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:52.190 --> 05:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
the vote is the motion before us is
 
05:29:54.948 --> 05:29:54.958 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on 4 20.
 
05:29:59.750 --> 05:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:02.270 --> 05:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
and we can't hear you so you'll have to
 
05:30:06.410 --> 05:30:06.420 align:start position:0%
use your hand signal up or down use your
 
05:30:09.830 --> 05:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:14.930 --> 05:30:14.940 align:start position:0%
thumbs up up thumb is up okay so it that
 
05:30:19.190 --> 05:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
would make it seven years and 14 Nays
 
05:30:31.310 --> 05:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:37.090 --> 05:30:37.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:40.128 --> 05:30:40.138 align:start position:0%
is there another motion sure
 
05:30:42.350 --> 05:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
who would make the motion oh I'll go
 
05:30:44.510 --> 05:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
ahead and do it then I'll move expedient
 
05:30:46.670 --> 05:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
to legislate
 
05:30:48.708 --> 05:30:48.718 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan moves in
 
05:30:53.448 --> 05:30:53.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:58.610 --> 05:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:00.530 --> 05:31:00.540 align:start position:0%
and do you want to address your motion
 
05:31:02.990 --> 05:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
briefly well pretty much the same
 
05:31:04.788 --> 05:31:04.798 align:start position:0%
rationality gave for voting it's the
 
05:31:07.190 --> 05:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
ought to pass this is a um
 
05:31:10.368 --> 05:31:10.378 align:start position:0%
this is a small amount of well first
 
05:31:12.410 --> 05:31:12.420 align:start position:0%
it's a fairly small amount of money
 
05:31:16.430 --> 05:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
that's uh it's mostly huge for uh
 
05:31:18.410 --> 05:31:18.420 align:start position:0%
for prevention and then interdiction
 
05:31:20.270 --> 05:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
which I think is you know it's still uh
 
05:31:22.550 --> 05:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
which is still still necessary and it's
 
05:31:25.190 --> 05:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh mostly correlated with how much uh
 
05:31:26.810 --> 05:31:26.820 align:start position:0%
prevention the interjection is going on
 
05:31:29.270 --> 05:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
so treatment is a separate issue I don't
 
05:31:31.430 --> 05:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
think this uh amount of money would make
 
05:31:32.690 --> 05:31:32.700 align:start position:0%
much difference in the need for
 
05:31:34.730 --> 05:31:34.740 align:start position:0%
treatment which is also a fairly
 
05:31:37.610 --> 05:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
politically popular cause and something
 
05:31:40.310 --> 05:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
that's uh problems with Ronald retriever
 
05:31:41.990 --> 05:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
not really because there's inadequate
 
05:31:44.810 --> 05:31:44.820 align:start position:0%
money available for it except but so I
 
05:31:47.030 --> 05:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
think this is a relatively small amount
 
05:31:49.070 --> 05:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
of money that can be targeted by the
 
05:31:51.410 --> 05:31:51.420 align:start position:0%
Attorney General to where it's uh most
 
05:31:52.550 --> 05:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
needed to
 
05:31:54.890 --> 05:31:54.900 align:start position:0%
stop the supply and stop the demand up
 
05:31:57.590 --> 05:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
front and so that's um that's why I
 
05:32:01.368 --> 05:32:01.378 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm proposing this itl motion
 
05:32:03.708 --> 05:32:03.718 align:start position:0%
any other discussion are you ready to
 
05:32:03.718 --> 05:32:04.730 align:start position:0%
any other discussion are you ready to
vote

05:32:04.730 --> 05:32:04.740 align:start position:0%
vote
 
05:32:07.910 --> 05:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
I think we're ready to vote on that
 
05:32:11.390 --> 05:32:11.400 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair of the motion is itl on 420
 
05:32:14.390 --> 05:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
and standing in for the clerk who
 
05:32:17.750 --> 05:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
appears to on our screen twice
 
05:32:20.990 --> 05:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
um yes yes well the clerk is on the
 
05:32:23.090 --> 05:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
screen twice because his power came back
 
05:32:26.868 --> 05:32:26.878 align:start position:0%
on all right and so now he has uh Power
 
05:32:29.030 --> 05:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
to his laptop and he's still young his
 
05:32:31.010 --> 05:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
phone which is constantly connecting and
 
05:32:32.868 --> 05:32:32.878 align:start position:0%
disconnecting but this seems to be a lot
 
05:32:35.690 --> 05:32:35.700 align:start position:0%
better oh great

Summer's work by the uh uh right to know
Commission

05:37:22.610 --> 05:37:22.620 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
05:37:25.610 --> 05:37:25.620 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
05:37:27.470 --> 05:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
hoped to be
 
05:37:31.550 --> 05:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
really good solution to the inability of
 
05:37:33.110 --> 05:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
our citizens
 
05:37:37.250 --> 05:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
to uh get information uh that they need
 
05:37:39.650 --> 05:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
from their local communities their
 
05:37:42.590 --> 05:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
boards and committees
 
05:37:46.010 --> 05:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
we currently have a very the only way
 
05:37:48.830 --> 05:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
when when a cool request is made by a
 
05:37:51.410 --> 05:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
citizen the only way of
 
05:37:51.420 --> 05:37:52.970 align:start position:0%
citizen the only way of
disputing

05:37:52.970 --> 05:37:52.980 align:start position:0%
disputing
 
05:37:57.948 --> 05:37:57.958 align:start position:0%
or or uh yeah disputing a refusal
 
05:38:00.110 --> 05:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
is to go to court and this is very
 
05:38:03.470 --> 05:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
intimidating and expensive and difficult
 
05:38:05.810 --> 05:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
and well beyond the means of most of our
 
05:38:09.770 --> 05:38:09.780 align:start position:0%
citizens the Ombudsman is uh hoped to be
 
05:38:12.530 --> 05:38:12.540 align:start position:0%
is a solution that's been used in many
 
05:38:14.030 --> 05:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
other States including the neighboring
 
05:38:15.128 --> 05:38:15.138 align:start position:0%
state of Maine
 
05:38:18.050 --> 05:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
where his uh reportedly working quite
 
05:38:18.060 --> 05:38:19.010 align:start position:0%
where his uh reportedly working quite
well

05:38:19.010 --> 05:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:38:21.770 --> 05:38:21.780 align:start position:0%
and created an initial surge of cases
 
05:38:24.128 --> 05:38:24.138 align:start position:0%
which has since declined to a much more
 
05:38:26.510 --> 05:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
acceptable level
 
05:38:28.970 --> 05:38:28.980 align:start position:0%
and most of the disputes are easily
 
05:38:31.010 --> 05:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
resolved and we're hopeful that that's
 
05:38:33.230 --> 05:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
exactly what the Ombudsman will do at
 
05:38:34.850 --> 05:38:34.860 align:start position:0%
very little cost
 
05:38:37.010 --> 05:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
to the state the uh
 
05:38:40.150 --> 05:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
office space and things like that are
 
05:38:43.128 --> 05:38:43.138 align:start position:0%
within the budget of the Secretary of
 
05:38:44.810 --> 05:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
State who said he could handle that very
 
05:38:44.820 --> 05:38:46.010 align:start position:0%
State who said he could handle that very
easily

05:38:46.010 --> 05:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
easily
 
05:38:50.530 --> 05:38:50.540 align:start position:0%
we'll uh have people who have
 
05:38:52.910 --> 05:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
volunteered to volunteer
 
05:38:55.128 --> 05:38:55.138 align:start position:0%
to do it so the salary expense will be
 
05:38:57.470 --> 05:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
you know or very near
 
05:39:00.470 --> 05:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
and the cost to the cities and towns of
 
05:39:03.410 --> 05:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
these lawsuits can be enormous it was a
 
05:39:07.430 --> 05:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
suit in uh sandwich was 250 000 dollars
 
05:39:10.310 --> 05:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
when they lost we've heard lots of
 
05:39:13.010 --> 05:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
testimony from people that there's this
 
05:39:15.410 --> 05:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
towns have spent twenty thousand dollars
 
05:39:18.230 --> 05:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars defending suits
 
05:39:20.810 --> 05:39:20.820 align:start position:0%
that probably didn't need to be brought
 
05:39:22.670 --> 05:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
if everybody had
 
05:39:24.650 --> 05:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
a better understanding of the right to
 
05:39:28.670 --> 05:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
know law and and an authority figure to
 
05:39:31.190 --> 05:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
guide them as they go forward uh it's
 
05:39:33.590 --> 05:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
hope that it and it's part of the
 
05:39:35.390 --> 05:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
ombudsman's tasking
 
05:39:38.868 --> 05:39:38.878 align:start position:0%
to give us reports so that we those who
 
05:39:41.810 --> 05:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
write and supervise this law
 
05:39:45.050 --> 05:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
will know uh what's causing disputes
 
05:39:48.530 --> 05:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
what kinds of uh issues are where the
 
05:39:52.310 --> 05:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
law is vague or faulty and correct them
 
05:39:52.320 --> 05:39:54.288 align:start position:0%
law is vague or faulty and correct them
expeditiously

05:39:54.288 --> 05:39:54.298 align:start position:0%
expeditiously
 
05:39:57.288 --> 05:39:57.298 align:start position:0%
so all in all it should be an excellent
 
05:40:00.050 --> 05:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
solution for our state and practically
 
05:40:01.670 --> 05:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
no cost
 
05:40:06.470 --> 05:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
and fully supports the uh intent of our
 
05:40:11.270 --> 05:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:15.770 --> 05:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:18.470 --> 05:40:18.480 align:start position:0%

um
 
05:40:24.350 --> 05:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
I think this is a bit of a unicorn uh
 
05:40:28.128 --> 05:40:28.138 align:start position:0%
this is a government solution it's uh
 
05:40:30.170 --> 05:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
solving a government problem our
 
05:40:35.208 --> 05:40:35.218 align:start position:0%
weakness in 91a is not going to be
 
05:40:37.730 --> 05:40:37.740 align:start position:0%
resolved by adding more government to
 
05:40:38.868 --> 05:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
the issue
 
05:40:40.970 --> 05:40:40.980 align:start position:0%
if this
 
05:40:43.128 --> 05:40:43.138 align:start position:0%
happens to work out I'll be happy to eat
 
05:40:44.930 --> 05:40:44.940 align:start position:0%
my words but uh
 
05:40:47.448 --> 05:40:47.458 align:start position:0%
three or four years from now when the
 
05:40:49.850 --> 05:40:49.860 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy is built and it just won't
 
05:40:52.670 --> 05:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
go away and people still have their
 
05:40:55.970 --> 05:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
problems with 91a and
 
05:41:01.070 --> 05:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:01.080 --> 05:41:02.288 align:start position:0%

Sylvia's concerns about the unicorn and
 
05:41:17.030 --> 05:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
all other kinds of stuff um there is a
 
05:41:19.850 --> 05:41:19.860 align:start position:0%
um sunset provision to the bill
 
05:41:22.730 --> 05:41:22.740 align:start position:0%
um so if it doesn't work there is a
 
05:41:24.770 --> 05:41:24.780 align:start position:0%
there is a way to make it go away
 
05:41:28.910 --> 05:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
I have invested a lot into a lot of time
 
05:41:31.550 --> 05:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
into this bill a lot of effort along
 
05:41:33.170 --> 05:41:33.180 align:start position:0%

Hampshire
 
05:41:45.770 --> 05:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
and as far as cost
 
05:41:50.448 --> 05:41:50.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:52.070 --> 05:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
there will be a salary there won't be
 
05:41:55.368 --> 05:41:55.378 align:start position:0%
volunteers acting as Ombudsman so and
 
05:41:57.708 --> 05:41:57.718 align:start position:0%
that that's really important that we do
 
05:42:00.770 --> 05:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
have a salaried position that way um
 
05:42:00.780 --> 05:42:02.030 align:start position:0%

representative Langley
 
05:42:22.310 --> 05:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair I would just add
 
05:42:24.530 --> 05:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
I've had experience working with
 
05:42:26.090 --> 05:42:26.100 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman when I was the director of
 
05:42:29.208 --> 05:42:29.218 align:start position:0%
adult and elderly services and I I think
 
05:42:33.288 --> 05:42:33.298 align:start position:0%
to um representative Sylvia's point one
 
05:42:35.750 --> 05:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
of the things that I saw that I I didn't
 
05:42:38.750 --> 05:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
expect quite frankly was having
 
05:42:41.150 --> 05:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
ombudsmen available to people in in
 
05:42:44.208 --> 05:42:44.218 align:start position:0%
facilities I saw them able to intervene
 
05:42:47.030 --> 05:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
before a problem became catastrophic or
 
05:42:49.850 --> 05:42:49.860 align:start position:0%
before it became big enough that it had
 
05:42:52.250 --> 05:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
to reach the absolute top of an
 
05:42:54.350 --> 05:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
organization and that's one of the
 
05:42:56.150 --> 05:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
things that I think this Ombudsman
 
05:42:59.208 --> 05:42:59.218 align:start position:0%
Position will add to us because of their
 
05:43:02.690 --> 05:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
familiarity with systems and on their
 
05:43:04.850 --> 05:43:04.860 align:start position:0%
ability to talk with people and being
 
05:43:08.030 --> 05:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
more approachable to people I think they
 
05:43:10.850 --> 05:43:10.860 align:start position:0%
are often able to intervene in ways that
 
05:43:16.010 --> 05:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:19.730 --> 05:43:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:24.288 --> 05:43:24.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:27.650 --> 05:43:27.660 align:start position:0%
I think we are so representative wolper
 
05:43:29.628 --> 05:43:29.638 align:start position:0%
we have
 
05:43:33.288 --> 05:43:33.298 align:start position:0%

05:49:29.520 --> 05:49:31.548 align:start position:0%
this bill I feel that it's lacking
information

05:49:31.548 --> 05:49:31.558 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:49:35.150 --> 05:49:35.160 align:start position:0%

05:49:51.530 --> 05:49:51.540 align:start position:0%

yes I'll second it Mr chair
 
05:53:54.410 --> 05:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
second advice
 
05:53:57.110 --> 05:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative karate here
 
05:54:02.628 --> 05:54:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:05.990 --> 05:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
yes um give me one sorry about that
 
05:54:08.150 --> 05:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
so um the committee heard has heard
 
05:54:09.830 --> 05:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
multiple bills regarding
 
05:54:12.590 --> 05:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
um this subject and um the bill would
 
05:54:14.570 --> 05:54:14.580 align:start position:0%
protect fetal life at viability which is
 
05:54:17.150 --> 05:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
defined by Planned Parenthood V Casey at
 
05:54:19.670 --> 05:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
23 and 24 weeks but I think there is
 
05:54:21.708 --> 05:54:21.718 align:start position:0%
value in a bill like this however we've
 
05:54:23.750 --> 05:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
already we will be voting on another
 
05:54:25.250 --> 05:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
bill and I think
 
05:54:26.868 --> 05:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
um these both accomplished nearly the
 
05:54:28.250 --> 05:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
same thing so I'm asking the committee
 
05:54:30.110 --> 05:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
that we retain this bill so we can see
 
05:54:31.490 --> 05:54:31.500 align:start position:0%
the direction of other bills that we
 
05:54:35.990 --> 05:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:38.150 --> 05:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
yes representative Smith
 
05:54:41.330 --> 05:54:41.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair yes there
 
05:54:43.910 --> 05:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
are a number of other bills and they are
 
05:54:47.208 --> 05:54:47.218 align:start position:0%
the same bills that we hear year after
 
05:54:49.930 --> 05:54:49.940 align:start position:0%
year after year
 
05:54:54.230 --> 05:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
and um they are emotional bills they are
 
05:54:57.230 --> 05:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
bills that are distressing to people no
 
05:54:59.570 --> 05:54:59.580 align:start position:0%
matter how they feel and I don't
 
05:55:03.250 --> 05:55:03.260 align:start position:0%
understand why we would retain this bill
 
05:55:07.010 --> 05:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
rather than act on it
 
05:55:10.368 --> 05:55:10.378 align:start position:0%
um as we have year after year after year
 
05:55:13.010 --> 05:55:13.020 align:start position:0%
and I would oppose retention and hope
 
05:55:15.410 --> 05:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
instead that we could consider another
 
05:55:18.530 --> 05:55:18.540 align:start position:0%
motion thank you
 
05:55:20.110 --> 05:55:20.120 align:start position:0%
thank you

05:58:18.110 --> 05:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
is that what you're asking
 
05:58:18.120 --> 05:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
is that what you're asking
okay

05:58:21.660 --> 05:58:21.670 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:21.670 --> 05:58:23.208 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:58:23.208 --> 05:58:23.218 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:58:25.490 --> 05:58:25.500 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
05:58:25.500 --> 05:58:26.510 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
um

05:58:26.510 --> 05:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:29.570 --> 05:58:29.580 align:start position:0%
it's your call Mr chair I doubt if
 
05:58:32.208 --> 05:58:32.218 align:start position:0%
there's going to be extensive debate on
 
05:58:35.330 --> 05:58:35.340 align:start position:0%
any of these bills I think
 
05:58:35.340 --> 05:58:36.110 align:start position:0%
any of these bills I think
um

05:58:36.110 --> 05:58:36.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:39.470 --> 05:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
people know how they're going to vote
 
05:58:42.830 --> 05:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
um and uh so it's just a question of
 
05:58:44.868 --> 05:58:44.878 align:start position:0%
whether you want to go through the
 
05:58:47.150 --> 05:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
remaining bills in order or not that's
 
05:58:50.270 --> 05:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
completely up to you I just as soon get
 
05:58:52.250 --> 05:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
the abortion related bills out of the
 
05:58:54.530 --> 05:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
way at this point in time in our early
 
05:58:57.770 --> 05:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
session if we can why don't we do 625
 
05:59:06.430 --> 05:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:10.310 --> 05:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
and I guess I just wonder I just want to
 
05:59:10.320 --> 05:59:13.490 align:start position:0%
and I guess I just wonder I just want to
um

05:59:13.490 --> 05:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:15.708 --> 05:59:15.718 align:start position:0%
I'm going to support whatever you want
 
05:59:18.410 --> 05:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
to do Mr chairman out of respect I just
 
05:59:21.170 --> 05:59:21.180 align:start position:0%
want to register
 
05:59:24.288 --> 05:59:24.298 align:start position:0%
my objection to us not going through
 
05:59:27.170 --> 05:59:27.180 align:start position:0%
these bills in the order that I mean you
 
05:59:29.810 --> 05:59:29.820 align:start position:0%
had begun by saying we would go through
 
05:59:31.850 --> 05:59:31.860 align:start position:0%
them in order then you said we do the
 
05:59:34.070 --> 05:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
early bills and now you're picking these
 
05:59:37.810 --> 05:59:37.820 align:start position:0%
bills out and there are
 
05:59:40.368 --> 05:59:40.378 align:start position:0%
ramifications for when in fact these
 
05:59:42.890 --> 05:59:42.900 align:start position:0%
bills will get to the floor
 
05:59:46.788 --> 05:59:46.798 align:start position:0%
um and uh so that I would prefer that
 
05:59:48.410 --> 05:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
you just go through them in order but
 
05:59:50.570 --> 05:59:50.580 align:start position:0%
having said that I will of course
 
05:59:52.368 --> 05:59:52.378 align:start position:0%
respect your decision
 
05:59:54.288 --> 05:59:54.298 align:start position:0%
well I was hoping to get through the
 
05:59:57.470 --> 05:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
mall today and my intention was to go
 
06:00:00.350 --> 06:00:00.360 align:start position:0%
through an order just as you said but
 
06:00:01.850 --> 06:00:01.860 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we had a technical
 
06:00:04.670 --> 06:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
difficulty today so then I felt that we
 
06:00:06.170 --> 06:00:06.180 align:start position:0%
needed to get rid of the early bills
 
06:00:10.368 --> 06:00:10.378 align:start position:0%
which we clearly needed to do and now I
 
06:00:12.890 --> 06:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
find myself with relatively limited time
 
06:00:16.310 --> 06:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
any at this point in time and so I'm
 
06:00:19.070 --> 06:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
going to do these bills I think and I I
 
06:00:20.510 --> 06:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
understand your objection and I
 
06:00:22.250 --> 06:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
appreciate that representative Smith but
 
06:00:23.930 --> 06:00:23.940 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go forward with house bill
 
06:00:23.940 --> 06:00:25.910 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go forward with house bill
625.

06:00:25.910 --> 06:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
625.
 
06:00:28.670 --> 06:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
and and thank you and I and I just want
 
06:00:31.070 --> 06:00:31.080 align:start position:0%
to be clear what you do understand what
 
06:00:33.190 --> 06:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
my objection is
 
06:00:33.200 --> 06:00:34.730 align:start position:0%
my objection is
why

06:00:34.730 --> 06:00:34.740 align:start position:0%
why
 
06:00:36.410 --> 06:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
I'm saying this
 
06:00:39.650 --> 06:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
well what I heard you say was the timing
 
06:00:42.590 --> 06:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
of these bills apparently has some
 
06:00:45.590 --> 06:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
importance to you or other people and
 
06:00:48.708 --> 06:00:48.718 align:start position:0%
uh I get that okay then I would just
 
06:00:50.868 --> 06:00:50.878 align:start position:0%
like to go on record
 
06:00:53.030 --> 06:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
um as you all know
 
06:00:54.770 --> 06:00:54.780 align:start position:0%
um at the moment
 
06:00:56.690 --> 06:00:56.700 align:start position:0%
um there is a case pending in federal
 
06:00:59.930 --> 06:00:59.940 align:start position:0%
court that might make it possible for
 
06:01:02.990 --> 06:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
there to be a full participation of all
 
06:01:05.510 --> 06:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
legislators in the sessions on the 24th
 
06:01:08.570 --> 06:01:08.580 align:start position:0%
and 25th if however that doesn't come to
 
06:01:10.548 --> 06:01:10.558 align:start position:0%
pass there will be a number of
 
06:01:12.650 --> 06:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
legislators who will not be able to be
 
06:01:15.650 --> 06:01:15.660 align:start position:0%
there on the floor on the 24th and 25th
 
06:01:18.470 --> 06:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
but perhaps might be there the next time
 
06:01:21.048 --> 06:01:21.058 align:start position:0%
we meet in full session and these are
 
06:01:23.090 --> 06:01:23.100 align:start position:0%
important bills and that's why I thought
 
06:01:26.030 --> 06:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
we should just take them as they come
 
06:01:27.530 --> 06:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
and not
 
06:01:30.048 --> 06:01:30.058 align:start position:0%
um pick and choose but now I've I've
 
06:01:32.570 --> 06:01:32.580 align:start position:0%
voiced my concern and I respect your
 
06:01:34.490 --> 06:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
decision thank you thank you I
 
06:01:36.170 --> 06:01:36.180 align:start position:0%

06:14:33.170 --> 06:14:33.180 align:start position:0%

06:14:35.570 --> 06:14:35.580 align:start position:0%
um this amendment is very simple on page
 
06:14:35.580 --> 06:14:36.890 align:start position:0%
um this amendment is very simple on page
two

06:14:36.890 --> 06:14:36.900 align:start position:0%
two
 
06:14:36.900 --> 06:14:38.270 align:start position:0%
two
um

06:14:38.270 --> 06:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:42.110 --> 06:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
online 17 and 18 it removes the lines
 
06:14:43.970 --> 06:14:43.980 align:start position:0%
um or for training to provide or perform
 
06:14:46.430 --> 06:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
abortion the reason why I wanted to
 
06:14:47.990 --> 06:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
remove that line is because I want to
 
06:14:50.090 --> 06:14:50.100 align:start position:0%
make sure that even though I don't
 
06:14:52.368 --> 06:14:52.378 align:start position:0%
necessarily agree with that abortion
 
06:14:55.430 --> 06:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
procedures in all situations
 
06:14:56.990 --> 06:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
um I think that we need to set our
 
06:14:59.208 --> 06:14:59.218 align:start position:0%
nurses up with the proper Educational
 
06:15:01.548 --> 06:15:01.558 align:start position:0%
Tools to be successful
 
06:15:03.770 --> 06:15:03.780 align:start position:0%
um in this state and whatever they
 
06:15:05.628 --> 06:15:05.638 align:start position:0%
decide to do in the future so I just
 
06:15:07.850 --> 06:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
think this gives you an H or other
 
06:15:11.030 --> 06:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
university the university system options
 
06:15:14.270 --> 06:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
on educating on medical procedures that
 
06:15:15.708 --> 06:15:15.718 align:start position:0%
are performed in this state on a regular
 
06:15:15.718 --> 06:15:16.850 align:start position:0%
are performed in this state on a regular
basis

06:15:16.850 --> 06:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
basis
 
06:15:18.288 --> 06:15:18.298 align:start position:0%
um so for that reason I I hope the
 
06:15:20.750 --> 06:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
committee will adopt this
 
06:15:23.890 --> 06:15:23.900 align:start position:0%
um I did speak briefly to the university
 
06:15:26.750 --> 06:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
system lobbyist who said that this would
 
06:15:28.010 --> 06:15:28.020 align:start position:0%
help alleviate some of their concerns
 
06:15:30.850 --> 06:15:30.860 align:start position:0%
with the bill so thank you Mr chair
 
06:15:34.128 --> 06:15:34.138 align:start position:0%
any other discussion on the amendment
 
06:15:34.138 --> 06:15:36.410 align:start position:0%
any other discussion on the amendment
um

06:15:36.410 --> 06:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:37.730 --> 06:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
it would have been I would have
 
06:15:38.990 --> 06:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
preferred the amendment that just
 
06:15:41.570 --> 06:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
strikes this language altogether because
 
06:15:43.910 --> 06:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
um certainly it does solve one problem
 
06:15:45.650 --> 06:15:45.660 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure
 
06:15:47.570 --> 06:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
what the rationale is for not letting
 
06:15:50.330 --> 06:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
individual students decide how to use
 
06:15:51.890 --> 06:15:51.900 align:start position:0%
their um
 
06:15:55.070 --> 06:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
how to use your fees which are uh for
 
06:15:56.628 --> 06:15:56.638 align:start position:0%
the most part uh
 
06:15:58.910 --> 06:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
most part paid by the students
 
06:16:01.190 --> 06:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
themselves or by other
 
06:16:03.770 --> 06:16:03.780 align:start position:0%
rather than buy a rather than out of
 
06:16:05.628 --> 06:16:05.638 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money so the purpose is to
 
06:16:07.670 --> 06:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
prevent attachment running your future
 
06:16:09.708 --> 06:16:09.718 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure why we're including the
 
06:16:12.470 --> 06:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
tuition and fees very little of which uh
 
06:16:15.350 --> 06:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
is actually in fact paid for by out of
 
06:16:17.570 --> 06:16:17.580 align:start position:0%
the state tax monies
 
06:16:17.580 --> 06:16:18.410 align:start position:0%
the state tax monies
so

06:16:18.410 --> 06:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:16:20.750 --> 06:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
um I'll vote against this on the grounds
 
06:16:23.750 --> 06:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go far enough this entire uh
 
06:16:25.910 --> 06:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
this entire section of the bill didn't
 
06:16:27.590 --> 06:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
belong there in the first place plus I
 
06:16:29.990 --> 06:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
mean I'm opposed to the whole thing but
 
06:16:32.208 --> 06:16:32.218 align:start position:0%
um this
 
06:16:34.128 --> 06:16:34.138 align:start position:0%
elimination one problem but it's still
 
06:16:35.750 --> 06:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
like leave several other problems in
 
06:16:36.948 --> 06:16:36.958 align:start position:0%
place so
 
06:16:39.708 --> 06:16:39.718 align:start position:0%
is there any other discussion
 
06:16:42.470 --> 06:16:42.480 align:start position:0%

so the vote is 11 to 10.
 
06:23:51.948 --> 06:23:51.958 align:start position:0%
and who would do The Minority Report on
 
06:23:51.958 --> 06:23:53.350 align:start position:0%
and who would do The Minority Report on
that

06:23:53.350 --> 06:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:23:58.430 --> 06:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:00.530 --> 06:24:00.540 align:start position:0%
just to be clear Mr chair The Minority
 
06:24:03.470 --> 06:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
Report is going to be an otpa correct
 
06:24:08.030 --> 06:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
otpa 338 339 yep perfect so for those
 
06:24:09.708 --> 06:24:09.718 align:start position:0%
that don't know
 
06:24:13.368 --> 06:24:13.378 align:start position:0%
if you report in a committee report the
 
06:24:13.378 --> 06:24:15.110 align:start position:0%
if you report in a committee report the
amendments

06:24:15.110 --> 06:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
06:24:17.990 --> 06:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
the Amendments appear in the calendar
 
06:24:22.070 --> 06:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:24.410 --> 06:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
so they will both be there and subject
 
06:24:27.048 --> 06:24:27.058 align:start position:0%
to separate votes in the house
 
06:24:29.448 --> 06:24:29.458 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to interrupt but it may be
 
06:24:31.430 --> 06:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
necessary to have those amendments come
 
06:24:31.440 --> 06:24:33.170 align:start position:0%
necessary to have those amendments come
by

06:24:33.170 --> 06:24:33.180 align:start position:0%
by
 
06:24:33.180 --> 06:24:34.788 align:start position:0%
by
combustion

06:24:34.788 --> 06:24:34.798 align:start position:0%
combustion
 
06:24:36.770 --> 06:24:36.780 align:start position:0%
um your preferred minority motion is
 
06:24:38.570 --> 06:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
otpa you may need to have those combined
 
06:24:41.270 --> 06:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
into a new number
 
06:24:42.770 --> 06:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
yeah it's my understanding that
 
06:24:44.510 --> 06:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
legislative services does that and
 
06:24:47.990 --> 06:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
they'll give it a new number yes
 
06:24:51.170 --> 06:24:51.180 align:start position:0%
okay that would save time but it would
 
06:24:53.150 --> 06:24:53.160 align:start position:0%
save time if the itl doesn't pass right
 
06:24:56.090 --> 06:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
off the bat but yes
 
06:25:00.288 --> 06:25:00.298 align:start position:0%

uh just briefly uh during a testimony
 
06:25:50.628 --> 06:25:50.638 align:start position:0%
the operative phrase that came out to me
 
06:25:52.548 --> 06:25:52.558 align:start position:0%
is medically appropriate
 
06:25:55.850 --> 06:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
that if the infant is born regardless of
 
06:25:55.860 --> 06:25:57.708 align:start position:0%
that if the infant is born regardless of
circumstances

06:25:57.708 --> 06:25:57.718 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
06:25:57.718 --> 06:25:59.750 align:start position:0%
circumstances
that

06:25:59.750 --> 06:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:26:03.048 --> 06:26:03.058 align:start position:0%
it's medically appropriate that if it
 
06:26:04.490 --> 06:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
gets reasonable care and treatment so
 
06:26:06.948 --> 06:26:06.958 align:start position:0%
I'm I remember I asked my colleagues
 
06:26:11.090 --> 06:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:14.030 --> 06:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
any other discussion

moment just to address representative
 
06:37:30.770 --> 06:37:30.780 align:start position:0%
McLean's concerns that he brought up the
 
06:37:33.170 --> 06:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
the bill is a flexible law that allows
 
06:37:36.170 --> 06:37:36.180 align:start position:0%
or the bill that's in place now is a
 
06:37:38.270 --> 06:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
flexible law that allows for it to be
 
06:37:40.010 --> 06:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
implemented and I think in the interest
 
06:37:43.368 --> 06:37:43.378 align:start position:0%
of concerns we've heard about increasing
 
06:37:43.378 --> 06:37:44.150 align:start position:0%
of concerns we've heard about increasing
um

06:37:44.150 --> 06:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:48.650 --> 06:37:48.660 align:start position:0%
and threats to leave the bill in place
 
06:37:50.510 --> 06:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
um the buffer zone Bill we have now in
 
06:37:53.270 --> 06:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
place to allow for the flexibility of
 
06:37:55.368 --> 06:37:55.378 align:start position:0%
clinics and Healthcare centers to
 
06:37:57.708 --> 06:37:57.718 align:start position:0%
address any issues that come up is
 
06:37:57.718 --> 06:37:59.270 align:start position:0%
address any issues that come up is
important

06:37:59.270 --> 06:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
important
 
06:38:01.448 --> 06:38:01.458 align:start position:0%
um the bill has withstood
 
06:38:05.690 --> 06:38:05.700 align:start position:0%
challenges in court and uh
 
06:38:08.090 --> 06:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
I think tries to balance the First
 
06:38:10.250 --> 06:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
Amendment issues as well as the public
 
06:38:12.708 --> 06:38:12.718 align:start position:0%

06:38:22.610 --> 06:38:22.620 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Horrigan I'll
 
06:38:25.250 --> 06:38:25.260 align:start position:0%
take a moment to say like and I I didn't
 
06:38:26.690 --> 06:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
have that much to do with it Reverend
 
06:38:28.010 --> 06:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
Birch was
 
06:38:30.230 --> 06:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
had more to it anybody but they're about
 
06:38:33.230 --> 06:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
half a dozen members totally rewrote
 
06:38:36.288 --> 06:38:36.298 align:start position:0%
the original Bill four or five years ago
 
06:38:37.430 --> 06:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
so we were
 
06:38:39.708 --> 06:38:39.718 align:start position:0%
well aware of the of the McCullen versus
 
06:38:42.548 --> 06:38:42.558 align:start position:0%
Coakley case so we we tried to read the
 
06:38:45.470 --> 06:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
objections raised in that one and also
 
06:38:45.480 --> 06:38:46.368 align:start position:0%
objections raised in that one and also
um

06:38:46.368 --> 06:38:46.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:38:50.090 --> 06:38:50.100 align:start position:0%
the activities of the protesters
 
06:38:52.970 --> 06:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
some of them say that they're offering
 
06:38:54.770 --> 06:38:54.780 align:start position:0%
counseling services so there actually is
 
06:38:56.690 --> 06:38:56.700 align:start position:0%
no First Amendment right to offer
 
06:38:58.548 --> 06:38:58.558 align:start position:0%
unlicensed Counseling Services on the
 
06:39:00.470 --> 06:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
sidewalk or anywhere else and this does
 
06:39:01.670 --> 06:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
it also
 
06:39:04.190 --> 06:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
and in terms of free speech just doesn't
 
06:39:06.650 --> 06:39:06.660 align:start position:0%
uh limit the right to free speech it
 
06:39:08.570 --> 06:39:08.580 align:start position:0%
just means they uh can't do in a way
 
06:39:10.610 --> 06:39:10.620 align:start position:0%
that's obstructing or harassing people

representative Burch and I have had
 
06:44:49.610 --> 06:44:49.620 align:start position:0%
uh we uh we seem to be uh kind of
 
06:44:52.368 --> 06:44:52.378 align:start position:0%
speaking uh across each other and not
 
06:44:54.530 --> 06:44:54.540 align:start position:0%
quite uh understanding where we're at so
 
06:44:57.048 --> 06:44:57.058 align:start position:0%
the issue was having to do with the
 
06:44:59.770 --> 06:44:59.780 align:start position:0%
federal Joint Task forces
 
06:44:59.780 --> 06:45:01.490 align:start position:0%
federal Joint Task forces
and

06:45:01.490 --> 06:45:01.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:45:04.310 --> 06:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
um this bill makes clear that
 
06:45:04.320 --> 06:45:06.170 align:start position:0%
um this bill makes clear that
uh

06:45:06.170 --> 06:45:06.180 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:45:08.810 --> 06:45:08.820 align:start position:0%
it only applies to seizures that are
 
06:45:11.330 --> 06:45:11.340 align:start position:0%
done by local New Hampshire law
 
06:45:14.208 --> 06:45:14.218 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh in the state and it does
 
06:45:19.490 --> 06:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
not affect Joint Task Force seizures
 
06:45:23.868 --> 06:45:23.878 align:start position:0%
so as a reminder this bill
 
06:45:27.110 --> 06:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh prohibits the
 
06:45:27.120 --> 06:45:28.190 align:start position:0%
uh prohibits the
um

06:45:28.190 --> 06:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:45:30.530 --> 06:45:30.540 align:start position:0%
adoption to the federal Equitable
 
06:45:35.350 --> 06:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
sharing program of uh seizures
 
06:45:38.390 --> 06:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
under one hundred thousand dollars
 
06:45:43.190 --> 06:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
and keeps that in state we have a good
 
06:45:45.650 --> 06:45:45.660 align:start position:0%
criminal asset Orchard
 
06:45:47.570 --> 06:45:47.580 align:start position:0%
law interstate
 
06:45:52.250 --> 06:45:52.260 align:start position:0%
this keeps that uh from going into the
 
06:45:54.048 --> 06:45:54.058 align:start position:0%
regular program
 
06:45:56.390 --> 06:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:45:58.548 --> 06:45:58.558 align:start position:0%
that way we are assuring that the the
 
06:46:00.048 --> 06:46:00.058 align:start position:0%
state law is
 
06:46:02.990 --> 06:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
followed and we have
 
06:46:06.410 --> 06:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
a criminal prosecution and money is not
 
06:46:07.910 --> 06:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
just uh
 
06:46:13.548 --> 06:46:13.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:15.708 --> 06:46:15.718 align:start position:0%

address it at all
 
06:46:22.910 --> 06:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
I think it's a uh it's a good Amendment
 
06:46:26.208 --> 06:46:26.218 align:start position:0%
it clarifies exactly what we're speaking
 
06:46:28.788 --> 06:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
about it's not a huge sum of money but
 
06:46:32.330 --> 06:46:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:36.048 --> 06:46:36.058 align:start position:0%

you've adopted
 
06:51:46.910 --> 06:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 331 as amended with Amendment
 
06:51:46.920 --> 06:51:48.890 align:start position:0%
House Bill 331 as amended with Amendment
0188

06:51:48.890 --> 06:51:48.900 align:start position:0%
0188
 
06:51:48.900 --> 06:51:51.170 align:start position:0%
0188
and

06:51:51.170 --> 06:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:51:56.810 --> 06:51:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:58.968 --> 06:51:58.978 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I'll defer to my friend in
 
06:52:01.368 --> 06:52:01.378 align:start position:0%
Durham but I don't plan on writing one
 
06:52:03.830 --> 06:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
um and consent is okay with me I would I
 
06:52:05.150 --> 06:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
was going to defer to my friend from
 
06:52:07.670 --> 06:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
Goffstown and uh so I guess we're both
 
06:52:09.410 --> 06:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
in agreement we don't objective putting
 
06:52:10.910 --> 06:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
it on consent so
 
06:52:13.610 --> 06:52:13.620 align:start position:0%
okay that'll be on the consent calendar
 
06:52:18.350 --> 06:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:28.628 --> 06:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:30.890 --> 06:52:30.900 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
06:52:30.900 --> 06:52:33.910 align:start position:0%
to pass
second

06:52:33.910 --> 06:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:37.968 --> 06:52:37.978 align:start position:0%
by representative Sylvia ought to pass
 
06:52:40.270 --> 06:52:40.280 align:start position:0%
and who seconded that sober
 
06:52:43.670 --> 06:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative Silber seconded that
 
06:52:47.090 --> 06:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
and would you like to address the motion
 
06:52:51.590 --> 06:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
sure just briefly uh this bill uh takes
 
06:52:53.330 --> 06:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
uh property
 
06:52:53.340 --> 06:52:55.250 align:start position:0%
uh property
negotiations

06:52:55.250 --> 06:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
negotiations
 
06:52:58.310 --> 06:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh for Price leaves that in non-public
 
06:53:00.350 --> 06:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
but then uh
 
06:53:04.430 --> 06:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
makes the actual consummation of the
 
06:53:07.250 --> 06:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
deal uh a public matter
 
06:53:09.590 --> 06:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
so I think this is a good public policy
 
06:53:12.170 --> 06:53:12.180 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we don't have things
 
06:53:15.310 --> 06:53:15.320 align:start position:0%
like that went on in Laconia
 
06:53:17.990 --> 06:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
and of course that's when we found out
 
06:53:20.750 --> 06:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
about we don't know if other such deals
 
06:53:24.170 --> 06:53:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:26.330 --> 06:53:26.340 align:start position:0%
in non-public sessions so I think this
 
06:53:30.170 --> 06:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:34.010 --> 06:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:34.020 --> 06:53:35.690 align:start position:0%
 
I

06:53:35.690 --> 06:53:35.700 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:53:37.548 --> 06:53:37.558 align:start position:0%
I listened to a discussions on with Tony
 
06:53:40.250 --> 06:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
and I gathered that not everybody was
 
06:53:43.070 --> 06:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
happy with the decision was made in it
 
06:53:44.990 --> 06:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
they did this often happens in real
 
06:53:47.570 --> 06:53:47.580 align:start position:0%
estate negotiations uh
 
06:53:49.490 --> 06:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
you know lay the groundwork for it in
 
06:53:51.530 --> 06:53:51.540 align:start position:0%
Secrets I I
 
06:53:53.628 --> 06:53:53.638 align:start position:0%
don't really see what the larger problem
 
06:53:55.548 --> 06:53:55.558 align:start position:0%
is it seems like a local controversy
 
06:53:56.868 --> 06:53:56.878 align:start position:0%
which uh
 
06:53:59.930 --> 06:53:59.940 align:start position:0%
and I don't think if this bill if it law
 
06:54:01.250 --> 06:54:01.260 align:start position:0%
had said would have said I don't know
 
06:54:02.810 --> 06:54:02.820 align:start position:0%
that would have happened that really any
 
06:54:06.230 --> 06:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
differently substantially so that's uh I
 
06:54:08.570 --> 06:54:08.580 align:start position:0%
I just I think this bill is unnecessary
 
06:54:10.670 --> 06:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
and I don't think the story about
 
06:54:16.490 --> 06:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:18.468 --> 06:54:18.478 align:start position:0%

06:56:40.390 --> 06:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:42.530 --> 06:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:56:46.070 --> 06:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
motion fails on a 10 to 10 vote
 
06:56:48.830 --> 06:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if we want to uh rather
 
06:56:50.868 --> 06:56:50.878 align:start position:0%
than take another motion at this time to
 
06:56:52.548 --> 06:56:52.558 align:start position:0%
hold the bill until
 
06:56:55.430 --> 06:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
we have a full complement of
 
06:56:55.440 --> 06:56:59.330 align:start position:0%
we have a full complement of
members

06:56:59.330 --> 06:56:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:59.340 --> 06:57:00.590 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:57:00.590 --> 06:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:57:03.890 --> 06:57:03.900 align:start position:0%
okay I would not object to that Mr chair
 
06:57:08.270 --> 06:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:08.280 --> 06:57:12.468 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:57:12.468 --> 06:57:12.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:18.220 --> 06:57:18.230 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:18.230 --> 06:57:22.368 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:57:22.368 --> 06:57:22.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:22.378 --> 06:57:23.810 align:start position:0%
 
that

06:57:23.810 --> 06:57:23.820 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:57:23.820 --> 06:57:26.030 align:start position:0%
that
um

06:57:26.030 --> 06:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:28.310 --> 06:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
and we may find ourselves in the same
 
06:57:30.830 --> 06:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances on that bill
 
06:57:30.840 --> 06:58:06.288 align:start position:0%
circumstances on that bill
[Applause]

06:58:06.288 --> 06:58:06.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:08.270 --> 06:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
you um
 
06:58:11.110 --> 06:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
would you like to do House Bill 359
 
06:58:13.850 --> 06:58:13.860 align:start position:0%
perhaps we can come to some agreement on
 
06:58:28.910 --> 06:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:28.920 --> 06:58:38.208 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

06:58:38.208 --> 06:58:38.218 align:start position:0%

06:58:47.270 --> 06:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
they're two hands up it's your call Mr
 
06:58:47.280 --> 06:58:48.708 align:start position:0%
they're two hands up it's your call Mr
chair

06:58:48.708 --> 06:58:48.718 align:start position:0%
chair
 
06:58:51.430 --> 06:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna call in joke I think uh
 
06:58:54.948 --> 06:58:54.958 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander first
 
06:58:54.958 --> 06:58:56.270 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander first
um

06:58:56.270 --> 06:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:58:58.070 --> 06:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
06:59:04.430 --> 06:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:10.430 --> 06:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:12.650 --> 06:59:12.660 align:start position:0%
I'll second it reckoned by
 
06:59:15.650 --> 06:59:15.660 align:start position:0%
representative silver
 
06:59:15.660 --> 06:59:17.708 align:start position:0%
representative silver
um

06:59:17.708 --> 06:59:17.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:20.030 --> 06:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
and do you want to address that at all
 
06:59:23.208 --> 06:59:23.218 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander
 
06:59:26.330 --> 06:59:26.340 align:start position:0%
um I I mean briefly we can I think this
 
06:59:28.788 --> 06:59:28.798 align:start position:0%
bill does have merits but I also think
 
06:59:30.708 --> 06:59:30.718 align:start position:0%
that the sponsor
 
06:59:32.330 --> 06:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
um also admitted that there's a lot of
 
06:59:34.128 --> 06:59:34.138 align:start position:0%
problems with the language in this and a
 
06:59:35.570 --> 06:59:35.580 align:start position:0%
lot of the answers
 
06:59:36.948 --> 06:59:36.958 align:start position:0%
um to the questions that the committee
 
06:59:40.128 --> 06:59:40.138 align:start position:0%
had uh were not answered so I just I TL
 
06:59:42.230 --> 06:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
it and bring it back as a new bill
 
06:59:50.448 --> 06:59:50.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:53.208 --> 06:59:53.218 align:start position:0%
any other discussion I I guess the
 
06:59:56.150 --> 06:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
question is whether or not you I T L it
 
06:59:59.510 --> 06:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
based upon that or whether or not
 
06:59:59.520 --> 07:00:01.570 align:start position:0%
based upon that or whether or not
um

07:00:01.570 --> 07:00:01.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:00:04.310 --> 07:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
clearly the sponsor indicated that it
 
07:00:07.090 --> 07:00:07.100 align:start position:0%
was poorly worded and and
 
07:00:09.590 --> 07:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
it needed work
 
07:00:09.600 --> 07:00:10.850 align:start position:0%
it needed work
either

07:00:10.850 --> 07:00:10.860 align:start position:0%
either
 
07:00:13.190 --> 07:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
I tell it or you could retain it I guess
 
07:00:17.690 --> 07:00:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:25.788 --> 07:00:25.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:28.730 --> 07:00:28.740 align:start position:0%
question is whether if this isn't going
 
07:00:30.110 --> 07:00:30.120 align:start position:0%
to pass if it's something that we can't
 
07:00:31.910 --> 07:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
retain because it heard a lot of
 
07:00:34.010 --> 07:00:34.020 align:start position:0%
testimony that it does seem to address a
 
07:00:36.288 --> 07:00:36.298 align:start position:0%
problem that is happening in New
 
07:00:38.510 --> 07:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I from what I heard it
 
07:00:40.490 --> 07:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
didn't appear that the problems were so
 
07:00:43.190 --> 07:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
difficult to solve that we couldn't
 
07:00:45.530 --> 07:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
um do so with some retention and
 
07:00:45.540 --> 07:00:48.350 align:start position:0%
um do so with some retention and
conversation

07:00:48.350 --> 07:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:50.930 --> 07:00:50.940 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander
 
07:00:52.310 --> 07:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair just to address
 
07:00:53.690 --> 07:00:53.700 align:start position:0%
that point
 
07:00:55.490 --> 07:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
um the sponsor and advocates for the
 
07:00:57.410 --> 07:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
bill gave examples of how the 11th
 
07:00:58.670 --> 07:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court
 
07:01:00.230 --> 07:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
um in the South
 
07:01:03.048 --> 07:01:03.058 align:start position:0%
um struck down um discrimination this is
 
07:01:05.030 --> 07:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
being discrimination based on race
 
07:01:06.650 --> 07:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
um but we have no evidence up here that
 
07:01:08.330 --> 07:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court up here
 
07:01:10.070 --> 07:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
um would do the same and I think that
 
07:01:12.830 --> 07:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
this bill the merits of the bill would
 
07:01:15.410 --> 07:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
qualify in my opinion under
 
07:01:17.150 --> 07:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
um definition of discrimination based on
 
07:01:19.250 --> 07:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
race so I think for that reason
 
07:01:22.850 --> 07:01:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:25.730 --> 07:01:25.740 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
07:01:27.170 --> 07:01:27.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:01:31.070 --> 07:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair I um
 
07:01:34.010 --> 07:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
as we all did sat through that hearing
 
07:01:39.048 --> 07:01:39.058 align:start position:0%
and I was quite attentive as I try to be
 
07:01:44.868 --> 07:01:44.878 align:start position:0%
um uh to all all the bills and I was
 
07:01:47.110 --> 07:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
um saddened
 
07:01:52.868 --> 07:01:52.878 align:start position:0%
by some of the questions that were asked
 
07:01:55.610 --> 07:01:55.620 align:start position:0%
that to me
 
07:01:58.250 --> 07:01:58.260 align:start position:0%
um would if I were an attorney and we
 
07:02:01.430 --> 07:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
know I'm not would cause me to say I
 
07:02:04.910 --> 07:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
rest my case the questions themselves
 
07:02:04.920 --> 07:02:07.070 align:start position:0%
rest my case the questions themselves
reflected

07:02:07.070 --> 07:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
reflected
 
07:02:07.080 --> 07:02:07.670 align:start position:0%
reflected
um

07:02:07.670 --> 07:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:02:10.930 --> 07:02:10.940 align:start position:0%
uh what could politely be called
 
07:02:13.330 --> 07:02:13.340 align:start position:0%
unconscious bias
 
07:02:17.628 --> 07:02:17.638 align:start position:0%
uh uh where perhaps the speakers didn't
 
07:02:20.030 --> 07:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
quite realize the implications of what
 
07:02:23.330 --> 07:02:23.340 align:start position:0%
they were saying I believe this is a
 
07:02:28.490 --> 07:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
problem that is experienced here in New
 
07:02:33.128 --> 07:02:33.138 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that the least we could do
 
07:02:37.070 --> 07:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
is address that problem either by going
 
07:02:41.350 --> 07:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
ahead with the bill or in good faith
 
07:02:45.288 --> 07:02:45.298 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill to try to correct
 
07:02:47.750 --> 07:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
some of the um
 
07:02:50.868 --> 07:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
the drafting weaknesses and then go
 
07:02:53.570 --> 07:02:53.580 align:start position:0%
forward with the bill where proudly we
 
07:02:56.390 --> 07:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
could say that yet again we're
 
07:02:58.490 --> 07:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
respecting the rights of all the people
 
07:03:02.690 --> 07:03:02.700 align:start position:0%
in the state thank you
 
07:03:04.850 --> 07:03:04.860 align:start position:0%
representative Morgan
 
07:03:06.968 --> 07:03:06.978 align:start position:0%
um yes if we the Full House
 
07:03:10.670 --> 07:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
and the Full House passes an Ito then
 
07:03:12.770 --> 07:03:12.780 align:start position:0%
that would make it difficult for
 
07:03:15.590 --> 07:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
someone to introduce a similar Bill next
 
07:03:17.150 --> 07:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
year because we've already rejected it
 
07:03:20.570 --> 07:03:20.580 align:start position:0%
so um that's uh that's a potential
 
07:03:22.430 --> 07:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
disadvantage probably a person would be
 
07:03:27.230 --> 07:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sure Reverend waltz or the other
 
07:03:28.490 --> 07:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
issue support would probably not
 
07:03:31.010 --> 07:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
introduce the exact same bill given uh
 
07:03:32.448 --> 07:03:32.458 align:start position:0%
you know since they were at the hearing
 
07:03:34.310 --> 07:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
and they were uh
 
07:03:36.110 --> 07:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
they heard those same concerns we were
 
07:03:37.968 --> 07:03:37.978 align:start position:0%
expressing at the executive sessions so
 
07:03:39.948 --> 07:03:39.958 align:start position:0%
I think um it only it might be
 
07:03:41.930 --> 07:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
potentially problematic although that's
 
07:03:43.070 --> 07:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
like a
 
07:03:44.930 --> 07:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
particularly case of what judgment the
 
07:03:47.690 --> 07:03:47.700 align:start position:0%
deputy speaker makes this fall and then
 
07:03:49.190 --> 07:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
it can also be appealed to the rules
 
07:03:50.390 --> 07:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
committee if somebody wanted to bring
 
07:03:52.968 --> 07:03:52.978 align:start position:0%
the bill back after it I was itl but
 
07:03:55.070 --> 07:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
that's just the next few issue with
 
07:03:56.750 --> 07:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
doing that versus taking some other
 
07:04:02.270 --> 07:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:04.250 --> 07:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
um so that that's that's just what I
 
07:04:05.628 --> 07:04:05.638 align:start position:0%
have to say about it I think I think
 
07:04:07.368 --> 07:04:07.378 align:start position:0%
it's a I think it's a good idea I do
 
07:04:10.128 --> 07:04:10.138 align:start position:0%
agree there's the way it's worded is uh
 
07:04:12.830 --> 07:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
not really not not really ready to be
 
07:04:12.840 --> 07:04:15.590 align:start position:0%
not really not not really ready to be
passed

07:04:15.590 --> 07:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:19.670 --> 07:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
well I think that's my issue is
 
07:04:22.368 --> 07:04:22.378 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm sympathetic with the end
 
07:04:26.510 --> 07:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
of the bill but the way it's drafted you
 
07:04:30.770 --> 07:04:30.780 align:start position:0%
you know you can't really Define Race by
 
07:04:32.810 --> 07:04:32.820 align:start position:0%
someone having the characteristics of
 
07:04:32.820 --> 07:04:35.090 align:start position:0%
someone having the characteristics of
race

07:04:35.090 --> 07:04:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:39.170 --> 07:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
you need to have a an appropriate
 
07:04:41.570 --> 07:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
definition and it's just poorly poorly
 
07:04:44.570 --> 07:04:44.580 align:start position:0%
drafted poorly worded and it needs it
 
07:04:45.380 --> 07:04:45.390 align:start position:0%
needs work
 
07:04:45.390 --> 07:04:47.570 align:start position:0%
needs work
[Music]

07:04:47.570 --> 07:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
07:04:50.208 --> 07:04:50.218 align:start position:0%
I certainly I don't think it's in a in a
 
07:04:52.670 --> 07:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
state where it could be passed or should
 
07:04:57.830 --> 07:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:01.090 --> 07:05:01.100 align:start position:0%
okay if there's is any other discussion
 
07:05:03.788 --> 07:05:03.798 align:start position:0%
this Mr chair
 
07:05:07.910 --> 07:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
would the maker of the motion uh
 
07:05:12.350 --> 07:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
consider withdrawing itl so that we
 
07:05:14.590 --> 07:05:14.600 align:start position:0%
might uh
 
07:05:21.230 --> 07:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:22.730 --> 07:05:22.740 align:start position:0%
I don't know you could ask
 
07:05:26.770 --> 07:05:26.780 align:start position:0%
representative uh Sylvia if uh
 
07:05:29.330 --> 07:05:29.340 align:start position:0%
excuse me if Alexander would be willing
 
07:05:34.010 --> 07:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:37.490 --> 07:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
um certainly uncertainly willing to do
 
07:05:39.230 --> 07:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
that on out of courtesy to my friend
 
07:05:40.730 --> 07:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
from Durham
 
07:05:42.230 --> 07:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
um we also
 
07:05:44.448 --> 07:05:44.458 align:start position:0%
um don't have a full committee here
 
07:05:44.458 --> 07:05:45.708 align:start position:0%
um don't have a full committee here
today

07:05:45.708 --> 07:05:45.718 align:start position:0%
today
 
07:05:45.718 --> 07:05:46.368 align:start position:0%
today
um

07:05:46.368 --> 07:05:46.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:05:48.230 --> 07:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
and circumstances may have been
 
07:05:48.240 --> 07:05:51.230 align:start position:0%
and circumstances may have been
different

07:05:51.230 --> 07:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:54.048 --> 07:05:54.058 align:start position:0%
so and representative silver would you
 
07:05:56.570 --> 07:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
be amenable to withdrawing your second
 
07:05:59.208 --> 07:05:59.218 align:start position:0%
in order to continue yes that's that's
 
07:05:59.218 --> 07:06:01.788 align:start position:0%
in order to continue yes that's that's
fine

07:06:01.788 --> 07:06:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:06.708 --> 07:06:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:08.628 --> 07:06:08.638 align:start position:0%
so representative Alexander would you
 
07:06:12.230 --> 07:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:14.208 --> 07:06:14.218 align:start position:0%
sure I would love to
 
07:06:15.548 --> 07:06:15.558 align:start position:0%
so moved
 
07:06:18.350 --> 07:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
and seconded by
 
07:06:22.510 --> 07:06:22.520 align:start position:0%

07:08:08.090 --> 07:08:08.100 align:start position:0%
where we at
 
07:08:08.100 --> 07:08:10.910 align:start position:0%
where we at
okay

07:08:10.910 --> 07:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:10.920 --> 07:08:14.468 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

07:08:14.468 --> 07:08:14.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:17.270 --> 07:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
any further this afternoon my concern is
 
07:08:19.310 --> 07:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
that many of the votes that we may take
 
07:08:21.230 --> 07:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
at this point in time are going to end
 
07:08:24.048 --> 07:08:24.058 align:start position:0%
up being 10 to 10 votes
 
07:08:28.788 --> 07:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:32.570 --> 07:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
uh well 287 is the remote notarization
 
07:08:34.208 --> 07:08:34.218 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:08:37.788 --> 07:08:37.798 align:start position:0%
I know we could
 
07:08:37.798 --> 07:08:40.128 align:start position:0%
I know we could
uh

07:08:40.128 --> 07:08:40.138 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:08:44.810 --> 07:08:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:48.110 --> 07:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
to read and I don't know where people
 
07:08:51.350 --> 07:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
are necessarily on it we've been asked
 
07:08:54.650 --> 07:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
to hold the bill by the bankers
 
07:08:56.390 --> 07:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
Association because they're trying to
 
07:08:59.030 --> 07:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
work out the details and we were asked
 
07:09:01.190 --> 07:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
or specifically requested
 
07:09:04.430 --> 07:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh to hold the bill because they're
 
07:09:08.448 --> 07:09:08.458 align:start position:0%
trying to amend the bill in the Senate
 
07:09:11.628 --> 07:09:11.638 align:start position:0%
there's a similar bill in the Senate and
 
07:09:13.368 --> 07:09:13.378 align:start position:0%
it's been made part of an Omnibus Bill
 
07:09:16.610 --> 07:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
but the current bill doesn't provide for
 
07:09:19.128 --> 07:09:19.138 align:start position:0%
remote notarization of estate planning
 
07:09:22.250 --> 07:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
documents like Wills or trusts and
 
07:09:24.530 --> 07:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
they're looking to amend it there
 
07:09:26.810 --> 07:09:26.820 align:start position:0%
and hopefully when the Senate Bill comes
 
07:09:28.490 --> 07:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
over but they've asked us if we would
 
07:09:31.490 --> 07:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
hold that bill for now if that was
 
07:09:33.410 --> 07:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
agreeable to everybody
 
07:09:36.830 --> 07:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
until we see what the Senate does
 
07:09:39.048 --> 07:09:39.058 align:start position:0%
are they assuming that the Senate is
 
07:09:41.930 --> 07:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
going to vote on that Mr chair and get
 
07:09:45.890 --> 07:09:45.900 align:start position:0%
it to us before we are expected to vote
 
07:09:48.410 --> 07:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
on on it
 
07:09:50.570 --> 07:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that they will get it to
 
07:09:54.110 --> 07:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
yes that's the intent is uh actually I
 
07:09:55.490 --> 07:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that they're actually
 
07:09:58.190 --> 07:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
looking for them to vote on it as much
 
07:10:00.708 --> 07:10:00.718 align:start position:0%
as they are to see whether or not they
 
07:10:03.770 --> 07:10:03.780 align:start position:0%
will in fact amend it
 
07:10:06.650 --> 07:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
in the Senate
 
07:10:12.830 --> 07:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:16.430 --> 07:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
I can make a motion to retain it
 
07:10:17.930 --> 07:10:17.940 align:start position:0%
I think we need a full committee before
 
07:10:19.250 --> 07:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
you proceed
 
07:10:22.070 --> 07:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that would be a good idea
 
07:10:22.080 --> 07:10:23.270 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that would be a good idea
um

07:10:23.270 --> 07:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:10:23.280 --> 07:10:24.708 align:start position:0%
um
I

07:10:24.708 --> 07:10:24.718 align:start position:0%
I
 
07:10:26.708 --> 07:10:26.718 align:start position:0%
I think when I look at the rest of the
 
07:10:29.750 --> 07:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
votes that we have
 
07:10:32.990 --> 07:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
and the indication where I think people
 
07:10:35.208 --> 07:10:35.218 align:start position:0%
will be on either side of it I think
 
07:10:36.530 --> 07:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
we're going to end up with a lot of 10
 
07:10:38.690 --> 07:10:38.700 align:start position:0%
10 votes and I just don't think that's
 
07:10:41.170 --> 07:10:41.180 align:start position:0%
in anybody's interest right now
 
07:10:45.890 --> 07:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
Sylvia yeah I'm I believe HP 360 is
 
07:10:48.288 --> 07:10:48.298 align:start position:0%
surprisingly easy have we not dealt with
 
07:10:49.548 --> 07:10:49.558 align:start position:0%
that yet
 
07:10:54.410 --> 07:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:07.788 --> 07:11:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:07.798 --> 07:11:10.150 align:start position:0%
 
oh

07:11:10.150 --> 07:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
oh
 
07:11:13.548 --> 07:11:13.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:17.208 --> 07:11:17.218 align:start position:0%
it I thought the issue with HB 360 was
 
07:11:20.150 --> 07:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
that uh Elliott Berry was gonna
 
07:11:25.430 --> 07:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
um provide the committee with um uh
 
07:11:28.670 --> 07:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
updated forms which I don't think we've
 
07:11:30.288 --> 07:11:30.298 align:start position:0%
received yet
 
07:11:35.330 --> 07:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:35.340 --> 07:11:36.468 align:start position:0%
 
yes

07:11:36.468 --> 07:11:36.478 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:11:41.930 --> 07:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
uh and I actually uh spoke with him and
 
07:11:45.468 --> 07:11:45.478 align:start position:0%
he resent it to me yesterday so
 
07:11:47.990 --> 07:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been drafted yet but he does
 
07:11:51.948 --> 07:11:51.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:54.708 --> 07:11:54.718 align:start position:0%
so we don't want to act on it now right
 
07:11:56.750 --> 07:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
I don't don't think so I wasn't planning
 
07:11:58.968 --> 07:11:58.978 align:start position:0%
on it
 
07:11:58.978 --> 07:12:04.430 align:start position:0%
on it
okay

07:12:04.430 --> 07:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:04.440 --> 07:12:06.770 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:12:06.770 --> 07:12:06.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:12:09.708 --> 07:12:09.718 align:start position:0%
I I guess I'll do what people want to do
 
07:12:11.570 --> 07:12:11.580 align:start position:0%
if you want to go forward and plow ahead
 
07:12:12.948 --> 07:12:12.958 align:start position:0%
with some of the other bills that are
 
07:12:16.670 --> 07:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
pending probably doesn't make sense
 
07:12:18.948 --> 07:12:18.958 align:start position:0%
I don't think it does right now I think
 
07:12:20.448 --> 07:12:20.458 align:start position:0%
we should wait and have our full
 
07:12:23.690 --> 07:12:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:26.390 --> 07:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
then we can have some definitive votes I
 
07:12:28.368 --> 07:12:28.378 align:start position:0%
you know just based upon
 
07:12:31.788 --> 07:12:31.798 align:start position:0%
uh the conversations that we've had and
 
07:12:33.708 --> 07:12:33.718 align:start position:0%
you and I have had representative Smith
 
07:12:35.990 --> 07:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
I I just think that we're gonna
 
07:12:38.810 --> 07:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
find ourselves divided on virtually all
 
07:12:41.110 --> 07:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
of the remaining bills
 
07:12:45.530 --> 07:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
well perhaps in the fullness of time
 
07:12:48.410 --> 07:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
um the scales will fall from some eyes
 
07:12:52.270 --> 07:12:52.280 align:start position:0%
and will agree on one side or the other
 
07:12:56.030 --> 07:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
I'm always optimistic yeah
 
07:12:59.030 --> 07:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so I didn't say whose eyes I just
 
07:13:05.170 --> 07:13:05.180 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:07.730 --> 07:13:07.740 align:start position:0%
the only thing that I request is that
 
07:13:09.230 --> 07:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
people do need to do those committee
 
07:13:11.510 --> 07:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
reports if you made the motion today the
 
07:13:14.208 --> 07:13:14.218 align:start position:0%
successful motion today uh with the
 
07:13:15.830 --> 07:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
exception of the retained bills I do
 
07:13:15.840 --> 07:13:16.730 align:start position:0%
exception of the retained bills I do
need

07:13:16.730 --> 07:13:16.740 align:start position:0%
need
 
07:13:21.770 --> 07:13:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:23.330 --> 07:13:23.340 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to have to haunt me
 
07:13:23.340 --> 07:13:24.230 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to have to haunt me
tomorrow

07:13:24.230 --> 07:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
07:13:24.240 --> 07:13:26.030 align:start position:0%

yeah
 
07:13:29.650 --> 07:13:29.660 align:start position:0%
and with that I guess I will
 
07:13:32.030 --> 07:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
close our unless there's other business
 
07:13:33.530 --> 07:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
people want to bring up yes
 
07:13:35.750 --> 07:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative De Lorenzo oh thank you
 
07:13:36.890 --> 07:13:36.900 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
07:13:38.990 --> 07:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
um would you believe that I made an
 
07:13:40.610 --> 07:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
error in voting I
 
07:13:44.750 --> 07:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
amendment to cacs six I intended to vote
 
07:13:49.190 --> 07:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:49.200 --> 07:13:51.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

07:13:51.590 --> 07:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:13:51.600 --> 07:13:52.430 align:start position:0%
okay
I

07:13:52.430 --> 07:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
I
 
07:13:55.128 --> 07:13:55.138 align:start position:0%
I if it hasn't left the committee yet I
 
07:13:55.138 --> 07:13:56.150 align:start position:0%
I if it hasn't left the committee yet I
think

07:13:56.150 --> 07:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
think
 
07:14:02.930 --> 07:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:05.510 --> 07:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
do you know what the updated vote is on
 
07:14:05.520 --> 07:14:06.410 align:start position:0%
do you know what the updated vote is on
that

07:14:06.410 --> 07:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:14:10.430 --> 07:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
um representative Smith the vote count
 
07:14:14.690 --> 07:14:14.700 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking now 17-4
 
07:14:14.700 --> 07:14:16.090 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking now 17-4
0

07:14:16.090 --> 07:14:16.100 align:start position:0%
0
 
07:14:20.690 --> 07:14:20.700 align:start position:0%
because Becky changed hers too
 
07:14:22.670 --> 07:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure I have it right
 
07:14:24.590 --> 07:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
for the final action report that I give
 
07:14:26.390 --> 07:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
to the committee assistant
 
07:14:28.690 --> 07:14:28.700 align:start position:0%
well but but they
 
07:14:33.410 --> 07:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
are you changing on the cacr or on the
 
07:14:37.430 --> 07:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
amendment to the cacr yeah
 
07:14:40.160 --> 07:14:40.170 align:start position:0%
on the amendment
 
07:14:40.170 --> 07:14:42.288 align:start position:0%
on the amendment
[Music]

07:14:42.288 --> 07:14:42.298 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
07:14:45.350 --> 07:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
I don't have I don't have the vote on
 
07:14:47.090 --> 07:14:47.100 align:start position:0%
the amendment I have the vote on the
 
07:14:52.310 --> 07:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:54.310 --> 07:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
12 yes
 
07:14:58.128 --> 07:14:58.138 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what I have too well to nine
 
07:15:01.190 --> 07:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
on the amendment and then
 
07:15:02.810 --> 07:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
um but that had
 
07:15:02.820 --> 07:15:06.708 align:start position:0%
um but that had
um

07:15:06.708 --> 07:15:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:11.810 --> 07:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
on that Becky was Voting yes and
 
07:15:15.048 --> 07:15:15.058 align:start position:0%
Charlotte was Voting yes
 
07:15:19.010 --> 07:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
so yeah 19-2 so did you want those to be
 
07:15:22.070 --> 07:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
changed or those stay the same
 
07:15:33.250 --> 07:15:33.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:36.170 --> 07:15:36.180 align:start position:0%
the bill was voted in expedient to
 
07:15:40.010 --> 07:15:40.020 align:start position:0%
legislate in any event right right
 
07:15:44.930 --> 07:15:44.940 align:start position:0%
could very well be moot but yes well I
 
07:15:48.590 --> 07:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
so so on the final bill itself
 
07:15:53.510 --> 07:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
was it 17-4 still or was it uh it was
 
07:15:57.048 --> 07:15:57.058 align:start position:0%
still 17 to 4.
 
07:16:00.230 --> 07:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislation right thank
 
07:16:00.240 --> 07:16:01.010 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislation right thank
you

07:16:01.010 --> 07:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:16:03.170 --> 07:16:03.180 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
07:16:03.180 --> 07:16:04.968 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
okay

07:16:04.968 --> 07:16:04.978 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:16:07.930 --> 07:16:07.940 align:start position:0%
any other business
 
07:16:10.730 --> 07:16:10.740 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I just asked if you and
 
07:16:12.468 --> 07:16:12.478 align:start position:0%
representative Smith would stay online
 
07:16:14.090 --> 07:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
for a few minutes with me after we get
 
07:16:14.100 --> 07:16:15.468 align:start position:0%
for a few minutes with me after we get
done

07:16:15.468 --> 07:16:15.478 align:start position:0%
done
 
07:16:18.310 --> 07:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
I would be glad to thank you
 
07:16:21.048 --> 07:16:21.058 align:start position:0%
and I'm assuming representative Smith
 
07:16:24.350 --> 07:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
would as well I would and I just I think
 
07:16:25.910 --> 07:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
probably representative McLean should
 
07:16:28.750 --> 07:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:31.128 --> 07:16:31.138 align:start position:0%
you should
 
07:16:33.350 --> 07:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
and I just want to thank everybody for
 
07:16:35.090 --> 07:16:35.100 align:start position:0%
putting up with what we've done today
 
07:16:37.968 --> 07:16:37.978 align:start position:0%
with the issues that we had
 
07:16:43.610 --> 07:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
I wish I feel badly that we had to face
 
07:16:46.250 --> 07:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
the challenges that we had to do today
 
07:16:49.610 --> 07:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
but it went very I mean I still think it
 
07:16:51.368 --> 07:16:51.378 align:start position:0%
works better
 
07:16:55.910 --> 07:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
this way with nobody in the State House
 
07:16:58.910 --> 07:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
um it the only problem today was Kurt
 
07:17:01.190 --> 07:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
and that had nothing to do with
 
07:17:02.990 --> 07:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
the state as it probably had to do with
 
07:17:05.690 --> 07:17:05.700 align:start position:0%
Comcast or somebody like that you had to
 
07:17:09.410 --> 07:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:12.770 --> 07:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
well it interestingly uh
 
07:17:16.128 --> 07:17:16.138 align:start position:0%
the the we had that terrible day where
 
07:17:18.110 --> 07:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
we had the the computer kept breaking
 
07:17:21.230 --> 07:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
down in room 206 208
 
07:17:24.948 --> 07:17:24.958 align:start position:0%
and then we came in for the next hearing
 
07:17:27.770 --> 07:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
date and we didn't have a problem and I
 
07:17:29.270 --> 07:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
talked to the tech people and they
 
07:17:30.830 --> 07:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
actually said that they changed the
 
07:17:34.368 --> 07:17:34.378 align:start position:0%
machine out from 206 to 08 and put it in
 
07:17:35.990 --> 07:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
enough another room and gave us the
 
07:17:37.250 --> 07:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
other machine
 
07:17:40.610 --> 07:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
and so our machine went better but but I
 
07:17:42.590 --> 07:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
understand representative hunt broke
 
07:17:46.548 --> 07:17:46.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:46.558 --> 07:17:48.048 align:start position:0%
 
this

07:17:48.048 --> 07:17:48.058 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:17:48.058 --> 07:17:49.448 align:start position:0%
this
anyway

07:17:49.448 --> 07:17:49.458 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
07:17:52.250 --> 07:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you all so very much I
 
07:17:55.430 --> 07:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
really appreciate it and thank you for
