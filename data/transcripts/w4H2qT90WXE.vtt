00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 align:start position:0%
I'm not mistaken we have a quorum now
 
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
so representative McGuire the floor is
 
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
yours all right thank you so I hope um
 
00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 align:start position:0%
everyone has in front of them an
 
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 align:start position:0%
amendment that at the top it's not this
 
00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 align:start position:0%
is not an official Amendment it says the
 
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
word unimproved at the top and it says
 
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
um zero six four seven h plus edits
 
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 align:start position:0%
right so remember when we came to the
 
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
public hearing we said we needed some
 
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
changes and I went to OLS and I said you
 
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 align:start position:0%
know here are the changes but what came
 
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 align:start position:0%
back wasn't particularly well written
 
00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh you know I think they're quite
 
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
stressed over there quite frankly you
 
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
know we gotta in my committee we have a
 
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
500 page uh House Bill too and and we've
 
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
never had one more than 250 pages right
 
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
so it's really crazy you know so
 
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.150 align:start position:0%
so it's really crazy you know so
um

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 align:start position:0%
so I think uh so rather than go back to
 
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
them for yet another thing in case you
 
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 align:start position:0%
know because you're probably gonna have
 
00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 align:start position:0%
changes also I just wrote in my own
 
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
changes and with with the help of my
 
00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors and and so that's what you
 
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
have in front of you so this is not in
 
00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
any way an official from OLS you know
 
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
piece of work this is something that we
 
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
took theirs and made changes okay all
 
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:26.690 align:start position:0%
took theirs and made changes okay all
right

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.070 align:start position:0%
right
so

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
um I I'll just go through it so nothing
 
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
from the public hearing has changed in
 
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 align:start position:0%
terms of the concept or the motivation
 
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
or the you know what we're trying to do
 
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
or anything like that it's just a matter
 
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
of trying to get that written correctly
 
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
on paper in a you know formal official
 
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
way right so
 
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:48.890 align:start position:0%
way right so
um

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 align:start position:0%
so I'll go through the bill uh briefly
 
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
and Tony will be here to give you more
 
00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 align:start position:0%
details if necessary so the first
 
00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 align:start position:0%
paragraph is uh this is the existing
 
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
paragraph in current law that defines
 
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 align:start position:0%
who who is in group one
 
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 align:start position:0%
so what's been removed from this
 
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
paragraph is state employees
 
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
right because because what the bill is
 
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
doing standard state employees not uh
 
00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
group twos and not teachers and so on
 
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
yes Peter
 
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 align:start position:0%
that was always there right but but I
 
00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 align:start position:0%
rewrote this paragraph a little bit to
 
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
make it clearer okay okay so
 
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
yes nothing right it's all about
 
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 align:start position:0%
trying to edit this so it says the right
 
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
stuff right so
 
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.409 align:start position:0%
stuff right so
yeah so

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
um so what we did was so this paragraph
 
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
if you look at the the bill or the
 
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
amendment I gave you last time used to
 
00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 align:start position:0%
also Define group three that's our new
 
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
group right in this paragraph but we
 
00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 align:start position:0%
decided that doesn't make sense this is
 
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 align:start position:0%
the paragraph that defines group one so
 
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
we'll Define group one and then later in
 
00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 align:start position:0%
the group three section we Define group
 
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
three over there right so anyways so
 
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
that's the main change yeah Dan sorry
 
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
one question real quick even
 
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
technically speaking old hires even if
 
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 align:start position:0%
this goes through would still be under
 
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
group one yes and I think I think that's
 
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
implied the way this is written but but
 
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 align:start position:0%
I think you should make that specific
 
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I think so I think you would you
 
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
know after permanent firemen you might
 
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.710 align:start position:0%
know after permanent firemen you might
say

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 align:start position:0%
um and uh state employees hired prior to
 
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
July 1st 2024 right so I do think that's
 
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 align:start position:0%
a change that ought to be in here okay
 
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
the second paragraph is the one that
 
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
makes you make sure that these people
 
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
the the group threes count in the
 
00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
calculation of the unfunded liability
 
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 align:start position:0%
and their employers pay the unfunded
 
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
liability payment so that's what the
 
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
second paragraph is
 
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
okay number two and then from number
 
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
three this is the plan right this is the
 
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
new group three stuff
 
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
um and there's some definitions
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
um again
 
00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.469 align:start position:0%
um again
um

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
what's the plan and so on so one thing
 
00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
we found out in the meantime that that
 
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
makes us clearer is that this is a
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
straightforward 401a plan okay so
 
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 align:start position:0%
there's no two plans or combination
 
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 align:start position:0%
plans or whatever this is a 401a that's
 
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
it and both the employer and the
 
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
employee contributions are required
 
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
right so the the employee is required to
 
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.220 align:start position:0%
put in his seven percent the employer is
 
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
required to put in whatever he's
 
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
whatever they're required to put in we
 
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
we wrote this such that it's the same as
 
00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
group one whatever the employer is
 
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
paying for group one that's what goes
 
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
into this okay so so the money part the
 
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340 align:start position:0%
money going into the plan the same as
 
00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 align:start position:0%
group one and so
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
um and so if you ever change what an
 
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
employer is doing with group one that
 
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
would automatically change you know the
 
00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:16.919 align:start position:0%
the way this is written just whatever it
 
00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:18.419 align:start position:0%
is in group one that's
 
00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
that's what it gets so
 
00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:21.469 align:start position:0%
that's what it gets so
um

00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
um but the plan itself is just one plan
 
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
it's a 401a both employer and employee
 
00:07:32.809 --> 00:07:32.819 align:start position:0%
contributions go in it it's managed
 
00:07:34.809 --> 00:07:34.819 align:start position:0%
according to the employee's preferences
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
that's it so that's the simplification
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
of of um
 
00:07:43.969 --> 00:07:43.979 align:start position:0%
100 a59 and then real quick um because I
 
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
haven't had a chance to look over this
 
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
uh vestings immediate
 
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
and it has immediate best okay so that
 
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
that money is immediately accessible to
 
00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:52.979 align:start position:0%
the employee
 
00:07:55.129 --> 00:07:55.139 align:start position:0%
oh well well within within the bounds of
 
00:07:58.189 --> 00:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
a 401a yes right because you know you
 
00:07:59.870 --> 00:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
can't take money there's a there's a
 
00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:01.919 align:start position:0%
later paragraph here which says um under
 
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
what circumstances can you receive money
 
00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:06.300 align:start position:0%
and it's not gonna be right yeah but
 
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
it's portable thank you it's portable
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
it's theirs right there's no vesting
 
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.589 align:start position:0%
it's theirs right there's no vesting
okay

00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
yeah determination you know it's it's
 
00:08:17.629 --> 00:08:17.639 align:start position:0%
things like death right termination
 
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:20.940 align:start position:0%
disability all those anyway okay uh the
 
00:08:22.909 --> 00:08:22.919 align:start position:0%
members so here's where we Define who's
 
00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
going in state employees beginning
 
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:30.780 align:start position:0%
service on or after July 1st 2024.
 
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
um and probably
 
00:08:37.389 --> 00:08:37.399 align:start position:0%
we should say other than
 
00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:41.339 align:start position:0%
teachers right so now I look at this
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
right other than teachers permanent
 
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
firemen and permanent policemen right
 
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.889 align:start position:0%
firemen and permanent policemen right
yeah

00:08:47.889 --> 00:08:47.899 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:08:47.899 --> 00:08:49.490 align:start position:0%
yeah
right

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.430 align:start position:0%
right
and

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
and maybe it should be permanent state
 
00:08:56.329 --> 00:08:56.339 align:start position:0%
employees I don't know because if
 
00:08:56.339 --> 00:08:57.350 align:start position:0%
employees I don't know because if
there's

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:08:59.329 --> 00:08:59.339 align:start position:0%
part-time state employees they don't
 
00:09:02.329 --> 00:09:02.339 align:start position:0%
count right so yeah so so this this
 
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:04.260 align:start position:0%
probably has to be fixed a little bit
 
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.150 align:start position:0%
probably has to be fixed a little bit
too

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:08.519 align:start position:0%
so here's the problem doing stuff
 
00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:10.220 align:start position:0%
five o'clock at night
 
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
okay so you see what I mean but anyways
 
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
this is the paragraph that defines who's
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
in this plane okay
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
um then we say who's in charge
 
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.230 align:start position:0%
um then we say who's in charge
and

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:21.949 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:21.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh so you'll have you'll have an
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
executive director so somebody will be
 
00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:27.779 align:start position:0%
hired to do this
 
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:31.260 align:start position:0%
um and they'll make rules that they need
 
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.190 align:start position:0%
um and
um

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:38.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
okay so so I think we need
 
00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:45.959 align:start position:0%
oh yeah we have it here yeah so
 
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
because this is so similar to our
 
00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
existing 457 plan I uh we decided to
 
00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
the the overall board that's sort of in
 
00:09:59.570 --> 00:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
charge we decided to make it the same as
 
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
the existing board who's in charge of
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
the 457 plan now that's something that's
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
a detail that you could decide maybe we
 
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
need a brand new board I don't know it's
 
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
just these are people that have been
 
00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
doing this for 35 years they have a lot
 
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:16.740 align:start position:0%
of experience it's a very similar plan
 
00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:18.899 align:start position:0%
they could put them out to bid at the
 
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
same time for for administration you
 
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
know that stuff like that so we just
 
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
just decided here we decided to make
 
00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:27.839 align:start position:0%
that board what we call the commission
 
00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
that's that board the one that already
 
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
is there I'd like to say that that board
 
00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.269 align:start position:0%
is there I'd like to say that that board
can

00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
board has the state treasurer the
 
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
commissioner of administrative services
 
00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.310 align:start position:0%
commissioner of administrative services
um

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:47.449 --> 00:10:47.459 align:start position:0%
and and a number of employee members
 
00:10:50.329 --> 00:10:50.339 align:start position:0%
it's a well-defined board that's that
 
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
looks like it's got all the important
 
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
people on it yeah and it and it seems to
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
be doing a good job Etc so yeah
 
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
um if I'm remembering correctly from the
 
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
Lost public hearing when I was in the
 
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
other room
 
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.310 align:start position:0%
other room
um

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
did he mention that we wouldn't
 
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:09.180 align:start position:0%
necessarily need 541 rule making if we
 
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
stuck with that no I I think you do
 
00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
because you know there's going to be
 
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:16.740 align:start position:0%
forms uh there's going to be details
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
about what does somebody do when they
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
want to you know say they're retiring
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
and and leaving and you know stuff like
 
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
there's always details right so yeah
 
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:29.449 align:start position:0%
there's always details right so yeah
um

00:11:29.449 --> 00:11:29.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:29.459 --> 00:11:31.670 align:start position:0%
um
okay

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
and and I assume go ahead so it's not
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
just details but rules are different
 
00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:40.140 align:start position:0%
than statutes they have the force and
 
00:11:42.829 --> 00:11:42.839 align:start position:0%
effective statutes but but the thing is
 
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
they're very detailed and how you do
 
00:11:47.569 --> 00:11:47.579 align:start position:0%
things statues in general doesn't do
 
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
that so they're going to be rules yeah
 
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
no I think I think what you were saying
 
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
is those rules might fall under
 
00:11:55.009 --> 00:11:55.019 align:start position:0%
rules that are already there if we
 
00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:56.700 align:start position:0%
synced them up but like I said I was
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
kind of over there so they should
 
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
probably be separate
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
separate sure
 
00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
yeah I bet if you looked up the rules
 
00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
that the 457 plan has they would you
 
00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
know be copied more or less but
 
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
obviously there can be special changes
 
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
right so sure okay
 
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.190 align:start position:0%
right so sure okay
um

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:18.660 align:start position:0%
so that's the administration uh the
 
00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
commission uh this is basically copied
 
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
from from the other plans so they can
 
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
pull the assets they can hire somebody
 
00:12:32.329 --> 00:12:32.339 align:start position:0%
to to administer the plan give give
 
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
choices to the employees and all that
 
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
sort of stuff okay now member
 
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
contributions this just says seven
 
00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:41.700 align:start position:0%
percent it's it's the same as in group
 
00:12:44.569 --> 00:12:44.579 align:start position:0%
one group one it just in in statute says
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
seven percent so we just copied that
 
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.350 align:start position:0%
seven percent so we just copied that
here

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.490 align:start position:0%
here
um

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
it seems simpler than referring to that
 
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
other section but anyway
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
um limitations this is kind of
 
00:12:59.569 --> 00:12:59.579 align:start position:0%
boilerplate stuff it says if federal law
 
00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
says you can't put in more than x then
 
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
you can't put in more than x right so
 
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
um contributions by the employer so
 
00:13:13.009 --> 00:13:13.019 align:start position:0%
notice we're referring to RSA 100a 16 2
 
00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
part C so this is
 
00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
um that's the group one calculation it's
 
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
called group one normal contribution
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
it's currently about two and a half
 
00:13:26.329 --> 00:13:26.339 align:start position:0%
percent but it's something that that the
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
retirement system calculates and so or
 
00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:33.180 align:start position:0%
so we I think it can change over time
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
and so that's why we made it you know
 
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
just whatever group one is doing that's
 
00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here
 
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:40.570 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here
okay

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:40.580 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:41.269 align:start position:0%
okay
[Music]

00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:41.810 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
individual Investments so we're just
 
00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
saying do it the same way that that the
 
00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:50.700 align:start position:0%
457 plan is
 
00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:51.470 align:start position:0%
457 plan is
um

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
and so in the sense that
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
they would contract with somebody they
 
00:13:59.449 --> 00:13:59.459 align:start position:0%
would have their own choices there'd be
 
00:14:02.449 --> 00:14:02.459 align:start position:0%
a limited list of of funds and so on
 
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
right the same way the other plan does
 
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
and um vesting
 
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:09.769 align:start position:0%
and um vesting
um

00:14:09.769 --> 00:14:09.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:12.829 --> 00:14:12.839 align:start position:0%
they're 100 vested so it just says that
 
00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
explicitly right there
 
00:14:17.329 --> 00:14:17.339 align:start position:0%
um and then withdraw so there's certain
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
conditions under which and I think these
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
come from federal rules generally
 
00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:24.180 align:start position:0%
speaking but it's um you can withdraw
 
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
when you when you terminate when you
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
retire when you're over 59 and a half
 
00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
and still employed
 
00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
um if you become disabled die
 
00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
um you have some kind of financial
 
00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:40.930 align:start position:0%
um you have some kind of financial
hardship

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:40.940 align:start position:0%
hardship
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
or there's required distributions so
 
00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
sometimes with a plan like this once you
 
00:14:49.129 --> 00:14:49.139 align:start position:0%
reach age 70 you're required to start
 
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
taking out like an IRA you know that
 
00:14:53.449 --> 00:14:53.459 align:start position:0%
kind of thing right so even if you might
 
00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:55.100 align:start position:0%
still be working
 
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
so if we ever had judges in this plan
 
00:14:59.210 --> 00:14:59.220 align:start position:0%
and we passed that Constitutional
 
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:01.620 align:start position:0%
Amendment and they're 74 years old or
 
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
something then there you go okay and
 
00:15:08.689 --> 00:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
then there's a specific reference to a
 
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
part of
 
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
401a9 this is probably you know kind of
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
Belton suspenders but it says will
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
comply with whatever required
 
00:15:20.689 --> 00:15:20.699 align:start position:0%
distributions the FED federal government
 
00:15:20.699 --> 00:15:22.550 align:start position:0%
distributions the FED federal government
has

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
um this health insurance paragraph
 
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
that's copied from group one it's a kind
 
00:15:29.689 --> 00:15:29.699 align:start position:0%
of a boilerplate thing it says employees
 
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
can can participate in health insurance
 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
the same way they would under group one
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
and then the last paragraph is about
 
00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:38.990 align:start position:0%
and then the last paragraph is about
um

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:41.329 --> 00:15:41.339 align:start position:0%
this plan will have some startup
 
00:15:44.449 --> 00:15:44.459 align:start position:0%
expenses right we'll have to hire an
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
administrator the equivalent of Craig
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
Downing uh to run this plan prior to the
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
fact prior to the date when anybody puts
 
00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
any money into it right so and and also
 
00:15:58.970 --> 00:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
it's going to have a relatively you know
 
00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:00.839 align:start position:0%
the first couple of years it won't have
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
that much money in it so what we have
 
00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
here is that the general fund will pay
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
for this administrator and pay for the
 
00:16:11.329 --> 00:16:11.339 align:start position:0%
first few years of startup expenses
 
00:16:14.449 --> 00:16:14.459 align:start position:0%
until such time as the fund itself is
 
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
big enough to pay its own expenses yes
 
00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:21.180 align:start position:0%
and where that front money be recouped
 
00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:26.420 align:start position:0%
by the state for funding it or it is a
 
00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
it's an expense yes
 
00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.590 align:start position:0%
it's an expense yes
yeah

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
um and just to give you a general
 
00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.329 align:start position:0%
um and just to give you a general
picture

00:16:35.329 --> 00:16:35.339 align:start position:0%
picture
 
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
um I was told that we hire roughly a
 
00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:40.740 align:start position:0%
thousand people a year okay we get a
 
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
thousand new hires a year under State
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
Employment so roughly let's suppose that
 
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
their average salary is about forty
 
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars so this is putting into
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
the plan roughly 10 percent of salary so
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
roughly four million dollars the first
 
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
year would be going into this plan and
 
00:17:06.409 --> 00:17:06.419 align:start position:0%
then the second year you would have a
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
new four million dollars from the new
 
00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:12.839 align:start position:0%
people plus you would have uh another 4
 
00:17:15.289 --> 00:17:15.299 align:start position:0%
million or whatever from the existing
 
00:17:17.929 --> 00:17:17.939 align:start position:0%
from the first year people right so the
 
00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
second year of the plan I would expect
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
roughly eight million dollars added so
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
now there'd be about 12 under management
 
00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
right and then the third year let's say
 
00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.750 align:start position:0%
right and then the third year let's say
another

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
10 or so 10 or 12 because some people
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
are going to be dropping out right some
 
00:17:36.529 --> 00:17:36.539 align:start position:0%
people quit in their first year or their
 
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
second year so you know after about
 
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
three years I'd expect there might be 20
 
00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
um you know and and increasing over time
 
00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.409 align:start position:0%
um you know and and increasing over time
so

00:17:48.409 --> 00:17:48.419 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:53.700 align:start position:0%
um by comparison the the 35 year old 457
 
00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
plan that has 500 million dollars right
 
00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
so it's much much bigger you know this
 
00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
will take time to build up and and our
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
retirement system I think they're at
 
00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
maybe 10 billion dollars or something
 
00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
like that so it'll take a while to to
 
00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
get to a stage where
 
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
um the plan can its own expenses it
 
00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
makes sense for the plan Zone expenses
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
to be paid for by the plan
 
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.590 align:start position:0%
to be paid for by the plan
okay

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
any immediate questions from the
 
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.310 align:start position:0%
any immediate questions from the
subcommittee

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
and then you
 
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:37.789 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:37.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:42.409 --> 00:18:42.419 align:start position:0%
I would submit that changing this plan
 
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
would have a chilling effect on new
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
hires what happens if the Thousand new
 
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
hires that you're looking at don't
 
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.789 align:start position:0%
hires that you're looking at don't
happen

00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:18:56.029 --> 00:18:56.039 align:start position:0%
okay so what what you're arguing do you
 
00:18:58.850 --> 00:18:58.860 align:start position:0%
mean changing you mean adopting the bill
 
00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
right you don't mean changing the way
 
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
this is written
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
saying changing the retirement
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
retirement I understand adding group
 
00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:08.940 align:start position:0%
three yeah yeah
 
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
so this is
 
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:14.630 align:start position:0%
so this is
um

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
so our argument during the public
 
00:19:21.529 --> 00:19:21.539 align:start position:0%
hearing is is that this is more
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
attractive to new employees rather than
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
less because
 
00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:30.200 align:start position:0%
in especially in this group of employees
 
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of turnover
 
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
people start their job and and after
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
only one year maybe I have some figures
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
I can get them to you but but the the
 
00:19:45.529 --> 00:19:45.539 align:start position:0%
retirement system their assumptions are
 
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:49.559 align:start position:0%
after one year 25 of these new hires
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
will decide I want some other job right
 
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
and then the next year another 10 or 15
 
00:19:58.370 --> 00:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
percent and then the next year you see
 
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
what I mean you know it shrinks down but
 
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
the point is a lot of these people don't
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
last to the 10-year vesting so this this
 
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
plan is a hundred percent vested when
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
they start so it's more attractive to
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
someone you know in general it's more
 
00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
attractive to someone who's not sure
 
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
what they're doing they're young people
 
00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:22.380 align:start position:0%
Etc right and people in general go to
 
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
lots of different jobs in their lifetime
 
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
so so I would argue that it's it's more
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
attractive rather than less yes
 
00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:31.380 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire yeah I'd like to
 
00:20:33.409 --> 00:20:33.419 align:start position:0%
also reply to that
 
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
that because of the immediate vesting
 
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
this means that the legislature Can't
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
Screw with their retirements plan it's
 
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
out of our control it's under their
 
00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
control and that's something that
 
00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
uh as we've noticed is of concern to a
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
lot of employees and then of course it's
 
00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
their money so that makes a big
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
difference to a fair number of people
 
00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:02.700 align:start position:0%
that it's it's their money it can't be
 
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
screwed with it can't be changed
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
it can't be taken away
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
so one one thought that I've been having
 
00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
on it that maybe you can
 
00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
kind of elaborate on
 
00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:15.470 align:start position:0%
kind of elaborate on
um

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
did we hear it all from the New
 
00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system on we have a
 
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
lot of turnover in this group and
 
00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:23.220 align:start position:0%
typically we're still contributing
 
00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
employee employee or right the employee
 
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
can take the money with them if they
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
leave but the employer money would stay
 
00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
in the fund and then would go towards
 
00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
the uaal because it would be absorbed so
 
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
if we go with this system how would that
 
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
affect the Actuarial rates
 
00:21:42.649 --> 00:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
do we have any idea of how much money
 
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
that's going to because now the employee
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
is getting all of it
 
00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:47.820 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a good question I haven't
 
00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
asked Mr Carlin that specifically but I
 
00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:55.860 align:start position:0%
think it's relatively small yeah good
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
and I have to go so I will turn it on
 
00:21:59.870 --> 00:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McGuire
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
call um at the uh the public hearing uh
 
00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
Marty did say that for this bill
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
um the effect would be minimal and he
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't concerned
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
um if at some point we were to switch
 
00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
all the state employees over to this
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
it would eventually have some issues you
 
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
know that issue and also
 
00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
you know towards the end as you're
 
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
winding down the current plan
 
00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to pay it that the
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
amount invested will shrink they're
 
00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
going to have to pay it out sooner
 
00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:37.799 align:start position:0%
they'll have to go with some more
 
00:22:39.169 --> 00:22:39.179 align:start position:0%
conservative Investments the return
 
00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:42.059 align:start position:0%
might be less so if it's some future
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
legislature decides to uh
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
to make this much larger it could be an
 
00:22:47.159 --> 00:22:47.990 align:start position:0%
to make this much larger it could be an
issue

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:50.940 align:start position:0%
but Marty said it wasn't a concern he
 
00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:52.980 align:start position:0%
was not taking a position on on this
 
00:22:57.049 --> 00:22:57.059 align:start position:0%
bill as I recall yeah and I I'd like to
 
00:22:59.690 --> 00:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
add that that's one of the reasons that
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
it's only state employees
 
00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:05.460 align:start position:0%
because if you decide to be a fireman or
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
a policeman
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
you're choosing to work for government
 
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:11.700 align:start position:0%
and it's for your career essentially
 
00:23:14.029 --> 00:23:14.039 align:start position:0%
you know some people may change their
 
00:23:14.039 --> 00:23:15.110 align:start position:0%
you know some people may change their
mind

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
mind
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
but in general you're saying you're
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
going if you're a policeman you're going
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
to work as a policeman for your entire
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
career if you're a state employee
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
you can get a job as a
 
00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
a truck driver an accountant a janitor
 
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
anywhere and they are much less they are
 
00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
not necessarily committing to a career
 
00:23:39.529 --> 00:23:39.539 align:start position:0%
in government employment and so they
 
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
want to be able to
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
and and that's what the statistics show
 
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:46.860 align:start position:0%
that they don't stick around long enough
 
00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:51.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
yeah representative thank you
 
00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
um with reference to representative
 
00:23:59.870 --> 00:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
lakis's Point
 
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
um I my one of my major concerns is the
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
retirees who are in the flan now and
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
what's going to support their retirement
 
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
going forward if there aren't new funds
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
going into
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
um go ahead no enough to move funds they
 
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
the employees are continuing to
 
00:24:22.909 --> 00:24:22.919 align:start position:0%
contribute toward their normal
 
00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:25.799 align:start position:0%
retirement as they have been and their
 
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:27.900 align:start position:0%
employer will continue to the normal
 
00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:29.029 align:start position:0%
employer will continue to the normal
cost

00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
and if any the only thing that might
 
00:24:35.149 --> 00:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
change by the
 
00:24:38.029 --> 00:24:38.039 align:start position:0%
why not having as many new members added
 
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
as before what might possibly be the
 
00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:43.740 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability but the contribution
 
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:47.820 align:start position:0%
to their to their personal retirement
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
is I mean this the employees are putting
 
00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
in a lot the employer is putting in
 
00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:55.380 align:start position:0%
enough to
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
cover that retirement it's only the the
 
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
history that's so big right they're
 
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:03.900 align:start position:0%
still forced in this to pay the 10.79 to
 
00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:07.380 align:start position:0%
the uaal so that portion of it is still
 
00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:08.820 align:start position:0%
being taken care of so it's still being
 
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
the old portion still being taken care
 
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
of the old debts being taken care of
 
00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
they still have to pay that portion of
 
00:25:15.649 --> 00:25:15.659 align:start position:0%
it but then they're funding their own
 
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
retirement moving forward they're not
 
00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
adding to the liability of the New
 
00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:21.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system and the
 
00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:24.260 align:start position:0%
the plan
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
is also
 
00:25:30.049 --> 00:25:30.059 align:start position:0%
supported by all the teachers which is
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
the biggest single group in the in the
 
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:33.900 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
all the police and fire who are still in
 
00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
the 100 a system so there is no way that
 
00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:43.860 align:start position:0%
this will cause the
 
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
retirement system to consider itself
 
00:25:48.649 --> 00:25:48.659 align:start position:0%
closed it's still open it's still
 
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
accepting new teachers new policemen it
 
00:25:54.049 --> 00:25:54.059 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to go into the death spiral
 
00:25:57.649 --> 00:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
of a closed plan and are you talking
 
00:25:59.630 --> 00:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
more from a cash flow perspective
 
00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
like well
 
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
money going in right now to pay right
 
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.630 align:start position:0%
money going in right now to pay right
now

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
the retirees are not putting into the
 
00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:09.740 align:start position:0%
system anymore if I can make a comment
 
00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:13.140 align:start position:0%
funding to support their retirement or
 
00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:16.380 align:start position:0%
add in fun item I will say one other
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
thing that occurred to me and we know
 
00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:22.220 align:start position:0%
from experience we've seen this before
 
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
when major changes happen to the
 
00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:28.860 align:start position:0%
retirement system there is an onslaught
 
00:26:33.049 --> 00:26:33.059 align:start position:0%
of current employees who retire so that
 
00:26:36.549 --> 00:26:36.559 align:start position:0%
they are grandfathered and with them
 
00:26:39.289 --> 00:26:39.299 align:start position:0%
goes literally hundreds of years of
 
00:26:42.529 --> 00:26:42.539 align:start position:0%
institutional memory out the doors
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
this doesn't affect any
 
00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
current employee
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
right if they are still in the 100-day
 
00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:52.340 align:start position:0%
retirement plan
 
00:26:57.289 --> 00:26:57.299 align:start position:0%
they are not required to put any more in
 
00:27:00.769 --> 00:27:00.779 align:start position:0%
they may choose to leave and go to this
 
00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:02.940 align:start position:0%
system but I could imagine that would
 
00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
only be appropriate for somebody who has
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
who is a short time I mean they're only
 
00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
a year or two into it if you ever got a
 
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
just on the funding thing
 
00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:23.810 align:start position:0%
just on the funding thing
um

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:23.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
so any if you're concerned about people
 
00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
that are currently retired um what
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
should have happened is that enough
 
00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
money was put in
 
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
to fully fund right now all the future
 
00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
expenses of their retirement that wasn't
 
00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
done and that's being fixed by uh the
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
mechanism for dealing with the unfunded
 
00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.669 align:start position:0%
mechanism for dealing with the unfunded
liability

00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
liability
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
so right now for the retired people the
 
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
money that comes in to help with their
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
retirement above and beyond what they
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
initially and their employer put in and
 
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
then the amount That Grew From
 
00:27:57.049 --> 00:27:57.059 align:start position:0%
investment are the uh the uaal payments
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
that all the employers are making
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
says that even if a new employee goes to
 
00:28:06.529 --> 00:28:06.539 align:start position:0%
group three or an existing employee
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
chooses to go to group three their
 
00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
employer is still on the hook for making
 
00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
exactly the same payments
 
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
to the Past debt to the uaal so that
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
money is still going to come in to help
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
fund the retirement of current retirees
 
00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
I think I think that if I'm
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
understanding correctly or maybe I'm
 
00:28:26.269 --> 00:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
just reading myself into this
 
00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:29.820 align:start position:0%
the concern would be how much money
 
00:28:33.409 --> 00:28:33.419 align:start position:0%
are the new hires typically putting in
 
00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:36.860 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis to help the cash flow
 
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
Marty had mentioned that 80 percent of
 
00:28:42.769 --> 00:28:42.779 align:start position:0%
what's getting paid out is what's
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
immediately getting put in so that we
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
can leave the rest of the money in
 
00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
Investments right we don't need to keep
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
them liquid all of the time is this
 
00:28:51.409 --> 00:28:51.419 align:start position:0%
going to hurt liquidity so that we have
 
00:28:54.289 --> 00:28:54.299 align:start position:0%
to pull more money out of Investments
 
00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
and drop drop the rate of return
 
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.610 align:start position:0%
and drop drop the rate of return
potentially

00:28:58.610 --> 00:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:01.980 align:start position:0%
I think in my understanding what he said
 
00:29:03.169 --> 00:29:03.179 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
um I mean people could contact him and
 
00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:08.220 align:start position:0%
have him email some information on this
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
um which I'd be glad to see is uh and I
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
don't want to put words in his mouth but
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
what I understood is that this is going
 
00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:16.860 align:start position:0%
to be a small enough effect that with
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
the uaal money still coming in it it's
 
00:29:22.669 --> 00:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
the the effect will be de minimis it
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
won't matter
 
00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
um I mean right now something close to
 
00:29:27.649 --> 00:29:27.659 align:start position:0%
80 percent
 
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
of what's being paid into the retirement
 
00:29:31.549 --> 00:29:31.559 align:start position:0%
system for current employees is the uaal
 
00:29:33.409 --> 00:29:33.419 align:start position:0%
and that's still going to go in
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:39.169 --> 00:29:39.179 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know if you'd have any
 
00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
idea on this Tony the other thing that I
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
was wondering
 
00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
does the definition of pension shift
 
00:29:48.289 --> 00:29:48.299 align:start position:0%
here as far as the windfall act would be
 
00:29:48.299 --> 00:29:50.149 align:start position:0%
here as far as the windfall act would be
concerned

00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
um so because they're still they're
 
00:29:54.649 --> 00:29:54.659 align:start position:0%
still paying into Social Security on top
 
00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
of what they're putting into the
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
retirement system right so they're not
 
00:29:58.970 --> 00:29:58.980 align:start position:0%
gonna they're not gonna lose Social
 
00:30:00.529 --> 00:30:00.539 align:start position:0%
Security benefits like they would under
 
00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:02.220 align:start position:0%
the regular pension well that's not
 
00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
necessarily true yeah it's so it happens
 
00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm in that situation
 
00:30:09.649 --> 00:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
um I get Social Security and I also am
 
00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:11.460 align:start position:0%
living partly on money I'm pulling out
 
00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:14.820 align:start position:0%
of a 401k and IRAs
 
00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
um you know when you do your taxes you
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
report that income that unless it's a
 
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
Roth where you've already paid taxes but
 
00:30:22.669 --> 00:30:22.679 align:start position:0%
I've got traditional
 
00:30:24.649 --> 00:30:24.659 align:start position:0%
you the you will have part of your
 
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
Social Security benefits tax just based
 
00:30:30.169 --> 00:30:30.179 align:start position:0%
on your total income
 
00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:32.220 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is that's the same
 
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
whether that income is being pulled out
 
00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:35.220 align:start position:0%
of an IRA or you're getting it from a
 
00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
pension so I don't think it's going to
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
make a difference and Carol correct me
 
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
you may yeah the windfall act applies
 
00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
specifically to people who have a
 
00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
pension earned while they were not
 
00:30:48.409 --> 00:30:48.419 align:start position:0%
paying into Social Security which in
 
00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
this case is group two okay so it never
 
00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:55.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:58.730 --> 00:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
IRS penalties for having earning too
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
much but there's nothing we can do about
 
00:31:03.649 --> 00:31:03.659 align:start position:0%
it sure yeah Peter
 
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
so uh this was alluded to just a moment
 
00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
ago but uh the tax return and tax filing
 
00:31:15.529 --> 00:31:15.539 align:start position:0%
aspect of it is something that we need
 
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
to think through because uh some people
 
00:31:21.289 --> 00:31:21.299 align:start position:0%
have a pretty simple estate or pretty uh
 
00:31:24.649 --> 00:31:24.659 align:start position:0%
simple Holdings uh and they may still be
 
00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:28.740 align:start position:0%
doing their own taxes okay but to what
 
00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
degree is this going to make uh tax
 
00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
filing a lot more complicated so people
 
00:31:36.409 --> 00:31:36.419 align:start position:0%
are going to go like uh I can't figure
 
00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:38.820 align:start position:0%
this out anymore now I'm going to have
 
00:31:40.669 --> 00:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
to pay an accountant I think I'm not
 
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
saying this is going to be different I
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
use an accountant because I got a kind
 
00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:47.940 align:start position:0%
of a complicated situation but what what
 
00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:50.220 align:start position:0%
are the answers here so the difference
 
00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:52.860 align:start position:0%
is that if you are receiving a
 
00:31:56.769 --> 00:31:56.779 align:start position:0%
traditional pension which I am you get a
 
00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
1099 P that says your pension was
 
00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
so much this year and so much of it is
 
00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:08.039 align:start position:0%
taxable if you get this will give you a
 
00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:10.140 align:start position:0%
statement from your retirement from the
 
00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:13.740 align:start position:0%
from the system saying you withdrew so
 
00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:14.570 align:start position:0%
from the system saying you withdrew so
much

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:32:16.669 --> 00:32:16.679 align:start position:0%
from the from the plan and it's all
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
taxable it's one line on the
 
00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:22.140 align:start position:0%
you'll still it should not be that much
 
00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
more difficult right I mean if you're
 
00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.710 align:start position:0%
more difficult right I mean if you're
using

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
using
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
um you could do it yourself you're going
 
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
to enter it on a different line or if
 
00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:29.940 align:start position:0%
you're using TurboTax or the H R Block
 
00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
app you know they ask the questions you
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
put it in it goes on a different line of
 
00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
form but it's the number just is a
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
different line and that's all the other
 
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:38.940 align:start position:0%
thing is um there's from a tax
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
standpoint there is actually another
 
00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.570 align:start position:0%
standpoint there is actually another
advantage

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
00:32:44.029 --> 00:32:44.039 align:start position:0%
to doing it this way and that is each
 
00:32:45.649 --> 00:32:45.659 align:start position:0%
year you have a choice as to how much
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
money you're going to withdraw as long
 
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
as it's at least the minimum required
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
distribution and what that means is
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
let's say
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
you know one year you have some other
 
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
income uh you know maybe from an
 
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
investment or maybe you worked part-time
 
00:33:01.789 --> 00:33:01.799 align:start position:0%
or whatever you can choose that year to
 
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:04.740 align:start position:0%
take less out of your your 401a or
 
00:33:06.289 --> 00:33:06.299 align:start position:0%
whatever this is
 
00:33:06.299 --> 00:33:06.830 align:start position:0%
whatever this is
um

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:08.700 align:start position:0%
but if a pension you're going to get the
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
same amount of money every year and that
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
means you know you may end up in a
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
higher tax bracket whereas with this you
 
00:33:16.669 --> 00:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
have a choice within you know with a
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
plur but you have a choice as to how
 
00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
much you take out you may be able to
 
00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
avoid paying additional taxes because
 
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:25.140 align:start position:0%
one year you had more income for some
 
00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:26.870 align:start position:0%
one year you had more income for some
reason

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.470 align:start position:0%
reason
foreign

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
I'm not objecting to it on that basis I
 
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
just think we need to think through it
 
00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:37.740 align:start position:0%
and make the argument so people know up
 
00:33:39.889 --> 00:33:39.899 align:start position:0%
front they want to be transparent right
 
00:33:42.649 --> 00:33:42.659 align:start position:0%
right uh so they know up front this is
 
00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to get this is going to
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
this these are additional complications
 
00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
if any and so forth so that we have
 
00:33:51.769 --> 00:33:51.779 align:start position:0%
addressed that so people are not going
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
well is there any water in the pool
 
00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:56.940 align:start position:0%
before I jump off this diving board I I
 
00:33:58.610 --> 00:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
do my own taxes
 
00:34:00.769 --> 00:34:00.779 align:start position:0%
um I actually use Turbo Tax but
 
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
with the statement from your the money
 
00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
you withdrawn from an IRA or 401K
 
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
it actually tells you you know
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
which things you need to enter and it
 
00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:15.419 align:start position:0%
gives you some idea of where
 
00:34:18.109 --> 00:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's no more complicated one
 
00:34:24.109 --> 00:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:25.740 align:start position:0%
sure Diane one more
 
00:34:28.129 --> 00:34:28.139 align:start position:0%
I apologize for being late I couldn't
 
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
get the ice off my windshield I came in
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
as the
 
00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
presenter the prime sponsor was talking
 
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
about the health care costs under this
 
00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:41.530 align:start position:0%
about the health care costs under this
plan

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:41.540 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
and that was a concern of mine also that
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
the original bill and the Amendments
 
00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:51.419 align:start position:0%
that were presented originally say that
 
00:34:55.129 --> 00:34:55.139 align:start position:0%
the health care costs would be paid by
 
00:34:58.490 --> 00:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
these new employees at their own expense
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
which is exactly what happens with
 
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
current employees at from group one who
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
state employees who are retired they
 
00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
have to deal with the there's a subsidy
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
but they have to contribute to
 
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:14.940 align:start position:0%
contribute to it and
 
00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
um it the wording in the amendment was
 
00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:20.820 align:start position:0%
taken exactly from the
 
00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:24.599 align:start position:0%
um group one yeah we included to hear
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
because if we if we didn't
 
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:28.740 align:start position:0%
um then the group three people wouldn't
 
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
be able to do it but we're letting them
 
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
continue exactly the same thing they
 
00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
have now so it still has a subsidy
 
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
with the depends on what the legislature
 
00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:40.980 align:start position:0%
feels like doing but but it refers if
 
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
you look at it this is uh on the last
 
00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
page 1871
 
00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
it um it refers back to two sections you
 
00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:54.200 align:start position:0%
know or a number of sections in RSA 21 I
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
which defines the plan they have now so
 
00:35:58.849 --> 00:35:58.859 align:start position:0%
it just says they're eligible for the
 
00:36:02.569 --> 00:36:02.579 align:start position:0%
same plan under the same terms as uh you
 
00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:15.180 align:start position:0%
that's what it says unless otherwise
 
00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
provided but it would be dependent on
 
00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
what I believe it's the finance fiscal
 
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:24.599 align:start position:0%
committee that vaccines as our current
 
00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:28.140 align:start position:0%
retirees okay and
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
is there a way that we can tell whether
 
00:36:36.109 --> 00:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
that subsidy would still be viable with
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
this new plan
 
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't make any difference
 
00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
because my mind my understanding and
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
Marty's actually testified this and I
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
think on another bill
 
00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
um the retirement nhrs has nothing to do
 
00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
with that whole health insurance group
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
thing so it can't have any impact on it
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
I realize that it's all determined by
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee but it's dependent
 
00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:02.940 align:start position:0%
on the amount of money that's available
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
but it's not available in the retirement
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
system it's I assume no it's all set by
 
00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.550 align:start position:0%
system it's I assume no it's all set by
by

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
the legislature and the budget by Das
 
00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:16.380 align:start position:0%
and fiscal to finalize it but it's it
 
00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
shouldn't make any difference what group
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
they're in
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
right we just want to make sure they
 
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
won't fund it
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
we just wanted to make sure it was
 
00:37:26.089 --> 00:37:26.099 align:start position:0%
available to the people that were put
 
00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
into group three as well so they weren't
 
00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:30.300 align:start position:0%
losing it under the same precarious
 
00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
condition group one yeah yeah you'd have
 
00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:34.310 align:start position:0%
condition group one yeah yeah you'd have
to

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:36.180 align:start position:0%
come to the conclusion that some reason
 
00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
fiscal would continue to allow group one
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
to do it but would exclude group three
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not even sure they could do that
 
00:37:43.849 --> 00:37:43.859 align:start position:0%
although they can I'm just saying what
 
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
the rationale would be you know that's
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
what we'd have to wrap our mind around
 
00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
why would they do that right and more
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
likely would be an abort across the
 
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
board cut yeah I would assume so
 
00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:53.700 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:37:57.050 --> 00:37:57.060 align:start position:0%
um I don't think I've got any questions
 
00:37:59.089 --> 00:37:59.099 align:start position:0%
on the pensions at all but there might
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
be a few people and I like to ask
 
00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:03.780 align:start position:0%
questions to clear up for them poor
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
people thank you so much representative
 
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
um the commission the commission uh
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh we'll we'll run the pension plan
 
00:38:17.329 --> 00:38:17.339 align:start position:0%
it's not a pension plan
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
but it's a uh it's a defined
 
00:38:22.609 --> 00:38:22.619 align:start position:0%
contribution plan right so you don't get
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
a pension so right so is there a cost
 
00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
for the commission
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
I mean there will be some costs not only
 
00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.770 align:start position:0%
I mean there will be some costs not only
for

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
whatever employees are in the commission
 
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
I mean one thing is we're the board
 
00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
we're using the existing ones we're not
 
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
standing up another whole board and the
 
00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
cost for that but the costs and there
 
00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
will be a cause for the commission
 
00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
um I assume there's going to be some
 
00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
employee portal so there'd be some cost
 
00:38:50.329 --> 00:38:50.339 align:start position:0%
you know I.T cost to getting that set up
 
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing the way this I
 
00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:54.900 align:start position:0%
think the existing plan works the 101b
 
00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:55.790 align:start position:0%
think the existing plan works the 101b
plan

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:38:59.569 --> 00:38:59.579 align:start position:0%
is the plan in RSA 101b is uh they
 
00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
generally will contract out with some
 
00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:03.300 align:start position:0%
outfit to actually handle the management
 
00:39:05.089 --> 00:39:05.099 align:start position:0%
of the funds and the investment all that
 
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
I mean like when I was working for a
 
00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:09.900 align:start position:0%
private company I had a 401k and the
 
00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:11.640 align:start position:0%
company contracted with Fidelity to
 
00:39:13.069 --> 00:39:13.079 align:start position:0%
handle the whole thing and there's other
 
00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
vendors will do that so there will be
 
00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:16.609 align:start position:0%
vendors will do that so there will be
costs

00:39:16.609 --> 00:39:16.619 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
when they contract that out to to pay
 
00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.050 align:start position:0%
when they contract that out to to pay
for

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:21.060 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
that management of the Investments okay
 
00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:26.820 align:start position:0%
and the way this is written is that
 
00:39:30.109 --> 00:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
after the first three years the cost of
 
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
that will be paid for by the fund the
 
00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
problem is two problems one is until
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
there's a reasonable amount of money in
 
00:39:40.849 --> 00:39:40.859 align:start position:0%
it the percentage of what's in the fund
 
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
that it would take to administer it
 
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
would be high enough that the returns
 
00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
would be very poor and second of all we
 
00:39:50.569 --> 00:39:50.579 align:start position:0%
heard testimony from I think that the
 
00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:53.540 align:start position:0%
I'm the fellow runs the uh the current
 
00:39:56.569 --> 00:39:56.579 align:start position:0%
uh to find yeah
 
00:39:58.490 --> 00:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
um he said that
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
if there isn't a guarantee for payment
 
00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:04.740 align:start position:0%
for the management on the startup end
 
00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
until there's money in there that
 
00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
nobody's going to bid on it
 
00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
and so that is the reason for
 
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
um you know paying the administrative
 
00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:20.460 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead how about you got 27. only
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
27 yeah
 
00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
we may have to we have to cut a few of
 
00:40:25.849 --> 00:40:25.859 align:start position:0%
them short I thought the first the first
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
Speaker said that um they would have to
 
00:40:30.109 --> 00:40:30.119 align:start position:0%
hire somebody
 
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
right but that would be there would be
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
hiring Fidelity well no it could be
 
00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
it'll be both I mean you're going to
 
00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:38.700 align:start position:0%
have some employees working for the
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
state to oversee it
 
00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:42.180 align:start position:0%
I mean if you're gonna if you're gonna
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
contract something somebody's got to
 
00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
write the RFP and somebody's got to
 
00:40:47.569 --> 00:40:47.579 align:start position:0%
oversee the contract and then there will
 
00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:51.540 align:start position:0%
be some work in the state because the
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
um there'll be at least some employee
 
00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
portal probably the state will have
 
00:40:56.569 --> 00:40:56.579 align:start position:0%
maybe they'll all be contracted out I
 
00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
don't know but there will be some work
 
00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
that the state will do
 
00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
um and maybe most of it will be done by
 
00:41:04.849 --> 00:41:04.859 align:start position:0%
the contractor but where that split is
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
up to
 
00:41:08.089 --> 00:41:08.099 align:start position:0%
you know how they write the contract yes
 
00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
and also you'll you'll have somebody who
 
00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
needs to write the rules and answer
 
00:41:12.359 --> 00:41:13.609 align:start position:0%
needs to write the rules and answer
questions

00:41:13.609 --> 00:41:13.619 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
so that's something that you would
 
00:41:18.349 --> 00:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
probably want to have an employee
 
00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
available to do that it might be that we
 
00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
the administrator of the 457 plan gets
 
00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
an assistant or a rule writer or
 
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
something like that to start up but
 
00:41:31.849 --> 00:41:31.859 align:start position:0%
there will be some overhead in the in
 
00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:33.900 align:start position:0%
the in the we're not expecting that to
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
be large and it's like you know again I
 
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:38.940 align:start position:0%
work for a company and uh the HR
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
department that benefits people
 
00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:42.470 align:start position:0%
department that benefits people
um

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
handled some stuff around the 401K plan
 
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
I mean they they did training you know
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
provided training materials the
 
00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.569 align:start position:0%
provided training materials the
employees

00:41:50.569 --> 00:41:50.579 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
um there were people who could ask if
 
00:41:54.829 --> 00:41:54.839 align:start position:0%
you had problems somebody to contact but
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
the bulk of what we did
 
00:41:58.609 --> 00:41:58.619 align:start position:0%
you know like setting how we wanted to
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
Investments and all that I mean actually
 
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
went we could go to a company portal but
 
00:42:05.089 --> 00:42:05.099 align:start position:0%
all that did was send us off to Fidelity
 
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
so there was a small part that's in was
 
00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
in the company but most of it was
 
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
Fidelity I expect similar situation here
 
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
and you are you are tying that to the
 
00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:17.420 align:start position:0%
457 correct that's what Dan said yeah
 
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
it's all the same program
 
00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.730 align:start position:0%
it's all the same program
um

00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:24.829 --> 00:42:24.839 align:start position:0%
uh just for clarification so the money
 
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
that we're putting in initially which he
 
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
said could be over the next few years
 
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
upwards of 20 million or so no no no
 
00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
what he was saying there was that oh
 
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
just that it would that within a few
 
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
years he expected the fun contributions
 
00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
the fund would be about around 20
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
minutes okay gotcha and and the idea is
 
00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:45.300 align:start position:0%
in that amount of time
 
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
um you know the fund will have enough
 
00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:49.619 align:start position:0%
money that it can pay the expenses and
 
00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
still have the employees get a
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable return on their investment
 
00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
and as it grows presumably the
 
00:42:58.910 --> 00:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
um you know the percentage of the
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
administrative costs
 
00:43:02.809 --> 00:43:02.819 align:start position:0%
as a percentage of the whole fund as the
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
yeah Chris
 
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
00:43:14.329 --> 00:43:14.339 align:start position:0%
so as long as a new employee
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
is under the 401 whatever plan
 
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
the the employee deployer and the
 
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
employer the state will be paying into
 
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:25.140 align:start position:0%
the ual
 
00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:26.569 align:start position:0%
the ual
correct

00:43:26.569 --> 00:43:26.579 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
but if that person leaves
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
they're not paying for that ghost person
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's true today if you have somebody
 
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
who's in the pension system and they
 
00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
leave I mean the ual is paid on as I
 
00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:41.220 align:start position:0%
understand it a percentage of gross
 
00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:42.170 align:start position:0%
understand it a percentage of gross
payroll

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:42.180 align:start position:0%
payroll
 
00:43:44.569 --> 00:43:44.579 align:start position:0%
and if that goes down because an
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
employee is not getting paid because
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
they love then the obligation towards El
 
00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:51.140 align:start position:0%
will go down
 
00:43:57.250 --> 00:43:57.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
so the the employee is paying seven
 
00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
percent in does the employer pay in yeah
 
00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:08.460 align:start position:0%
2.48 yeah 2.48 right
 
00:44:12.589 --> 00:44:12.599 align:start position:0%
plus the plus the uh plus the 10.79 the
 
00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
uaal goes to goes into the
 
00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire retirement system and it's
 
00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:20.940 align:start position:0%
managed along with the rest of the
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
payments for the retirees and the people
 
00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:25.980 align:start position:0%
who are in the existing plans
 
00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
the the two and a half percent goes into
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
the into this plan to be and men's
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
managed by by the employee it is vested
 
00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:38.819 align:start position:0%
immediately right and we left it we put
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
in that that's the minimum so that
 
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
people could negotiate
 
00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
could negotiate for a higher match or
 
00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:49.250 align:start position:0%
could negotiate for a higher match or
whatever

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
we think that the current amount is
 
00:44:57.170 --> 00:44:57.180 align:start position:0%
barely adequate and so we would like we
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
would want to have people either well we
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
would like to have people save on their
 
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
own on the Deferred Compensation Plan
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
and we'd like to encourage the employer
 
00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:10.380 align:start position:0%
to contribute more but
 
00:45:13.309 --> 00:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
and as a start we're putting in the same
 
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
yeah we changed actually in this most
 
00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:20.700 align:start position:0%
recent draft that they have to
 
00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:22.430 align:start position:0%
recent draft that they have to
contribute

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
contribute
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
equal to or greater than the amount
 
00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:28.380 align:start position:0%
they're currently contributing to the uh
 
00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:30.300 align:start position:0%
um that they do for any group on
 
00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:31.609 align:start position:0%
um that they do for any group on
employee

00:45:31.609 --> 00:45:31.619 align:start position:0%
employee
 
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
the normal cost right
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you representative
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
Lucas I think um just due to time and
 
00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
how it's going I would like to give a
 
00:45:40.609 --> 00:45:40.619 align:start position:0%
little bit of time just to hear from the
 
00:45:43.609 --> 00:45:43.619 align:start position:0%
state employees Association
 
00:45:44.809 --> 00:45:44.819 align:start position:0%
um and their take on this all right
 
00:45:47.089 --> 00:45:47.099 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
probably not a ton of time but a little
 
00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
bit of time while he's setting up who's
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
going to write who's going to take care
 
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
of the Amendments it's going to be
 
00:45:56.089 --> 00:45:56.099 align:start position:0%
needed to clean up some of the things
 
00:45:58.730 --> 00:45:58.740 align:start position:0%
that Dan talked about I'm assuming Tony
 
00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:13.980 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you very much
 
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
um with your permission Mr chairman I
 
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
believe I have some
 
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
um I was only anticipating five I see
 
00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:22.740 align:start position:0%
six not everybody's on the subcommittee
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
I I can certainly uh provide more
 
00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
um so for the record uh Bob Blasdell
 
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
representing the state employees
 
00:46:31.069 --> 00:46:31.079 align:start position:0%
Association good morning
 
00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:33.660 align:start position:0%
um first I'd like to start off with um
 
00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:36.900 align:start position:0%
with an apology uh when this bill was
 
00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:39.900 align:start position:0%
initially heard uh public hearing I had
 
00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
a family emergency and was not able to
 
00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
attend so I apologize uh for that but I
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
certainly very much appreciate the
 
00:46:49.849 --> 00:46:49.859 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh this morning
 
00:46:49.859 --> 00:46:50.390 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh this morning
um

00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
I guess first and foremost uh you know
 
00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
this is in in your packet you're going
 
00:46:58.370 --> 00:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
to see a letter from the state employees
 
00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
um president uh Mr Rich gulla outlining
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh many of the concerns we have with
 
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation
 
00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
um so far I believe this we've seen the
 
00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
as introduced version we've seen the
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
amendment presented at the public
 
00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
hearing we've seen another amendment
 
00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
this morning and on the Fly this morning
 
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
we're seeing additional edits so we're
 
00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
essentially on to like the fourth
 
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
version of of this which should
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh bring you to a pause
 
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
um this is a very serious matter you're
 
00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:33.900 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:36.180 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
Financial futures of thousands of
 
00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
individuals who work very very hard for
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
the state our state
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
um so I guess first question would be
 
00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:49.380 align:start position:0%
out of the box is who's asking for this
 
00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:51.660 align:start position:0%
I can tell you as representing the state
 
00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:54.300 align:start position:0%
employees Association we certainly are
 
00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:56.450 align:start position:0%
employees Association we certainly are
not

00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:56.460 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:57.050 align:start position:0%
not
um

00:47:57.050 --> 00:47:57.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
you'll see in your packet this this blue
 
00:48:02.329 --> 00:48:02.339 align:start position:0%
one of these blue again I apologize um
 
00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
somebody put a trick on me this morning
 
00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
put blue paper into the printer
 
00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:08.460 align:start position:0%
um I apologize for the obnoxious color
 
00:48:10.849 --> 00:48:10.859 align:start position:0%
but you'll see here
 
00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
um with Florida and North Dakota South
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
Dakota South Carolina excuse me in
 
00:48:18.589 --> 00:48:18.599 align:start position:0%
Colorado when employees are given a a
 
00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:20.460 align:start position:0%
choice of the matter but between a
 
00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
defined benefit and a defined
 
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:25.079 align:start position:0%
contribution plan it's overwhelming 76
 
00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
percent in Florida chose defined benefit
 
00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
North Dakota and 98 South Carolina 82
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
percent Colorado 88 percent
 
00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:37.380 align:start position:0%
um we just don't necessarily see where
 
00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
this is coming from when you look at the
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
legislative history which is also
 
00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
stapled to president gullah's testimony
 
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
or letter you'll see the legislative
 
00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:49.140 align:start position:0%
history going all the way back to the
 
00:48:50.809 --> 00:48:50.819 align:start position:0%
year 2000.
 
00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
with I've been I've included all of the
 
00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:54.730 align:start position:0%
with I've been I've included all of the
blurbs

00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:54.740 align:start position:0%
blurbs
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
from all of those inexpedient to
 
00:49:00.349 --> 00:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
legislate motions that were adopted by
 
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
both Republican and Democrat
 
00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:05.150 align:start position:0%
both Republican and Democrat
legislatures

00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
legislatures
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:09.180 align:start position:0%
certainly been the course of this
 
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
legislature over the years to to review
 
00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
everything to see if there's something
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
that we can do better
 
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
again I hope we can all pause here
 
00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:18.290 align:start position:0%
again I hope we can all pause here
because

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:19.130 align:start position:0%
because
um

00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:19.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
everywhere we go in this legislature and
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
these Halls this legislative session all
 
00:49:25.609 --> 00:49:25.619 align:start position:0%
we hear is recruitment retention
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
recruitment retention that's where we're
 
00:49:27.599 --> 00:49:28.990 align:start position:0%
recruitment retention that's where we're
at

00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:33.420 align:start position:0%
this is not a bill that emphasizes
 
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
retention in fact I've heard many people
 
00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:39.180 align:start position:0%
say this is portable this is portable
 
00:49:42.109 --> 00:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
um encouraging the portability of this
 
00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
but I do want to make one
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
um clear note here it's been suggested
 
00:49:49.490 --> 00:49:49.500 align:start position:0%
that the current plan that we have is
 
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
not portable
 
00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
I would suggest to you this morning that
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
it is portable it's portable within the
 
00:49:57.770 --> 00:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
first 10 years
 
00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:00.839 align:start position:0%
in legislatures in the past very wisely
 
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
set up this system to protect the
 
00:50:05.569 --> 00:50:05.579 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
what does that mean
 
00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
that means that taxpayer dollars are
 
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
going in for the first 10 years along
 
00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
with the employee contributions and if
 
00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:15.900 align:start position:0%
that employee so chooses to leave before
 
00:50:18.589 --> 00:50:18.599 align:start position:0%
they're vested that employee is portable
 
00:50:21.890 --> 00:50:21.900 align:start position:0%
they can leave with their money but not
 
00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers money
 
00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
okay when they invest in this state
 
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
they're rewarded by by working hard for
 
00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:32.220 align:start position:0%
the state and they become vested now the
 
00:50:34.609 --> 00:50:34.619 align:start position:0%
monster events did now the taxpayers say
 
00:50:37.609 --> 00:50:37.619 align:start position:0%
thank you here's your pension
 
00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:40.500 align:start position:0%
so right now the system we have protects
 
00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer money
 
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
right and it is portable but that
 
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
employee just takes their their their
 
00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
chunk of the money that they invested
 
00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:51.300 align:start position:0%
over the nine and a half years
 
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to make sure that was that
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
was clear
 
00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:55.430 align:start position:0%
was clear
um

00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:58.490 --> 00:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
you've got a lot of material there
 
00:50:59.930 --> 00:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
um in your in your you've got the week
 
00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:01.740 align:start position:0%
off next week some of you
 
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
um hopefully you'll be able to have a
 
00:51:05.809 --> 00:51:05.819 align:start position:0%
chance to to review it
 
00:51:05.819 --> 00:51:07.370 align:start position:0%
chance to to review it
um

00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:07.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure that
 
00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
the guesswork potentially by these
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
potential group three employees about
 
00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
having to make the right choices for
 
00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:24.180 align:start position:0%
their financial future
 
00:51:26.329 --> 00:51:26.339 align:start position:0%
um I consider myself halfway educated
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
fairly intelligent
 
00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:30.180 align:start position:0%
um I know I get my my informational
 
00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:32.099 align:start position:0%
packets from Merrill Lynch
 
00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:34.380 align:start position:0%
um every now and again and I can't make
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
heads or tails of it
 
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
um I don't consider myself to be in a
 
00:51:42.109 --> 00:51:42.119 align:start position:0%
position to be making decisions
 
00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
um to to make I that's what I asked the
 
00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
experts for right I ask for those people
 
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
to to guide me through that
 
00:51:53.809 --> 00:51:53.819 align:start position:0%
the issue with the defined contribution
 
00:51:56.089 --> 00:51:56.099 align:start position:0%
plan is
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
there there's no guarantee right
 
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
when you look at the stock market which
 
00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:05.220 align:start position:0%
is all this is based on right
 
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
the four Worst Years
 
00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:10.740 align:start position:0%
in the stock market's history
 
00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:13.380 align:start position:0%
okay four I'm shooting out of the ten
 
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
worst years excuse me out of the 10
 
00:52:17.089 --> 00:52:17.099 align:start position:0%
worst years ever in the history of the
 
00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
stock market four of them happened in
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
this century
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
four of them in the last 22 years
 
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
so if you happen to be one of those
 
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunate individuals to to have to
 
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
sometimes have to retire or choose to
 
00:52:32.329 --> 00:52:32.339 align:start position:0%
retire in those down years when your
 
00:52:35.329 --> 00:52:35.339 align:start position:0%
investment just plummets okay and you
 
00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
have a 401k
 
00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:40.020 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee that you're going
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
to be able to to have access to the to
 
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
those funds in its completion for the
 
00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:46.260 align:start position:0%
rest of your life you may cannibalize
 
00:52:47.809 --> 00:52:47.819 align:start position:0%
that in the first eight years of your
 
00:52:50.809 --> 00:52:50.819 align:start position:0%
retirement and then what
 
00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:53.460 align:start position:0%
cost shifting is a very real issue which
 
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:55.980 align:start position:0%
I have not heard yet debated
 
00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
okay in the future let's say push this
 
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:01.740 align:start position:0%
out 30 40 years we have a group three
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
and these people retire
 
00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:06.599 align:start position:0%
and they outlive the Investments of
 
00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
their defined contribution
 
00:53:11.569 --> 00:53:11.579 align:start position:0%
where do they go
 
00:53:14.089 --> 00:53:14.099 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you where they go they go back
 
00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:16.020 align:start position:0%
onto the roles of the state
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
because that's what happens
 
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
that's what happens so the cost shifting
 
00:53:22.609 --> 00:53:22.619 align:start position:0%
right there I hope everybody again
 
00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:25.020 align:start position:0%
please pause and think about that about
 
00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:27.180 align:start position:0%
what that does to not only the
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
individual putting them in that
 
00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
situation but also the taxpayers of the
 
00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:32.329 align:start position:0%
situation but also the taxpayers of the
state

00:53:32.329 --> 00:53:32.339 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:53:32.339 --> 00:53:33.890 align:start position:0%
state
it's

00:53:33.890 --> 00:53:33.900 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
it's concerning
 
00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
um whereas obviously a defined benefit
 
00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
you have that for the rest of your life
 
00:53:43.549 --> 00:53:43.559 align:start position:0%
until the day you die and you can count
 
00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
you know I I you know I wasn't able to
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
attend the hearing but I was able to
 
00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
listen to it online
 
00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
and good friend of my good friend the
 
00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:01.140 align:start position:0%
most of ours here is just really quickly
 
00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
maybe like three more minutes or so oh
 
00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
three minutes okay three three five tops
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm on the clock yeah I'm just
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
watching the clock a little bit all
 
00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:08.270 align:start position:0%
watching the clock a little bit all
right

00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:09.049 align:start position:0%
right
um

00:54:09.049 --> 00:54:09.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
okay there was a there was a comment
 
00:54:14.329 --> 00:54:14.339 align:start position:0%
um made by representative McGuire
 
00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
earlier this morning
 
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
um about
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
should we should this legislature decide
 
00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
to move forward
 
00:54:24.829 --> 00:54:24.839 align:start position:0%
um with the the group three that
 
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
um there's there's nothing I believe um
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
said Madam chair mentioned um that their
 
00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
retirement can't be screwed with
 
00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:34.490 align:start position:0%
retirement can't be screwed with
um

00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:36.170 --> 00:54:36.180 align:start position:0%
I would take
 
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
um issue with that comment only because
 
00:54:41.809 --> 00:54:41.819 align:start position:0%
I know that this state is the only state
 
00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
in the country
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
I believe I stand corrected but I
 
00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
believe it's the only state in the
 
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
country that actually put forward
 
00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:53.220 align:start position:0%
retroactive changes to the New Hampshire
 
00:54:55.010 --> 00:54:55.020 align:start position:0%
Retirement System
 
00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
so I would suggest to you that yeah
 
00:54:59.690 --> 00:54:59.700 align:start position:0%
although they they will have their money
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
like 100 invested right away however
 
00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:06.180 align:start position:0%
that's not to say that 10 15 years from
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
now we're sitting at this very table and
 
00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:10.740 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a hybrid
 
00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:13.020 align:start position:0%
maybe a hybrid but have to find benefit
 
00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:16.980 align:start position:0%
half half contribution plan so there are
 
00:55:19.069 --> 00:55:19.079 align:start position:0%
what we've witness is that we know that
 
00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:22.740 align:start position:0%
the legislature can make changes
 
00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:24.900 align:start position:0%
um so nothing's nothing certainly set in
 
00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:26.089 align:start position:0%
um so nothing's nothing certainly set in
stone

00:55:26.089 --> 00:55:26.099 align:start position:0%
stone
 
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
just for clarification on that point if
 
00:55:30.770 --> 00:55:30.780 align:start position:0%
those members had been vested that they
 
00:55:32.569 --> 00:55:32.579 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have been able to have been
 
00:55:34.849 --> 00:55:34.859 align:start position:0%
retroactively affected so the vestment
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
was the point of contention in the
 
00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:38.220 align:start position:0%
courts just for clarification on that
 
00:55:40.849 --> 00:55:40.859 align:start position:0%
correct but what we witnessed was that
 
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
there can be changes made absolutely
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
um so I know I'm on the clock here I'll
 
00:55:50.089 --> 00:55:50.099 align:start position:0%
I'll keep that ask questions as well
 
00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
just as far as the overall testimony
 
00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
yeah so I would just ask to
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
um please obviously you're going to do
 
00:55:59.870 --> 00:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
your due diligence and and be very
 
00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
thoughtful about this
 
00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:03.710 align:start position:0%
thoughtful about this
um

00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:06.910 align:start position:0%
um
foreign

00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
it up to any questions now and I
 
00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:11.700 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time this morning yeah
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative Schmidt
 
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
Bob thank you very much for being here
 
00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
today because we certainly want to hear
 
00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:23.460 align:start position:0%
from all sides
 
00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
all rational sides anyway
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
um so uh the the legislative history
 
00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
that is appended to the letter from Mr
 
00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
Gullah uh I was one of the people who
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
got the letter so I I did see some of
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
that uh and was able to kind of think
 
00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:43.500 align:start position:0%
through it and look through it uh but is
 
00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
it not the case that this proposed plan
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
is quite different from uh the previous
 
00:56:52.130 --> 00:56:52.140 align:start position:0%
plans as I understand it anyway in that
 
00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:55.140 align:start position:0%
the many of the previous ideas or
 
00:56:59.030 --> 00:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
concepts that were it out all of them uh
 
00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
were a some form of here's what you got
 
00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
now we're going to switch switch that to
 
00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:06.900 align:start position:0%
something completely well not completely
 
00:57:08.329 --> 00:57:08.339 align:start position:0%
different but fundamentally different
 
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
from you know one was defined benefit
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
when it was going to go to Define
 
00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
contribution whereas this is I
 
00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:17.940 align:start position:0%
understand it and please tell me if I've
 
00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
got it wrong or if you see it
 
00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:23.460 align:start position:0%
differently that the uh we are in this
 
00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
planner the sponsors that we we haven't
 
00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
done it yet
 
00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:28.549 align:start position:0%
done it yet
um

00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
are saying here's your current plan
 
00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:33.900 align:start position:0%
that's going to stay
 
00:57:35.930 --> 00:57:35.940 align:start position:0%
and all the commitments have been made
 
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
so the uaal is still going to be
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
continued to be funded by the employers
 
00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
um and uh the people are still going to
 
00:57:48.049 --> 00:57:48.059 align:start position:0%
have their defined benefit and so forth
 
00:57:50.329 --> 00:57:50.339 align:start position:0%
and this and group three is going to be
 
00:57:50.339 --> 00:57:51.410 align:start position:0%
and this and group three is going to be
something

00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
added on is that not the case or is that
 
00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
is that your understanding
 
00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
the earlier plans that were all i t out
 
00:58:04.010 --> 00:58:04.020 align:start position:0%
if I understand your your question
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative is is you know basically
 
00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:07.740 align:start position:0%
what's what's the difference from the
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
past into what we have in front of us
 
00:58:09.359 --> 00:58:11.089 align:start position:0%
past into what we have in front of us
today

00:58:11.089 --> 00:58:11.099 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
um the difference is being I know in the
 
00:58:13.079 --> 00:58:14.089 align:start position:0%
um the difference is being I know in the
past

00:58:14.089 --> 00:58:14.099 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
um they were very very good fiscal notes
 
00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
associated with with the bills in the
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
past I do see an FN associated with this
 
00:58:25.549 --> 00:58:25.559 align:start position:0%
bill number however I've never I haven't
 
00:58:27.410 --> 00:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
I've seen corrected I haven't seen what
 
00:58:29.329 --> 00:58:29.339 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost the state
 
00:58:31.549 --> 00:58:31.559 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh the first couple of years
 
00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
of implementing this plan I I haven't
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
seen the additional cost of the of the
 
00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:39.540 align:start position:0%
ual by picking up the cost of the group
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
three people so that's that's a
 
00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
difference I guess in a question of not
 
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
knowing what the finances are and I
 
00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
understand this isn't going to finance
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
so again I create hopefully some great
 
00:58:50.690 --> 00:58:50.700 align:start position:0%
pause there
 
00:58:52.609 --> 00:58:52.619 align:start position:0%
um as far as the group three if I
 
00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
understand your question please tell me
 
00:58:55.370 --> 00:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
if I'm going down the wrong Rabbit Hole
 
00:58:57.049 --> 00:58:57.059 align:start position:0%
here representative but
 
00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:00.180 align:start position:0%
um the difference being this time around
 
00:59:02.809 --> 00:59:02.819 align:start position:0%
um it does not include firefighters
 
00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
police teachers as all the versions in
 
00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
the past have
 
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
um that's that's my understanding and
 
00:59:11.329 --> 00:59:11.339 align:start position:0%
again stand corrected but the
 
00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
legislative history that I'm aware of
 
00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
this is the first time this is just
 
00:59:19.549 --> 00:59:19.559 align:start position:0%
targeted towards state employees
 
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:22.140 align:start position:0%
I as far as I remember that is correct
 
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:24.829 align:start position:0%
it is
um

00:59:24.829 --> 00:59:24.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's definitely the first time that it
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
is limited to State Employees group one
 
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.730 align:start position:0%
is limited to State Employees group one
because

00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:31.740 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:59:34.609 --> 00:59:34.619 align:start position:0%
the characteristics of group one and
 
00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:37.140 align:start position:0%
group two are significantly different
 
00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:41.700 align:start position:0%
so this says you know a defined benefit
 
00:59:44.089 --> 00:59:44.099 align:start position:0%
pension makes a lot more sense for group
 
00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:46.980 align:start position:0%
two who are
 
00:59:49.069 --> 00:59:49.079 align:start position:0%
essentially committing to Public Service
 
00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:52.740 align:start position:0%
their entire careers then to the state
 
00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
employees who are not necessarily so
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
I would um
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
with all due respect Madam chair there
 
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
are many members thousands of members
 
01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:05.220 align:start position:0%
that view the state of New Hampshire
 
01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:06.780 align:start position:0%
working for them in group one state
 
01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
employees as their career and they're
 
01:00:10.849 --> 01:00:10.859 align:start position:0%
very proud of it wasn't saying that that
 
01:00:13.789 --> 01:00:13.799 align:start position:0%
there were not career employees I'm
 
01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:16.380 align:start position:0%
saying that not all group one are career
 
01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:18.470 align:start position:0%
saying that not all group one are career
employees

01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
even if you have a career say as a civil
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
engineer you might work for the state
 
01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:26.099 align:start position:0%
and then go work for oddly or whatever
 
01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
sure I also understand
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
um I I know
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
um several people who are former
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
teachers former firefighters former
 
01:00:35.809 --> 01:00:35.819 align:start position:0%
police officers that after a couple of
 
01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
First Years on the job they decide you
 
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
know what I'm going to be a real estate
 
01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:41.700 align:start position:0%
agent I'm going to go sell insurance
 
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
um so uh to to try and say that all
 
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
group two employees or teachers that's
 
01:00:48.829 --> 01:00:48.839 align:start position:0%
their career and that's their sentence
 
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
no I would I would say no that's not the
 
01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:53.950 align:start position:0%
no I would I would say no that's not the
case

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
teachers less so but that's that
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
teachers are in a different situation
 
01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
and that there are so many
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
many employers compared to the state
 
01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
thank you for joining us I really
 
01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:12.780 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time yeah thank you
 
01:01:13.849 --> 01:01:13.859 align:start position:0%
enjoy your break
 
01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
uh representative leak is just really
 
01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:17.150 align:start position:0%
uh representative leak is just really
quickly

01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:25.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:25.859 --> 01:01:29.470 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh so in the creation of this
 
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
um it's mandatory for all future members
 
01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:37.740 align:start position:0%
to be part of the defined contribution
 
01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:39.109 align:start position:0%
to be part of the defined contribution
plan

01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
um was the concern over the
 
01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:45.299 align:start position:0%
uh pool of money uh being large enough
 
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
and therefore needing all of those
 
01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
employees or is there a reason why we
 
01:01:50.569 --> 01:01:50.579 align:start position:0%
didn't offer the option to stay in the
 
01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
Divine benefit as opposed to you know
 
01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
just the biggest reason
 
01:01:56.030 --> 01:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
um the problem is
 
01:01:59.329 --> 01:01:59.339 align:start position:0%
it you know if something is optional I
 
01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:01.140 align:start position:0%
mean even if people in general like it
 
01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:03.660 align:start position:0%
it may take time for people to decide
 
01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
this is something they want news to get
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
out whatever and the problem is if that
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
fund grows too slowly
 
01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:10.910 align:start position:0%
fund grows too slowly
then

01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:02:13.549 --> 01:02:13.559 align:start position:0%
um you know either the state would have
 
01:02:15.289 --> 01:02:15.299 align:start position:0%
to pay for administration at least part
 
01:02:16.849 --> 01:02:16.859 align:start position:0%
of it longer
 
01:02:16.859 --> 01:02:18.349 align:start position:0%
of it longer
or

01:02:18.349 --> 01:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:02:18.359 --> 01:02:19.010 align:start position:0%
or
um

01:02:19.010 --> 01:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
the administrative costs would consume
 
01:02:23.569 --> 01:02:23.579 align:start position:0%
too high a percentage of the employees
 
01:02:25.609 --> 01:02:25.619 align:start position:0%
contributions with them resulting in
 
01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:27.020 align:start position:0%
them having a
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh very poor return or Worse yeah that
 
01:02:31.789 --> 01:02:31.799 align:start position:0%
makes sense I just wanted a
 
01:02:31.799 --> 01:02:33.410 align:start position:0%
makes sense I just wanted a
clarification

01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:36.660 align:start position:0%
um any other questions guys for Tony
 
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative appreciate it
 
01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
yeah and when I see that information I
 
01:02:42.349 --> 01:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
think I am the prime sponsor may get
 
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
together and yeah come up with a
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
obviously we're not scoring the circle
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
today so yeah
 
01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:50.220 align:start position:0%
um we need the finalized Amendment
 
01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
version from you anyway so we'll be
 
01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
meeting again on this one for sure thank
 
01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:55.309 align:start position:0%
meeting again on this one for sure thank
you

01:02:55.309 --> 01:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
as it turns out an extra copy of the
 
01:02:59.210 --> 01:02:59.220 align:start position:0%
letter from
 
01:03:12.589 --> 01:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:14.460 align:start position:0%
anybody on the committee opposed to us
 
01:03:16.849 --> 01:03:16.859 align:start position:0%
moving off of 559 for now we'll have to
 
01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:18.839 align:start position:0%
come back to it
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
I would just like to make one comment
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
addressing something that was stated at
 
01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:27.079 align:start position:0%
the hearing uh it was foot forward that
 
01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
uh there were the individual had doubts
 
01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:34.380 align:start position:0%
about the constitutionality of the
 
01:03:38.809 --> 01:03:38.819 align:start position:0%
current pension program based on section
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
36 which was instituted in 1784 I would
 
01:03:48.049 --> 01:03:48.059 align:start position:0%
say that folks back then really did not
 
01:03:50.569 --> 01:03:50.579 align:start position:0%
understand pension programs and it was
 
01:03:53.089 --> 01:03:53.099 align:start position:0%
certainly a different animal than what
 
01:03:55.549 --> 01:03:55.559 align:start position:0%
we see today and I would point out
 
01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
further that
 
01:04:01.089 --> 01:04:01.099 align:start position:0%
the state Constitutional Convention
 
01:04:05.230 --> 01:04:05.240 align:start position:0%
which was comprised of 400 members in
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
1984 200 years later chose to amend that
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
section with 36a to protect the Pension
 
01:04:16.490 --> 01:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
funds so I think if they had doubts
 
01:04:19.490 --> 01:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
about the constitutionality of the plan
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
at that time that answers the quest
 
01:04:23.770 --> 01:04:23.780 align:start position:0%
question that it is in fact
 
01:04:26.569 --> 01:04:26.579 align:start position:0%
constitutional thank you
 
01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure we were planning on
 
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
ripping the whole thing out by the roots
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
anyway but
 
01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
um all right um I would like to move on
 
01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:35.690 align:start position:0%
um all right um I would like to move on
to

01:04:35.690 --> 01:04:35.700 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:37.309 align:start position:0%
to
um 461.

01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
um 461.
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
uh representative Pearson if you would
 
01:05:00.410 --> 01:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
this uh this being a work session we
 
01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
needed to um
 
01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:10.569 align:start position:0%
needed to um
discuss

01:05:10.569 --> 01:05:10.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
modifications there was some suggestions
 
01:05:13.319 --> 01:05:14.990 align:start position:0%
modifications there was some suggestions
made

01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.609 align:start position:0%
made
um

01:05:16.609 --> 01:05:16.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing
 
01:05:22.609 --> 01:05:22.619 align:start position:0%
and uh I did oh for the record
 
01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
representative C Pierce in Rockingham
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
the original thought process that with
 
01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
of this really surrounded group two and
 
01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:34.140 align:start position:0%
and as discussions were had during the
 
01:05:36.049 --> 01:05:36.059 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
um about group one's inclusion in this
 
01:05:41.690 --> 01:05:41.700 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
and then there was substantial
 
01:05:44.829 --> 01:05:44.839 align:start position:0%
discussion about
 
01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:48.260 align:start position:0%
handcuffing the downsizing of
 
01:05:50.809 --> 01:05:50.819 align:start position:0%
specifically school districts and their
 
01:05:54.370 --> 01:05:54.380 align:start position:0%
employees and how this may potentially
 
01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:00.829 --> 01:06:00.839 align:start position:0%
so between the public hearing and some
 
01:06:02.809 --> 01:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
hallway discussions in reference to
 
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
really where the abuses are versus it
 
01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
not being a global problem within those
 
01:06:11.030 --> 01:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
systems it's generally just based on
 
01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion is as to
 
01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
modifying this
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
in order to just
 
01:06:27.410 --> 01:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
cover those type positions yeah I my
 
01:06:29.930 --> 01:06:29.940 align:start position:0%
concern initially with it was that it's
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps to different issues
 
01:06:35.930 --> 01:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
um and would you consider
 
01:06:38.990 --> 01:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
focusing primarily on the downshifting
 
01:06:40.609 --> 01:06:40.619 align:start position:0%
from a full-time position to a part-time
 
01:06:43.309 --> 01:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
position for now one of the one of the
 
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
concerns I have is that there's a pretty
 
01:06:47.089 --> 01:06:47.099 align:start position:0%
easy work around for reducing the number
 
01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
of employees especially in
 
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
the situation we find ourselves in right
 
01:06:54.109 --> 01:06:54.119 align:start position:0%
now which is that a municipality could
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
just leave that position on the books
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
and not fill it and say well we still
 
01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
have it but it's not filled and to me
 
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
that would seem like it would be a
 
01:07:03.170 --> 01:07:03.180 align:start position:0%
pretty easy work around to
 
01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
reduce you know if you reduce the number
 
01:07:06.829 --> 01:07:06.839 align:start position:0%
of employees now they're on the hook for
 
01:07:08.690 --> 01:07:08.700 align:start position:0%
the liability well only if they get rid
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
of the position but what if they don't
 
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
fill the position keep it on the books
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:20.270 align:start position:0%
 
gotcha

01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
so I suppose that would be a similar
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
well I guess it wouldn't no not in that
 
01:07:31.309 --> 01:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
case so so this is you're looking what
 
01:07:32.329 --> 01:07:32.339 align:start position:0%
you're what I'm getting at from your
 
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
representative Simon is more along the
 
01:07:37.069 --> 01:07:37.079 align:start position:0%
lines of a reclassification
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
from Full to part rather than
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
elimination yeah so I got you there okay
 
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
I mean I think I think I just think it's
 
01:07:45.230 --> 01:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
more workable sure and that's really
 
01:07:46.849 --> 01:07:46.859 align:start position:0%
what's that's really the what's going on
 
01:07:48.650 --> 01:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
anyway so
 
01:07:51.349 --> 01:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
so with that being said we did discuss
 
01:07:53.809 --> 01:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
that this would be or there was
 
01:07:56.089 --> 01:07:56.099 align:start position:0%
discussions in reference to
 
01:07:58.910 --> 01:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
top tier positions versus
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
all positions
 
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
if in and I think that in this
 
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
particular case it would be prudent
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps to address the areas we know
 
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
where there's a problem and if we have a
 
01:08:12.349 --> 01:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
more Global problem later we could
 
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
certainly come back and make
 
01:08:17.150 --> 01:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
modifications but
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
um hang on one second there Steve any
 
01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
any comments from the committee yeah
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
I was in on the hallway discussions and
 
01:08:28.849 --> 01:08:28.859 align:start position:0%
I agree that the abuses that this bill
 
01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
is intended to address are the top tier
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
positions there's not a problem if
 
01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
Epsom decides it doesn't need a
 
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
full-time emergency coordinator
 
01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
I mean we're still going to have as many
 
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
police or fires as before we're just
 
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
not going to have that position be full
 
01:08:48.769 --> 01:08:48.779 align:start position:0%
time the trouble is with the police
 
01:08:51.289 --> 01:08:51.299 align:start position:0%
Chiefs the administrators
 
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
School administrators
 
01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.430 align:start position:0%
School administrators
uh

01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:58.370 --> 01:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
possibly fire captains although that I
 
01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
haven't heard of any cases no it's
 
01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:02.630 align:start position:0%
haven't heard of any cases no it's
um

01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:03.890 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:03.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
and in those cases the abuse is that
 
01:09:11.209 --> 01:09:11.219 align:start position:0%
they take an existing full-time position
 
01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
and declare
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
declare it to be part-time and hire a
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
retiree to fill it
 
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
so that the the employer doesn't have to
 
01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
pay the into the retirement system at
 
01:09:27.410 --> 01:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
all if they're hiring a part-time person
 
01:09:30.289 --> 01:09:30.299 align:start position:0%
and they can offer a somewhat lower
 
01:09:33.229 --> 01:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
salary because it's part-time and the
 
01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
person is already collecting their
 
01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:36.229 align:start position:0%
person is already collecting their
pension

01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
pension
 
01:09:38.689 --> 01:09:38.699 align:start position:0%
is that the problem you're seeking to
 
01:09:40.669 --> 01:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean that that in the fact that
 
01:09:43.249 --> 01:09:43.259 align:start position:0%
the municipality then whether would
 
01:09:44.809 --> 01:09:44.819 align:start position:0%
there be no contribution to the
 
01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
retirement system they get out of not
 
01:09:48.530 --> 01:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
only the payment the normal portion of
 
01:09:52.249 --> 01:09:52.259 align:start position:0%
that but also the uaal portion so
 
01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
if we're looking at that those types of
 
01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
positions we're talking superintendents
 
01:09:58.729 --> 01:09:58.739 align:start position:0%
principles administrators Fire Chiefs
 
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
police Chiefs I did write down the word
 
01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:02.450 align:start position:0%
police Chiefs I did write down the word
director

01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
director
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that how that title fits
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
into something but I and then
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
sub variations of that as as in
 
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
assistance and deputies with the
 
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
exception of law enforcement because the
 
01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
sheriff's department calls their Rank
 
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
and file deputies and that's again we're
 
01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
not looking at Rank and file here so
 
01:10:21.709 --> 01:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to get from the
 
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
committee here is is exactly how the
 
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
framework how how to frame this
 
01:10:29.330 --> 01:10:29.340 align:start position:0%
amendment and that's that's really the
 
01:10:31.490 --> 01:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
the discussion that we need to have here
 
01:10:33.770 --> 01:10:33.780 align:start position:0%
as far as as far as
 
01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
the the titles of folks that would be
 
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
included in this top tier type
 
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
look you could also put a salary limit
 
01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
you know the top 10 percent of salaries
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:50.330 --> 01:10:50.340 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
that may become problematic in the sense
 
01:10:55.729 --> 01:10:55.739 align:start position:0%
that there are police departments where
 
01:10:58.130 --> 01:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
the top 10 percent of salaries will not
 
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
include their police chief
 
01:11:02.209 --> 01:11:02.219 align:start position:0%
really for the salary they don't have
 
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
any overtime uh well I meant salary not
 
01:11:10.189 --> 01:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:12.669 --> 01:11:12.679 align:start position:0%
Maybe baseball
 
01:11:15.290 --> 01:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
we had a situation in Dover where there
 
01:11:17.330 --> 01:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
was one police officer who was working
 
01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
every detail he could get because he had
 
01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
a bunch of kids so he was working
 
01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
everything so he had a very high net pay
 
01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
uh but a gross pay I guess uh but it was
 
01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
not salary or base pay so that that
 
01:11:34.130 --> 01:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
difference has to be spelled out yeah I
 
01:11:37.390 --> 01:11:37.400 align:start position:0%
mean that happens everywhere sure sure
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
so okay so then you know I'm just trying
 
01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
to I have to think of this I have to
 
01:11:45.050 --> 01:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
think of Fitzwilliam versus Manchester
 
01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:46.310 align:start position:0%
think of Fitzwilliam versus Manchester
and

01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
something with the word notch in it in
 
01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:51.900 align:start position:0%
it versus Nashua right because this has
 
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
to this is a global this is a global law
 
01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
so it's got a tiny little town versus
 
01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
our larger communities and and how does
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
this work
 
01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
um if I can just get a sense from the
 
01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
committee though if we are just going to
 
01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
keep this to
 
01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
um top-tier employees and we're really
 
01:12:09.709 --> 01:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
just trying to deal with the issue of
 
01:12:11.689 --> 01:12:11.699 align:start position:0%
them moving from full-time to part-time
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
in order to circumvent the New Hampshire
 
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
retirement system is that something for
 
01:12:17.930 --> 01:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
the most part the committee would be
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
interested in hearing back on
 
01:12:22.370 --> 01:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
is that is that better than the original
 
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
it's a real problem and and it's an
 
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
abuse of the system and I think if we
 
01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
can figure out a way to get at it yeah
 
01:12:31.850 --> 01:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
we ought to do it so
 
01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
um yeah so I mean I don't Carol go ahead
 
01:12:41.630 --> 01:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:45.900 align:start position:0%
the people that hear about it and it's
 
01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
an incentive for other towns to do the
 
01:12:50.930 --> 01:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
same thing absolutely uh I I have on a
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
totally separate issue the
 
01:12:57.530 --> 01:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
the penalty you have here is in
 
01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:58.669 align:start position:0%
the penalty you have here is in
perpetuity

01:12:58.669 --> 01:12:58.679 align:start position:0%
perpetuity
 
01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
and I think that's I think that's well
 
01:13:02.990 --> 01:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
the retirement system assumed it was so
 
01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
uh well we need to be explicit I would
 
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
suggest something like for 10 years or
 
01:13:11.689 --> 01:13:11.699 align:start position:0%
until the full-time position is restored
 
01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
it says at line seven
 
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
if the position is restored or group two
 
01:13:17.450 --> 01:13:17.460 align:start position:0%
contributing position the penalty shall
 
01:13:19.010 --> 01:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
be terminated in the normal calculations
 
01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
for retirement system contributions will
 
01:13:22.729 --> 01:13:22.739 align:start position:0%
be restored
 
01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
we want to incentivize them thank you
 
01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:27.179 align:start position:0%
very much I miss that to do it to to do
 
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
things right so we certainly don't want
 
01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
to lock them into a problem so unless
 
01:13:32.689 --> 01:13:32.699 align:start position:0%
there's unless there's anything else
 
01:13:34.490 --> 01:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
from the committee on this and it's fine
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
that there is
 
01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:39.780 align:start position:0%
um yes I know we did talk about the uh
 
01:13:42.189 --> 01:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
look back
 
01:13:45.530 --> 01:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
retroactive if you will I assume that
 
01:13:48.050 --> 01:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
yeah line 10 can go away that can be
 
01:13:51.410 --> 01:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:53.209 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:13:53.209 --> 01:13:53.219 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:55.490 --> 01:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
just trying to clear up the fog that's
 
01:13:57.709 --> 01:13:57.719 align:start position:0%
always surrounded me that's right
 
01:13:57.719 --> 01:13:58.669 align:start position:0%
always surrounded me that's right
um

01:13:58.669 --> 01:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:01.130 --> 01:14:01.140 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about people
 
01:14:02.689 --> 01:14:02.699 align:start position:0%
a few people
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
yes just a few people you always say a
 
01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
fog but you're always right on the stick
 
01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:09.830 align:start position:0%
fog but you're always right on the stick
representative

01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:11.330 align:start position:0%
 
who

01:14:11.330 --> 01:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
were eligible to retire yes did so
 
01:14:18.649 --> 01:14:18.659 align:start position:0%
nothing illegal there correct
 
01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
and because they retire they're not
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
paying into the retirement system
 
01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:25.370 align:start position:0%
paying into the retirement system
anymore

01:14:25.370 --> 01:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
and if the town wants to hire them back
 
01:14:32.570 --> 01:14:32.580 align:start position:0%
as part-time but pay them the same kind
 
01:14:35.450 --> 01:14:35.460 align:start position:0%
of seller of salary potentially
 
01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
but just call it part-time work so they
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:49.850 --> 01:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
dissipating employer which is everybody
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
and every government unit in the state
 
01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
you your pension is suspended and you
 
01:14:58.729 --> 01:14:58.739 align:start position:0%
make further contributions in the
 
01:15:01.729 --> 01:15:01.739 align:start position:0%
retirement system if you're lucky
 
01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
you might get a raise and your pension
 
01:15:05.570 --> 01:15:05.580 align:start position:0%
are more years of service and your
 
01:15:09.410 --> 01:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:12.530 --> 01:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
if you decide to retire and collect your
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
pension you can work part-time
 
01:15:19.130 --> 01:15:19.140 align:start position:0%
but only for a limited number of hours
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
um actually incredibly generous but we
 
01:15:26.450 --> 01:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
won't go into that that's a different
 
01:15:28.850 --> 01:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
bill so it's a different issue but but
 
01:15:32.090 --> 01:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
if you are working part-time neither you
 
01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:33.780 align:start position:0%
nor your employer pays into the
 
01:15:35.570 --> 01:15:35.580 align:start position:0%
retirement system for you for that
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
position so you're double dipping you're
 
01:15:39.169 --> 01:15:39.179 align:start position:0%
keeping your job and you're collecting
 
01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
your pension at the same time and the
 
01:15:43.370 --> 01:15:43.380 align:start position:0%
issue is that the
 
01:15:46.010 --> 01:15:46.020 align:start position:0%
if you're unscrupulous
 
01:15:48.890 --> 01:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
you declare yourself working part-time
 
01:15:51.890 --> 01:15:51.900 align:start position:0%
and with your employer's consent and
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
they'll pay you some amount part-time
 
01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
and you'll still collect your pension
 
01:15:59.390 --> 01:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
and I realized double tipping is is a
 
01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
nasty uh well it's uh not populous uh to
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
the people who are paying taxes for that
 
01:16:08.450 --> 01:16:08.460 align:start position:0%
school administrator both of the town
 
01:16:10.370 --> 01:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
manager or whatever
 
01:16:13.130 --> 01:16:13.140 align:start position:0%
but isn't that the town's choice I mean
 
01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
well you left off one part the town is
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
also getting out of its debt that it is
 
01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
required to pay and that's where that's
 
01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
a big that's a bigger issue with this
 
01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
than probably anything else yeah it
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't be such a problem if
 
01:16:28.189 --> 01:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
the uaal didn't exist but because it
 
01:16:28.199 --> 01:16:29.270 align:start position:0%
the uaal didn't exist but because it
does

01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:16:32.330 --> 01:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
they're taking that job off of the off
 
01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
of the payroll let's say for
 
01:16:36.530 --> 01:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
downshifting the debt so that's going to
 
01:16:38.930 --> 01:16:38.940 align:start position:0%
get pushed off to other communities to
 
01:16:40.669 --> 01:16:40.679 align:start position:0%
pick up that burden
 
01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
um because the debt doesn't go away
 
01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
they're just not paying their portion of
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
it now for the position that they should
 
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
be paying
 
01:16:48.890 --> 01:16:48.900 align:start position:0%
does that make sense yeah
 
01:16:50.510 --> 01:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
sorry that would that be the biggest
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
problem I think in 2000 you know um 2040
 
01:16:55.729 --> 01:16:55.739 align:start position:0%
this isn't necessarily as big of a deal
 
01:16:58.430 --> 01:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
in 2040 100a is going to probably be
 
01:17:00.290 --> 01:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
substantially Rewritten anyway
 
01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
so we'll cross that bridge when all of
 
01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
us are talking to other legislators
 
01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
about it and also I mean if it if it is
 
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
a concern would there be a problem with
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
putting a sunset clause in once the uial
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
is fully funded if you want I I'm not
 
01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:19.980 align:start position:0%
opposed to that the thing of it is that
 
01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:23.410 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:23.410 --> 01:17:28.310 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:29.689 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:17:29.689 --> 01:17:29.699 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:31.850 --> 01:17:31.860 align:start position:0%
I would I would feel better if we just
 
01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
said it's a uaal contribution because
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
they don't the person is not earning any
 
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
further benefits
 
01:17:42.410 --> 01:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
as a part-time employee so the normal
 
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
cost is not necessary
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
but sure that's a tiny amount of the uh
 
01:17:49.729 --> 01:17:49.739 align:start position:0%
right normal cost of the pension the
 
01:17:51.649 --> 01:17:51.659 align:start position:0%
pension system is extremely low I mean
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
that's why the
 
01:17:54.410 --> 01:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
that's why we created the pension system
 
01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
in 67 because it's far cheaper so than
 
01:18:00.649 --> 01:18:00.659 align:start position:0%
doing it any other way so it's so sure I
 
01:18:02.930 --> 01:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
mean that's that's really the ual part
 
01:18:04.970 --> 01:18:04.980 align:start position:0%
of this part of this is is really the
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
majority of right the the problem here
 
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
you're just you just don't want to shift
 
01:18:11.570 --> 01:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
costs right it's not fair for dairy I
 
01:18:13.610 --> 01:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
mean representative true and I border
 
01:18:16.370 --> 01:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
towns it's not fair if my town decides
 
01:18:19.130 --> 01:18:19.140 align:start position:0%
to to come up with this this scheme all
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
I'm doing is Shifting that debt over to
 
01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
his town and everybody else's town and
 
01:18:25.570 --> 01:18:25.580 align:start position:0%
that's that's just not
 
01:18:27.890 --> 01:18:27.900 align:start position:0%
this this has got a little bitty fire
 
01:18:30.590 --> 01:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
going on right now under it and if you
 
01:18:33.229 --> 01:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
know we've we've spent six years quietly
 
01:18:35.689 --> 01:18:35.699 align:start position:0%
talking about fixing this
 
01:18:39.169 --> 01:18:39.179 align:start position:0%
and then it happened again so we have
 
01:18:40.610 --> 01:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
got to nip this in the bud before this
 
01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
becomes a a tactic
 
01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
any other questions it may have already
 
01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
become a tactic it just is not very
 
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
widespread yet right
 
01:18:52.669 --> 01:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
so keep it on the down low so they don't
 
01:18:56.750 --> 01:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
hear us talking no okay so so uh
 
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I assure you this isn't something
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
that within especially the group two
 
01:19:05.930 --> 01:19:05.940 align:start position:0%
World everyone is well aware of yeah
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
um so if you want representative to work
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
on an amendment and we are happy to help
 
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
with input on that um well that's that's
 
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
why I'm talking to you now in in this in
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
this forum really just just so that
 
01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
because like I said my thought with this
 
01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
is that if we're if we're going to look
 
01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
at the positions where this has happened
 
01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:23.390 align:start position:0%
at the positions where this has happened
or

01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:19:25.729 --> 01:19:25.739 align:start position:0%
or potentially could happen then we're
 
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
talking about superintendents principals
 
01:19:29.149 --> 01:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
administrators fire chief police chief
 
01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:32.820 align:start position:0%
and potentially the title of director
 
01:19:35.689 --> 01:19:35.699 align:start position:0%
yeah Direct ly direct name what it's
 
01:19:37.850 --> 01:19:37.860 align:start position:0%
called sure if it's the same kind of
 
01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:38.689 align:start position:0%
called sure if it's the same kind of
thing

01:19:38.689 --> 01:19:38.699 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
so if we did use the phrase and the
 
01:19:42.530 --> 01:19:42.540 align:start position:0%
light because I'm not really familiar
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
with seeing that in statute very much
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
OLS might have a different term that
 
01:19:50.090 --> 01:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
becomes uh right all us to figure it out
 
01:19:51.709 --> 01:19:51.719 align:start position:0%
there's a legal term
 
01:19:54.050 --> 01:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
yeah however however the the lawyers
 
01:19:55.610 --> 01:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
will phrase such a thing and then
 
01:19:56.930 --> 01:19:56.940 align:start position:0%
everybody can chop and say it's too
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
vague to enforce
 
01:20:01.010 --> 01:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
well well you'd have litigation yeah
 
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
would the term administrative position
 
01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
senior administrator I mean you're
 
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
talking senior Personnel yes well the
 
01:20:10.850 --> 01:20:10.860 align:start position:0%
other thing that yeah because the other
 
01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
thing that you don't want to leave is a
 
01:20:13.610 --> 01:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
loophole is the whatever the
 
01:20:15.709 --> 01:20:15.719 align:start position:0%
organization is just changes the name so
 
01:20:17.209 --> 01:20:17.219 align:start position:0%
it doesn't match up with the statute and
 
01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
then they're like well it isn't a fire
 
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
chief it's uh whatever and yeah it's a
 
01:20:25.130 --> 01:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
fire leader exactly sure of course all
 
01:20:26.810 --> 01:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
right and that
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
everybody laughs at that until the first
 
01:20:31.450 --> 01:20:31.460 align:start position:0%
Community does it they'll do it for sure
 
01:20:34.250 --> 01:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
and then right that's what this that's
 
01:20:36.410 --> 01:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
what city of Franklin did that they were
 
01:20:38.209 --> 01:20:38.219 align:start position:0%
the first ones to ever ever kind of get
 
01:20:39.649 --> 01:20:39.659 align:start position:0%
on this road and that's exactly what
 
01:20:41.209 --> 01:20:41.219 align:start position:0%
they did they had an emergency
 
01:20:44.209 --> 01:20:44.219 align:start position:0%
management or Emergency Operations
 
01:20:47.090 --> 01:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
director some some bizarre title that
 
01:20:50.209 --> 01:20:50.219 align:start position:0%
was not fire chief and not police chief
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
so there's well in statute it only says
 
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
this and this
 
01:20:56.510 --> 01:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
01:21:00.169 --> 01:21:00.179 align:start position:0%
so I agree we'll we'll ask for that
 
01:21:03.950 --> 01:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
the legalese of that concept sure sure
 
01:21:07.010 --> 01:21:07.020 align:start position:0%
okay well then uh then we'll have
 
01:21:08.330 --> 01:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
another work session you can bring it
 
01:21:09.770 --> 01:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
back to it and we'll take a look at it
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
yep that works and uh now that we've got
 
01:21:17.149 --> 01:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:19.370 --> 01:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
we'll go from there sure cool awesome
 
01:21:21.050 --> 01:21:21.060 align:start position:0%
awesome thank you so much I'll run that
 
01:21:22.970 --> 01:21:22.980 align:start position:0%
by you before I file it okay that sounds
 
01:21:25.310 --> 01:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
good we can just discuss it well we'll
 
01:21:26.689 --> 01:21:26.699 align:start position:0%
discuss it I'll pass it around get some
 
01:21:28.010 --> 01:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
feedback from everybody else and then we
 
01:21:29.630 --> 01:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
can send it in okay so that way you're
 
01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
not showing up and then we're totally
 
01:21:32.810 --> 01:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
revamping it and having to have a third
 
01:21:36.050 --> 01:21:36.060 align:start position:0%
work session right yeah right gotcha all
 
01:21:39.890 --> 01:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
right fantastic cool thank you thank you
 
01:21:43.250 --> 01:21:43.260 align:start position:0%

01:22:48.290 --> 01:22:48.300 align:start position:0%
joining
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit recently
 
01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
exactly focused on the topic of of this
 
01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh the principle of this legislation
 
01:23:04.010 --> 01:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
which is that the ESG investing and it
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
could be any kind of uh investing that
 
01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
is not standard uh using standard
 
01:23:14.570 --> 01:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duty you know pecuniary
 
01:23:19.070 --> 01:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility only not some other uh
 
01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
Factor social justice whatever it is
 
01:23:26.570 --> 01:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
um is is inappropriate and uh as the
 
01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
federal government has has changed the
 
01:23:32.209 --> 01:23:32.219 align:start position:0%
laws or is in the process of changing
 
01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
the laws to uh permit this
 
01:23:39.709 --> 01:23:39.719 align:start position:0%
um and uh we have multiple states that
 
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
are now suing the federal government to
 
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
stop the implementation of that rule
 
01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
and the rationale is highlighted in
 
01:23:53.330 --> 01:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
yellow at the bottom ESG funds generally
 
01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:54.590 align:start position:0%
yellow at the bottom ESG funds generally
gain

01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
gain
 
01:23:58.729 --> 01:23:58.739 align:start position:0%
a 6.3 percent return compared to an 8.9
 
01:24:01.930 --> 01:24:01.940 align:start position:0%
return for the average Market
 
01:24:04.970 --> 01:24:04.980 align:start position:0%
so there are multiple surveys that are
 
01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
out there and in the testimony that
 
01:24:09.950 --> 01:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
happened on the on the bill when it was
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
heard you heard people make the claims
 
01:24:16.010 --> 01:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
that yes you can be this and can be that
 
01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
and you can look at
 
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
you know whatever survey you want but in
 
01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:21.649 align:start position:0%
you know whatever survey you want but in
general

01:24:21.649 --> 01:24:21.659 align:start position:0%
general
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
I believe it is accepted that in the
 
01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
current climate any of these ESG funds
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
or non
 
01:24:34.450 --> 01:24:34.460 align:start position:0%
straight fiduciary duty oriented funds
 
01:24:37.930 --> 01:24:37.940 align:start position:0%
will have a lower rate of return
 
01:24:41.330 --> 01:24:41.340 align:start position:0%
the CEO of BlackRock made the statement
 
01:24:44.209 --> 01:24:44.219 align:start position:0%
that we need to do this for about 10
 
01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
years or so in order to change the way
 
01:24:50.810 --> 01:24:50.820 align:start position:0%
the world works and then this won't be a
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
problem anymore so just accept it
 
01:24:55.149 --> 01:24:55.159 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's the principle behind the
 
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
legislation the second article in the in
 
01:25:04.250 --> 01:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
the stack just describes what the
 
01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
court cases and the other two documents
 
01:25:09.890 --> 01:25:09.900 align:start position:0%
I've provided you were were the
 
01:25:12.830 --> 01:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
documents I referenced in my testimony
 
01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
um and uh unfortunately I I did not have
 
01:25:19.130 --> 01:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
the ability to give you at at that time
 
01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
so with that I'm I'm
 
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
ready to entertain whatever questions
 
01:25:26.630 --> 01:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
you may have
 
01:25:29.270 --> 01:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
01:25:32.570 --> 01:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:34.970 --> 01:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
good morning I see that our attorney
 
01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
general has said that
 
01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:40.790 align:start position:0%
general has said that
um

01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
that that that
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
the fiduciary should Place their clients
 
01:25:47.930 --> 01:25:47.940 align:start position:0%
interest at the Forefront which is New
 
01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law and New Hampshire
 
01:25:52.189 --> 01:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the issue you're trying
 
01:25:55.610 --> 01:25:55.620 align:start position:0%
to stop is a federal law and I don't see
 
01:26:00.129 --> 01:26:00.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:00.139 --> 01:26:02.090 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:03.290 align:start position:0%
uh
so

01:26:03.290 --> 01:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:07.250 --> 01:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
when I reviewed the law with OLS
 
01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:09.070 align:start position:0%
when I reviewed the law with OLS
um

01:26:09.070 --> 01:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:12.590 --> 01:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
the treasure does not have a fiduciary
 
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
duty to make investments according to a
 
01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:21.719 align:start position:0%
you know traditional fiduciary duty
 
01:26:25.090 --> 01:26:25.100 align:start position:0%
responsibility there's nothing in in in
 
01:26:29.629 --> 01:26:29.639 align:start position:0%
those statutes that requires that
 
01:26:32.450 --> 01:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:26:36.070 --> 01:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
pension laws say that one should use
 
01:26:40.610 --> 01:26:40.620 align:start position:0%
sole interest which I can argue and I
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
think many would argue is even higher
 
01:26:46.030 --> 01:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
standard traditional fiduciary duty
 
01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
the question that I have is whether or
 
01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
not that is indeed being done
 
01:26:57.530 --> 01:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
um and so the purpose of this was to
 
01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
drive home that point that one should be
 
01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
looking at that and I asked in my
 
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
testimony uh that the the Pension funds
 
01:27:10.729 --> 01:27:10.739 align:start position:0%
be asked whether or not they are
 
01:27:14.209 --> 01:27:14.219 align:start position:0%
actually using the sole interest law or
 
01:27:17.450 --> 01:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duty responsibility in their
 
01:27:20.629 --> 01:27:20.639 align:start position:0%
investment activities or are they
 
01:27:23.410 --> 01:27:23.420 align:start position:0%
turning it over to most
 
01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
many Pension funds are run by by turning
 
01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
the actual voting of shares and buying
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
and processing of those shares over to a
 
01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
proxy that
 
01:27:38.930 --> 01:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
doesn't look at these things
 
01:27:42.530 --> 01:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
so if it's listed on the exchange it's
 
01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
okay you know if they they are not
 
01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the underlying criteria like
 
01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
whether they're pursuing ESG or some
 
01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:54.530 align:start position:0%
whether they're pursuing ESG or some
other

01:27:54.530 --> 01:27:54.540 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:27:57.530 --> 01:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
um factors beyond straight fiduciary
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
duty which is why you have 25 states
 
01:28:03.410 --> 01:28:03.420 align:start position:0%
that are now stirring the pot here
 
01:28:05.629 --> 01:28:05.639 align:start position:0%
saying this is wrong
 
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
to follow up on that question though
 
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
um and you know I share your feelings on
 
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
ESG as a general rule for sure I'm just
 
01:28:14.209 --> 01:28:14.219 align:start position:0%
trying to parse out you know what's
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
going on in this particular bill
 
01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
is your main concern simply that the
 
01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is
 
01:28:24.649 --> 01:28:24.659 align:start position:0%
making Investments with fiduciary
 
01:28:28.189 --> 01:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility in the Forefront or as
 
01:28:30.050 --> 01:28:30.060 align:start position:0%
the main concern that we just aren't
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
investing in ESG at all
 
01:28:34.250 --> 01:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
the reason why I asked the question is
 
01:28:37.370 --> 01:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
what if the two coincide on a in a
 
01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
particular fund whereas both they both
 
01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:41.209 align:start position:0%
particular fund whereas both they both
are

01:28:41.209 --> 01:28:41.219 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:28:44.090 --> 01:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
um take ESG into consideration but it is
 
01:28:46.250 --> 01:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
also producing the highest return that's
 
01:28:48.169 --> 01:28:48.179 align:start position:0%
available to the state of New Hampshire
 
01:28:50.450 --> 01:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
and just following up on that my
 
01:28:52.010 --> 01:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
question would be
 
01:28:54.410 --> 01:28:54.420 align:start position:0%
would it meet your goal to just put into
 
01:28:57.530 --> 01:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
statute that the treasurer does have to
 
01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
take fiduciary responsibility into
 
01:29:03.229 --> 01:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
consideration when making Investments
 
01:29:07.370 --> 01:29:07.380 align:start position:0%
um and leave the ESG component of it out
 
01:29:11.050 --> 01:29:11.060 align:start position:0%
uh from your perspective well I don't
 
01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
the the law itself does not say anything
 
01:29:20.149 --> 01:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
about BSG The Proposal it just says
 
01:29:20.159 --> 01:29:21.169 align:start position:0%
about BSG The Proposal it just says
um

01:29:21.169 --> 01:29:21.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:23.770 --> 01:29:23.780 align:start position:0%
let me find it here
 
01:29:26.209 --> 01:29:26.219 align:start position:0%
social political or ideological
 
01:29:28.430 --> 01:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
interests I mean that that's the part
 
01:29:30.050 --> 01:29:30.060 align:start position:0%
that I'm getting at it doesn't say ESG
 
01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
but that's I mean that's the general
 
01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
idea of it now the analysis section uh
 
01:29:37.990 --> 01:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
says that but the but the proposal
 
01:29:40.490 --> 01:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
that's in order to make it clear what
 
01:29:43.850 --> 01:29:43.860 align:start position:0%
what this focus is but the law uh
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
actually being proposed is all
 
01:29:48.290 --> 01:29:48.300 align:start position:0%
Investments and their management shall
 
01:29:50.270 --> 01:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
be governed by fiduciary duty to
 
01:29:52.490 --> 01:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
maximize benefits to the state and the
 
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries of States trust funds
 
01:29:57.950 --> 01:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
that's it so it doesn't matter if it's
 
01:30:01.390 --> 01:30:01.400 align:start position:0%
ESG or if it's uh some other
 
01:30:04.189 --> 01:30:04.199 align:start position:0%
criteria the bottom line is
 
01:30:06.410 --> 01:30:06.420 align:start position:0%
whoever is managing the fund should
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
manage them for maximum return
 
01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:10.790 align:start position:0%
manage them for maximum return
period

01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:30:14.450 --> 01:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
right no no other no other common or no
 
01:30:16.490 --> 01:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
other criteria should be blended into
 
01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
that right no I understand so that's my
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's my question is if we were to make
 
01:30:23.870 --> 01:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
an amendment to this bill that basically
 
01:30:25.490 --> 01:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
just said that the treasury because the
 
01:30:28.010 --> 01:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire retirement system from our
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
understanding is already under that
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
obligation the concern is that the
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
treasury isn't under that obligation if
 
01:30:35.090 --> 01:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
we just rewrote it to say that the
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
treasury is under that obligation with
 
01:30:40.250 --> 01:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
that meet your concerns
 
01:30:43.729 --> 01:30:43.739 align:start position:0%
it would meet my concern however I again
 
01:30:47.810 --> 01:30:47.820 align:start position:0%
I I would ask that I am not sure that
 
01:30:50.090 --> 01:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
the treasure is I mean excuse me the
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
pension fund system is following that
 
01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:55.010 align:start position:0%
pension fund system is following that
responsibility

01:30:55.010 --> 01:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
01:30:58.910 --> 01:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
your sole interest so maybe Carol would
 
01:31:00.290 --> 01:31:00.300 align:start position:0%
know this better than me I'm sure she
 
01:31:02.570 --> 01:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
would actually know this better than me
 
01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:05.400 align:start position:0%
um who oversees whether or not the New
 
01:31:06.890 --> 01:31:06.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system is meeting
 
01:31:08.689 --> 01:31:08.699 align:start position:0%
that fiduciary responsibility and who
 
01:31:10.250 --> 01:31:10.260 align:start position:0%
can hold them accountable because the
 
01:31:11.689 --> 01:31:11.699 align:start position:0%
same question would hold true to the
 
01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
treasurer if we pass this on to the
 
01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:14.990 align:start position:0%
treasurer if we pass this on to the
treasurer

01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
treasurer
 
01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:18.649 align:start position:0%
treasurer
um

01:31:18.649 --> 01:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know the
 
01:31:25.370 --> 01:31:25.380 align:start position:0%
boarded the Board of Trustees of the
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
01:31:29.930 --> 01:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
is it stated that they shall I had they
 
01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
had they are fiduciaries
 
01:31:36.169 --> 01:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
and any person who is a beneficiary that
 
01:31:39.290 --> 01:31:39.300 align:start position:0%
thinks they aren't not investing solely
 
01:31:42.610 --> 01:31:42.620 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of the
 
01:31:45.410 --> 01:31:45.420 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries can sue them
 
01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:54.169 --> 01:31:54.179 align:start position:0%
entity that is checking up on them
 
01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
regularly that's what you're asking yeah
 
01:31:59.030 --> 01:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
well I don't know at all we got even if
 
01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
we put that clause in say we were to say
 
01:32:03.169 --> 01:32:03.179 align:start position:0%
that they had to ask whether or not they
 
01:32:04.610 --> 01:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
were taking those other things into
 
01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:06.290 align:start position:0%
were taking those other things into
consideration

01:32:06.290 --> 01:32:06.300 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:07.250 align:start position:0%
consideration
um

01:32:07.250 --> 01:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:08.689 --> 01:32:08.699 align:start position:0%
the question still comes back to
 
01:32:10.129 --> 01:32:10.139 align:start position:0%
accountability who's holding them
 
01:32:11.570 --> 01:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
accountable to that who's looking after
 
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
them to say did you ask or was the
 
01:32:16.610 --> 01:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
paperwork that you asked or
 
01:32:18.729 --> 01:32:18.739 align:start position:0%
um that would be the next question
 
01:32:21.770 --> 01:32:21.780 align:start position:0%
that's that's the premise of why I
 
01:32:23.629 --> 01:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
brought this
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
right but even if we were to pass this
 
01:32:28.129 --> 01:32:28.139 align:start position:0%
as written yeah who who's holding them
 
01:32:30.110 --> 01:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
accountable so now they're supposed to
 
01:32:31.729 --> 01:32:31.739 align:start position:0%
do this but who's coming on the backside
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
and holding them accountable for it
 
01:32:35.810 --> 01:32:35.820 align:start position:0%
how would we know
 
01:32:40.430 --> 01:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
lead quite a bit of concern a few years
 
01:32:45.169 --> 01:32:45.179 align:start position:0%
back when the Retirement System's
 
01:32:49.250 --> 01:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
earnings came in at I believe it was 1.5
 
01:32:51.709 --> 01:32:51.719 align:start position:0%
percent when everyone else was earning
 
01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
12 and at that point the legislature
 
01:32:59.570 --> 01:32:59.580 align:start position:0%
passed a bill that they had to
 
01:33:02.689 --> 01:33:02.699 align:start position:0%
post on the website the amounts that
 
01:33:06.890 --> 01:33:06.900 align:start position:0%
they were spending in investment
 
01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
who they were spending money with to
 
01:33:13.129 --> 01:33:13.139 align:start position:0%
invest the monies of which corporations
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
and how much I would also find out that
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
the Investments for the retirement
 
01:33:20.570 --> 01:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
system are actually done by an
 
01:33:22.669 --> 01:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
independent investment committee
 
01:33:25.129 --> 01:33:25.139 align:start position:0%
appointed by the Board of Trustees
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
correct right I would also have the
 
01:33:30.530 --> 01:33:30.540 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duty yes definitely they are
 
01:33:30.540 --> 01:33:31.689 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duty yes definitely they are
all

01:33:31.689 --> 01:33:31.699 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:33:35.209 --> 01:33:35.219 align:start position:0%
fiduciaries and have that responsibility
 
01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
I would also point out that the state
 
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
treasurer is answerable to the
 
01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
legislature gets reelected every two
 
01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:44.510 align:start position:0%
legislature gets reelected every two
years

01:33:44.510 --> 01:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:33:46.129 --> 01:33:46.139 align:start position:0%
but there isn't like a standing
 
01:33:47.870 --> 01:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
committee on finance or anything that's
 
01:33:52.250 --> 01:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
specifically oversees Investments
 
01:33:54.590 --> 01:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
and would for the treasurer or for the
 
01:33:55.910 --> 01:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire retirement system there's
 
01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
no there's no standing committee that
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
oversees that
 
01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
Carol Le DNA does look at the retirement
 
01:34:04.370 --> 01:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
system fairly often but we don't
 
01:34:07.129 --> 01:34:07.139 align:start position:0%
necessarily dig down into whether or not
 
01:34:09.649 --> 01:34:09.659 align:start position:0%
they're making changes
 
01:34:13.250 --> 01:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
um so potentially that could be an
 
01:34:15.050 --> 01:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
amendment that would say
 
01:34:17.209 --> 01:34:17.219 align:start position:0%
there shall be a
 
01:34:18.910 --> 01:34:18.920 align:start position:0%
committee that
 
01:34:22.250 --> 01:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
investigates whether this fiduciary
 
01:34:24.590 --> 01:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
standard is being upheld yeah I'm just
 
01:34:26.330 --> 01:34:26.340 align:start position:0%
trying to drill down to make sure that I
 
01:34:28.189 --> 01:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
understand I'm you know meeting your
 
01:34:29.450 --> 01:34:29.460 align:start position:0%
concerns with the bill which is
 
01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
primarily that fiduciary responsibility
 
01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
is the Paramount concern and that
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
somebody's watching to make sure that
 
01:34:37.129 --> 01:34:37.139 align:start position:0%
the institutions that are investing are
 
01:34:37.139 --> 01:34:38.330 align:start position:0%
the institutions that are investing are
investing

01:34:38.330 --> 01:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
investing
 
01:34:42.050 --> 01:34:42.060 align:start position:0%
with that in mind yes the the retirement
 
01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:42.950 align:start position:0%
with that in mind yes the the retirement
system

01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:34:44.750 --> 01:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
does issue
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
issue their minutes are public they do
 
01:34:50.090 --> 01:34:50.100 align:start position:0%
issue reports and they send it to me
 
01:34:53.390 --> 01:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
ex-officio and I noticed that for
 
01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
example when the federal government said
 
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
you know don't invest in Russia they had
 
01:35:01.370 --> 01:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
a plan to divest Russian
 
01:35:01.380 --> 01:35:02.870 align:start position:0%
a plan to divest Russian
assets

01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
assets
 
01:35:04.970 --> 01:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
which they identified as being very
 
01:35:08.030 --> 01:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
risky and not a lot but not not a large
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
Port part of their portfolio
 
01:35:14.990 --> 01:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
and I understand it's uh so
 
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.110 align:start position:0%
and I understand it's uh so
um

01:35:18.110 --> 01:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
I believe I I also looked at the at the
 
01:35:23.450 --> 01:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
site and they're publishing their
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
returns uh you know because yeah yes 10
 
01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
or so years ago we were down to one and
 
01:35:33.110 --> 01:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
a half percent and and then while
 
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
everybody else is making uh over 10
 
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
percent in their returns uh so the focus
 
01:35:43.729 --> 01:35:43.739 align:start position:0%
is on their rate of return but there is
 
01:35:47.330 --> 01:35:47.340 align:start position:0%
no focus on whether or not this
 
01:35:51.290 --> 01:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
uh infiltration idea that you can invest
 
01:35:55.129 --> 01:35:55.139 align:start position:0%
both for fiduciary or pecuniary return
 
01:35:58.610 --> 01:35:58.620 align:start position:0%
and social justice concerns at the same
 
01:36:00.530 --> 01:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
time which
 
01:36:02.890 --> 01:36:02.900 align:start position:0%
will drag your your returns down
 
01:36:05.930 --> 01:36:05.940 align:start position:0%
somewhat but maybe not so bad that you
 
01:36:08.750 --> 01:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't notice it that who's watching
 
01:36:10.850 --> 01:36:10.860 align:start position:0%
for that that's that's the concern we're
 
01:36:12.890 --> 01:36:12.900 align:start position:0%
looking at here
 
01:36:15.010 --> 01:36:15.020 align:start position:0%
those who care
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
I mean that's legitimately if you think
 
01:36:20.570 --> 01:36:20.580 align:start position:0%
that they're investing in a way that
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
that jeopardizes their returns
 
01:36:24.890 --> 01:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
you're an interested party you're
 
01:36:28.250 --> 01:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
bringing in a bill I mean what
 
01:36:31.490 --> 01:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
if you and to be to be honest looking at
 
01:36:34.010 --> 01:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
the returns of the retirement system I'd
 
01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
say they are not worse than other
 
01:36:38.870 --> 01:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
Retirement Systems but they sure look a
 
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
whole lot more more highly variable
 
01:36:43.729 --> 01:36:43.739 align:start position:0%
volatile they're definitely more
 
01:36:43.739 --> 01:36:45.470 align:start position:0%
volatile they're definitely more
volatile

01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
volatile
 
01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:46.370 align:start position:0%
volatile
um

01:36:46.370 --> 01:36:46.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:48.770 --> 01:36:48.780 align:start position:0%
another thought potentially
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
should should some oversight of either
 
01:36:54.649 --> 01:36:54.659 align:start position:0%
Finance or Edna
 
01:36:57.470 --> 01:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
um should we request reports comparing
 
01:36:59.930 --> 01:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
the returns of our system to similar
 
01:37:01.850 --> 01:37:01.860 align:start position:0%
systems around the country they give
 
01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
they give them
 
01:37:04.669 --> 01:37:04.679 align:start position:0%
we do get them okay yeah I'll show you
 
01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:09.239 --> 01:37:11.149 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:37:11.149 --> 01:37:11.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:37:12.649 --> 01:37:12.659 align:start position:0%
um and do we know if the treasury does
 
01:37:22.610 --> 01:37:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:22.620 --> 01:37:27.189 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:37:27.189 --> 01:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
they send out quarterly and I look at it
 
01:37:32.209 --> 01:37:32.219 align:start position:0%
and I skim it for you know obvious
 
01:37:34.669 --> 01:37:34.679 align:start position:0%
issues and then I put it on the stack
 
01:37:36.649 --> 01:37:36.659 align:start position:0%
and then when the stack gets too high I
 
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
take out the bottom exactly so but I'm
 
01:37:43.850 --> 01:37:43.860 align:start position:0%
not as concerned about these issues as
 
01:37:47.330 --> 01:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:49.610 --> 01:37:49.620 align:start position:0%
and and speaking from the other side of
 
01:37:52.490 --> 01:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
Edna I would say we aren't either it's a
 
01:37:56.209 --> 01:37:56.219 align:start position:0%
matter of how much they're making uh not
 
01:37:58.910 --> 01:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
so much how they're making it what kind
 
01:38:01.510 --> 01:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
of decisions they're making as far as
 
01:38:04.010 --> 01:38:04.020 align:start position:0%
maximizing the income
 
01:38:06.410 --> 01:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
well dealing with the Gnomes of Zurich
 
01:38:08.689 --> 01:38:08.699 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm happy with that
 
01:38:10.490 --> 01:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
provided of course they get a reasonable
 
01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:11.570 align:start position:0%
provided of course they get a reasonable
return

01:38:11.570 --> 01:38:11.580 align:start position:0%
return
 
01:38:14.930 --> 01:38:14.940 align:start position:0%
well again the concept is is clear that
 
01:38:17.930 --> 01:38:17.940 align:start position:0%
if you are trying to serve two masters
 
01:38:20.450 --> 01:38:20.460 align:start position:0%
your returns are going to be slightly
 
01:38:23.149 --> 01:38:23.159 align:start position:0%
lower that's the issue well I I feel
 
01:38:26.270 --> 01:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
like if if the treasurer isn't under a
 
01:38:28.850 --> 01:38:28.860 align:start position:0%
fiduciary obligation and statute we
 
01:38:30.290 --> 01:38:30.300 align:start position:0%
should look to we should look to fix
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
that I mean I would say that I would say
 
01:38:33.649 --> 01:38:33.659 align:start position:0%
that is something that we ought to
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
include that the treasurer is does have
 
01:38:38.990 --> 01:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
a fiduciary responsibility because
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
she's got millions of dollars of State
 
01:38:44.330 --> 01:38:44.340 align:start position:0%
money rainy day fund plus all the
 
01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
operating funds all the lost money all
 
01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
all the in
 
01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:48.590 align:start position:0%
all the in
a

01:38:48.590 --> 01:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:38:51.290 --> 01:38:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:52.970 --> 01:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
responsibility because some of that
 
01:38:56.689 --> 01:38:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:59.810 --> 01:38:59.820 align:start position:0%
um I would say that before we take that
 
01:39:03.050 --> 01:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
step though we should have the treasurer
 
01:39:05.390 --> 01:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
or a representative come in and and
 
01:39:08.110 --> 01:39:08.120 align:start position:0%
address this issue
 
01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
directly with this subcommittee because
 
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
there may be
 
01:39:15.530 --> 01:39:15.540 align:start position:0%
um conditions that we're not considering
 
01:39:17.330 --> 01:39:17.340 align:start position:0%
are hearing yeah I think I think
 
01:39:19.129 --> 01:39:19.139 align:start position:0%
bringing the treasurer in and maybe some
 
01:39:21.310 --> 01:39:21.320 align:start position:0%
uh somebody from OLS who can explain
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
that side of it as well someone from the
 
01:39:25.310 --> 01:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
treasurer's office I would say I would
 
01:39:28.189 --> 01:39:28.199 align:start position:0%
say yeah I just meant uh someone from
 
01:39:30.410 --> 01:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
the lawyer side as well to interpret the
 
01:39:36.290 --> 01:39:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:37.970 --> 01:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
the first year we're considering this
 
01:39:40.910 --> 01:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
bill would they be able to provide to
 
01:39:42.890 --> 01:39:42.900 align:start position:0%
meet with this have somebody meet with
 
01:39:44.689 --> 01:39:44.699 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee yeah
 
01:39:44.699 --> 01:39:46.430 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee yeah
because

01:39:46.430 --> 01:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:39:49.610 --> 01:39:49.620 align:start position:0%
it doesn't look like
 
01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:52.370 align:start position:0%
it doesn't look like
um

01:39:52.370 --> 01:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:54.649 --> 01:39:54.659 align:start position:0%
because when you read it they're talking
 
01:39:56.870 --> 01:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
about costs to check into whether or not
 
01:39:59.450 --> 01:39:59.460 align:start position:0%
their current suppliers are compliant
 
01:40:01.490 --> 01:40:01.500 align:start position:0%
they're not saying we don't have a
 
01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:02.990 align:start position:0%
they're not saying we don't have a
fiduciary

01:40:02.990 --> 01:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
fiduciary
 
01:40:05.209 --> 01:40:05.219 align:start position:0%
I don't think that they're saying they
 
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
don't feel they have a fiduciary
 
01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:09.169 align:start position:0%
don't feel they have a fiduciary
responsibility

01:40:09.169 --> 01:40:09.179 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
01:40:11.450 --> 01:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
so but we all definitely ought to talk
 
01:40:13.490 --> 01:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
to them
 
01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:17.229 align:start position:0%
to them
parameters

01:40:17.229 --> 01:40:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
okay I'll take care of that I'll contact
 
01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:22.860 align:start position:0%
the treasurer and see if they can have a
 
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
um representative meet with us to
 
01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
discuss whether or not
 
01:40:28.729 --> 01:40:28.739 align:start position:0%
and then um if need be we can check in
 
01:40:28.739 --> 01:40:29.709 align:start position:0%
and then um if need be we can check in
with

01:40:29.709 --> 01:40:29.719 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:40:32.030 --> 01:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
OLS and see if
 
01:40:34.669 --> 01:40:34.679 align:start position:0%
their interpretation is
 
01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:35.510 align:start position:0%
the same
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:36.890 align:start position:0%
the same
[Laughter]

01:40:36.890 --> 01:40:36.900 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:40:39.110 --> 01:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
so we can get multiple uh opinions on it
 
01:40:40.850 --> 01:40:40.860 align:start position:0%
and then we can discuss it further and
 
01:40:42.890 --> 01:40:42.900 align:start position:0%
and see what uh
 
01:40:44.570 --> 01:40:44.580 align:start position:0%
we do have the concept we do want to
 
01:40:46.010 --> 01:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
make sure that all of our institutions
 
01:40:48.590 --> 01:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
are taking fiduciary responsibility as
 
01:40:50.510 --> 01:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
the primary concern for our investments
 
01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
I think we're all agreed on that
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
um so this will we'll do that we'll have
 
01:40:57.649 --> 01:40:57.659 align:start position:0%
another meeting looks like we are going
 
01:40:58.910 --> 01:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
to have another meeting on all three of
 
01:41:00.290 --> 01:41:00.300 align:start position:0%
these bills
 
01:41:03.169 --> 01:41:03.179 align:start position:0%
um and hopefully we can Chip Away them a
 
01:41:04.850 --> 01:41:04.860 align:start position:0%
little bit more than we have until the
 
01:41:04.860 --> 01:41:06.649 align:start position:0%
little bit more than we have until the
16th

01:41:06.649 --> 01:41:06.659 align:start position:0%
16th
 
01:41:06.659 --> 01:41:08.270 align:start position:0%
16th
eighth

01:41:08.270 --> 01:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
eighth
 
01:41:10.910 --> 01:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
the exact is scheduled for the eighth
 
01:41:13.550 --> 01:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
eighth okay so the
 
01:41:16.669 --> 01:41:16.679 align:start position:0%
uh we do have till the 15th to actually
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
complete all of the bills but they're
 
01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
scheduled for the eighth
 
01:41:23.390 --> 01:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh I have spoken with representative
 
01:41:27.169 --> 01:41:27.179 align:start position:0%
Smith and we can use this room is
 
01:41:28.970 --> 01:41:28.980 align:start position:0%
available to us
 
01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
for Mondays as well as Fridays
 
01:41:34.490 --> 01:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
seeing as how we're losing our they're
 
01:41:36.590 --> 01:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
only going to be here on Tuesdays
 
01:41:39.550 --> 01:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
we're losing our Thursdays to session so
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
Mondays and Fridays are available okay
 
01:41:42.239 --> 01:41:45.649 align:start position:0%
Mondays and Fridays are available okay
sorry

01:41:45.649 --> 01:41:45.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:48.050 --> 01:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
uh well Chris Chris wanted me to miss it
 
01:41:50.629 --> 01:41:50.639 align:start position:0%
for the world so
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
um any any other comments uh from the
 
01:41:53.870 --> 01:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
committee that we should take into
 
01:41:59.629 --> 01:41:59.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:02.209 --> 01:42:02.219 align:start position:0%
yes representative are we expecting an
 
01:42:02.219 --> 01:42:04.430 align:start position:0%
yes representative are we expecting an
amendment

01:42:04.430 --> 01:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:42:07.729 --> 01:42:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:10.669 --> 01:42:10.679 align:start position:0%
I would I would say we should talk to
 
01:42:20.990 --> 01:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:25.310 --> 01:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
you know I'm regardless of this issue I
 
01:42:27.530 --> 01:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
think just simply saying that the
 
01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
treasurer does have a fiduciary
 
01:42:32.810 --> 01:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
responsibility I'm sure that
 
01:42:34.850 --> 01:42:34.860 align:start position:0%
this has to be the case well I'm sure
 
01:42:36.709 --> 01:42:36.719 align:start position:0%
it's assumed but I don't know where it
 
01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
is in statute 10 years vested has been
 
01:42:43.129 --> 01:42:43.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:45.109 --> 01:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
at least I'd be happy
 
01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
I would say everybody on the committee
 
01:42:48.970 --> 01:42:48.980 align:start position:0%
would would support
 
01:42:51.109 --> 01:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
clarifying that the treasurer does have
 
01:42:53.870 --> 01:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
a fiduciary duty provided there's no
 
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
Zinger so we don't know about or there's
 
01:42:59.870 --> 01:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:01.250 align:start position:0%
 
good

01:43:01.250 --> 01:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:43:02.570 --> 01:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi thank you for
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
your time and we're gonna we'll keep you
 
01:43:06.290 --> 01:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
posted on as we continue to work on this
 
01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:09.709 align:start position:0%
posted on as we continue to work on this
thing

01:43:09.709 --> 01:43:09.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:11.270 --> 01:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:43:13.129 --> 01:43:13.139 align:start position:0%
unless anybody has anything else that's
 
01:43:13.139 --> 01:43:14.450 align:start position:0%
unless anybody has anything else that's
uh

01:43:14.450 --> 01:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
I mean the end of the uh
 
01:43:24.890 --> 01:43:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:26.990 --> 01:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
well these were on the docker for our
 
01:43:31.330 --> 01:43:31.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:34.729 --> 01:43:34.739 align:start position:0%
they are on the docket for the exec
 
01:43:36.410 --> 01:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
session because
 
01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
all the bills are listed we we can
 
01:43:43.729 --> 01:43:43.739 align:start position:0%
recess and reschedule and we probably
 
01:43:43.739 --> 01:43:50.530 align:start position:0%
recess and reschedule and we probably
will

01:43:50.530 --> 01:43:50.540 align:start position:0%
