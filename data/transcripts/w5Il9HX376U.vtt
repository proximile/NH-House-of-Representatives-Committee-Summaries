to resolve a conflict in existing
 
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
statutory law we want to be clear they
 
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
don't need to be licensed to sell
 
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 align:start position:0%

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
nature you might get a more detailed
 
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 align:start position:0%

i just want to make sure that the and
 
00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 align:start position:0%
the language thank you senator for for
 
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
coming uh
 
00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 align:start position:0%
on line six of
 
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh of the text of the first page of the
 
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
text it says
 
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.710 align:start position:0%
text it says
uh

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.550 align:start position:0%
uh
2500

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
2500
 
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
per violation or any combination or
 
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
actions should that be the combination
 
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
of actions or i'm not sure the sentence
 
00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
reads maybe it's not enough caffeine or
 
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
too much caffeine or one or the other
 
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's not making sense to me in reading
 
00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
that should it be of or i see what
 
00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
you're saying um
 
00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
why don't i have the department weigh in
 
00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
because my understanding is a lot of
 
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
this language is consistent with other
 
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
parts of the statute i
 
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.990 align:start position:0%
parts of the statute i
believe

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
i believe it should be of but i'll have
 
00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 align:start position:0%
them respond so we drink the same cup of
 
00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 align:start position:0%

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
house different from the senate we

i did fill one out but i attached it
 
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
over there
 
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
here it is it just suddenly appeared
 
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 align:start position:0%

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
is joshua hilliard i'm the compliance
 
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
and enforcement council at the new
 
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire insurance department and i'm
 
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
here to speak of course in favor of this
 
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
bill for the department today
 
00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
so to to first address the question from
 
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
representative greeson uh i believe that
 
00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 align:start position:0%
may um need to be in of as you identify
 
00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759 align:start position:0%
rather than an or in in that line
 
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
line six of that first page thank you
 
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
i'd like to speak briefly to each of
 
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
these changes but please you know
 
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
interrupt me at any point if you have
 
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
any questions about them
 
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
as identified by senator susie the first
 
00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 align:start position:0%
change would modify
 
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
the licensure for
 
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
adjusters in terms of the penalties we
 
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
can bring and bring it in line with that
 
00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
for insurance agents insurance producers
 
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
right now the statute only identifies
 
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
good cause as the reasons why the
 
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
department may bring an action against
 
00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
an adjuster who has violated our laws
 
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
that's of course quite vague
 
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
this change would identify good cause to
 
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
include all of the reasons that are
 
00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639 align:start position:0%
enumerated under the statute to bring an
 
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
action against an insurance agent
 
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
the second change to 400 829
 
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
makes clear that not only are the
 
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
application fees non-refundable for
 
00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
insurance you know producer or agent
 
00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 align:start position:0%
license but the renewal fees as well
 
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
the third change would uh help eliminate
 
00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
what is currently a conflict in our law
 
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
under 400
 
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
406 c
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
right now financial institutions both
 
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
banks and credit unions
 
00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
are not required to obtain a license to
 
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
sell a limited line of credit insurance
 
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately another part of our
 
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
statutes and that is 408 a9 indicates
 
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
that anyone selling credit insurance
 
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
must have a license there's a clear
 
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
conflict in the law the practice that
 
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
the department has meant to not require
 
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
of course under 406 c that a financial
 
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
institution have a license and this
 
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
change in the statute this third change
 
00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
would eliminate that current conflict in
 
00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
the law
 
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
the the fourth and final change
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
would make a change to the requirement
 
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
right now for designated responsible
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
licensed producers or persons drlps
 
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
and those are people that are identified
 
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
as the person responsible for an
 
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
entity's compliance with insurance law
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
so if an entity is producing selling
 
00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
insurance they need to have a person who
 
00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
is licensed who is responsible for that
 
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
entity's compliance with the law
 
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
currently under the law there's no
 
00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 align:start position:0%
requirement that that individual who is
 
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
responsible for the entity's compliance
 
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
be licensed in the same lines that the
 
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
entity is which is an issue because you
 
00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
could have a producer an insurance agent
 
00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
who may be licensed to sell auto
 
00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
insurance who could be named as a drlp
 
00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 align:start position:0%
for an entity that's selling life
 
00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:31.759 align:start position:0%
insurance and that person who is
 
00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
licensed cell auto does not know life
 
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
and really how can they be responsible
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
for the compliance for that entity so
 
00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
this change would just make it so that
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
the person or persons identified as the
 
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
drlp for that entity be licensed in the
 
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
lines that that entity is selling
 
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer any questions any me
 
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
we do have questions
 
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
representative van halen thank you good
 
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
morning and thank you for your testimony
 
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
i just have a
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
clarification for my own
 
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
sensibility i guess under the good cause
 
00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
limitations or not limited to uh the
 
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
last one roman 12
 
00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't directly deal with insurance as
 
00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
do the others it deals with
 
00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:16.710 align:start position:0%
do the others it deals with
um

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
court imposing child support obligation
 
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
and a violation thereof um that just
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
seems unusual all the others are related
 
00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:25.039 align:start position:0%
to insurance i'm wondering why that
 
00:08:25.039 --> 00:08:26.390 align:start position:0%
to insurance i'm wondering why that
exists

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
exists
 
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
that's a direct corollary representative
 
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
producer law
 
00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
where we have the same powers on the
 
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
producer law to bring action against an
 
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
entity who has failed to to a person
 
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
rather you know who has failed to pay a
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
child support order
 
00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
the grounds for that
 
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
i'm really not best to speak to the
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
actual grounds for that i believe it's
 
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
probably because it comes from a model
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:55.600 align:start position:0%

molillo legislative aid for senator

00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
introducing senate bill 204 and an
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
amendment to sb 204 at the request of
 
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
the insurance department to further
 
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
modify the definition of covered claim
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
in the new hampshire insurance guarantee
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
association act
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
the guaranty association was established
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
to protect property and casualty
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
policyholders from unfunded losses and
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
ensure that their claims are paid should
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
will be paid by the association and
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
policies originally issued by a
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
non-member will not be covered by the
 
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
association regardless of what company
 
00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
has responsibility for the policy at the
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
time of the claim
 
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
the controlling issue is who issued the
 
00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
original policy a member or non-member
 
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment to sb 204 helps further
 
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
clarify the issue the insurance industry
 
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
supports these changes
 
00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
and heather silverstein
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
is here from the insurance department to
 
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you may have
 
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much
 
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:08.710 align:start position:0%
okay uh
heather

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
heather
 
00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.510 align:start position:0%
heather
so

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
no doug
 
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:18.799 align:start position:0%
he was the good morning
 
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
he was originally supposed to be the
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
neic meeting so maybe he just thought
 
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.590 align:start position:0%
neic meeting so maybe he just thought
that

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:31.029 --> 00:18:31.039 align:start position:0%
so this this change is uh and including
 
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
the amendment is just to further clarify
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
um this obligation you know what happens
 
00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
if companies go into liquidation at some
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
point down the road and who has um
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the claims under
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
particular policy and we just wanted to
 
00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
clarify in our law
 
00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
it's who
 
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
as long as there was a met it was a
 
00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.350 align:start position:0%
as long as there was a met it was a
member

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
member
 
00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
um that issued the policy then that
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
policy would be covered regardless if
 
00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:03.039 align:start position:0%
there was changes later um
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
with regard to the policy being owned or
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
you know uh under the control of a
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
different company later
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
and this came about because there has
 
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
been confusion in other states
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
and that have led to issues and we
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
didn't want that to happen in our state
 
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
okay any questions
 
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
yep representative abel
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
um are there any uh situations in which
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
a policyholder in new hampshire would
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
not have someone
 
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
making you know
 
00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:39.990 align:start position:0%
making you know
uh

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
covering them
 
00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.549 align:start position:0%
covering them
um

00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
i mean uh
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
do we have to worry about anybody
 
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh any
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
individual policyholders who would not
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
be covered by this not for licensed
 
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
companies not for licensed vnc companies
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's more of like a if a non-licensed
 
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
company got the policy down the road and
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
then you know so the idea is these
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
license companies they pay into the
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
guaranty fund they support it and so
 
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
it's also consistency with that it's the
 
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
companies that are paying in those
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
policies should be covered later
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
most policies would be covered in new
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
hampshire because they'd be like delayed
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
the company would be licensed but if for
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
some reason it passed to a non-licensed
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:26.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%

request of the insurance department to
 
00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
modify the way the department manages
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
their administration fund when there's
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
an overage at the beginning of the new
 
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
current language stipulates any overage
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
to be calculated as a pro rata offset a
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
portion to each individual insurer based
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%

fund
 
00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
the changes proposed by sb 205 will
 
00:30:30.389 --> 00:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
allow for any overage to be generally
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
applied to reduce future assessments
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
across the board
 
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:36.080 align:start position:0%

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
statute for the department of labor and
 
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:39.919 align:start position:0%

00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0%

i would say you could look to stock it
 
00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
you're just
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%

with heather silva's team who's the
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
general counsel at the department um
 
00:47:17.589 --> 00:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
this uh bill senate bill 206 actually
 
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
has uh two pieces one piece is the
 
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
consumer guarantee a little closer to
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
the money i'm sorry
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
one piece is the consumer guarantee
 
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
contract piece um that senator french
 
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned and then there's also an
 
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
amendment to add a piece about the
 
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
department's uh investigation uh statute
 
00:47:35.589 --> 00:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
400 a16 and that's what um general
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
counsel silverstein will discuss so i'm
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
only here for the consumer guarantee
 
00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
contract piece
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
as uh senator french
 
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
noted uh the consumer guarantee contract
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh law
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
is was designed for him and handles
 
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
service contracts and also some people
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
call them um extended warranties that's
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
the thing when you buy an item at a
 
00:47:58.470 --> 00:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
store they say would you like an
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
extended warranty or if you buy a car
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
they say would you like an extended
 
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
warranty um that is how what the law in
 
00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
my opinion was designed for and it works
 
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
very well for that and we regulate that
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
and we
 
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
help consumers understand their rights
 
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
under those contracts um but uh in
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
addition to that also what was added to
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
that law was a prepaid legal contracts
 
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
and those are contracts where
 
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
you um you may have seen them on on
 
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
television you like legal zoom you you
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
enter into a contract and then if you
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
have some legal questions uh you can uh
 
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
call and they'll provide you with a
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
lawyer to answer some simple legal
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
questions now in that area
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
i've been with the department 10 years
 
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
we've never had one complaint that we've
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
handled as to those issues
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
and also are really our only role in
 
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
that at this point is we occasionally
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
have a company ask us if their
 
00:48:52.549 --> 00:48:52.559 align:start position:0%
particular contract falls within our law
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
or doesn't fall within our law
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
which sometimes is a little bit
 
00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
difficult to answer because the current
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
statute is very subjective like
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
if they can answer simple questions then
 
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
there's always a question what's a
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
simple question so um
 
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
you know and so basically after
 
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
consideration by the department it felt
 
00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:12.559 align:start position:0%
like our our resources were better spent
 
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
on the more emerging actual insurance
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
products that are coming out uh because
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
they're actually getting much more uh
 
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
high tech let's call it so their reviews
 
00:49:24.549 --> 00:49:24.559 align:start position:0%
getting more extensive and to to remove
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
this particular uh product from uh the
 
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:30.559 align:start position:0%
consumer guarantee uh statute because
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's in the department's uh
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
opinion not something that we need to
 
00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.470 align:start position:0%
opinion not something that we need to
regulate

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
regulate
 
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
um to protect consumers
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
obviously at some point in time if there
 
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
was if there were a problem in the
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
future we would reconsider that position
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
but at this point after over a decade we
 
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
don't feel it's necessary now the other
 
00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
piece of the consumer guarantee contract
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
part of the bill that we are asking to
 
00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
have included
 
00:49:55.359 --> 00:49:56.870 align:start position:0%
have included
is

00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:49:58.790 --> 00:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
something called pro rata return so if
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
you have say you have an automobile
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
policy um and you you pay um
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
geico for six months uh then you decide
 
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
to cancel it halfway through you get
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
half your money back that's a pro rata
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
return um that is how it operates in
 
00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
pers almost all personal lines except if
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
you have like a short term policy uh
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
then like you're you're
 
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
getting insurance for an uh like an
 
00:50:23.829 --> 00:50:23.839 align:start position:0%
event or or a
 
00:50:25.109 --> 00:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
trip then it's a little different
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
because the risk is not spread out over
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
that full period of time so those we
 
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
don't require to be pro rata um we
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
didn't have that in the consumer
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
guarantee contract um and we thought we
 
00:50:37.349 --> 00:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
and we had some um insurance companies
 
00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
that were not insurance companies some
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
consumer guarantee company contract
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
companies who were
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
balking at the parata idea but most of
 
00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
them do it so the thought was to just
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
put it in the law that
 
00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
you have to do it pro rata if
 
00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:52.470 align:start position:0%
you have to do it pro rata if
it's

00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
a contract that's a year
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
uh or more and then what they're a lot
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
what we allow them to do because they
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
said well there is a cost to our you
 
00:51:01.109 --> 00:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
know processing these things is that
 
00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
they can have
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
10 of the contract price but with a cap
 
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
of 75
 
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
for two in essence to to minister the
 
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
the cancellation and then the rest goes
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
back to the consumer and that is um
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
generally how it works uh in
 
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.270 align:start position:0%
generally how it works uh in
um

00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
regular insurance we allow fees as long
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
as they're reasonable we felt this was a
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
reasonable fee so we thought this would
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
um end the issue of what the return
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
should be and we wouldn't have
 
00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:32.559 align:start position:0%
complaints about like i got an extended
 
00:51:32.559 --> 00:51:33.670 align:start position:0%
complaints about like i got an extended
warranty

00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
warranty
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
for my car and i you know i sold my car
 
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
fairly shortly thereafter so i don't
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
need it and i'm having trouble getting
 
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
my money back
 
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
um so now we can point to a law and say
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
you have to do it and ends the
 
00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:46.150 align:start position:0%
you have to do it and ends the
discussion

00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
so those are the two consumer guarantee
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
contract issues and i'll let heather
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:59.430 --> 00:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
good morning again
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
so the amendment that we would like
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
for our statute 400 a16 which is
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
pertaining to investigations that the
 
00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
department does
 
00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
currently the statute
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
requires it states that the commissioner
 
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
shall adopt rules pursuant to 541a
 
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
to identify documents obtained during a
 
00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:21.829 align:start position:0%
to identify documents obtained during a
consumer

00:52:21.829 --> 00:52:21.839 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
investigation of the department
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
that potentially could be disclosed to a
 
00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:27.510 align:start position:0%
that potentially could be disclosed to a
consumer

00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
that is really a
 
00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.430 align:start position:0%
that is really a
difficult

00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
language for us it's requiring us to
 
00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
adopt those rules where we the amendment
 
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
we would like was to be as may be
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
necessary so if those rules are needed
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
then we could adopt those rules and we
 
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
have that in other statutes
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
at the current time there's not a
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
need to adopt those rules so we don't
 
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
want to be required to go through the
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
administrative process to drop rules
 
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
where it's not necessary
 
00:52:55.760 --> 00:53:02.630 align:start position:0%
where it's not necessary
so

00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
okay any questions from
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
yeah representative abel
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you for your testimony um
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
if uh the um
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
if the prepaid legal contract
 
00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
is no longer uh
 
00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.549 align:start position:0%
is no longer uh
um

00:53:24.549 --> 00:53:24.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
part of you're not overseeing those
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
where would a consumer go to uh
 
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
to contact someone in the state about a
 
00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:34.950 align:start position:0%
to contact someone in the state about a
problem

00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question and i
 
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
actually was supposed to say that but i
 
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
forgot to
 
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
so there's i wrote there's really three
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
options one we're talking about
 
00:53:44.549 --> 00:53:44.559 align:start position:0%
attorneys so you go to the bar
 
00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
association if you have a complaint
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
about an attorney and that scares any
 
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
attorney more than anything else in the
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
world uh way more than insurance
 
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
department would uh other one the next
 
00:53:54.069 --> 00:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
one is you could have you bring a
 
00:53:56.309 --> 00:53:56.319 align:start position:0%
contract claim against the company and
 
00:53:58.230 --> 00:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
then the last one is it would then in
 
00:53:59.670 --> 00:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
the department's opinion fall back to
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection act so that
 
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
remember there was some time when they
 
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
went back and forth did what's the
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
latest with the the bar association
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
being under the consumer protection act
 
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
because i know at one point in time they
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
were in and lawyers were out learners
 
00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
are in i don't know what what is the
 
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
current status of that yeah you know i'm
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
not sure about the current status but if
 
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
you actually if you if you look at so
 
00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
you would get a lawyer but
 
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
these are really companies that are
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
providing you with lawyers so you could
 
00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
even if the lawyers write i think you go
 
00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
after the company itself like that they
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
didn't provide you the look so they're
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
basically saying they're going to
 
00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
provide you a lawyer
 
00:54:38.309 --> 00:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
or they're gonna or they're gonna they
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
have a lawyer they're gonna pay you
 
00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
money to get a lawyer so um
 
00:54:43.349 --> 00:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
if you wanna go after the lawyer you
 
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
definitely go to the bar association and
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
if you wanna go after the company i
 
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
think you go after the consumer
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
protection act and maybe with the lawyer
 
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
you go after both i'm not sure
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
but there is a an exemption on the
 
00:54:56.069 --> 00:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act for insurance so
 
00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
this is sort of like right so that that
 
00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
gap just to make sure that if there was
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
some laps somewhere there you would end
 
00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
the day you would be on the insurance
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
departments right that's always in and
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
you know that's always how how we we
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
look at things is okay when we regulate
 
00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.190 align:start position:0%
look at things is okay when we regulate
it

00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:55:12.789 --> 00:55:12.799 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of exemptions then that's
 
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
what we do and then if we don't well
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
where does it fall so that's always was
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
part of the process of making sure that
 
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
consumers to the extent there were
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
problems would be protected
 
00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:22.390 align:start position:0%
problems would be protected
perfect

00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
yes represent van halen thank you and
 
00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming before us this
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
morning i have a question about the
 
00:55:30.309 --> 00:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
amendment if i may please
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
um the quest the question relates to
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
language and i understand that this new
 
00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:35.510 align:start position:0%
language and i understand that this new
language

00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
and the third they're not numbered but
 
00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799 align:start position:0%
the third line down the sentence begins
 
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
the commissioner shall adopt rules
 
00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:42.549 align:start position:0%
the commissioner shall adopt rules
pursuant

00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:42.559 align:start position:0%
pursuant
 
00:55:44.789 --> 00:55:44.799 align:start position:0%
and then it says as may be necessary is
 
00:55:47.109 --> 00:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
there a conflict between the word shall
 
00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
and the words as may be necessary they
 
00:55:52.789 --> 00:55:52.799 align:start position:0%
seem to be shell is like must and as may
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
be necessary as yeah maybe
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
no so we have this in other statutes as
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
well as to our rulemaking authority so
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
we shall adopt them as made me necessary
 
00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
so it's if there's a need for the rules
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
then we would adopt and so that gives us
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
the flexibility rather than we have to
 
00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
adopt rules when there's no need to
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
adopt rules and nobody wants us to adopt
 
00:56:15.599 --> 00:56:18.069 align:start position:0%
adopt rules and nobody wants us to adopt
rules

00:56:18.069 --> 00:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
sort of sounds like a chicken in the
 
00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:20.630 align:start position:0%
sort of sounds like a chicken in the
yang

00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
yang
 
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
you want to have the child to tell you
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
you have to do something
 
00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
and then you have the may says oh well
 
00:56:29.589 --> 00:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
nobody really feels a need for it so we
 
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
don't have to do it versus is just
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
taking the shower and say may up front
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
is someone might say is
 
00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
the department wants to make the rules
 
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
and say well you don't have to and then
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
they get bogged down and arguing about
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
why they don't have to where in this
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
case you're saying the the
 
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
represent van gaal thank you just a
 
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up
 
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
um is there a definition for necessary
 
00:56:59.109 --> 00:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
in this context i understand the word
 
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
necessary but in this context is there a
 
00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:02.870 align:start position:0%
necessary but in this context is there a
definition

00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
definition
 
00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
and i don't mean to put you on the spot
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
at all i'm just trying to understand
 
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
this no but typically i mean i look at
 
00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
it practically you know is there some
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
reason um like for a consumer protection
 
00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
related reason or the licensee also for
 
00:57:18.549 --> 00:57:18.559 align:start position:0%
our licensees is there some reason that
 
00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
further regulate
 
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
these these investigations are these are
 
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
our insurance products and so that i use
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
i view it and i think most of us at the
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
department would view it that way too
 
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:41.589 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:43.440 align:start position:0%

and
 
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
we are here in to speak in
 
00:58:41.829 --> 00:58:41.839 align:start position:0%
support of this bill and particularly
 
00:58:44.309 --> 00:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
section two which relates to the refunds
 
00:58:44.319 --> 00:58:45.349 align:start position:0%
section two which relates to the refunds
that

00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
james had mentioned earlier and
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
part of the discussion about this
 
00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
amendment was uh when its first
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
iteration it was just strictly everyone
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
had to issue refunds
 
00:58:59.910 --> 00:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
and um we
 
00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:00.950 align:start position:0%
and um we
mentioned

00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
to the department that you know these
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
contracts aren't all uniform they have
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
different durations and as james
 
00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
explained you know there's a lot of them
 
00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
that are written month to month and are
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
kind of low dollar amounts so
 
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
you know this is actually the biggest
 
00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
industry here is
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
service line contracts utility line
 
00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:18.470 align:start position:0%
service line contracts utility line
contracts

00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
to you know between that serve take care
 
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
service lines between the water and
 
00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%
sewer lines between someone's house and
 
00:59:27.589 --> 00:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
the and that's you
 
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
municipality service line and those are
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
typically a few dollars a month
 
00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
um and then you have
 
00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
service contracts that are longer
 
00:59:38.549 --> 00:59:38.559 align:start position:0%
duration that's typically auto service
 
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
contracts and you know equipment service
 
00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
contracts and as james said those are
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
higher dollar amounts so in the context
 
00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
of this discussion we we discussed the
 
00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:51.829 align:start position:0%
of this discussion we we discussed the
uh

00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
the way of addressing the distinction
 
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
through this
 
00:59:57.990 --> 00:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
through uh requiring the refund only for
 
00:59:59.910 --> 00:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
12-month contracts and allowing for
 
01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
administrative charge and
 
01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:02.789 align:start position:0%
administrative charge and
this

01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:02.799 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
bill currently balances those interests
 
01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
quite well and we support this bill as
 
01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.190 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
what james had mentioned earlier
 
01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
or on the way over is i think there
 
01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
no i'm sorry
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
yeah in line 22
 
01:00:30.309 --> 01:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
or 24 i didn't have it in front of me
 
01:00:32.549 --> 01:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
because there's a misreference in one or
 
01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
two so
 
01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:35.839 align:start position:0%
i think there's a subcommittee tomorrow
 
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
i think the department will be able to
 
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
point which one i got which one it is by
 
01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:42.710 align:start position:0%
point which one i got which one it is by
tomorrow

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:43.990 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
so

01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
that's it's just there's
 
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
i think the roman numeral two
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
in roman numeral one on line 22 the
 
01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
so anyway we'll we'll have that nailed
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
well it'd be nice if we can get it
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
solved today so that we'll know when we
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
take up the amen when we take up this
 
01:01:10.319 --> 01:01:12.150 align:start position:0%
take up the amen when we take up this
amendment

01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
we'll solve it today
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
okay so and kristen behind you is who
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:21.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
you gotta jump all right
 
01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
okay otherwise otherwise we would have
 
01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
to have another subcommittee so it would
 
01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
be nice to have the amendment correct
 
01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise for tomorrow we can figure
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
that right now soon okay great
 
01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
so make sure i understand this when
 
01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
you're talking about
 
01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
i have
 
01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh um
 
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
when we get our new cell phones
 
01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
and we get this i know that this
 
01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
legislation was related to this way back
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
when at some point in time i think like
 
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
i was the sponsor of it
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
and uh so the
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
changing to 12 months so when i
 
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
sign up when i get my new phone and i
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
sign up for the service contract it it
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
they bill me
 
01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:04.789 align:start position:0%
they bill me
monthly

01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
but have i really signed up for a
 
01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:09.039 align:start position:0%
contract that's more than two years
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
or more than a year or they might you
 
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
know what whatever the length of the
 
01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:14.309 align:start position:0%
know what whatever the length of the
purchase

01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
purchase
 
01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:16.799 align:start position:0%
so you'd have to you know you have to
 
01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:18.839 align:start position:0%
know exactly when you signed
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
up but certainly you know there are
 
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
there are certainly um service contracts
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
that are uh
 
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
a year or more of duration that are
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
billed monthly i don't think that
 
01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.270 align:start position:0%
billed monthly i don't think that
yeah

01:02:31.270 --> 01:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
so this since this would focus is on the
 
01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
duration of the contract
 
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay so i just need to make sure it
 
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
it it really is a long is it for the
 
01:02:44.069 --> 01:02:44.079 align:start position:0%
life of it right until uh
 
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
i paid off the phone right which is the
 
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
way it's sort of sold as but i never
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
it is true i've never read the fine
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
print there's a big booklet that comes
 
01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:54.559 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:02:54.559 --> 01:02:56.230 align:start position:0%
with that
okay

01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the community
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
remember seeing them thank you very much
 
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh i have no more cards
 
01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:04.470 align:start position:0%
uh i have no more cards
and

01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
the blue sheets
 
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
i got uh joan
 
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
vaginal is still here new hampshire
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
insurance agent still in support
 
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.309 align:start position:0%
insurance agent still in support
and

01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
senator kavanaugh and senator susie
 
01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
senator carson and senator reagan are
 
01:03:24.549 --> 01:03:24.559 align:start position:0%
all in support
 
01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:26.079 align:start position:0%
evidently the senators are taking
 
01:03:28.829 --> 01:03:28.839 align:start position:0%
advantage of our online
 
01:03:28.839 --> 01:03:30.630 align:start position:0%
advantage of our online
system

01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
more than we'd probably take advantage
 
01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
of theirs well that's right they don't
 
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
okay seeing a number of cards and we'll
 
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:48.950 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:52.799 --> 01:04:59.430 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
okay we'll open up the public hearing on
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
senate bill 207 and hear from the prime
 
01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor senator french
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
good morning again senator french
 
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
once again good morning to the committee
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
for the record i still am
 
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
senator harold french senator for
 
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
district 7.
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
i'm here to introduce to you today
 
01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
senate bill 207 at the request of the
 
01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
insurance department to clarify that a
 
01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
company's cost of retaining an outside
 
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
expert for review
 
01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
of their annual statements will be
 
01:05:41.349 --> 01:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
credited towards their assessed
 
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
administrative fees for the subsequent
 
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
year only
 
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
the current language suggests such
 
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
credit may be carried over into future
 
01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal years but since this credit
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
pertains to an annual review cost the
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
practice is to apply only to the
 
01:05:59.750 --> 01:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
subsequent year
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
any future credit earned for costs
 
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
associated with future annual reviews
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
will likewise be applied only to the
 
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
year subsequent to the year such credit
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
is earned
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
the industry the insurance industry is
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
fine with this clarifying change and
 
01:06:18.309 --> 01:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
michelle heaton is here from the
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
insurance department to answer any
 
01:06:23.029 --> 01:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
questions you may have and as a side
 
01:06:23.039 --> 01:06:24.069 align:start position:0%
questions you may have and as a side
note

01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
note
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
it came out of committee 5-0
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
was put on consent and passed on a voice
 
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:30.870 align:start position:0%
was put on consent and passed on a voice
vote

01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair for doing your
 
01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:37.190 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair for doing your
homework

01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
homework
 
01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
for my committee members
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
so it could have been that the old days
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
the fees
 
01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
were such that that there was really a
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
carryover to multiple years and now the
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
fees are such that there isn't it could
 
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
be i mean
 
01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:59.270 --> 01:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
all right okay thank you very much thank
 
01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
you have a great day you too
 
01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
doug bartlett from the new hampshire
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:20.799 align:start position:0%
i'm the health law and policy legal
 
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
counsel and i have doug bartlett here as
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
well and he should be able to answer
 
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
your questions probably a little bit
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
better than i could
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.079 --> 01:07:35.430 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:07:38.309 --> 01:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
this section of the law was enacted to
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
be able to contract for analysis
 
01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
assistance if it was needed
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
the consultants would be paid for by the
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
insurance companies that they assisted
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
with the department's analysis
 
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
and those insurance companies would be
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
able to offset payments to these
 
01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
consultants with a credit to the
 
01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
administrative assessment
 
01:07:59.270 --> 01:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
this assessment is an assessment to pay
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
for the cost of the insurance department
 
01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
based on the amount of premiums an
 
01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
insurance company wrote in new hampshire
 
01:08:06.789 --> 01:08:06.799 align:start position:0%
and the total amount of the assessment
 
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
is not lowered by this this is added to
 
01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
the assessment and then taken back in so
 
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
we're not getting less money because we
 
01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
in the first year we did 47 had 47
 
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
companies and that's the little misnomer
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
that liberty mutual had 19 the hanover
 
01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
had seven
 
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh and this year uh
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
we only used 14 companies well for last
 
01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:39.759 align:start position:0%
year this year we are not using
 
01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
consultants we've been able to hire
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
three people
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
since two years ago and so we're all uh
 
01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
doing that all ourselves now
 
01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
so if in i i guess i just answer
 
01:08:53.189 --> 01:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
questions that anybody has any questions
 
01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
relating to how it works
 
01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
um let me just add one thing that a lot
 
01:09:00.070 --> 01:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
of these companies don't write much here
 
01:09:02.789 --> 01:09:02.799 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and so if it costs like
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
maybe four thousand dollars to do their
 
01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.630 align:start position:0%
maybe four thousand dollars to do their
analysis

01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
and and they write very little here it
 
01:09:11.110 --> 01:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
could take like 30 years
 
01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
to actually collect that
 
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's why we just said you know
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
this is we're doing it for this year
 
01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:20.799 align:start position:0%
this is the year that you can take the
 
01:09:20.799 --> 01:09:24.630 align:start position:0%
this is the year that you can take the
credit

01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:26.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
any other
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
i mean i guess
 
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
hiring of consultants because you're
 
01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
assuming that you don't
 
01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
have the expertise in-house for this
 
01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
okay this is an analysis we analyze all
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
of our domestic companies every year
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
and you build them ahead of time right
 
01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
you bill them for this analysis work no
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
no this is part of their
 
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
when they make their contribution
 
01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:56.950 align:start position:0%
when they make their contribution
assessment

01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
01:09:59.110 --> 01:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
if we don't hire consultants no we don't
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
build them that's part of the built-in
 
01:10:01.199 --> 01:10:02.470 align:start position:0%
build them that's part of the built-in
assessment

01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
right okay okay but if we if we need to
 
01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
hire experts and that it was brought on
 
01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
with basically you know we had a
 
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
ameri retired and we had two two right
 
01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
analysts die i mean
 
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
we just
 
01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
we just weren't ready and you know it
 
01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
was a one of these things when we just
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
had to do something because you know we
 
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:28.709 --> 01:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
we have to
 
01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
fit the schedule of the neic and all
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
states all 50 states have to do that and
 
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
there are certain time limits
 
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
especially for your annual analysis and
 
01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
you know we didn't hire them to do the
 
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
analysis we hired them as the first
 
01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
review uh
 
01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
i mean it just it was impossible
 
01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.030 align:start position:0%
i mean it just it was impossible
really

01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
we we couldn't have done it all
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
by june 1st
 
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
are we all set
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay have no cards nobody else wants to
 
01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:09.520 align:start position:0%

the request of the insurance department

regulates life insurance
 
03:03:39.030 --> 03:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
this rewrite project has been ongoing
 
03:03:40.469 --> 03:03:40.479 align:start position:0%
for a couple years
 
03:03:42.790 --> 03:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
in 2020 the department requested senate
 
03:03:46.710 --> 03:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
bill 664 that was stripped out and
 
03:03:48.469 --> 03:03:48.479 align:start position:0%
out the outdated and obsolete provisions
 
03:03:50.309 --> 03:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
of rsa 408
 
03:03:51.910 --> 03:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
that bill passed the senate on a voice
 
03:03:53.990 --> 03:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
boat but then was tabled in the house
 
03:03:57.190 --> 03:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
because of the when the pandemic hit
 
03:03:59.349 --> 03:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
the language proposed in senate bill 208
 
03:04:01.590 --> 03:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
not only strips out the old provisions
 
03:04:03.110 --> 03:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
but also revises the remaining
 
03:04:05.110 --> 03:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
provisions to bring them up to date
 
03:04:07.030 --> 03:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
resulting in a proposal to repeal and re
 
03:04:10.710 --> 03:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
reenact rsa 408
 
03:04:12.550 --> 03:04:12.560 align:start position:0%

hampshire's life insurance statute and
 
03:05:06.870 --> 03:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
to bring it into modern times the
 
03:05:10.150 --> 03:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
current 408 or rsa 408 contains several
 
03:05:11.990 --> 03:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
outdated provisions which were first
 
03:05:12.000 --> 03:05:13.349 align:start position:0%
outdated provisions which were first

03:05:13.349 --> 03:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
enacted
 
03:05:16.309 --> 03:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
as far back as 1850.
 
03:05:17.750 --> 03:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
the department originally sought to
 
03:05:17.760 --> 03:05:18.710 align:start position:0%
the department originally sought to
update

03:05:18.710 --> 03:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
update
 
03:05:21.670 --> 03:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
for rsa40i into two phases first by
 
03:05:23.349 --> 03:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
removing all the outdated and
 
03:05:25.429 --> 03:05:25.439 align:start position:0%
duplicative provisions
 
03:05:28.950 --> 03:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
and then the second phase would be to
 
03:05:30.389 --> 03:05:30.399 align:start position:0%
update and expand the remaining
 
03:05:32.870 --> 03:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
provisions as necessary
 
03:05:34.950 --> 03:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
as senator cavanaugh already let you
 
03:05:36.230 --> 03:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
know that
 
03:05:38.150 --> 03:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
first phase started going and then the
 
03:05:40.469 --> 03:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
pandemic kit so it got tabled and then
 
03:05:41.830 --> 03:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
we decided we're just going to do it all
 
03:05:44.230 --> 03:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
as one
 
03:05:44.240 --> 03:05:45.030 align:start position:0%
as one
one

03:05:45.030 --> 03:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:05:50.309 --> 03:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:51.670 --> 03:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
so since
 
03:05:54.309 --> 03:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
2020 we have now completed a proposal
 
03:05:56.389 --> 03:05:56.399 align:start position:0%
for updating and monitorizing the life
 
03:06:00.469 --> 03:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:02.389 --> 03:06:02.399 align:start position:0%
so this legend here that's being passed
 
03:06:04.309 --> 03:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
around because it's a complete repeal
 
03:06:07.750 --> 03:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
and re-enactment helps guide people the
 
03:06:10.469 --> 03:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
left-hand side is what the current 408
 
03:06:13.510 --> 03:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
is and then there's the re the reasons
 
03:06:15.990 --> 03:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
why it's either repealed or where it got
 
03:06:20.710 --> 03:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:23.670 --> 03:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
or how it's been amended as well
 
03:06:25.190 --> 03:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
so as you'll see a lot of the provisions
 
03:06:27.269 --> 03:06:27.279 align:start position:0%
have been repealed as they're either no
 
03:06:29.110 --> 03:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
longer necessary or they're covered by
 
03:06:32.309 --> 03:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
other statutes for example um
 
03:06:35.030 --> 03:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
there are the old 408.5 or the current
 
03:06:37.429 --> 03:06:37.439 align:start position:0%
408.5 relating to agents
 
03:06:39.830 --> 03:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
is we don't need that in 408 because
 
03:06:41.469 --> 03:06:41.479 align:start position:0%
it's already covered by
 
03:06:44.230 --> 03:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
rsa402j which is specific to insurance
 
03:06:45.750 --> 03:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
producers so there's a lot of
 
03:06:47.349 --> 03:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
duplicative provisions in the current
 
03:06:49.510 --> 03:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
408 right now so we want to move those
 
03:06:50.790 --> 03:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
out to make
 
03:06:52.790 --> 03:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
it easier for people to find because if
 
03:06:54.150 --> 03:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
you're looking at
 
03:06:56.230 --> 03:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
statutes relating to insurance producers
 
03:06:57.429 --> 03:06:57.439 align:start position:0%
you would not think to look in the
 
03:06:59.590 --> 03:06:59.600 align:start position:0%
insurance of the life insurance statute
 
03:07:04.389 --> 03:07:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:05.910 --> 03:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of things that have
 
03:07:07.910 --> 03:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
been repealed because they're in they're
 
03:07:11.269 --> 03:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
covered in other sections of the
 
03:07:13.670 --> 03:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
title 37 relating to insurance
 
03:07:15.590 --> 03:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
we've also for the stuff that's
 
03:07:17.190 --> 03:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
remaining we've also updated the
 
03:07:19.750 --> 03:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
language to bring it into modern times
 
03:07:21.110 --> 03:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
and some of the provisions that are
 
03:07:24.070 --> 03:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
based off of naic models we have also
 
03:07:25.910 --> 03:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
updated that language because the model
 
03:07:27.190 --> 03:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
may have been
 
03:07:30.389 --> 03:07:30.399 align:start position:0%
adopted you know 20 30 years ago and the
 
03:07:32.469 --> 03:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
model has since been amended we're just
 
03:07:34.870 --> 03:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
adding in that new language too so it
 
03:07:37.190 --> 03:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
better aligns with the current versions
 
03:07:41.190 --> 03:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:42.710 --> 03:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
so rather than walking through every
 
03:07:44.150 --> 03:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
single change that we've made because
 
03:07:46.230 --> 03:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
it's quite extensive i'd be happy to
 
03:07:49.030 --> 03:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
03:07:52.230 --> 03:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
okay yep representative paul
 
03:07:53.250 --> 03:07:53.260 align:start position:0%
no he's not here
 
03:07:53.260 --> 03:07:56.870 align:start position:0%
no he's not here
[Laughter]

03:07:56.870 --> 03:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:07:59.269 --> 03:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
depalma's not here
 
03:08:04.389 --> 03:08:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:06.469 --> 03:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
since you are utilizing this is a
 
03:08:08.870 --> 03:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
complete rewrite it sounds like from uh
 
03:08:11.510 --> 03:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
existing uh laws going back as far as
 
03:08:14.389 --> 03:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
1850 all right yes uh is is this
 
03:08:17.429 --> 03:08:17.439 align:start position:0%
primarily the nic model
 
03:08:19.750 --> 03:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
that you're using and i guess what i'm
 
03:08:21.510 --> 03:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
asking is would you would you be able to
 
03:08:24.240 --> 03:08:24.250 align:start position:0%
highlight any particular sections
 
03:08:24.250 --> 03:08:25.670 align:start position:0%
highlight any particular sections
[Music]

03:08:25.670 --> 03:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:08:25.680 --> 03:08:26.389 align:start position:0%
[Music]
of

03:08:26.389 --> 03:08:26.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:08:26.399 --> 03:08:27.990 align:start position:0%
of
this

03:08:27.990 --> 03:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:08:30.150 --> 03:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
of this bill that are new hampshire
 
03:08:30.160 --> 03:08:31.349 align:start position:0%
of this bill that are new hampshire
specific

03:08:31.349 --> 03:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
specific
 
03:08:34.710 --> 03:08:34.720 align:start position:0%
peculiar to new hampshire
 
03:08:38.710 --> 03:08:38.720 align:start position:0%
so there isn't an naic model that's just
 
03:08:41.429 --> 03:08:41.439 align:start position:0%
for life insurance okay and that would
 
03:08:41.439 --> 03:08:43.030 align:start position:0%
for life insurance okay and that would
be

03:08:43.030 --> 03:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:08:44.630 --> 03:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
that would incorporate everything that's
 
03:08:46.950 --> 03:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
in 408 there are multiple models that
 
03:08:48.870 --> 03:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
have been incorporated into different
 
03:08:51.429 --> 03:08:51.439 align:start position:0%
sections of 408 so for example there's a
 
03:08:54.790 --> 03:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
model about group life insurance so
 
03:08:57.190 --> 03:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
those provisions are included in our
 
03:09:01.030 --> 03:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
rewrite but that would only be one naic
 
03:09:04.950 --> 03:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
model so there are certain things um
 
03:09:07.030 --> 03:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to think like our form our
 
03:09:09.670 --> 03:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
form filings and review
 
03:09:12.469 --> 03:09:12.479 align:start position:0%
that's basically how most states operate
 
03:09:13.990 --> 03:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that there's necessarily an
 
03:09:16.550 --> 03:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
naic model on it so that might be a
 
03:09:18.150 --> 03:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
little bit specific some of those time
 
03:09:19.670 --> 03:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
periods could be specific to new
 
03:09:21.830 --> 03:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire um
 
03:09:24.229 --> 03:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
trying to think of something else
 
03:09:25.750 --> 03:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
there's various aspects of different
 
03:09:28.590 --> 03:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
models that get incorporated in here so
 
03:09:31.349 --> 03:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure which one quick follow for
 
03:09:32.229 --> 03:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
the question
 
03:09:34.469 --> 03:09:34.479 align:start position:0%
so there there's there's nothing here
 
03:09:36.469 --> 03:09:36.479 align:start position:0%
with reference to the reference
 
03:09:38.550 --> 03:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
materials that you
 
03:09:40.790 --> 03:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
utilized and
 
03:09:44.389 --> 03:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
incorporated into this rewrite
 
03:09:46.469 --> 03:09:46.479 align:start position:0%
that were either
 
03:09:48.870 --> 03:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
changed because
 
03:09:48.880 --> 03:09:50.070 align:start position:0%
changed because
uh

03:09:50.070 --> 03:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:09:53.750 --> 03:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire specific concerns
 
03:09:57.670 --> 03:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:00.870 --> 03:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
yes sir am i are you getting me
 
03:10:02.150 --> 03:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
kind of yeah
 
03:10:04.070 --> 03:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
here's another way putting this could
 
03:10:05.910 --> 03:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
could could this bill
 
03:10:08.790 --> 03:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
if if uh if if pennsylvania
 
03:10:10.389 --> 03:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
uh we're in the same position as new
 
03:10:12.150 --> 03:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire with respect to the need to do
 
03:10:14.229 --> 03:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
a rewrite which you acknowledge
 
03:10:14.239 --> 03:10:15.269 align:start position:0%
a rewrite which you acknowledge
uh

03:10:15.269 --> 03:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:10:17.670 --> 03:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
are there any substantial sections of
 
03:10:21.750 --> 03:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:24.229 --> 03:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
not knowing pennsylvania i would say no
 
03:10:25.190 --> 03:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
in that
 
03:10:27.429 --> 03:10:27.439 align:start position:0%
every every state their laws are
 
03:10:28.950 --> 03:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
slightly different
 
03:10:31.030 --> 03:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
we didn't change anything that was in
 
03:10:33.429 --> 03:10:33.439 align:start position:0%
408 to make it more new hampshire
 
03:10:35.190 --> 03:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
specific there could have been things
 
03:10:37.830 --> 03:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
that were already in 408 that we
 
03:10:40.630 --> 03:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
didn't take out
 
03:10:42.710 --> 03:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
but we may have tweaked it to better
 
03:10:44.630 --> 03:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
align with the national standard or with
 
03:10:46.790 --> 03:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
the naic guidelines
 
03:10:48.630 --> 03:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
okay there's nothing peculiar to new
 
03:10:48.640 --> 03:10:49.670 align:start position:0%
okay there's nothing peculiar to new
hampshire

03:10:49.670 --> 03:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:10:52.229 --> 03:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
no thank you
 
03:10:56.070 --> 03:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
and i would venture to say that you um
 
03:10:58.070 --> 03:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
because given that how much case law
 
03:10:59.030 --> 03:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
might be
 
03:11:01.429 --> 03:11:01.439 align:start position:0%
driven by the statute you really don't
 
03:11:02.870 --> 03:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
want to change
 
03:11:06.229 --> 03:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
anything in terms of actual legal
 
03:11:08.070 --> 03:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
process because you you don't want to
 
03:11:09.590 --> 03:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
upset the cart when it comes to the
 
03:11:11.750 --> 03:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
courts having to say we have to change
 
03:11:14.550 --> 03:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
it because it was changed by the statute
 
03:11:16.309 --> 03:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
no as we were going through the rewrite
 
03:11:18.229 --> 03:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
if there was something if there was some
 
03:11:19.750 --> 03:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
kind of case law and i'm not thinking of
 
03:11:22.550 --> 03:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
anything specific to 408 but had there
 
03:11:25.670 --> 03:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
been some kind of case law that um
 
03:11:28.229 --> 03:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
interpreted 408 in a particular way we
 
03:11:30.229 --> 03:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
may have clarified the language in 408
 
03:11:32.870 --> 03:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
to be consistent with what that
 
03:11:35.510 --> 03:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
legal precedent was right and i and i do

michelle

03:16:45.030 --> 03:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
michelle
 
03:16:47.030 --> 03:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
eaton from the insurance department who
 
03:16:50.630 --> 03:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:52.309 --> 03:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
hi again michelle heaton from the new
 
03:16:53.750 --> 03:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire insurance department i'm the
 
03:16:56.150 --> 03:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
health law and policy legal counsel
 
03:16:59.030 --> 03:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
and to answer your question this bill is
 
03:17:02.550 --> 03:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
amending the registration requirements
 
03:17:05.429 --> 03:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
for um discount medical plans can you
 
03:17:07.510 --> 03:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
explain what that is a discount medical
 
03:17:10.229 --> 03:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
plan yeah so these are not insurance
 
03:17:13.110 --> 03:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
these are um discount plans where a
 
03:17:15.269 --> 03:17:15.279 align:start position:0%
person could either
 
03:17:18.229 --> 03:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
subscribe pay a monthly fee join some
 
03:17:21.190 --> 03:17:21.200 align:start position:0%
app something like that and in doing so
 
03:17:23.510 --> 03:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
they would have access to
 
03:17:26.309 --> 03:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
potential discounts on health services
 
03:17:29.190 --> 03:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
so for example common one would be a
 
03:17:31.349 --> 03:17:31.359 align:start position:0%
drug discount plan and you've probably
 
03:17:33.349 --> 03:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
seen commercials for these on tv where
 
03:17:34.870 --> 03:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
you know you have this app or you pay
 
03:17:34.880 --> 03:17:35.670 align:start position:0%
you know you have this app or you pay
this

03:17:35.670 --> 03:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:17:37.750 --> 03:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
fee of five dollars a month and when you
 
03:17:40.229 --> 03:17:40.239 align:start position:0%
go to the pharmacy you can show them
 
03:17:42.630 --> 03:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
this card and you may get a better
 
03:17:44.150 --> 03:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
discount than what you would get with
 
03:17:46.389 --> 03:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
your insurance so my
 
03:17:46.399 --> 03:17:47.349 align:start position:0%
your insurance so my
my

03:17:47.349 --> 03:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
my
 
03:17:48.870 --> 03:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
my farm is just reached over the counter
 
03:17:50.710 --> 03:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
and just grabs his card and hands it to
 
03:17:52.830 --> 03:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
me yeah submerged to
 
03:17:55.510 --> 03:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
that okay so that's what we're talking
 
03:17:57.030 --> 03:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
about these those people
 
03:17:59.349 --> 03:17:59.359 align:start position:0%
yes okay yes
 
03:18:01.990 --> 03:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
so and they're not insurance because
 
03:18:04.070 --> 03:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
there is no risk you're not guaranteed
 
03:18:06.150 --> 03:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
any discount and some of these services
 
03:18:07.510 --> 03:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
are available
 
03:18:09.429 --> 03:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
without ever actually collecting any
 
03:18:11.990 --> 03:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
money from patients or clients or
 
03:18:12.000 --> 03:18:13.750 align:start position:0%
money from patients or clients or
consumers

03:18:13.750 --> 03:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
03:18:16.150 --> 03:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
they're available to anyone
 
03:18:17.429 --> 03:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
so what we're trying to do with this
 
03:18:18.870 --> 03:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
bill is just make sure that these
 
03:18:21.110 --> 03:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
organizations have minimal minimum
 
03:18:24.790 --> 03:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:26.309 --> 03:18:26.319 align:start position:0%
and that if they
 
03:18:27.910 --> 03:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
are no longer solvent we have the
 
03:18:30.630 --> 03:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
ability to revoke their registration to
 
03:18:35.030 --> 03:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:35.040 --> 03:18:37.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:18:37.990 --> 03:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:39.830 --> 03:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative terry thank you mr
 
03:18:39.840 --> 03:18:41.030 align:start position:0%
representative terry thank you mr
chairman

03:18:41.030 --> 03:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:18:44.150 --> 03:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh so do i understand that now to get
 
03:18:46.309 --> 03:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
very specific here with an example
 
03:18:49.429 --> 03:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
um i have a good rx a discount card for
 
03:18:51.429 --> 03:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
pharmacy there currently there's no
 
03:18:51.439 --> 03:18:52.950 align:start position:0%
pharmacy there currently there's no
regulation

03:18:52.950 --> 03:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
03:18:55.990 --> 03:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
of good rx but under this statute there
 
03:18:58.630 --> 03:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
would now be regulation of good rx and
 
03:19:00.469 --> 03:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
similar entities
 
03:19:02.229 --> 03:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
so we do already regulate discount
 
03:19:05.190 --> 03:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
medical plans we have
 
03:19:07.990 --> 03:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
we adopted the model the naic model
 
03:19:09.510 --> 03:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
number 98
 
03:19:12.150 --> 03:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
relating to discount medical plans and
 
03:19:13.950 --> 03:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
the chapter
 
03:19:16.710 --> 03:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
rsa415i is specific to discount medical
 
03:19:18.469 --> 03:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
plans what we're doing here is we're
 
03:19:20.229 --> 03:19:20.239 align:start position:0%
only changing the registration
 
03:19:21.990 --> 03:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
requirements to put in some minimum
 
03:19:22.000 --> 03:19:23.670 align:start position:0%
requirements to put in some minimum
standards

03:19:23.670 --> 03:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
standards
 
03:19:25.830 --> 03:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
so in order now if this were to pass in
 
03:19:28.229 --> 03:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
order to get this registration you would
 
03:19:31.510 --> 03:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:33.269 --> 03:19:33.279 align:start position:0%
as part of the registration process we
 
03:19:34.950 --> 03:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
would be asking whether your
 
03:19:37.110 --> 03:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
registration had been suspended denied
 
03:19:39.190 --> 03:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
revoked in any other jurisdiction if
 
03:19:40.950 --> 03:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
you're under investigation in any other
 
03:19:40.960 --> 03:19:42.630 align:start position:0%
you're under investigation in any other
jurisdiction

03:19:42.630 --> 03:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
03:19:46.389 --> 03:19:46.399 align:start position:0%
um and then we'd also ask them to
 
03:19:48.950 --> 03:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
present evidence showing a network
 
03:19:52.469 --> 03:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
net worth of at least 150 000
 
03:19:53.590 --> 03:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
so we're just putting in these
 
03:19:55.670 --> 03:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
additional requirements to make sure
 
03:19:57.830 --> 03:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
that these types of plans
 
03:20:01.190 --> 03:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
are solvent and are not operating in a
 
03:20:06.469 --> 03:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:08.229 --> 03:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
representative mack later
 
03:20:09.830 --> 03:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:20:11.429 --> 03:20:11.439 align:start position:0%
a question a couple of questions if you
 
03:20:12.790 --> 03:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
don't mind how many of these
 
03:20:14.309 --> 03:20:14.319 align:start position:0%
organizations do we have in new
 
03:20:16.469 --> 03:20:16.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire right now do you know
 
03:20:18.469 --> 03:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
i do not know but i can get back to you
 
03:20:19.510 --> 03:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
on that
 
03:20:21.830 --> 03:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
and second question so this really has
 
03:20:24.229 --> 03:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the
 
03:20:26.550 --> 03:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
with what they offer it really has to do
 
03:20:28.630 --> 03:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
with the organization itself is that
 
03:20:28.640 --> 03:20:29.990 align:start position:0%
with the organization itself is that
correct

03:20:29.990 --> 03:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:20:32.229 --> 03:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
how they're structured and and the fact
 
03:20:33.830 --> 03:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
that they're financially
 
03:20:35.830 --> 03:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
sound as opposed to
 
03:20:37.670 --> 03:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
you you have to if you're going to offer
 
03:20:39.269 --> 03:20:39.279 align:start position:0%
this you got to be it's going to look
 
03:20:41.110 --> 03:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
like that or there's nothing to do with
 
03:20:43.190 --> 03:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
that as i understand it
 
03:20:45.110 --> 03:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
this amendment is only talking about the
 
03:20:47.510 --> 03:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
financial regulations but overall the
 
03:20:49.910 --> 03:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
chapter there are regulations okay about
 
03:20:52.469 --> 03:20:52.479 align:start position:0%
how you advertise and there has to be
 
03:20:55.030 --> 03:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
disclaimers the the concern that comes
 
03:20:56.550 --> 03:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
about with these is we don't want these
 
03:20:58.950 --> 03:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
types of plans being marketed as being
 
03:21:00.389 --> 03:21:00.399 align:start position:0%
health insurance
 
03:21:02.229 --> 03:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
or having similar benefits to health
 
03:21:04.150 --> 03:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
insurance and sometimes they can be
 
03:21:05.910 --> 03:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
marketed in a way that would confuse
 
03:21:07.510 --> 03:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
consumers so the reason we have this
 
03:21:09.590 --> 03:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
statute is to make sure that to the
 
03:21:11.349 --> 03:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
extent these entities are operating in
 
03:21:13.429 --> 03:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
new hampshire they're meeting those
 
03:21:15.110 --> 03:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
requirements that there's proper
 
03:21:16.550 --> 03:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
disclosures so that there is no
 
03:21:19.110 --> 03:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
confusion with whether this is medical
 
03:21:21.030 --> 03:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
insurance and what it's going to cover
 
03:21:22.710 --> 03:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
and that there is no guarantee this is
 
03:21:29.110 --> 03:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:29.120 --> 03:21:34.950 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:21:34.950 --> 03:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:37.030 --> 03:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and my
 
03:21:41.590 --> 03:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
question um and and see the commissioner
 
03:21:41.600 --> 03:21:43.990 align:start position:0%
question um and and see the commissioner
um

03:21:43.990 --> 03:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:46.469 --> 03:21:46.479 align:start position:0%
can get information um that would help
 
03:21:48.229 --> 03:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
him make his decision but
 
03:21:49.429 --> 03:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
number three
 
03:21:51.590 --> 03:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
he's judging whether someone is of good
 
03:21:54.150 --> 03:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
character and i question what does that
 
03:21:56.630 --> 03:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
mean and how would that determination be
 
03:21:56.640 --> 03:21:58.070 align:start position:0%
mean and how would that determination be
made

03:21:58.070 --> 03:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
made
 
03:22:00.630 --> 03:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
so the good character is um the type of
 
03:22:02.150 --> 03:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
provision we do have in some of our
 
03:22:03.910 --> 03:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
other registration licensing
 
03:22:03.920 --> 03:22:06.150 align:start position:0%
other registration licensing
requirements

03:22:06.150 --> 03:22:06.160 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
03:22:08.870 --> 03:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
what that generally includes is that
 
03:22:11.030 --> 03:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
there would be background checks for the
 
03:22:11.040 --> 03:22:12.710 align:start position:0%
there would be background checks for the
um

03:22:12.710 --> 03:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:14.550 --> 03:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
the board of directors or whoever is
 
03:22:16.950 --> 03:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
running running this entity and that the
 
03:22:19.830 --> 03:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
reason we have those in place is because
 
03:22:21.190 --> 03:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
people who have
 
03:22:23.190 --> 03:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
engaged in fraudulent activities in
 
03:22:25.269 --> 03:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
other states with other entities we
 
03:22:27.269 --> 03:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
don't want them just establishing this
 
03:22:29.269 --> 03:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
new entity and coming into our state and
 
03:22:31.590 --> 03:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
potentially doing something like that so
 
03:22:33.269 --> 03:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
it's usually one of the requirements we
 
03:22:33.279 --> 03:22:34.389 align:start position:0%
it's usually one of the requirements we
have

03:22:34.389 --> 03:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:22:37.110 --> 03:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that those bad actors
 
03:22:38.229 --> 03:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
are not allowed to do that in new
 
03:22:39.910 --> 03:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire follow-up
 
03:22:41.670 --> 03:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
for the question may inquire
 
03:22:41.680 --> 03:22:43.030 align:start position:0%
for the question may inquire
um

03:22:43.030 --> 03:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:45.429 --> 03:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we spell that out because
 
03:22:47.349 --> 03:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
i totally understand what you're saying
 
03:22:49.910 --> 03:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
and i think it's good um but we don't
 
03:22:52.309 --> 03:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
say that it has to be a background check
 
03:22:53.990 --> 03:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
or anything like that i just
 
03:22:55.670 --> 03:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if we should be more
 
03:22:57.349 --> 03:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
specific about
 
03:22:59.510 --> 03:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
that particular thing so that it's not
 
03:23:03.190 --> 03:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
arbitrary or capricious in any way
 
03:23:05.590 --> 03:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
we could this is the language used in
 
03:23:06.630 --> 03:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
the model
 
03:23:09.590 --> 03:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
and one of the drawbacks to putting in
 
03:23:12.070 --> 03:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
too much limiting language there is that
 
03:23:13.590 --> 03:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
if we were to put in something like you
 
03:23:16.070 --> 03:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
had to have been convicted of fraud well
 
03:23:17.830 --> 03:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
this person could be under investigation
 
03:23:19.910 --> 03:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
in many states a lot of people are
 
03:23:21.269 --> 03:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
looking at them maybe they had
 
03:23:22.870 --> 03:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
settlement agreements but there was no
 
03:23:25.349 --> 03:23:25.359 align:start position:0%
actual conviction of fraud so would that
 
03:23:26.950 --> 03:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
qualify under here
 
03:23:28.630 --> 03:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
you know that's the type of thing that
 
03:23:30.870 --> 03:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
good character encompasses all of those
 
03:23:32.950 --> 03:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
types of situations and that is what is
 
03:23:35.269 --> 03:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
in the naic model but if the committee
 
03:23:37.110 --> 03:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
feels that needs to be amended we'd be
 
03:23:38.229 --> 03:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
happy to work with you on better
 
03:23:38.239 --> 03:23:39.670 align:start position:0%
happy to work with you on better
language

03:23:39.670 --> 03:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:23:43.429 --> 03:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
um for the question yeah
 
03:23:45.510 --> 03:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
i think the background check minimally
 
03:23:47.510 --> 03:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
might be something that we
 
03:23:49.510 --> 03:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
would want to put in as a requirement
 
03:23:51.830 --> 03:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
but again i
 
03:23:54.469 --> 03:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
do you always do a background check
 
03:23:57.590 --> 03:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
is that part of the process
 
03:23:59.110 --> 03:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
currently for these no because there is
 
03:24:01.190 --> 03:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
no requirement for that it depends on
 
03:24:03.830 --> 03:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
the type of entity so for example
 
03:24:06.070 --> 03:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh tpa's third party administrators in
 
03:24:08.389 --> 03:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
their um application that is part of one
 
03:24:09.670 --> 03:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
of the requirements to become an
 
03:24:11.910 --> 03:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
insurance company if you're filing an
 
03:24:13.750 --> 03:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
application for that you definitely need
 
03:24:15.190 --> 03:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
to have background checks for everyone
 
03:24:16.070 --> 03:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
that's going to be involved in the
 
03:24:17.510 --> 03:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
management so it is something that's
 
03:24:19.990 --> 03:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
typically done for a lot of our licensed
 
03:24:23.349 --> 03:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
and regulated entities but
 
03:24:25.590 --> 03:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
currently for the discount medical plans
 
03:24:25.600 --> 03:24:26.630 align:start position:0%
currently for the discount medical plans
there's

03:24:26.630 --> 03:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
there's
 
03:24:29.269 --> 03:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
minimal very very minimal provisions of
 
03:24:31.910 --> 03:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
who can apply for these and there's
 
03:24:34.229 --> 03:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
not much done to oversee
 
03:24:35.910 --> 03:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
who's getting these registrations or not
 
03:24:37.429 --> 03:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
and that's why we're trying to get this
 
03:24:37.439 --> 03:24:38.469 align:start position:0%
and that's why we're trying to get this
language

03:24:38.469 --> 03:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:24:40.630 --> 03:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
adopted so that we can do a better job
 
03:24:42.710 --> 03:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
of regulating who is allowed to operate
 
03:24:45.349 --> 03:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
as a discount medical plan
 
03:24:47.990 --> 03:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:24:50.790 --> 03:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
okay representative johnson
 
03:24:52.710 --> 03:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
03:24:56.150 --> 03:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
um kind of piggybacking on what uh
 
03:24:58.469 --> 03:24:58.479 align:start position:0%
representative fargo said
 
03:24:59.510 --> 03:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
so there
 
03:25:01.510 --> 03:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
any nowhere else in the statue it
 
03:25:02.870 --> 03:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't define because that was my
 
03:25:02.880 --> 03:25:04.150 align:start position:0%
doesn't define because that was my
question

03:25:04.150 --> 03:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:25:07.429 --> 03:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
it doesn't define what a good character
 
03:25:11.269 --> 03:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
is anywhere else in the statue no
 
03:25:11.279 --> 03:25:13.030 align:start position:0%
is anywhere else in the statue no
okay

03:25:13.030 --> 03:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:25:13.040 --> 03:25:14.389 align:start position:0%
okay
representative

03:25:14.389 --> 03:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:25:15.750 --> 03:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
following on
 
03:25:15.760 --> 03:25:16.870 align:start position:0%
following on
the

03:25:16.870 --> 03:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:25:16.880 --> 03:25:19.269 align:start position:0%
the
um

03:25:19.269 --> 03:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:22.550 --> 03:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
troublingly vague
 
03:25:24.630 --> 03:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
description good character
 
03:25:27.190 --> 03:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
do you have you don't have in law do you
 
03:25:28.950 --> 03:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
have an administrative
 
03:25:31.349 --> 03:25:31.359 align:start position:0%
procedures or manuals
 
03:25:31.359 --> 03:25:32.229 align:start position:0%
procedures or manuals
a

03:25:32.229 --> 03:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:25:34.389 --> 03:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
a definition of good character is it
 
03:25:36.389 --> 03:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
described elsewhere i thought i heard
 
03:25:38.229 --> 03:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
you made reference to
 
03:25:41.510 --> 03:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
something or somewhere else
 
03:25:44.550 --> 03:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
no this the standard of good care are of
 
03:25:46.550 --> 03:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
good character appears in various
 
03:25:48.229 --> 03:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
statutes but i don't believe we have any
 
03:25:49.910 --> 03:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
administrative rules that further define
 
03:25:51.830 --> 03:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
what good character is usually it's in
 
03:25:51.840 --> 03:25:52.870 align:start position:0%
what good character is usually it's in
the

03:25:52.870 --> 03:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:25:52.880 --> 03:25:54.630 align:start position:0%
the
um

03:25:54.630 --> 03:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:56.389 --> 03:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
at the discretion of the commissioner so
 
03:25:58.070 --> 03:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
if the commissioner finds you're not of
 
03:26:00.229 --> 03:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
good character that would be a basis for
 
03:26:02.150 --> 03:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
denying an application
 
03:26:04.870 --> 03:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
follow the question it seems to me that
 
03:26:04.880 --> 03:26:06.070 align:start position:0%
follow the question it seems to me that
um

03:26:06.070 --> 03:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:08.229 --> 03:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
that an improvement could be made here
 
03:26:10.550 --> 03:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
by providing some specific some
 
03:26:10.560 --> 03:26:11.830 align:start position:0%
by providing some specific some
measurements

03:26:11.830 --> 03:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
measurements
 
03:26:13.590 --> 03:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
some specificity
 
03:26:16.469 --> 03:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
uh this is troublingly vague
 
03:26:16.479 --> 03:26:17.429 align:start position:0%
uh this is troublingly vague
and

03:26:17.429 --> 03:26:17.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:26:19.269 --> 03:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
it seems to me it would be
 
03:26:23.269 --> 03:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
for the applicant as well as for the
 
03:26:25.190 --> 03:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
the party who's going to be making the
 
03:26:27.590 --> 03:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
determination if i was in a position of
 
03:26:29.670 --> 03:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
having to determine good character that
 
03:26:31.990 --> 03:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
was not defined in any way
 
03:26:33.670 --> 03:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
i would be i'd be uncomfortable with
 
03:26:35.990 --> 03:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
that so i i think some thought should be
 
03:26:40.389 --> 03:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:40.399 --> 03:26:42.469 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:26:42.469 --> 03:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:26:44.309 --> 03:26:44.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
03:26:45.990 --> 03:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question
 
03:26:47.590 --> 03:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
actually it's not a question it's just
 
03:26:49.429 --> 03:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up
 
03:26:51.990 --> 03:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
there is a definition of good character
 
03:26:53.910 --> 03:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
good character have traits like
 
03:26:56.630 --> 03:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
integrity honesty courage loyalty
 
03:26:58.550 --> 03:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
fortitude and other important virtues
 
03:27:00.389 --> 03:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
that promote good behavior
 
03:27:03.349 --> 03:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
so there is a definition
 
03:27:05.910 --> 03:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a webster's dictionary
 
03:27:07.380 --> 03:27:07.390 align:start position:0%
it is
 
03:27:07.390 --> 03:27:12.830 align:start position:0%

um i asked about it being in statue
 
03:27:23.190 --> 03:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
so okay we'll take this up
 
03:27:23.200 --> 03:27:26.950 align:start position:0%
so okay we'll take this up
subcommittee

03:28:02.469 --> 03:28:02.479 align:start position:0%
is this the right bill
 
03:28:07.510 --> 03:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:09.670 --> 03:28:09.680 align:start position:0%

for the record i'm cindy rosenwald
 
03:30:23.750 --> 03:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
and i represent senate district 13 which
 
03:30:25.750 --> 03:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
is most of nashua
 
03:30:28.229 --> 03:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
and today i have for you
 
03:30:30.469 --> 03:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
senate bill 121
 
03:30:33.910 --> 03:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
this is enabling legislation which will
 
03:30:33.920 --> 03:30:34.950 align:start position:0%
this is enabling legislation which will
allow

03:30:34.950 --> 03:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
allow
 
03:30:37.750 --> 03:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to exercise more local
 
03:30:37.760 --> 03:30:39.030 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to exercise more local
control

03:30:39.030 --> 03:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
control
 
03:30:42.469 --> 03:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
and potentially save individuals
 
03:30:45.590 --> 03:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
significant money on premiums that they
 
03:30:48.070 --> 03:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
might purchase in the individual market
 
03:30:50.150 --> 03:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
for health insurance
 
03:30:52.870 --> 03:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
following the passage of the affordable
 
03:30:55.510 --> 03:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
care act in 2010
 
03:30:57.269 --> 03:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
we enacted
 
03:31:00.150 --> 03:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
a law to prohibit the state from using a
 
03:31:03.190 --> 03:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
state-based health benefit exchange
 
03:31:05.349 --> 03:31:05.359 align:start position:0%
mandating instead that we use the
 
03:31:07.349 --> 03:31:07.359 align:start position:0%
federal marketplace
 
03:31:10.389 --> 03:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
and that's worked out okay
 
03:31:13.030 --> 03:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
but we do have to pay
 
03:31:16.070 --> 03:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
a three percent assessment
 
03:31:19.190 --> 03:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
per enrollee for being
 
03:31:22.070 --> 03:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
involved with healthcare.gov
 
03:31:24.630 --> 03:31:24.640 align:start position:0%
um and that adds up to nearly eight
 
03:31:27.990 --> 03:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:29.510 --> 03:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
but in the 12
 
03:31:32.389 --> 03:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
years since the law was passed
 
03:31:35.110 --> 03:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
and enacted private businesses have
 
03:31:38.229 --> 03:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
developed market-based solutions for
 
03:31:41.030 --> 03:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
state health benefit exchanges
 
03:31:44.229 --> 03:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
and this could be an option for new
 
03:31:47.429 --> 03:31:47.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire that would give us more data
 
03:31:50.150 --> 03:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
better data on who is signing up for
 
03:31:54.389 --> 03:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
what and give us more control so brokers
 
03:31:56.309 --> 03:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
and carriers could better serve the
 
03:31:58.950 --> 03:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
unique needs of granite staters
 
03:32:01.670 --> 03:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
it could also save up to four million
 
03:32:04.150 --> 03:32:04.160 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
03:32:07.349 --> 03:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
versus paying that three percent
 
03:32:07.359 --> 03:32:08.790 align:start position:0%
versus paying that three percent
assessment

03:32:08.790 --> 03:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
03:32:08.800 --> 03:32:09.750 align:start position:0%
assessment
fee

03:32:09.750 --> 03:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
fee
 
03:32:12.950 --> 03:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
and this could accrue to
 
03:32:12.960 --> 03:32:14.070 align:start position:0%
and this could accrue to
reduce

03:32:14.070 --> 03:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
03:32:16.950 --> 03:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
those health insurance premiums
 
03:32:19.110 --> 03:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
and in addition the federal government
 
03:32:22.389 --> 03:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
could layer more money on top of that
 
03:32:24.870 --> 03:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
making the potential savings even
 
03:32:28.309 --> 03:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
greater so let me just say again
 
03:32:31.750 --> 03:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
this is enabling legislation
 
03:32:34.070 --> 03:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
the insurance department would not be
 
03:32:35.590 --> 03:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
able to
 
03:32:38.790 --> 03:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
decide on their own to do this they
 
03:32:40.630 --> 03:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
would still have to get
 
03:32:40.640 --> 03:32:41.830 align:start position:0%
would still have to get
approval

03:32:41.830 --> 03:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
approval
 
03:32:41.840 --> 03:32:43.910 align:start position:0%
approval
from

03:32:43.910 --> 03:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:32:46.950 --> 03:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee on
 
03:32:50.309 --> 03:32:50.319 align:start position:0%
health care reform plus the joint fiscal
 
03:32:52.710 --> 03:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
committee so they would have to get
 
03:32:54.309 --> 03:32:54.319 align:start position:0%
approval from
 
03:32:56.710 --> 03:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
two different committees
 
03:32:59.750 --> 03:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
it really removes the prohibition on
 
03:33:03.269 --> 03:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
having a state-based exchange giving us
 
03:33:04.870 --> 03:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
options for
 
03:33:08.550 --> 03:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
a better product at a at a lower cost
 
03:33:11.830 --> 03:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
through commercial enterprises and i
 
03:33:13.830 --> 03:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
think i'll stop there i'm happy to take
 
03:33:15.429 --> 03:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
questions but there are
 
03:33:16.870 --> 03:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
other people here
 
03:33:19.670 --> 03:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
really more well versed in this subject
 
03:33:19.680 --> 03:33:20.630 align:start position:0%
really more well versed in this subject
matter

03:33:20.630 --> 03:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
matter
 
03:33:23.429 --> 03:33:23.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:33:25.190 --> 03:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:33:27.670 --> 03:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs
 
03:33:28.790 --> 03:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:33:30.870 --> 03:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question senator
 
03:33:32.550 --> 03:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
um would this
 
03:33:34.469 --> 03:33:34.479 align:start position:0%
eliminate the federal exchange in new
 
03:33:36.070 --> 03:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire and my second part is are
 
03:33:38.469 --> 03:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
there any benefits to being part of the
 
03:33:38.479 --> 03:33:39.590 align:start position:0%
there any benefits to being part of the
federal

03:33:39.590 --> 03:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
federal
 
03:33:39.600 --> 03:33:41.349 align:start position:0%
federal
exchange

03:33:41.349 --> 03:33:41.359 align:start position:0%
exchange
 
03:33:42.469 --> 03:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't
 
03:33:45.510 --> 03:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
eliminate it it would give the insurance
 
03:33:48.790 --> 03:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
department the ability to examine
 
03:33:51.750 --> 03:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
not using it
 
03:33:51.760 --> 03:33:52.550 align:start position:0%
not using it
i

03:33:52.550 --> 03:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:33:54.950 --> 03:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
can't imagine we would ever use two
 
03:33:56.710 --> 03:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
different exchanges
 
03:33:56.720 --> 03:33:57.830 align:start position:0%
different exchanges
but

03:33:57.830 --> 03:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:34:00.870 --> 03:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
if we found out we'd have better
 
03:34:03.510 --> 03:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
control better data at lower cost it
 
03:34:05.910 --> 03:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
would give us the option
 
03:34:07.750 --> 03:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
to use
 
03:34:10.150 --> 03:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
a non-federal
 
03:34:12.389 --> 03:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
health benefit exchange i mean i think
 
03:34:16.469 --> 03:34:16.479 align:start position:0%
the benefit at the time we did it was
 
03:34:16.479 --> 03:34:18.550 align:start position:0%
the benefit at the time we did it was
that

03:34:18.550 --> 03:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:34:21.429 --> 03:34:21.439 align:start position:0%
it was less expensive
 
03:34:24.070 --> 03:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
than trying to build our own state
 
03:34:26.309 --> 03:34:26.319 align:start position:0%
exchange as some
 
03:34:29.190 --> 03:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
states did but a lot of states
 
03:34:32.389 --> 03:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
used the federal health benefit exchange
 
03:34:36.150 --> 03:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
and as you probably remember it
 
03:34:38.389 --> 03:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
got a rocky start
 
03:34:40.630 --> 03:34:40.640 align:start position:0%
but um the
 
03:34:42.630 --> 03:34:42.640 align:start position:0%
kicks got worked out of it and and
 
03:34:44.070 --> 03:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
really was
 
03:34:44.080 --> 03:34:45.269 align:start position:0%
really was
fine

03:34:45.269 --> 03:34:45.279 align:start position:0%
fine
 
03:34:47.590 --> 03:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
my daughter uses it
 
03:34:50.229 --> 03:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
to purchase health insurance and
 
03:34:53.110 --> 03:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
she doesn't have any trouble but i think
 
03:34:55.030 --> 03:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
people would be happier
 
03:34:55.040 --> 03:34:56.469 align:start position:0%
people would be happier
if

03:34:56.469 --> 03:34:56.479 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:34:58.550 --> 03:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
their health insurance premiums were
 
03:35:01.590 --> 03:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
lower because we were able to find a
 
03:35:03.429 --> 03:35:03.439 align:start position:0%
model that cost less
 
03:35:05.910 --> 03:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:35:10.790 --> 03:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:12.790 --> 03:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much uh just a
 
03:35:15.030 --> 03:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
question would would the state be able
 
03:35:15.040 --> 03:35:16.070 align:start position:0%
question would would the state be able
to

03:35:16.070 --> 03:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:35:18.630 --> 03:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
to basically take the federal
 
03:35:22.229 --> 03:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
medical bill and trim it down
 
03:35:24.630 --> 03:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
in other words make it uh
 
03:35:26.550 --> 03:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
maybe less expensive by trimming
 
03:35:26.560 --> 03:35:29.510 align:start position:0%
maybe less expensive by trimming
benefits

03:35:29.510 --> 03:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:32.229 --> 03:35:32.239 align:start position:0%
i don't believe so but if i'm wrong i'm
 
03:35:34.389 --> 03:35:34.399 align:start position:0%
sure i'll be corrected
 
03:35:36.870 --> 03:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:38.710 --> 03:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
representative fargo
 
03:35:42.150 --> 03:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
um yes i i have two questions
 
03:35:42.160 --> 03:35:43.190 align:start position:0%
um yes i i have two questions
um

03:35:43.190 --> 03:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:45.349 --> 03:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
as far as the
 
03:35:47.429 --> 03:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
federal regulations i believe
 
03:35:47.439 --> 03:35:48.229 align:start position:0%
federal regulations i believe
um

03:35:48.229 --> 03:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:51.269 --> 03:35:51.279 align:start position:0%
i i can't remember but i think we passed
 
03:35:53.429 --> 03:35:53.439 align:start position:0%
a bill here in new hampshire that says
 
03:35:55.670 --> 03:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire has to provide
 
03:35:57.910 --> 03:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
the same benefits that are afforded
 
03:35:59.349 --> 03:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
under the
 
03:35:59.359 --> 03:36:01.349 align:start position:0%
under the
aca

03:36:01.349 --> 03:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
aca
 
03:36:04.150 --> 03:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
if i'm not mistaken i believe that is in
 
03:36:07.110 --> 03:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
statute already tyler's yeah thank you
 
03:36:10.710 --> 03:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not so sure would that hold true for
 
03:36:14.309 --> 03:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
this this would not change the benefits
 
03:36:17.429 --> 03:36:17.439 align:start position:0%
this would just change the process
 
03:36:19.429 --> 03:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
of how you
 
03:36:19.439 --> 03:36:20.950 align:start position:0%
of how you
enrolled

03:36:20.950 --> 03:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
enrolled
 
03:36:24.309 --> 03:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
in a in a plan thank you my second
 
03:36:24.319 --> 03:36:25.349 align:start position:0%
in a in a plan thank you my second
question

03:36:25.349 --> 03:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:36:28.150 --> 03:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
is there a reason i mean usually when we
 
03:36:29.990 --> 03:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
see something like this there's a study
 
03:36:31.750 --> 03:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
done and it comes
 
03:36:33.750 --> 03:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
the results of this study come back to
 
03:36:36.710 --> 03:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
us as another bill and the house and
 
03:36:38.870 --> 03:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
senate then have the opportunity to vote
 
03:36:41.990 --> 03:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
on that and my cons i guess my concern
 
03:36:44.229 --> 03:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
or my question is is
 
03:36:47.030 --> 03:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
why why would you do this study and then
 
03:36:48.870 --> 03:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
implement it without bringing it back to
 
03:36:52.389 --> 03:36:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:52.399 --> 03:36:53.670 align:start position:0%
 
well

03:36:53.670 --> 03:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:36:53.680 --> 03:36:54.630 align:start position:0%
well
so

03:36:54.630 --> 03:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:36:56.870 --> 03:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
there's not a study committee here it
 
03:37:00.550 --> 03:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
has the insurance department to evaluate
 
03:37:05.590 --> 03:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
the options but then it's come back to
 
03:37:09.110 --> 03:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
two legislatively established committees
 
03:37:12.229 --> 03:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
one being the joint committee on health
 
03:37:14.309 --> 03:37:14.319 align:start position:0%
care reform
 
03:37:14.319 --> 03:37:15.110 align:start position:0%
care reform
which

03:37:15.110 --> 03:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
which
 
03:37:17.429 --> 03:37:17.439 align:start position:0%
i've been on and i think i might be on
 
03:37:17.439 --> 03:37:18.309 align:start position:0%
i've been on and i think i might be on
again

03:37:18.309 --> 03:37:18.319 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:37:20.229 --> 03:37:20.239 align:start position:0%
is that the one we're on together
 
03:37:23.750 --> 03:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
is that the oversight yes the joint
 
03:37:26.229 --> 03:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
healthcare oversight reform committee
 
03:37:26.239 --> 03:37:27.349 align:start position:0%
healthcare oversight reform committee
that

03:37:27.349 --> 03:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:37:28.830 --> 03:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
is charged
 
03:37:33.030 --> 03:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
with um making decisions policy
 
03:37:35.750 --> 03:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
decisions to the extent that the state
 
03:37:35.760 --> 03:37:36.950 align:start position:0%
decisions to the extent that the state
can

03:37:36.950 --> 03:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:37:36.960 --> 03:37:37.990 align:start position:0%
can
on

03:37:37.990 --> 03:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:37:40.630 --> 03:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
health care reform and the other one is
 
03:37:43.110 --> 03:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
the joint fiscal committee
 
03:37:46.389 --> 03:37:46.399 align:start position:0%
which looks at
 
03:37:49.429 --> 03:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
changes to
 
03:37:51.590 --> 03:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
state and federal spending in new
 
03:37:51.600 --> 03:37:52.710 align:start position:0%
state and federal spending in new
hampshire

03:37:52.710 --> 03:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:37:52.720 --> 03:37:54.550 align:start position:0%
hampshire
throughout

03:37:54.550 --> 03:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
throughout
 
03:37:56.469 --> 03:37:56.479 align:start position:0%
the session even when
 
03:38:00.150 --> 03:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
we're not all in session so i think
 
03:38:02.389 --> 03:38:02.399 align:start position:0%
there is still
 
03:38:05.190 --> 03:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
good control both on the policy and the
 
03:38:09.110 --> 03:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
money from both the house and the senate
 
03:38:11.670 --> 03:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
but it enables a little bit of
 
03:38:11.680 --> 03:38:13.830 align:start position:0%
but it enables a little bit of
nimbleness

03:38:13.830 --> 03:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
nimbleness
 
03:38:15.830 --> 03:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:38:19.190 --> 03:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:21.269 --> 03:38:21.279 align:start position:0%
yes thank you there here i am there you
 
03:38:21.279 --> 03:38:21.910 align:start position:0%
yes thank you there here i am there you
are

03:38:21.910 --> 03:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:38:25.190 --> 03:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
hi you're hiding um
 
03:38:27.110 --> 03:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
i think you referenced i believe you
 
03:38:29.750 --> 03:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
referenced that there are states that um
 
03:38:33.189 --> 03:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
adopted and implemented their own models
 
03:38:33.199 --> 03:38:34.870 align:start position:0%
adopted and implemented their own models
yes

03:38:34.870 --> 03:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:38:37.030 --> 03:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
which states adopted models which have
 
03:38:38.469 --> 03:38:38.479 align:start position:0%
worked out well
 
03:38:40.150 --> 03:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
to the effect that i believe you
 
03:38:40.160 --> 03:38:41.910 align:start position:0%
to the effect that i believe you
identified

03:38:41.910 --> 03:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
identified
 
03:38:44.469 --> 03:38:44.479 align:start position:0%
they were able to provide
 
03:38:46.950 --> 03:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
the same services at lower costs to
 
03:38:48.950 --> 03:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
their state's residents
 
03:38:52.389 --> 03:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that question um
 
03:38:55.750 --> 03:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
i think what i was referencing was that
 
03:38:58.229 --> 03:38:58.239 align:start position:0%
in after 2010
 
03:38:59.670 --> 03:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna try and move this so i can
 
03:39:01.910 --> 03:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
look at you when i talk
 
03:39:05.189 --> 03:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
um some states and i know for example
 
03:39:07.429 --> 03:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
new york state and massachusetts the big
 
03:39:10.790 --> 03:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
states built their own state exchanges
 
03:39:13.269 --> 03:39:13.279 align:start position:0%
but there are states also that have
 
03:39:15.750 --> 03:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
adopted these commercial products and
 
03:39:19.349 --> 03:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
there is a gentleman here from one of
 
03:39:21.670 --> 03:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
those companies
 
03:39:24.389 --> 03:39:24.399 align:start position:0%
to speak and he'd be able better to tell
 
03:39:26.710 --> 03:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
you what states
 
03:39:31.990 --> 03:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:34.469 --> 03:39:34.479 align:start position:0%
so the question man so without without
 
03:39:36.790 --> 03:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
identifying specific states which i
 
03:39:38.150 --> 03:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
don't believe you're able to do at this
 
03:39:39.830 --> 03:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
point that's okay
 
03:39:39.840 --> 03:39:41.269 align:start position:0%
point that's okay
um

03:39:41.269 --> 03:39:41.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:42.950 --> 03:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
you're quite confident that there are
 
03:39:45.269 --> 03:39:45.279 align:start position:0%
states that have adopted models
 
03:39:46.790 --> 03:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
that have
 
03:39:48.630 --> 03:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
produced benefits
 
03:39:51.910 --> 03:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
that are favorable to to consumers
 
03:39:54.309 --> 03:39:54.319 align:start position:0%
yes from a financial standpoint because
 
03:39:56.150 --> 03:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
we've already heard that that the
 
03:39:57.990 --> 03:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
product has to be the same
 
03:40:00.389 --> 03:40:00.399 align:start position:0%
it's just the process is different such
 
03:40:00.399 --> 03:40:01.429 align:start position:0%
it's just the process is different such
that

03:40:01.429 --> 03:40:01.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:40:03.110 --> 03:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
there's a savings
 
03:40:05.750 --> 03:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
provided by a state
 
03:40:07.349 --> 03:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
mechanism rather than the federal
 
03:40:10.070 --> 03:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
mechanism yes what i'm not sure is
 
03:40:13.189 --> 03:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
whether all those states have elected to
 
03:40:15.429 --> 03:40:15.439 align:start position:0%
pass the savings on
 
03:40:18.630 --> 03:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
to consumers in the form of lower
 
03:40:20.309 --> 03:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
premiums but
 
03:40:22.710 --> 03:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
i certainly would
 
03:40:25.349 --> 03:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
hope and expect that that's what new
 
03:40:27.429 --> 03:40:27.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire would do
 
03:40:34.550 --> 03:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:36.469 --> 03:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
representative johnson
 
03:40:38.710 --> 03:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
03:40:38.720 --> 03:40:39.590 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

03:40:39.590 --> 03:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:42.150 --> 03:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
with the if this bill were to pass does
 
03:40:44.870 --> 03:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
that mean we would not be sending
 
03:40:47.269 --> 03:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
any of our uh
 
03:40:49.510 --> 03:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
residents to the federal we would just
 
03:40:51.590 --> 03:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
let them pick from the state and that
 
03:40:53.349 --> 03:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
that's where the savings would come in
 
03:40:56.710 --> 03:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
or would we still have to offer both
 
03:41:00.150 --> 03:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
so we'd still end up paying the federal
 
03:41:02.309 --> 03:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
fees thank you for the question no we
 
03:41:06.229 --> 03:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do both this bill would just
 
03:41:08.710 --> 03:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
authorize the insurance department to
 
03:41:11.269 --> 03:41:11.279 align:start position:0%
take a look at
 
03:41:11.279 --> 03:41:12.630 align:start position:0%
take a look at
whether

03:41:12.630 --> 03:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
whether
 
03:41:15.429 --> 03:41:15.439 align:start position:0%
there's a better less expensive option
 
03:41:19.110 --> 03:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
they're not allowed to even consider
 
03:41:21.269 --> 03:41:21.279 align:start position:0%
one of these commercial products right
 
03:41:24.550 --> 03:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
now under state law so this is just
 
03:41:27.189 --> 03:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation to
 
03:41:29.590 --> 03:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
allow the insurance department to
 
03:41:31.990 --> 03:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
evaluate whether we could be
 
03:41:34.469 --> 03:41:34.479 align:start position:0%
getting a better deal for new hampshire
 
03:41:34.479 --> 03:41:35.830 align:start position:0%
getting a better deal for new hampshire
consumers

03:41:35.830 --> 03:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
03:41:37.189 --> 03:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
we would not
 
03:41:40.229 --> 03:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:43.189 --> 03:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
but as i i read the last sentence here
 
03:41:45.189 --> 03:41:45.199 align:start position:0%
the department would then
 
03:41:47.910 --> 03:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh go out to bid
 
03:41:50.469 --> 03:41:50.479 align:start position:0%
and get a proposal
 
03:41:52.070 --> 03:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
and make a recommendation to the
 
03:41:55.030 --> 03:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
governor and council for a vote
 
03:41:57.670 --> 03:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
right but it was would already have gone
 
03:41:57.680 --> 03:41:58.550 align:start position:0%
right but it was would already have gone
through

03:41:58.550 --> 03:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
through
 
03:42:01.030 --> 03:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
joint health care review reform
 
03:42:04.229 --> 03:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
oversight and fiscal
 
03:42:07.349 --> 03:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
in addition to a contract having to be
 
03:42:09.830 --> 03:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
approved by the executive council so
 
03:42:12.229 --> 03:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
there there's really a lot of
 
03:42:15.349 --> 03:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:17.349 --> 03:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
representative johnson
 
03:42:17.359 --> 03:42:18.309 align:start position:0%
representative johnson
so

03:42:18.309 --> 03:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:42:19.990 --> 03:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
with that being said wouldn't this make
 
03:42:22.150 --> 03:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
more sense for a study committee
 
03:42:23.510 --> 03:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
so that we could
 
03:42:25.349 --> 03:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
better see if that's something that was
 
03:42:27.269 --> 03:42:27.279 align:start position:0%
actually needed or wanted
 
03:42:29.030 --> 03:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
before we
 
03:42:31.189 --> 03:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
go through all of this
 
03:42:33.590 --> 03:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
well this i mean the
 
03:42:35.429 --> 03:42:35.439 align:start position:0%
house will do
 
03:42:37.030 --> 03:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
what the house
 
03:42:39.349 --> 03:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
wants to do but
 
03:42:41.510 --> 03:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
um i and the other sponsors thought we
 
03:42:43.429 --> 03:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
should have the insurance department do
 
03:42:44.630 --> 03:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
that study
 
03:42:44.640 --> 03:42:45.990 align:start position:0%
that study
because

03:42:45.990 --> 03:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:42:47.910 --> 03:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
they could
 
03:42:49.030 --> 03:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
they could
 
03:42:49.910 --> 03:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
do it
 
03:42:54.309 --> 03:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:56.229 --> 03:42:56.239 align:start position:0%
okay no more questions thank you very
 
03:42:58.309 --> 03:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
much thank you
 
03:43:01.030 --> 03:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
okay chair we'll call on peter bragnan
 
03:43:04.710 --> 03:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
representing pretty strategies oh
 
03:43:06.950 --> 03:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
petty that's right
 
03:43:09.670 --> 03:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:25.510 --> 03:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:25.520 --> 03:43:42.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:43:42.630 --> 03:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:44.309 --> 03:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
03:43:47.349 --> 03:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
committee for the record peter bragdon
 
03:43:49.030 --> 03:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
senior policy advisor with pretty
 
03:43:49.040 --> 03:43:50.309 align:start position:0%
senior policy advisor with pretty
strategies

03:43:50.309 --> 03:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
strategies
 
03:43:53.429 --> 03:43:53.439 align:start position:0%
here representing getting short
 
03:43:55.750 --> 03:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
with jason sparks
 
03:43:59.189 --> 03:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
current new hampshire law rsa 420 n7
 
03:44:02.229 --> 03:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
prohibits any state agency from even
 
03:44:04.309 --> 03:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
planning to implement a state exchange
 
03:44:06.469 --> 03:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
let alone implementing one
 
03:44:08.070 --> 03:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
there are many benefits however to a
 
03:44:09.830 --> 03:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
state exchange and jason can talk about
 
03:44:09.840 --> 03:44:10.630 align:start position:0%
state exchange and jason can talk about
that

03:44:10.630 --> 03:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:44:12.070 --> 03:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
this bill simply authorizes the
 
03:44:13.670 --> 03:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
department insurance to look into it and
 
03:44:15.590 --> 03:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
if they feel it's warranted based on the
 
03:44:17.590 --> 03:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
criteria you see in the bill also
 
03:44:19.349 --> 03:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
authorize the implementation but only
 
03:44:21.189 --> 03:44:21.199 align:start position:0%
upon approval of the legislative fiscal
 
03:44:23.349 --> 03:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
committee and the hhs oversight
 
03:44:24.710 --> 03:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
committee that's one thing by the way
 
03:44:26.469 --> 03:44:26.479 align:start position:0%
i'll point out senator rosenwald spoke
 
03:44:28.630 --> 03:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
of the the joint health care reform
 
03:44:30.870 --> 03:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
oversight committee the original version
 
03:44:33.189 --> 03:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
of the bill had that in there which was
 
03:44:36.309 --> 03:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
a committee formed when we when the aca
 
03:44:38.229 --> 03:44:38.239 align:start position:0%
was implemented
 
03:44:40.710 --> 03:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
to specifically deal with issues related
 
03:44:42.790 --> 03:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
to the affordable care act the senate
 
03:44:44.469 --> 03:44:44.479 align:start position:0%
changed that to be the health and human
 
03:44:46.550 --> 03:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
services oversight committee uh
 
03:44:49.030 --> 03:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
obviously the house committee can
 
03:44:51.990 --> 03:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
do what uh what they see fit he took
 
03:44:54.150 --> 03:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
took heard me out of it
 
03:44:54.160 --> 03:44:55.110 align:start position:0%
took heard me out of it
well

03:44:55.110 --> 03:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:44:56.710 --> 03:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
we would all prefer uh representative
 
03:44:59.189 --> 03:44:59.199 align:start position:0%
hunt that you be a part of this so uh
 
03:45:01.590 --> 03:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
we would be open to a change of any sort
 
03:45:01.600 --> 03:45:02.309 align:start position:0%
we would be open to a change of any sort
that

03:45:02.309 --> 03:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:45:04.389 --> 03:45:04.399 align:start position:0%
allows that
 
03:45:06.070 --> 03:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh let's see a little bit of history so
 
03:45:09.030 --> 03:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
back in 2011 2012 i was in the senate at
 
03:45:10.150 --> 03:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
the time
 
03:45:11.590 --> 03:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
the legislature grappled with how to
 
03:45:13.590 --> 03:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
implement the new affordable care act
 
03:45:15.429 --> 03:45:15.439 align:start position:0%
that had been passed down in washington
 
03:45:17.750 --> 03:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh also known as the aca
 
03:45:20.469 --> 03:45:20.479 align:start position:0%
a key question of the aca is what to do
 
03:45:23.830 --> 03:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
for an exchange uh under the aca every
 
03:45:26.790 --> 03:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
state needed to provide a an exchange a
 
03:45:29.030 --> 03:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
a portal a marketplace a place where
 
03:45:30.550 --> 03:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
individuals can go
 
03:45:32.790 --> 03:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
compare insurance plans and select which
 
03:45:34.950 --> 03:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
ones they want to do
 
03:45:37.030 --> 03:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
states could create their own exchange
 
03:45:38.950 --> 03:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
or they could use the federal exchange
 
03:45:40.870 --> 03:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
which is now known as healthcare.gov
 
03:45:42.550 --> 03:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
they could not do both they had to do
 
03:45:43.830 --> 03:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
one or the other
 
03:45:45.830 --> 03:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
at the time we in the legislature were
 
03:45:47.590 --> 03:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
very concerned that the state had
 
03:45:50.389 --> 03:45:50.399 align:start position:0%
neither the resources nor the expertise
 
03:45:52.790 --> 03:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
to create our own custom exchange from
 
03:45:52.800 --> 03:45:54.309 align:start position:0%
to create our own custom exchange from
scratch

03:45:54.309 --> 03:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
scratch
 
03:45:57.269 --> 03:45:57.279 align:start position:0%
plus at the time healthcare.gov was free
 
03:45:59.269 --> 03:45:59.279 align:start position:0%
so we selected the federal exchange and
 
03:46:01.830 --> 03:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
put into statute that agencies cannot
 
03:46:03.269 --> 03:46:03.279 align:start position:0%
work to implement
 
03:46:05.269 --> 03:46:05.279 align:start position:0%
a state exchange
 
03:46:07.269 --> 03:46:07.279 align:start position:0%
here we are now 10 years later however
 
03:46:08.870 --> 03:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
and there's a market that's grown for
 
03:46:10.950 --> 03:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
companies to provide off-the-shelf
 
03:46:13.830 --> 03:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
software as a solution for states not
 
03:46:15.830 --> 03:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
some custom-built thing from scratch but
 
03:46:17.510 --> 03:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
an off-the-shelf program that can be
 
03:46:19.510 --> 03:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
tailored get insured as one of those
 
03:46:21.349 --> 03:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
companies there are several others they
 
03:46:23.429 --> 03:46:23.439 align:start position:0%
provide exchange for
 
03:46:25.670 --> 03:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
let's see 17 states
 
03:46:28.150 --> 03:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
right now have state exchanges
 
03:46:30.070 --> 03:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
getting short i believe provides the
 
03:46:32.070 --> 03:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
services for seven of them i believe
 
03:46:34.229 --> 03:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
there's three more that are currently
 
03:46:36.710 --> 03:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
in the process procurement process for
 
03:46:38.710 --> 03:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh switching to a state exchange so soon
 
03:46:41.189 --> 03:46:41.199 align:start position:0%
there'll be 20 of the 50 states that use
 
03:46:43.510 --> 03:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
a state-based exchange with many of them
 
03:46:45.110 --> 03:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
having switched from the federal
 
03:46:46.790 --> 03:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
exchange for various reasons some of
 
03:46:49.110 --> 03:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
which we'll say here
 
03:46:51.510 --> 03:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
in addition to that what was once free
 
03:46:53.830 --> 03:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
healthcare.gov now has a significant
 
03:46:56.630 --> 03:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
cost the federal exchange healthcare.gov
 
03:46:59.590 --> 03:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
is funded by a 2.75
 
03:47:01.990 --> 03:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
tax on individual health insurance
 
03:47:06.150 --> 03:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
premiums that's up from 2.25 percent one
 
03:47:07.910 --> 03:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
year ago
 
03:47:09.830 --> 03:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
it will likely cost these new hampshire
 
03:47:12.550 --> 03:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
policyholders 7.8 million dollars this
 
03:47:13.910 --> 03:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
year and you see that referenced on the
 
03:47:15.510 --> 03:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
sheet i passed around
 
03:47:17.830 --> 03:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
experience has shown that states
 
03:47:19.910 --> 03:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
exchanges that run would get insured at
 
03:47:23.030 --> 03:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
least operate at 40 50 percent less than
 
03:47:24.469 --> 03:47:24.479 align:start position:0%
what the federal
 
03:47:26.389 --> 03:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
exchange charges
 
03:47:28.389 --> 03:47:28.399 align:start position:0%
the potential savings to new hampshire's
 
03:47:30.150 --> 03:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
individual policyholders then would be
 
03:47:32.389 --> 03:47:32.399 align:start position:0%
just under potentially four million
 
03:47:37.030 --> 03:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:39.349 --> 03:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
all that's well and good um the big
 
03:47:40.550 --> 03:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
question is what do we do with these
 
03:47:42.790 --> 03:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
savings these savings could be sent back
 
03:47:45.269 --> 03:47:45.279 align:start position:0%
to those insurance premium
 
03:47:47.189 --> 03:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
policyholders the individual market
 
03:47:47.199 --> 03:47:48.309 align:start position:0%
policyholders the individual market
holders

03:47:48.309 --> 03:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
holders
 
03:47:50.950 --> 03:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
or they could be leveraged the federal
 
03:47:53.830 --> 03:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
government for innovation grants will
 
03:47:56.710 --> 03:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
match state efforts at premium reduction
 
03:47:59.349 --> 03:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh 2-1 3-1
 
03:48:01.510 --> 03:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes even higher than three to one
 
03:48:03.429 --> 03:48:03.439 align:start position:0%
so if we took that four million dollars
 
03:48:05.189 --> 03:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
and used it for overall premium
 
03:48:07.030 --> 03:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
reductions we have the ability to with
 
03:48:10.070 --> 03:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
the federal match uh have a savings of
 
03:48:11.590 --> 03:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
12 million dollars
 
03:48:14.389 --> 03:48:14.399 align:start position:0%
16 million dollars maybe more
 
03:48:15.590 --> 03:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
that's significant because you recall
 
03:48:17.429 --> 03:48:17.439 align:start position:0%
that two years ago we implemented a
 
03:48:19.830 --> 03:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
reinsurance pool to reduce the premiums
 
03:48:22.309 --> 03:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
in the individual market using the 1332
 
03:48:22.319 --> 03:48:23.349 align:start position:0%
in the individual market using the 1332
waiver

03:48:23.349 --> 03:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
waiver
 
03:48:25.030 --> 03:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
that helped drive down the individual
 
03:48:27.750 --> 03:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
insurance rates 16 percent
 
03:48:29.830 --> 03:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
but that was funded by a fourteen
 
03:48:32.150 --> 03:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
million dollar assessment also known as
 
03:48:35.030 --> 03:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
a tax on all health insurance policies
 
03:48:36.150 --> 03:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
03:48:38.550 --> 03:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
everybody's insurance premiums went up
 
03:48:40.950 --> 03:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
especially those for small businesses if
 
03:48:42.870 --> 03:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
we could use the savings from switching
 
03:48:45.030 --> 03:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
to a state exchange get the federal
 
03:48:47.510 --> 03:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
match use that to fund the reinsurance
 
03:48:49.429 --> 03:48:49.439 align:start position:0%
program we have the ability then to
 
03:48:52.309 --> 03:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
reduce eliminate that tax increase that
 
03:48:54.550 --> 03:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
was passed on to small businesses and
 
03:48:56.790 --> 03:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
large businesses across the state
 
03:48:58.790 --> 03:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion both red states and
 
03:49:00.790 --> 03:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
blue states want more control over their
 
03:49:02.870 --> 03:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
health insurance decisions and now that
 
03:49:04.870 --> 03:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
states are not required to create their
 
03:49:07.349 --> 03:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
own custom state exchange from scratch
 
03:49:09.349 --> 03:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
and can rely on off-the-shelf solutions
 
03:49:11.189 --> 03:49:11.199 align:start position:0%
from national vendors it's time for new
 
03:49:12.950 --> 03:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire to seriously consider a switch
 
03:49:15.429 --> 03:49:15.439 align:start position:0%
to state exchange um i'd be happy to
 
03:49:16.710 --> 03:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
answer any questions or you may want to
 
03:49:18.070 --> 03:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
hear from mr sparks first that's up to
 
03:49:21.670 --> 03:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:24.710 --> 03:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
representative johnson has a question
 
03:49:27.269 --> 03:49:27.279 align:start position:0%
on the as you put uh off the shelf
 
03:49:29.349 --> 03:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
software what's the cost for the the
 
03:49:31.269 --> 03:49:31.279 align:start position:0%
state to be enrolled in something like
 
03:49:33.510 --> 03:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
that or purchase this off the shelf
 
03:49:36.550 --> 03:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
software so uh probably uh mr sparks
 
03:49:38.389 --> 03:49:38.399 align:start position:0%
should answer that more directly but
 
03:49:40.710 --> 03:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh there is uh some upfront costs the
 
03:49:42.870 --> 03:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
federal government will uh for a state
 
03:49:44.550 --> 03:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
moving to a state exchange i believe
 
03:49:46.790 --> 03:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's still the case uh they up to two
 
03:49:49.189 --> 03:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
million dollars for that uh and then the
 
03:49:51.349 --> 03:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
contracts have been structured for
 
03:49:53.030 --> 03:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
states that don't want an upfront cost
 
03:49:55.830 --> 03:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
any extra startup cost just rolled into
 
03:49:57.910 --> 03:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
the contract and just amortized over the
 
03:50:00.550 --> 03:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
period so the upfront cost can be as low
 
03:50:03.830 --> 03:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:05.429 --> 03:50:05.439 align:start position:0%
for the question inquiry
 
03:50:08.309 --> 03:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
so there's a monthly fee in order to
 
03:50:10.229 --> 03:50:10.239 align:start position:0%
operate this program
 
03:50:12.710 --> 03:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
these programs correct there was so the
 
03:50:14.630 --> 03:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
the current fee paid to healthcare.gov
 
03:50:16.950 --> 03:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
it's about 2.75
 
03:50:19.830 --> 03:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh the the off-the-shelf packages can do
 
03:50:22.469 --> 03:50:22.479 align:start position:0%
it for 40 to 50 less but it's still a
 
03:50:23.510 --> 03:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
well i don't know it's a monthly
 
03:50:25.510 --> 03:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
assessment or a yearly but there is
 
03:50:26.950 --> 03:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
something yeah either way there is
 
03:50:28.309 --> 03:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
something whether it's going to the the
 
03:50:31.429 --> 03:50:31.439 align:start position:0%
feds or uh staying within new hampshire
 
03:50:32.630 --> 03:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
and part of it going to private
 
03:50:32.640 --> 03:50:34.790 align:start position:0%
and part of it going to private
contractors

03:50:34.790 --> 03:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
contractors
 
03:50:38.630 --> 03:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative fargo
 
03:50:41.590 --> 03:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that information um
 
03:50:44.150 --> 03:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
i think one of the concerns that i have
 
03:50:45.990 --> 03:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm questioning this is you talk
 
03:50:50.070 --> 03:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
about the possibilities of being able to
 
03:50:52.309 --> 03:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
help the consumer or the policyholder by
 
03:50:53.990 --> 03:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
reducing premiums but there's nothing in
 
03:50:56.550 --> 03:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
this bill that determines how that
 
03:50:59.030 --> 03:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
savings would be used and while
 
03:50:59.040 --> 03:51:00.309 align:start position:0%
savings would be used and while
it

03:51:00.309 --> 03:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:51:02.710 --> 03:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
it sounds terrific we could reduce their
 
03:51:04.790 --> 03:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
premiums and things like that i don't
 
03:51:08.790 --> 03:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
see anything in the bill itself that
 
03:51:11.030 --> 03:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
that would guarantee that the
 
03:51:13.189 --> 03:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
policyholder would benefit from this
 
03:51:16.389 --> 03:51:16.399 align:start position:0%
change and we're saying that we we would
 
03:51:19.349 --> 03:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
allow them to do this study make the
 
03:51:19.359 --> 03:51:21.030 align:start position:0%
allow them to do this study make the
determination

03:51:21.030 --> 03:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
determination
 
03:51:23.750 --> 03:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
um without the people having a voice and
 
03:51:23.760 --> 03:51:25.189 align:start position:0%
um without the people having a voice and
that

03:51:25.189 --> 03:51:25.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:51:25.199 --> 03:51:26.389 align:start position:0%
that
is

03:51:26.389 --> 03:51:26.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:51:27.670 --> 03:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
03:51:29.750 --> 03:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um it takes
 
03:51:33.189 --> 03:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
about 18 months to start an exchange so
 
03:51:35.590 --> 03:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
the earliest we would see this start
 
03:51:39.110 --> 03:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
would be uh january of 2024 at which
 
03:51:40.469 --> 03:51:40.479 align:start position:0%
point it would part of the budgetary
 
03:51:42.309 --> 03:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
process of the next legislature anyways
 
03:51:44.790 --> 03:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
i believe so i agree with you it doesn't
 
03:51:46.710 --> 03:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
specifically say what's going to happen
 
03:51:48.309 --> 03:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
with the money that's a policy decision
 
03:51:50.389 --> 03:51:50.399 align:start position:0%
for the legislature at that time to
 
03:51:50.399 --> 03:51:52.710 align:start position:0%
for the legislature at that time to
decide

03:51:52.710 --> 03:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
decide
 
03:51:54.550 --> 03:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:51:56.790 --> 03:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um i'm a little bit
 
03:51:59.670 --> 03:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
confused about the status of this
 
03:52:02.790 --> 03:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
exchange or enterprise is it is it a a
 
03:52:04.950 --> 03:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
private enterprise is it a public
 
03:52:06.950 --> 03:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
enterprise or is it sort of a
 
03:52:09.429 --> 03:52:09.439 align:start position:0%
quasi-public private enterprise the
 
03:52:11.510 --> 03:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
exchange itself i think mr sparks is
 
03:52:12.630 --> 03:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
probably better able to answer that in
 
03:52:14.870 --> 03:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
his testimony he has had experience
 
03:52:17.189 --> 03:52:17.199 align:start position:0%
running various exchanges um so i'll
 
03:52:21.990 --> 03:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:24.550 --> 03:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead
 
03:52:27.269 --> 03:52:27.279 align:start position:0%
thanks so much
 
03:52:29.030 --> 03:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members i
 
03:52:31.349 --> 03:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to testify
 
03:52:33.510 --> 03:52:33.520 align:start position:0%

uh this bill and uh
 
03:52:50.389 --> 03:52:50.399 align:start position:0%
the need for uh new hampshire to
 
03:52:52.309 --> 03:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
really take the chance to
 
03:52:53.750 --> 03:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
exert greater control over its
 
03:52:55.269 --> 03:52:55.279 align:start position:0%
healthcare future
 
03:52:56.950 --> 03:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
prior to joining just a little bit about
 
03:52:59.269 --> 03:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
myself prior to joining get insured
 
03:53:02.469 --> 03:53:02.479 align:start position:0%
i helped the chief information officer
 
03:53:04.790 --> 03:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
role at the dc
 
03:53:07.189 --> 03:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
health insurance agency
 
03:53:09.269 --> 03:53:09.279 align:start position:0%
d.c health link which was the
 
03:53:11.990 --> 03:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
state-based exchange for the district of
 
03:53:12.000 --> 03:53:13.429 align:start position:0%
state-based exchange for the district of
columbia

03:53:13.429 --> 03:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
columbia
 
03:53:15.830 --> 03:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
so i was in a senior policy
 
03:53:18.150 --> 03:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
senior leadership position in one of the
 
03:53:19.990 --> 03:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
state-based exchanges
 
03:53:23.030 --> 03:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
that mr bregman spoke about
 
03:53:26.150 --> 03:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
in my four years in that capacity i had
 
03:53:28.469 --> 03:53:28.479 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to work on
 
03:53:29.910 --> 03:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
the marketplace's successful
 
03:53:32.710 --> 03:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
implementation and operations uh prior
 
03:53:32.720 --> 03:53:33.590 align:start position:0%
implementation and operations uh prior
to

03:53:33.590 --> 03:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:53:35.990 --> 03:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
my experience with dc link
 
03:53:37.910 --> 03:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
i worked at enroll america which was the
 
03:53:40.309 --> 03:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
national nonprofit that was focused on
 
03:53:42.229 --> 03:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
education and outreach
 
03:53:42.239 --> 03:53:44.150 align:start position:0%
education and outreach
around

03:53:44.150 --> 03:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
around
 
03:53:46.309 --> 03:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
health insurance
 
03:53:48.630 --> 03:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
so based on those experiences my more
 
03:53:51.189 --> 03:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
than 10 years in the public and private
 
03:53:53.830 --> 03:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
sectors in healthcare policy i can tell
 
03:53:56.150 --> 03:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
you the firsthand uh tell you firsthand
 
03:53:58.950 --> 03:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
of the need uh for states to really take
 
03:53:58.960 --> 03:53:59.910 align:start position:0%
of the need uh for states to really take
control

03:53:59.910 --> 03:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
control
 
03:54:03.110 --> 03:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
and regulate uh and and and take charge
 
03:54:05.750 --> 03:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
over their health insurance markets
 
03:54:08.309 --> 03:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
um i believe that states rather than the
 
03:54:09.670 --> 03:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
03:54:11.510 --> 03:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
are in the best position to be
 
03:54:14.229 --> 03:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
responsive to and to address the unique
 
03:54:15.990 --> 03:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
needs that you have
 
03:54:17.590 --> 03:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
in your markets
 
03:54:19.189 --> 03:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
unique needs for your citizens your
 
03:54:22.070 --> 03:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
communities you're at the forefront of
 
03:54:24.070 --> 03:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
finding creative and innovative
 
03:54:26.630 --> 03:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
approaches to address the crises that we
 
03:54:29.110 --> 03:54:29.120 align:start position:0%
all know exist
 
03:54:31.349 --> 03:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
in healthcare in health insurance
 
03:54:35.189 --> 03:54:35.199 align:start position:0%
whether it's costs inequities
 
03:54:35.199 --> 03:54:36.550 align:start position:0%
whether it's costs inequities
coverage

03:54:36.550 --> 03:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
03:54:36.560 --> 03:54:38.469 align:start position:0%
coverage
issues

03:54:38.469 --> 03:54:38.479 align:start position:0%
issues
 
03:54:38.479 --> 03:54:39.269 align:start position:0%
issues
and

03:54:39.269 --> 03:54:39.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:54:42.389 --> 03:54:42.399 align:start position:0%
what we've seen in my experience is that
 
03:54:44.950 --> 03:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
establishing a state-based exchange can
 
03:54:46.469 --> 03:54:46.479 align:start position:0%
be an important step to help new
 
03:54:49.830 --> 03:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire begin to chart its own course
 
03:54:51.189 --> 03:54:51.199 align:start position:0%
in health care
 
03:54:51.199 --> 03:54:52.309 align:start position:0%
in health care
so

03:54:52.309 --> 03:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:54:55.910 --> 03:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
to a prior question under federal law
 
03:54:58.070 --> 03:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
each state
 
03:54:58.080 --> 03:54:59.189 align:start position:0%
each state
must

03:54:59.189 --> 03:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
must
 
03:55:00.950 --> 03:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
have a
 
03:55:03.510 --> 03:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
exchange a public health
 
03:55:05.429 --> 03:55:05.439 align:start position:0%
insurance exchange
 
03:55:07.510 --> 03:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
whether the federal government runs that
 
03:55:08.790 --> 03:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
exchange as
 
03:55:11.429 --> 03:55:11.439 align:start position:0%
it does for new hampshire on
 
03:55:13.670 --> 03:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
healthcare.gov or whether the state
 
03:55:16.070 --> 03:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
establishes a state-based marketplace
 
03:55:17.750 --> 03:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
that operates on a
 
03:55:20.150 --> 03:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
a platform that the state develops
 
03:55:20.160 --> 03:55:21.269 align:start position:0%
a platform that the state develops
in-house

03:55:21.269 --> 03:55:21.279 align:start position:0%
in-house
 
03:55:23.510 --> 03:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
as some states have done or whether they
 
03:55:27.429 --> 03:55:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:29.030 --> 03:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
each state
 
03:55:30.790 --> 03:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
must have a
 
03:55:33.189 --> 03:55:33.199 align:start position:0%
under federal law must have a private or
 
03:55:36.710 --> 03:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
must have a a health insurance exchange
 
03:55:38.550 --> 03:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
this is not optional
 
03:55:40.309 --> 03:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
in 2022
 
03:55:43.429 --> 03:55:43.439 align:start position:0%
over 52 000 granite staters
 
03:55:46.389 --> 03:55:46.399 align:start position:0%
enrolled in health insurance through
 
03:55:46.399 --> 03:55:47.910 align:start position:0%
enrolled in health insurance through
healthcare.gov

03:55:47.910 --> 03:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
healthcare.gov
 
03:55:49.510 --> 03:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
that was a fairly significant increase
 
03:55:51.269 --> 03:55:51.279 align:start position:0%
over the prior year which i believe was
 
03:55:54.469 --> 03:55:54.479 align:start position:0%
about 44 000 46 000 in that range
 
03:55:56.550 --> 03:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
um so this is not an insignificant
 
03:55:58.150 --> 03:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
number of folks who are who are
 
03:55:59.990 --> 03:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
enrolling in coverage
 
03:56:00.000 --> 03:56:01.189 align:start position:0%
enrolling in coverage
um

03:56:01.189 --> 03:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:03.670 --> 03:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
peter mentioned that the 1332 waiver is
 
03:56:06.469 --> 03:56:06.479 align:start position:0%
a great example of where the state can
 
03:56:08.630 --> 03:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
take you know when states take
 
03:56:13.030 --> 03:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
local control and responsibility for
 
03:56:15.349 --> 03:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
state health policy you can really drive
 
03:56:18.070 --> 03:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
innovation mention that that that
 
03:56:19.750 --> 03:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
decrease in
 
03:56:22.950 --> 03:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
premiums in year one
 
03:56:25.349 --> 03:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
and and um
 
03:56:27.349 --> 03:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's
 
03:56:30.150 --> 03:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
a function of that reinsurance program
 
03:56:32.950 --> 03:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh there was a question earlier about
 
03:56:32.960 --> 03:56:33.990 align:start position:0%
uh there was a question earlier about
um

03:56:33.990 --> 03:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:36.469 --> 03:56:36.479 align:start position:0%
what states have been successful
 
03:56:38.389 --> 03:56:38.399 align:start position:0%
in establishing
 
03:56:38.399 --> 03:56:39.510 align:start position:0%
in establishing
um

03:56:39.510 --> 03:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:42.229 --> 03:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
state-based exchanges
 
03:56:45.030 --> 03:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
and uh i would point to pennsylvania as
 
03:56:49.429 --> 03:56:49.439 align:start position:0%
an example so in pennsylvania in 2020
 
03:56:51.590 --> 03:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
they established a state-based exchange
 
03:56:53.429 --> 03:56:53.439 align:start position:0%
they happened to use our technology get
 
03:56:55.349 --> 03:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
insurance platform
 
03:56:57.269 --> 03:56:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh in addition to establishing a
 
03:56:58.710 --> 03:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
state-based exchange they also
 
03:57:01.750 --> 03:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
established a reinsurance program that
 
03:57:01.760 --> 03:57:02.710 align:start position:0%
established a reinsurance program that
year

03:57:02.710 --> 03:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:57:05.910 --> 03:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
and this is uh and and what they were
 
03:57:07.189 --> 03:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
able to do
 
03:57:11.269 --> 03:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
is establish both of those programs
 
03:57:11.279 --> 03:57:12.870 align:start position:0%
is establish both of those programs
for

03:57:12.870 --> 03:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:57:15.349 --> 03:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
essentially the cost of one program and
 
03:57:16.950 --> 03:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
they were able to save money and they
 
03:57:18.830 --> 03:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
were able to drive down the cost of
 
03:57:20.870 --> 03:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
premiums for
 
03:57:23.110 --> 03:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
their consumers they were able to do all
 
03:57:24.870 --> 03:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
of that
 
03:57:27.349 --> 03:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
save money
 
03:57:29.429 --> 03:57:29.439 align:start position:0%
not redirect funds to the federal
 
03:57:31.510 --> 03:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
government because that
 
03:57:33.910 --> 03:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
spigot got turned off they didn't have
 
03:57:36.150 --> 03:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
to send those
 
03:57:39.590 --> 03:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
those those federal user fees to
 
03:57:41.269 --> 03:57:41.279 align:start position:0%
the federal government because they were
 
03:57:44.389 --> 03:57:44.399 align:start position:0%
just using their state-based exchange
 
03:57:46.150 --> 03:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
and that's an example of a successful
 
03:57:48.950 --> 03:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
program and and in the most recent open
 
03:57:51.670 --> 03:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
enrollment period they saw about 11
 
03:57:53.750 --> 03:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
percent enrollment growth so they're
 
03:57:53.760 --> 03:57:54.870 align:start position:0%
percent enrollment growth so they're
operating

03:57:54.870 --> 03:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
operating
 
03:57:57.429 --> 03:57:57.439 align:start position:0%
a reinsurance program that's being paid
 
03:57:57.439 --> 03:57:58.550 align:start position:0%
a reinsurance program that's being paid
for

03:57:58.550 --> 03:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:58:00.309 --> 03:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
not by
 
03:58:02.710 --> 03:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
an assessment against all on all
 
03:58:05.030 --> 03:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
carriers but it's being paid for it's
 
03:58:06.870 --> 03:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
being funded by
 
03:58:10.070 --> 03:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
these lower reduced user fees and
 
03:58:11.910 --> 03:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
they've been able to reduce
 
03:58:13.910 --> 03:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
consumer premiums on the individual
 
03:58:16.150 --> 03:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
marketplace so all of these programs
 
03:58:21.910 --> 03:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:23.990 --> 03:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
i'd also point to the pandemic as being
 
03:58:26.309 --> 03:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
a real life example of how state-based
 
03:58:26.319 --> 03:58:28.150 align:start position:0%
a real life example of how state-based
exchanges

03:58:28.150 --> 03:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
exchanges
 
03:58:30.070 --> 03:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
are able to provide states with
 
03:58:32.870 --> 03:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
flexibility policy flexibility it's one
 
03:58:34.309 --> 03:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
of the key
 
03:58:36.070 --> 03:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
components of state-based marketplaces
 
03:58:37.910 --> 03:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
when you're on the federal marketplace
 
03:58:39.670 --> 03:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
you're tied to whatever the federal
 
03:58:41.830 --> 03:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
government does from a technology
 
03:58:45.030 --> 03:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
standpoint they make decisions
 
03:58:45.040 --> 03:58:45.750 align:start position:0%
standpoint they make decisions
the

03:58:45.750 --> 03:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:58:47.670 --> 03:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
36 states that use it that use
 
03:58:47.680 --> 03:58:49.349 align:start position:0%
36 states that use it that use
healthcare.gov

03:58:49.349 --> 03:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
healthcare.gov
 
03:58:49.359 --> 03:58:50.309 align:start position:0%
healthcare.gov
are

03:58:50.309 --> 03:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:58:51.910 --> 03:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
going that direction right you don't get
 
03:58:53.269 --> 03:58:53.279 align:start position:0%
a choice
 
03:58:54.710 --> 03:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
if you if you're operating on a
 
03:58:56.229 --> 03:58:56.239 align:start position:0%
state-based marketplace on your own
 
03:58:58.550 --> 03:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
platform you get to make your own policy
 
03:59:00.389 --> 03:59:00.399 align:start position:0%
decisions we saw that
 
03:59:03.349 --> 03:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic during covid states
 
03:59:05.269 --> 03:59:05.279 align:start position:0%
running their own platforms again
 
03:59:06.870 --> 03:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's a state that developed
 
03:59:09.429 --> 03:59:09.439 align:start position:0%
their own technology a state that used
 
03:59:12.870 --> 03:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
our you know get insured uh operated
 
03:59:14.550 --> 03:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
platform or state that used another
 
03:59:17.030 --> 03:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
vendor's platform uh were able they were
 
03:59:19.510 --> 03:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
able to make those policies those those
 
03:59:21.990 --> 03:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
local policy decisions that made sense
 
03:59:22.950 --> 03:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
for their
 
03:59:27.030 --> 03:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh community uh and for their consumers
 
03:59:27.040 --> 03:59:28.389 align:start position:0%
uh community uh and for their consumers
um

03:59:28.389 --> 03:59:28.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:30.229 --> 03:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
an example of that is uh special
 
03:59:32.070 --> 03:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
enrollment period so
 
03:59:32.080 --> 03:59:33.429 align:start position:0%
enrollment period so
uh

03:59:33.429 --> 03:59:33.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:59:36.389 --> 03:59:36.399 align:start position:0%
wanting to to ensure that consumers who
 
03:59:39.030 --> 03:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
were impacted by the pandemic could come
 
03:59:41.189 --> 03:59:41.199 align:start position:0%
in and enroll
 
03:59:41.199 --> 03:59:43.510 align:start position:0%
in and enroll
uh

03:59:43.510 --> 03:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:46.469 --> 03:59:46.479 align:start position:0%
irrespective of the time of the year
 
03:59:47.910 --> 03:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
they were able to make those system
 
03:59:49.990 --> 03:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
changes and do that so
 
03:59:51.750 --> 03:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
very quickly
 
03:59:54.070 --> 03:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh i would i would just point to three
 
03:59:56.150 --> 03:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
overarching reasons why
 
03:59:59.349 --> 03:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
um we believe that new hampshire should
 
04:00:01.750 --> 04:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
establish a state-based marketplace one
 
04:00:04.070 --> 04:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
we've talked about it uh
 
04:00:06.630 --> 04:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
gives you the ability to establish local
 
04:00:10.229 --> 04:00:10.239 align:start position:0%
control more control over the direction
 
04:00:13.110 --> 04:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
of the health insurance market
 
04:00:15.750 --> 04:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
it helps you protect against restrictive
 
04:00:17.590 --> 04:00:17.600 align:start position:0%
and potentially harmful
 
04:00:19.670 --> 04:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
federal regulations
 
04:00:21.830 --> 04:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
number two again we've spoken a bit
 
04:00:24.229 --> 04:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
about this
 
04:00:25.510 --> 04:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
we're now in a place where there's
 
04:00:27.670 --> 04:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
better technology
 
04:00:29.830 --> 04:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
and and we've been able to drive down
 
04:00:34.309 --> 04:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
costs it's much easier to transition
 
04:00:34.319 --> 04:00:35.510 align:start position:0%
costs it's much easier to transition
to

04:00:35.510 --> 04:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:00:38.150 --> 04:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
a state-based marketplace than it was
 
04:00:40.950 --> 04:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
four five six seven eight nine years ago
 
04:00:43.269 --> 04:00:43.279 align:start position:0%
uh getting sure it is currently
 
04:00:45.670 --> 04:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh transitioning georgia state of
 
04:00:48.950 --> 04:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
georgia off of the federal marketplace
 
04:00:52.150 --> 04:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
onto the get insured platform
 
04:00:54.469 --> 04:00:54.479 align:start position:0%
we started that project in january of
 
04:00:55.670 --> 04:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
this year
 
04:00:57.750 --> 04:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to go live in on november
 
04:00:59.590 --> 04:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
1st of this year
 
04:01:01.349 --> 04:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
very short timeline
 
04:01:03.670 --> 04:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
going to be successful
 
04:01:06.710 --> 04:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
better technology lower costs
 
04:01:08.950 --> 04:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
and then third as was previously
 
04:01:10.870 --> 04:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned a well-designed state-based
 
04:01:12.870 --> 04:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
marketplace can really serve as a
 
04:01:15.189 --> 04:01:15.199 align:start position:0%
foundation for future
 
04:01:18.150 --> 04:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh creative and market-based reforms so
 
04:01:20.309 --> 04:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
as you're thinking about you know where
 
04:01:21.670 --> 04:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
you want to go
 
04:01:21.680 --> 04:01:23.670 align:start position:0%
you want to go
directionally

04:01:23.670 --> 04:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
directionally
 
04:01:25.590 --> 04:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
from a regulatory standpoint from a
 
04:01:28.710 --> 04:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
policy standpoint having that technology
 
04:01:30.710 --> 04:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
framework in place
 
04:01:32.710 --> 04:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
gives you the flexibility that you don't
 
04:01:34.389 --> 04:01:34.399 align:start position:0%
have today
 
04:01:36.790 --> 04:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
running on the federal platform
 
04:01:38.870 --> 04:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
let me stop there and and see what
 
04:01:40.790 --> 04:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
additional questions
 
04:01:42.710 --> 04:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
the committee has
 
04:01:46.070 --> 04:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative terry
 
04:01:47.910 --> 04:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you sir and thank you for uh
 
04:01:50.070 --> 04:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
remembering my question and providing
 
04:01:53.349 --> 04:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
that information that initial question
 
04:01:53.359 --> 04:01:55.429 align:start position:0%
that information that initial question
um

04:01:55.429 --> 04:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:57.510 --> 04:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
this sounds like a train that's moving
 
04:01:59.590 --> 04:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
in just one direction
 
04:02:02.790 --> 04:02:02.800 align:start position:0%
and to be more specific and to be clear
 
04:02:04.550 --> 04:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
appears as though
 
04:02:06.630 --> 04:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
there are increasing number of states
 
04:02:08.790 --> 04:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
that are moving from the federal
 
04:02:12.790 --> 04:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
model to the state based models
 
04:02:15.830 --> 04:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
is in fact that the case
 
04:02:15.840 --> 04:02:18.630 align:start position:0%
is in fact that the case
um

04:02:18.630 --> 04:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:21.030 --> 04:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
can it go the other way
 
04:02:22.309 --> 04:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
the reason i asked that question is
 
04:02:25.030 --> 04:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
because i i came from a state that
 
04:02:27.750 --> 04:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
adopted a state-based model initially
 
04:02:31.110 --> 04:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
and it had to be kind a lot of problems
 
04:02:32.710 --> 04:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
and there was talk about
 
04:02:34.309 --> 04:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
giving it up and going back to the
 
04:02:35.670 --> 04:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
federal model
 
04:02:37.189 --> 04:02:37.199 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:02:38.790 --> 04:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
so that i don't have to keep asking if i
 
04:02:41.429 --> 04:02:41.439 align:start position:0%
can ask follow-up questions
 
04:02:44.309 --> 04:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
um is it in fact true that there are
 
04:02:45.750 --> 04:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
increasing number of states that are
 
04:02:48.389 --> 04:02:48.399 align:start position:0%
moving from federal to state
 
04:02:49.830 --> 04:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
have any states that you're aware of
 
04:02:51.429 --> 04:02:51.439 align:start position:0%
going back
 
04:02:54.550 --> 04:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
to the federal model and i guess finally
 
04:02:58.630 --> 04:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
with respect to the state-based models
 
04:03:00.630 --> 04:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
what was the the base
 
04:03:05.429 --> 04:03:05.439 align:start position:0%
beginning in 20 what year was it 2010
 
04:03:05.439 --> 04:03:06.229 align:start position:0%
beginning in 20 what year was it 2010
when

04:03:06.229 --> 04:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:03:07.670 --> 04:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
when this went into then the law went
 
04:03:09.990 --> 04:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
into effect and how many have come on
 
04:03:12.150 --> 04:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
board since then
 
04:03:13.910 --> 04:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
so it's really a three-part question and
 
04:03:13.920 --> 04:03:15.030 align:start position:0%
so it's really a three-part question and
i

04:03:15.030 --> 04:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:03:16.389 --> 04:03:16.399 align:start position:0%
did that so that i didn't have to keep
 
04:03:17.750 --> 04:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
asking if i could ask follow-up
 
04:03:19.189 --> 04:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
questions so thank you for making a note
 
04:03:21.030 --> 04:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
of that i'd appreciate it absolutely
 
04:03:22.150 --> 04:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
there so
 
04:03:24.229 --> 04:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
they're great questions um if i could
 
04:03:26.229 --> 04:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
take them a little bit out of order
 
04:03:26.239 --> 04:03:28.550 align:start position:0%
take them a little bit out of order
um

04:03:28.550 --> 04:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:28.560 --> 04:03:29.670 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:03:29.670 --> 04:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:03:31.429 --> 04:03:31.439 align:start position:0%
in 2019
 
04:03:34.070 --> 04:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
one state transitioned from
 
04:03:36.550 --> 04:03:36.560 align:start position:0%
the federal platform to
 
04:03:38.790 --> 04:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
a state-based exchange
 
04:03:42.870 --> 04:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
in 2022 states did in 2021 three states
 
04:03:42.880 --> 04:03:44.229 align:start position:0%
in 2022 states did in 2021 three states
did

04:03:44.229 --> 04:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
did
 
04:03:47.510 --> 04:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
and in 2022 one state is
 
04:03:47.520 --> 04:03:48.710 align:start position:0%
and in 2022 one state is
um

04:03:48.710 --> 04:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:48.720 --> 04:03:49.990 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:03:49.990 --> 04:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:03:50.000 --> 04:03:52.710 align:start position:0%
so
it's

04:03:52.710 --> 04:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:54.550 --> 04:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
it's a trend
 
04:03:54.560 --> 04:03:56.309 align:start position:0%
it's a trend
um

04:03:56.309 --> 04:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:56.319 --> 04:03:57.349 align:start position:0%
um
but

04:03:57.349 --> 04:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:04:01.269 --> 04:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
uh it it it's certainly a trend and and
 
04:04:05.349 --> 04:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:11.349 --> 04:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:14.309 --> 04:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
do some quick math here um
 
04:04:17.110 --> 04:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
about 40 to 45
 
04:04:17.120 --> 04:04:18.389 align:start position:0%
about 40 to 45
increase

04:04:18.389 --> 04:04:18.399 align:start position:0%
increase
 
04:04:21.189 --> 04:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
from the baseline uh
 
04:04:24.710 --> 04:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
from between 2018 and 2022.
 
04:04:27.349 --> 04:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
um in terms of how many states
 
04:04:28.550 --> 04:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
there were
 
04:04:31.830 --> 04:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
initially in 2020 or in 2010 i should
 
04:04:31.840 --> 04:04:32.710 align:start position:0%
initially in 2020 or in 2010 i should
say

04:04:32.710 --> 04:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:04:34.790 --> 04:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
um that we'd have to i think come back
 
04:04:35.830 --> 04:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
to you on
 
04:04:37.670 --> 04:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh unless you want to unless you want me
 
04:04:38.870 --> 04:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
to sit here and try to think through
 
04:04:40.389 --> 04:04:40.399 align:start position:0%
real quickly which i don't think you
 
04:04:42.710 --> 04:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
want me to do um i'd rather not guess at
 
04:04:44.630 --> 04:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
it and and would rather get back to you
 
04:04:47.110 --> 04:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
on that and how he gave up and how many
 
04:04:48.790 --> 04:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
gave up um
 
04:04:50.710 --> 04:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
so a couple did a couple transitioned
 
04:04:53.030 --> 04:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
off um
 
04:04:53.040 --> 04:04:53.910 align:start position:0%
off um
uh

04:04:53.910 --> 04:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:04:56.070 --> 04:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
nevada transitioned
 
04:04:57.510 --> 04:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
back to
 
04:04:59.990 --> 04:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
nevada became a
 
04:05:01.830 --> 04:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
state-based marketplace
 
04:05:04.389 --> 04:05:04.399 align:start position:0%
i believe in 2010
 
04:05:06.710 --> 04:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
in early days
 
04:05:08.790 --> 04:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
had an unsuccessful
 
04:05:11.110 --> 04:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
launch as a state-based marketplace went
 
04:05:13.670 --> 04:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
back to the federal marketplace
 
04:05:13.680 --> 04:05:15.189 align:start position:0%
back to the federal marketplace
transitioned

04:05:15.189 --> 04:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
transitioned
 
04:05:17.670 --> 04:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
back to a state-based exchange on our
 
04:05:20.070 --> 04:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
platform on the get insured platform
 
04:05:22.469 --> 04:05:22.479 align:start position:0%
in 2019
 
04:05:29.269 --> 04:05:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:29.279 --> 04:05:30.790 align:start position:0%
 
kentucky

04:05:30.790 --> 04:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
kentucky
 
04:05:32.710 --> 04:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
transition kentucky was a successful
 
04:05:34.309 --> 04:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
launch in 2010.
 
04:05:37.269 --> 04:05:37.279 align:start position:0%
they moved off of they moved from the
 
04:05:39.750 --> 04:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
state-based exchange back to the federal
 
04:05:39.760 --> 04:05:41.110 align:start position:0%
state-based exchange back to the federal
platform

04:05:41.110 --> 04:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
platform
 
04:05:42.870 --> 04:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
in the mid-2010s
 
04:05:45.750 --> 04:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
and in 2021 went back to being a
 
04:05:47.830 --> 04:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
state-based exchange
 
04:05:49.750 --> 04:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
um so there's been a couple of those
 
04:05:52.070 --> 04:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
that have gone back and forth
 
04:05:52.080 --> 04:05:54.710 align:start position:0%
that have gone back and forth
um

04:05:54.710 --> 04:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:56.630 --> 04:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
i'd have to think real hard and again
 
04:05:59.110 --> 04:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
probably do research and and and get you
 
04:06:02.150 --> 04:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up information on any that have
 
04:06:04.389 --> 04:06:04.399 align:start position:0%
that were state-based exchanges and are
 
04:06:05.670 --> 04:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
still operating on the federal
 
04:06:05.680 --> 04:06:07.429 align:start position:0%
still operating on the federal
marketplace

04:06:07.429 --> 04:06:07.439 align:start position:0%
marketplace
 
04:06:09.830 --> 04:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
mr trump one quick follow then
 
04:06:12.950 --> 04:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question thank you
 
04:06:14.710 --> 04:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
it seems as though
 
04:06:17.830 --> 04:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:20.070 --> 04:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
the passage of time
 
04:06:23.750 --> 04:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
and the continuing work in developing
 
04:06:23.760 --> 04:06:25.429 align:start position:0%
and the continuing work in developing
refining

04:06:25.429 --> 04:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
refining
 
04:06:27.269 --> 04:06:27.279 align:start position:0%
state-based exchanges
 
04:06:29.510 --> 04:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
that the trend is
 
04:06:32.309 --> 04:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
towards states looking more favorably on
 
04:06:34.630 --> 04:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
adopting their own models perhaps for
 
04:06:35.990 --> 04:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
some of the reasons that have already
 
04:06:38.389 --> 04:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
been cited in the initial testimony
 
04:06:39.910 --> 04:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
would that be
 
04:06:39.920 --> 04:06:41.429 align:start position:0%
would that be
generally

04:06:41.429 --> 04:06:41.439 align:start position:0%
generally
 
04:06:44.550 --> 04:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
true it was a statement it would okay
 
04:06:45.670 --> 04:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:06:48.229 --> 04:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
thank you and if i could jump in
 
04:06:50.710 --> 04:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
ribs and fargo
 
04:06:53.349 --> 04:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um again i have two
 
04:06:53.359 --> 04:06:55.269 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um again i have two
questions

04:06:55.269 --> 04:06:55.279 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:06:57.030 --> 04:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
would you say that the growth in this
 
04:06:59.830 --> 04:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
industry has been a byproduct in the
 
04:07:01.830 --> 04:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
last couple years of the
 
04:07:04.150 --> 04:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
great resignation and the covet issues
 
04:07:06.389 --> 04:07:06.399 align:start position:0%
because people have become unemployed
 
04:07:08.389 --> 04:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
and have had to search out
 
04:07:10.469 --> 04:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
insurance solutions because they aren't
 
04:07:13.590 --> 04:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
being provided by an employer
 
04:07:16.150 --> 04:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
it's an interesting question i i
 
04:07:18.309 --> 04:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
so given the
 
04:07:18.319 --> 04:07:19.349 align:start position:0%
so given the
um

04:07:19.349 --> 04:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:21.750 --> 04:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
the law the relatively long
 
04:07:24.389 --> 04:07:24.399 align:start position:0%
runway that was earlier alluded to
 
04:07:26.469 --> 04:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
that we typically see so
 
04:07:26.479 --> 04:07:28.070 align:start position:0%
that we typically see so
generally

04:07:28.070 --> 04:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
generally
 
04:07:29.269 --> 04:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
it takes
 
04:07:30.550 --> 04:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
a fairly
 
04:07:32.150 --> 04:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
long time
 
04:07:32.160 --> 04:07:33.189 align:start position:0%
long time
from

04:07:33.189 --> 04:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:07:35.269 --> 04:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
the time that a state makes a decision
 
04:07:37.429 --> 04:07:37.439 align:start position:0%
that it wants to establish a state-based
 
04:07:37.439 --> 04:07:38.790 align:start position:0%
that it wants to establish a state-based
marketplace

04:07:38.790 --> 04:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
marketplace
 
04:07:41.030 --> 04:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
from that point to the time they issue
 
04:07:42.229 --> 04:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
an rfp
 
04:07:44.149 --> 04:07:44.159 align:start position:0%
to the time that a contract's awarded to
 
04:07:46.229 --> 04:07:46.239 align:start position:0%
the time that it actually goes live
 
04:07:48.870 --> 04:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
that's typically
 
04:07:52.550 --> 04:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
two to two and a half to three years
 
04:07:55.670 --> 04:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
um virginia is an example here
 
04:07:58.550 --> 04:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
virginia passed legislation in
 
04:08:02.070 --> 04:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
2019 2020
 
04:08:04.630 --> 04:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
to become a state-based exchange
 
04:08:07.750 --> 04:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
they just last friday
 
04:08:10.630 --> 04:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
issued a request for proposal
 
04:08:13.349 --> 04:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
first of april um so that's a you know
 
04:08:14.389 --> 04:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
like a
 
04:08:16.070 --> 04:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
two and a half year
 
04:08:16.080 --> 04:08:17.189 align:start position:0%
two and a half year
period

04:08:17.189 --> 04:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
period
 
04:08:20.229 --> 04:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
to get an rfp out on the request for a
 
04:08:20.239 --> 04:08:21.429 align:start position:0%
to get an rfp out on the request for a
proposal

04:08:21.429 --> 04:08:21.439 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
04:08:23.110 --> 04:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
out on the street
 
04:08:25.670 --> 04:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
um for a
 
04:08:28.070 --> 04:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
exchange that will go live on november
 
04:08:32.389 --> 04:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:32.399 --> 04:08:33.670 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:08:33.670 --> 04:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:08:36.149 --> 04:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
it it it may be
 
04:08:36.159 --> 04:08:38.149 align:start position:0%
it it it may be
that

04:08:38.149 --> 04:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:08:41.349 --> 04:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
that that there's some of that at play
 
04:08:43.750 --> 04:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative but i think it's more a
 
04:08:45.110 --> 04:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
function of
 
04:08:45.120 --> 04:08:46.389 align:start position:0%
function of
states

04:08:46.389 --> 04:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:08:48.790 --> 04:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
seeing the benefit and and talking to
 
04:08:50.070 --> 04:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
one another
 
04:08:50.080 --> 04:08:51.750 align:start position:0%
one another
about

04:08:51.750 --> 04:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:08:51.760 --> 04:08:52.550 align:start position:0%
about
uh

04:08:52.550 --> 04:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:08:55.429 --> 04:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
the fact that these products are now
 
04:08:57.750 --> 04:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
not costing in the early days
 
04:08:57.760 --> 04:08:59.990 align:start position:0%
not costing in the early days
representative

04:08:59.990 --> 04:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:09:01.590 --> 04:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
to build a
 
04:09:03.349 --> 04:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
from scratch because these products were
 
04:09:04.630 --> 04:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
not available
 
04:09:07.110 --> 04:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
off the shelf
 
04:09:09.189 --> 04:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
these products
 
04:09:13.349 --> 04:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
these products cost 100 120 150 million
 
04:09:15.830 --> 04:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
dollars to build that wasn't even
 
04:09:18.070 --> 04:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
talking about maintenance costs
 
04:09:20.309 --> 04:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
and and the cost
 
04:09:22.229 --> 04:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
to to to
 
04:09:25.349 --> 04:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
implement these now is is a small
 
04:09:26.870 --> 04:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
fraction of that
 
04:09:29.830 --> 04:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
and so i think it's more about
 
04:09:32.389 --> 04:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
these just being much
 
04:09:34.950 --> 04:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
easier to implement and the benefits to
 
04:09:36.870 --> 04:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
state being much more to states being
 
04:09:38.149 --> 04:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
much more
 
04:09:38.159 --> 04:09:39.670 align:start position:0%
much more
straightforward

04:09:39.670 --> 04:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
straightforward
 
04:09:42.469 --> 04:09:42.479 align:start position:0%
when looking at
 
04:09:43.510 --> 04:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
when you
 
04:09:45.830 --> 04:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
establish a state-based exchange
 
04:09:48.469 --> 04:09:48.479 align:start position:0%
you get the benefits of
 
04:09:51.030 --> 04:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
things like better integration with your
 
04:09:52.950 --> 04:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
state medicaid agency
 
04:09:52.960 --> 04:09:54.149 align:start position:0%
state medicaid agency
so

04:09:54.149 --> 04:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:09:54.159 --> 04:09:56.070 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:09:56.070 --> 04:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:57.750 --> 04:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
right now when
 
04:09:59.870 --> 04:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
you're operating on
 
04:09:59.880 --> 04:10:01.510 align:start position:0%
you're operating on
healthcare.gov

04:10:01.510 --> 04:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
healthcare.gov
 
04:10:01.520 --> 04:10:02.469 align:start position:0%
healthcare.gov
um

04:10:02.469 --> 04:10:02.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:05.269 --> 04:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
if your state medicaid agency
 
04:10:07.750 --> 04:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
needs to make a change a tech you know
 
04:10:09.990 --> 04:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
technical change they've got to reach
 
04:10:12.309 --> 04:10:12.319 align:start position:0%
out to somebody in baltimore and maybe
 
04:10:14.950 --> 04:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
they'll get a call back maybe they won't
 
04:10:16.229 --> 04:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
just that that
 
04:10:18.229 --> 04:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
that that communication it's not like
 
04:10:19.910 --> 04:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
going down the hall or going across the
 
04:10:22.830 --> 04:10:22.840 align:start position:0%
street and having a conversation
 
04:10:25.990 --> 04:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
um or having a vendor who's on the hook
 
04:10:26.000 --> 04:10:30.550 align:start position:0%
um or having a vendor who's on the hook
contractually

04:10:30.550 --> 04:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:33.349 --> 04:10:33.359 align:start position:0%
so so being able to establish that kind
 
04:10:33.359 --> 04:10:34.070 align:start position:0%
so so being able to establish that kind
of

04:10:34.070 --> 04:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:10:36.469 --> 04:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
you know much closer integration between
 
04:10:36.479 --> 04:10:37.750 align:start position:0%
you know much closer integration between
agencies

04:10:37.750 --> 04:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
04:10:40.149 --> 04:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
internally is one example being able to
 
04:10:43.030 --> 04:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
have control over that data
 
04:10:45.349 --> 04:10:45.359 align:start position:0%
again rather than the data living in
 
04:10:47.429 --> 04:10:47.439 align:start position:0%
baltimore not being accessible to the
 
04:10:47.439 --> 04:10:48.389 align:start position:0%
baltimore not being accessible to the
states

04:10:48.389 --> 04:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:10:50.790 --> 04:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
having it be
 
04:10:53.990 --> 04:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
accessible you know at a moment's notice
 
04:10:55.189 --> 04:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
i think it's more about that
 
04:10:57.189 --> 04:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
representative than about
 
04:10:59.510 --> 04:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh the impacts of the pandemic and and
 
04:10:59.520 --> 04:11:01.510 align:start position:0%
uh the impacts of the pandemic and and
covet

04:11:01.510 --> 04:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
covet
 
04:11:03.110 --> 04:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
my second question
 
04:11:06.070 --> 04:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
you talk a lot about the disadvantages
 
04:11:08.229 --> 04:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
of the federal program but i think one
 
04:11:10.710 --> 04:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
of the things that i see is the benefit
 
04:11:10.720 --> 04:11:12.550 align:start position:0%
of the things that i see is the benefit
of

04:11:12.550 --> 04:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:11:15.670 --> 04:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
the federal program provides protections
 
04:11:17.429 --> 04:11:17.439 align:start position:0%
that the state
 
04:11:20.950 --> 04:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
could take away from the consumer by
 
04:11:23.830 --> 04:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
not adhering to the
 
04:11:25.830 --> 04:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
conditions of the for instance the
 
04:11:28.870 --> 04:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
affordable care act and the state
 
04:11:30.630 --> 04:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
when they're in control does not have to
 
04:11:32.630 --> 04:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
provide the same benefits
 
04:11:36.309 --> 04:11:36.319 align:start position:0%
they can change the benefit packages at
 
04:11:38.070 --> 04:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
will once the control is in the state
 
04:11:40.630 --> 04:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
and i don't necessarily
 
04:11:42.469 --> 04:11:42.479 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that's an advantage and
 
04:11:44.309 --> 04:11:44.319 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking of a consumer protection
 
04:11:47.670 --> 04:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
perspective and then federal regulations
 
04:11:50.229 --> 04:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
look down on but i i think that they
 
04:11:52.790 --> 04:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
provide a safety net for people to make
 
04:11:55.030 --> 04:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
sure that they have good coverage and
 
04:11:56.950 --> 04:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
that they have the benefits the
 
04:11:59.110 --> 04:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
maternity benefits the pre-existing
 
04:12:01.030 --> 04:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
conditions and all those things that we
 
04:12:02.790 --> 04:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
value here so
 
04:12:02.800 --> 04:12:04.389 align:start position:0%
value here so
um

04:12:04.389 --> 04:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:06.790 --> 04:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
how do you address that i mean once the
 
04:12:09.429 --> 04:12:09.439 align:start position:0%
we give up that control and it it gets
 
04:12:12.149 --> 04:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
to a state level is there
 
04:12:14.630 --> 04:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
are there any guard rails protecting
 
04:12:17.830 --> 04:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
the consumers in the state at that point
 
04:12:20.469 --> 04:12:20.479 align:start position:0%
so so establishing a state-based uh
 
04:12:22.550 --> 04:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
exchange when you establish a
 
04:12:25.349 --> 04:12:25.359 align:start position:0%
state-based exchange
 
04:12:28.309 --> 04:12:28.319 align:start position:0%
part of the process that the state goes
 
04:12:28.319 --> 04:12:29.110 align:start position:0%
part of the process that the state goes
through

04:12:29.110 --> 04:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:12:31.189 --> 04:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
is a comprehensive
 
04:12:33.429 --> 04:12:33.439 align:start position:0%
uh engagement and review
 
04:12:35.510 --> 04:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
with cms
 
04:12:40.389 --> 04:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
and its sub units uh like cisco uh i'm
 
04:12:43.429 --> 04:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
sorry the the center for uh medicaid
 
04:12:46.309 --> 04:12:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh and medicare services uh which is a
 
04:12:48.469 --> 04:12:48.479 align:start position:0%
subunit of uh
 
04:12:49.910 --> 04:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
the federal department of health and
 
04:12:51.349 --> 04:12:51.359 align:start position:0%
human services
 
04:12:51.359 --> 04:12:52.790 align:start position:0%
human services
so

04:12:52.790 --> 04:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:12:52.800 --> 04:12:53.750 align:start position:0%
so
uh

04:12:53.750 --> 04:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:12:55.670 --> 04:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
cms are the
 
04:12:58.550 --> 04:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
are the unit inside of
 
04:13:00.550 --> 04:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
04:13:05.269 --> 04:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
that oversee the affordable care act
 
04:13:05.279 --> 04:13:06.389 align:start position:0%
that oversee the affordable care act
and

04:13:06.389 --> 04:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:13:07.590 --> 04:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
there are
 
04:13:09.189 --> 04:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
there is significantly there are
 
04:13:11.750 --> 04:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
significant regulatory
 
04:13:11.760 --> 04:13:13.110 align:start position:0%
significant regulatory
oversight

04:13:13.110 --> 04:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
04:13:15.910 --> 04:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
in the establishment of the state-based
 
04:13:18.550 --> 04:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
exchange in terms of
 
04:13:20.950 --> 04:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
security oversight establishing the
 
04:13:23.110 --> 04:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
connection between the state-based
 
04:13:23.120 --> 04:13:24.550 align:start position:0%
connection between the state-based
exchange

04:13:24.550 --> 04:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
exchange
 
04:13:24.560 --> 04:13:25.670 align:start position:0%
exchange
and

04:13:25.670 --> 04:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:13:25.680 --> 04:13:27.429 align:start position:0%
and
the

04:13:27.429 --> 04:13:27.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:13:30.870 --> 04:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
data services to which the state to
 
04:13:33.030 --> 04:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
which uh the states exchange the state
 
04:13:33.040 --> 04:13:34.070 align:start position:0%
which uh the states exchange the state
exchange

04:13:34.070 --> 04:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
exchange
 
04:13:37.269 --> 04:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
connects in order to transact data
 
04:13:39.510 --> 04:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
because we still need to verify
 
04:13:41.510 --> 04:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know data you know information with
 
04:13:45.429 --> 04:13:45.439 align:start position:0%
federal data sources for example um
 
04:13:47.030 --> 04:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
and there are there are other
 
04:13:47.040 --> 04:13:53.030 align:start position:0%
and there are there are other
um

04:13:53.030 --> 04:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:54.950 --> 04:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
there are other validations and and
 
04:13:56.870 --> 04:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
other uh
 
04:13:56.880 --> 04:13:57.750 align:start position:0%
other uh
uh

04:13:57.750 --> 04:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:13:59.670 --> 04:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
pr you know uh
 
04:14:02.550 --> 04:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
guardrails that are in place uh to
 
04:14:02.560 --> 04:14:03.910 align:start position:0%
guardrails that are in place uh to
validate

04:14:03.910 --> 04:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
validate
 
04:14:05.830 --> 04:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
that things like
 
04:14:08.070 --> 04:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh you know essential health benefits
 
04:14:08.080 --> 04:14:09.030 align:start position:0%
uh you know essential health benefits
are

04:14:09.030 --> 04:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:14:09.040 --> 04:14:09.910 align:start position:0%
are
uh

04:14:09.910 --> 04:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:14:12.710 --> 04:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
being offered
 
04:14:15.030 --> 04:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
you know absent the state
 
04:14:15.040 --> 04:14:16.550 align:start position:0%
you know absent the state
um

04:14:16.550 --> 04:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:19.349 --> 04:14:19.359 align:start position:0%
seeking a waiver from
 
04:14:19.359 --> 04:14:20.950 align:start position:0%
seeking a waiver from
the

04:14:20.950 --> 04:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:14:23.990 --> 04:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
provision of essential health benefits
 
04:14:26.309 --> 04:14:26.319 align:start position:0%
um the state would
 
04:14:28.309 --> 04:14:28.319 align:start position:0%
you know still
 
04:14:30.469 --> 04:14:30.479 align:start position:0%
through the department of insurance
 
04:14:30.479 --> 04:14:31.910 align:start position:0%
through the department of insurance
um

04:14:31.910 --> 04:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:33.750 --> 04:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
the carriers would still
 
04:14:35.830 --> 04:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
need to be providing all of the
 
04:14:38.229 --> 04:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
essential health benefits
 
04:14:40.870 --> 04:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
that are detailed in the affordable care
 
04:14:40.880 --> 04:14:44.309 align:start position:0%
that are detailed in the affordable care
act

04:14:44.309 --> 04:14:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:44.319 --> 04:14:45.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:14:45.510 --> 04:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:14:45.520 --> 04:14:50.550 align:start position:0%
okay
representative

04:14:50.550 --> 04:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:55.750 --> 04:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:57.429 --> 04:14:57.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today uh
 
04:14:59.269 --> 04:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
you are an employee of get insured is
 
04:15:00.550 --> 04:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
that correct i am
 
04:15:04.070 --> 04:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
um could you describe your competition
 
04:15:06.229 --> 04:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
and how they compare to your services
 
04:15:06.239 --> 04:15:07.670 align:start position:0%
and how they compare to your services
and

04:15:07.670 --> 04:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:15:09.750 --> 04:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
you know their strengths and weaknesses
 
04:15:11.189 --> 04:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
maybe thank you
 
04:15:15.510 --> 04:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
sure sure so um it's a relatively
 
04:15:17.429 --> 04:15:17.439 align:start position:0%
uh small
 
04:15:20.070 --> 04:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
they're a relatively small number of
 
04:15:22.550 --> 04:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
suppliers that operate in the health
 
04:15:24.389 --> 04:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
insurance marketplace
 
04:15:24.399 --> 04:15:26.070 align:start position:0%
insurance marketplace
space

04:15:26.070 --> 04:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
space
 
04:15:29.590 --> 04:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
probably three or four
 
04:15:31.670 --> 04:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
key suppliers
 
04:15:34.309 --> 04:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
that offer health insurance
 
04:15:38.550 --> 04:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
exchange technology solutions
 
04:15:38.560 --> 04:15:40.149 align:start position:0%
exchange technology solutions
and

04:15:40.149 --> 04:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:15:42.389 --> 04:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
get insured
 
04:15:45.110 --> 04:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
currently operates the technology in
 
04:15:47.590 --> 04:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
eight now with georgia
 
04:15:50.550 --> 04:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
of the i believe it's 18
 
04:15:52.469 --> 04:15:52.479 align:start position:0%
states that are operating state-based
 
04:15:52.479 --> 04:15:53.750 align:start position:0%
states that are operating state-based
exchanges

04:15:53.750 --> 04:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
exchanges
 
04:15:55.590 --> 04:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh and the other
 
04:15:57.670 --> 04:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
states are
 
04:16:00.870 --> 04:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
scattered across they're a mix
 
04:16:03.189 --> 04:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
some states as i mentioned
 
04:16:05.510 --> 04:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
have decided to in-source where they've
 
04:16:08.070 --> 04:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
got you know state staff
 
04:16:12.950 --> 04:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:15.030 --> 04:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
maryland's an example of that
 
04:16:15.040 --> 04:16:16.229 align:start position:0%
maryland's an example of that
um

04:16:16.229 --> 04:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:17.990 --> 04:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
colorado i believe is another example of
 
04:16:18.000 --> 04:16:18.790 align:start position:0%
colorado i believe is another example of
that

04:16:18.790 --> 04:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:16:20.309 --> 04:16:20.319 align:start position:0%
and then there are other states that
 
04:16:20.319 --> 04:16:21.269 align:start position:0%
and then there are other states that
have

04:16:21.269 --> 04:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:16:24.790 --> 04:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh larger technology vendors that are uh
 
04:16:26.790 --> 04:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
supporting their
 
04:16:28.630 --> 04:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
their services
 
04:16:30.630 --> 04:16:30.640 align:start position:0%
further question
 
04:16:32.710 --> 04:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
thank you uh what are the names of the
 
04:16:35.110 --> 04:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
companies that are in the same space as
 
04:16:37.510 --> 04:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
you are and uh second half of the
 
04:16:40.830 --> 04:16:40.840 align:start position:0%
question does the bill allow for a
 
04:16:40.840 --> 04:16:42.550 align:start position:0%
question does the bill allow for a
homegrown

04:16:42.550 --> 04:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
homegrown
 
04:16:45.349 --> 04:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
exchange if the insurance department so
 
04:16:45.359 --> 04:16:46.550 align:start position:0%
exchange if the insurance department so
desires

04:16:46.550 --> 04:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
desires
 
04:16:48.469 --> 04:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
uh so those two questions names of
 
04:16:49.910 --> 04:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
competition and
 
04:16:51.670 --> 04:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
homegrown possibility
 
04:16:51.680 --> 04:16:52.469 align:start position:0%
homegrown possibility
sure

04:16:52.469 --> 04:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:16:52.479 --> 04:16:53.269 align:start position:0%
sure
so

04:16:53.269 --> 04:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:16:55.670 --> 04:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
i can speak to the former
 
04:16:58.630 --> 04:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
so the names of the competition
 
04:16:59.590 --> 04:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:16:59.600 --> 04:17:01.990 align:start position:0%
would be
deloitte

04:17:01.990 --> 04:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
deloitte
 
04:17:04.070 --> 04:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
idea crew
 
04:17:04.080 --> 04:17:05.189 align:start position:0%
idea crew
and

04:17:05.189 --> 04:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:17:05.199 --> 04:17:06.550 align:start position:0%
and
optum

04:17:06.550 --> 04:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
optum
 
04:17:09.670 --> 04:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
would be the three that are
 
04:17:11.750 --> 04:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
currently operating
 
04:17:11.760 --> 04:17:13.670 align:start position:0%
currently operating
uh

04:17:13.670 --> 04:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:17:15.349 --> 04:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
or supporting
 
04:17:19.030 --> 04:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
health insurance exchanges along with us
 
04:17:21.269 --> 04:17:21.279 align:start position:0%
not along with us but in the same space
 
04:17:23.670 --> 04:17:23.680 align:start position:0%
with us
 
04:17:26.309 --> 04:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
uh and then with respect to homegrown so
 
04:17:27.670 --> 04:17:27.680 align:start position:0%
this would require basically a
 
04:17:28.950 --> 04:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
procurement process should the
 
04:17:31.910 --> 04:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
department decide to proceed with it uh
 
04:17:34.950 --> 04:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
and so any company would be able to bid
 
04:17:37.110 --> 04:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
on that and that obviously requirements
 
04:17:39.429 --> 04:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
to be met in terms of the documents but
 
04:17:41.670 --> 04:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
yeah it would be an open uh competitive
 
04:17:43.590 --> 04:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
bid uh for something to present to the
 
04:17:45.189 --> 04:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
executive council
 
04:17:46.389 --> 04:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
uh if i can follow up on one of the
 
04:17:47.670 --> 04:17:47.680 align:start position:0%
things too was asked about states that
 
04:17:49.910 --> 04:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
have switched from a state-based plan
 
04:17:51.590 --> 04:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
back to the national plan the federal
 
04:17:54.550 --> 04:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
plan the ones i'm aware of um the three
 
04:17:56.630 --> 04:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
that i'm aware of uh two were mentioned
 
04:17:58.229 --> 04:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
nevada and kentucky and i think the
 
04:17:59.750 --> 04:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
third was oregon
 
04:18:01.910 --> 04:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
the three of them all if my recollection
 
04:18:05.590 --> 04:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
is correct all built their own custom
 
04:18:08.309 --> 04:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
programs in-house uh and two of them
 
04:18:09.910 --> 04:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
struggled very early on i'm not even
 
04:18:11.990 --> 04:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
sure if ever got off the ground um and
 
04:18:13.349 --> 04:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
then one did but they are in such
 
04:18:15.110 --> 04:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
trouble they moved to the state exchange
 
04:18:16.710 --> 04:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
i think two of the three are in the
 
04:18:18.630 --> 04:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
procurement process to move back to a
 
04:18:21.910 --> 04:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
state exchange and the third i think is
 
04:18:23.590 --> 04:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
about to start the procurement process
 
04:18:25.750 --> 04:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
so the three that have gone from state
 
04:18:27.750 --> 04:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
to federal uh are now planning to go
 
04:18:30.710 --> 04:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
back to state uh state yeah
 
04:18:32.710 --> 04:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
okay next is mclear
 
04:18:35.189 --> 04:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
herbert and then
 
04:18:38.229 --> 04:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much i i i think you
 
04:18:40.309 --> 04:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
sort of talked around it but i really
 
04:18:43.750 --> 04:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
like a direct answer as to how this
 
04:18:46.630 --> 04:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
enterprise is set up is it a private
 
04:18:49.910 --> 04:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
for-profit enterprise is it a public or
 
04:18:51.550 --> 04:18:51.560 align:start position:0%
is it a
 
04:18:54.070 --> 04:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
quasi-public-private enterprise i i
 
04:18:56.070 --> 04:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
nobody answered that directly to my
 
04:18:56.080 --> 04:18:57.110 align:start position:0%
nobody answered that directly to my
knowledge

04:18:57.110 --> 04:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
04:18:59.189 --> 04:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
yes sir thanks for the question so it is
 
04:18:59.199 --> 04:19:00.070 align:start position:0%
yes sir thanks for the question so it is
a

04:19:00.070 --> 04:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:19:00.080 --> 04:19:00.870 align:start position:0%
a
uh

04:19:00.870 --> 04:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:19:04.389 --> 04:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
generally it's either established as a
 
04:19:06.309 --> 04:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
the health insurance exchange is
 
04:19:08.110 --> 04:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
generally established either as a
 
04:19:10.870 --> 04:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
quasi-independent government agency uh
 
04:19:13.189 --> 04:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
or a division within
 
04:19:15.910 --> 04:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
a department of insurance
 
04:19:17.670 --> 04:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
that's how we typically see it but it's
 
04:19:19.030 --> 04:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
a government
 
04:19:19.040 --> 04:19:20.149 align:start position:0%
a government
run

04:19:20.149 --> 04:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
run
 
04:19:23.830 --> 04:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh entity that then contracts with
 
04:19:23.840 --> 04:19:24.870 align:start position:0%
uh entity that then contracts with
a

04:19:24.870 --> 04:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:19:27.349 --> 04:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
private vendor
 
04:19:29.189 --> 04:19:29.199 align:start position:0%
but it's just that's just a contractual
 
04:19:31.910 --> 04:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
relationship and so
 
04:19:35.110 --> 04:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
you know where we operate
 
04:19:36.950 --> 04:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
we have a strict you know we have a
 
04:19:36.960 --> 04:19:37.990 align:start position:0%
we have a strict you know we have a
contract

04:19:37.990 --> 04:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
contract
 
04:19:39.429 --> 04:19:39.439 align:start position:0%
to provide
 
04:19:41.670 --> 04:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
implementation services and then
 
04:19:43.830 --> 04:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
maintenance and operation services there
 
04:19:45.910 --> 04:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
was a question earlier about sort of
 
04:19:48.469 --> 04:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
what that looks like from a from a
 
04:19:50.630 --> 04:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
fee standpoint
 
04:19:54.469 --> 04:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
and it's essentially a licensing fee
 
04:19:57.189 --> 04:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
is what the structure is
 
04:19:59.429 --> 04:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:20:01.990 --> 04:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
that operates on a we
 
04:20:04.149 --> 04:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
on the implementation side we
 
04:20:04.159 --> 04:20:05.189 align:start position:0%
on the implementation side we
uh

04:20:05.189 --> 04:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:20:07.110 --> 04:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
factor in uh
 
04:20:09.750 --> 04:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
kind of amortize the implementation cost
 
04:20:11.349 --> 04:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
and then on the maintenance side on an
 
04:20:12.870 --> 04:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
ongoing basis
 
04:20:15.510 --> 04:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
that's just paid on a monthly basis
 
04:20:18.790 --> 04:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
but the the entity the exchange itself
 
04:20:21.429 --> 04:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
is is a
 
04:20:23.750 --> 04:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
government entity
 
04:20:41.590 --> 04:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:41.600 --> 04:20:42.389 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:20:42.389 --> 04:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:44.950 --> 04:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
for my reading not not just in in this
 
04:20:47.030 --> 04:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
particular area but uh
 
04:20:48.510 --> 04:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
what i'm listening to is the
 
04:20:50.469 --> 04:20:50.479 align:start position:0%
financialization of what used to be a
 
04:20:52.229 --> 04:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
public enterprise
 
04:20:55.269 --> 04:20:55.279 align:start position:0%
so in other words where uh
 
04:20:58.149 --> 04:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
a public-private partnership or a
 
04:20:58.159 --> 04:20:59.830 align:start position:0%
a public-private partnership or a
non-profit

04:20:59.830 --> 04:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
non-profit
 
04:20:59.840 --> 04:21:00.950 align:start position:0%
non-profit
uh

04:21:00.950 --> 04:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:21:04.070 --> 04:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:07.510 --> 04:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
you know convinces a state to
 
04:21:10.469 --> 04:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
allow them to run a program that was
 
04:21:13.269 --> 04:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
otherwise a public enterprise
 
04:21:14.630 --> 04:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
so that's that's called the
 
04:21:17.269 --> 04:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
financialization now i've read a lot
 
04:21:17.279 --> 04:21:18.389 align:start position:0%
financialization now i've read a lot
about

04:21:18.389 --> 04:21:18.399 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:21:19.750 --> 04:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
the history
 
04:21:21.189 --> 04:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
plus or minus
 
04:21:23.269 --> 04:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
on the financialization of public
 
04:21:23.279 --> 04:21:24.550 align:start position:0%
on the financialization of public
enterprises

04:21:24.550 --> 04:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
enterprises
 
04:21:27.670 --> 04:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
the record is not all that stellar
 
04:21:29.429 --> 04:21:29.439 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
04:21:29.439 --> 04:21:32.389 align:start position:0%
my question is
one

04:21:32.389 --> 04:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:34.630 --> 04:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
what happens if if the federal
 
04:21:38.630 --> 04:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
government allows medicare to
 
04:21:40.870 --> 04:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
negotiate pricing
 
04:21:43.670 --> 04:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
does it does that benefit trickle down
 
04:21:43.680 --> 04:21:44.950 align:start position:0%
does it does that benefit trickle down
somehow

04:21:44.950 --> 04:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
04:21:47.590 --> 04:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
to to a state-run uh
 
04:21:47.600 --> 04:21:49.590 align:start position:0%
to to a state-run uh
platform

04:21:49.590 --> 04:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
platform
 
04:21:51.990 --> 04:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
i mean how how would that work because
 
04:21:53.429 --> 04:21:53.439 align:start position:0%
at some point
 
04:21:55.110 --> 04:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
we have a very expensive national
 
04:21:55.120 --> 04:21:56.229 align:start position:0%
we have a very expensive national
program

04:21:56.229 --> 04:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:21:58.149 --> 04:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
because there is any there isn't any
 
04:21:58.159 --> 04:21:59.510 align:start position:0%
because there is any there isn't any
competition

04:21:59.510 --> 04:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
competition
 
04:22:02.389 --> 04:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh in certain areas partic particularly
 
04:22:05.910 --> 04:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs so
 
04:22:07.830 --> 04:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
i'm a little skeptical that a smaller
 
04:22:09.670 --> 04:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
organization will be able to negotiate
 
04:22:11.590 --> 04:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
higher better pricing
 
04:22:14.790 --> 04:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
than would a federal negotiator
 
04:22:16.790 --> 04:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
and the federal negotiator hasn't even
 
04:22:20.070 --> 04:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
been called in to sit at the table yet
 
04:22:21.590 --> 04:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to figure out what the
 
04:22:23.110 --> 04:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
relationship would you still be
 
04:22:26.309 --> 04:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
competitive would you be able to benefit
 
04:22:28.870 --> 04:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
from that negotiation if it did happen
 
04:22:30.950 --> 04:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
04:22:32.710 --> 04:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
if we had an exchange
 
04:22:37.269 --> 04:22:37.279 align:start position:0%
and it was your your business to uh
 
04:22:39.269 --> 04:22:39.279 align:start position:0%
uh run it
 
04:22:42.630 --> 04:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh as efficiently as you can and then uh
 
04:22:45.269 --> 04:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
the federal you know medicare becomes
 
04:22:47.349 --> 04:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
universal health care or at least they
 
04:22:50.149 --> 04:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
get to negotiate pricing is that pricing
 
04:22:53.510 --> 04:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
going to get trickled down to
 
04:22:55.830 --> 04:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
the state exchanges so representative
 
04:22:57.269 --> 04:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
herbert if i could
 
04:22:59.510 --> 04:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
sort of back up half a step on the
 
04:22:59.520 --> 04:23:03.189 align:start position:0%
sort of back up half a step on the
question

04:23:03.189 --> 04:23:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:06.229 --> 04:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
what we do fundamentally is
 
04:23:08.870 --> 04:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
we replace the technology
 
04:23:10.870 --> 04:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
that the federal
 
04:23:13.670 --> 04:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
government currently provides
 
04:23:15.429 --> 04:23:15.439 align:start position:0%
we're not involved you know we're not
 
04:23:17.510 --> 04:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
04:23:19.670 --> 04:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
the operation of the health insurance
 
04:23:21.269 --> 04:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
plans we're not involved in the
 
04:23:24.149 --> 04:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
collecting of the premiums
 
04:23:26.469 --> 04:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
we're not involved in the negotiating of
 
04:23:28.229 --> 04:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
the prices
 
04:23:29.590 --> 04:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
we are
 
04:23:32.389 --> 04:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
replacing the
 
04:23:35.429 --> 04:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
the guts of the technology
 
04:23:35.439 --> 04:23:36.389 align:start position:0%
the guts of the technology
um

04:23:36.389 --> 04:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:38.149 --> 04:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
and the
 
04:23:38.159 --> 04:23:38.870 align:start position:0%
and the
the

04:23:38.870 --> 04:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:23:41.349 --> 04:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
the foundation of the technology and the
 
04:23:43.590 --> 04:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
plumbing of the technology that the
 
04:23:45.590 --> 04:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
04:23:48.550 --> 04:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
that that the the people of ma of of new
 
04:23:48.560 --> 04:23:49.590 align:start position:0%
that that the the people of ma of of new
hampshire

04:23:49.590 --> 04:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:23:52.710 --> 04:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
are paying 2.75 percent
 
04:23:54.469 --> 04:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:23:56.309 --> 04:23:56.319 align:start position:0%
to use
 
04:23:56.319 --> 04:23:58.550 align:start position:0%
to use
um

04:23:58.550 --> 04:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:00.229 --> 04:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
we're replacing that with with our
 
04:24:02.070 --> 04:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
technology solution
 
04:24:04.389 --> 04:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
and and and that that's that's that's
 
04:24:07.189 --> 04:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
our that's our business model and so
 
04:24:07.199 --> 04:24:08.149 align:start position:0%
our that's our business model and so
um

04:24:08.149 --> 04:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:10.550 --> 04:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
we don't receive any
 
04:24:12.950 --> 04:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
financial benefit at all
 
04:24:12.960 --> 04:24:14.469 align:start position:0%
financial benefit at all
from

04:24:14.469 --> 04:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:24:16.790 --> 04:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
you know anything that happens
 
04:24:19.429 --> 04:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
with respect to
 
04:24:19.439 --> 04:24:20.309 align:start position:0%
with respect to
uh

04:24:20.309 --> 04:24:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:24:21.910 --> 04:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
you know if the
 
04:24:23.510 --> 04:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
what happens over with the department of
 
04:24:23.520 --> 04:24:24.870 align:start position:0%
what happens over with the department of
insurance

04:24:24.870 --> 04:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
04:24:27.349 --> 04:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh if they negotiate
 
04:24:29.510 --> 04:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
you know if they change the plan design
 
04:24:31.750 --> 04:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
or benefit design or prescription
 
04:24:33.830 --> 04:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
benefit design or
 
04:24:35.990 --> 04:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
formularies or any of that
 
04:24:37.269 --> 04:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
we are
 
04:24:38.950 --> 04:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
an agnostic
 
04:24:38.960 --> 04:24:39.910 align:start position:0%
an agnostic
uh

04:24:39.910 --> 04:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:24:43.349 --> 04:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
system provider technology provider
 
04:24:45.670 --> 04:24:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's making the technology available
 
04:24:49.670 --> 04:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:53.590 --> 04:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
of the of the program and so
 
04:24:55.590 --> 04:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
there's no financial benefit that would
 
04:24:59.269 --> 04:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
accrue to us of any of any change
 
04:25:03.189 --> 04:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:04.830 --> 04:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
let's make this easy
 
04:25:08.149 --> 04:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
okay this is just the front end this is
 
04:25:10.149 --> 04:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
just you signing up
 
04:25:12.229 --> 04:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
remember when obamacare first went in
 
04:25:13.750 --> 04:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
and the federal government software
 
04:25:16.229 --> 04:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
crashed on the first day
 
04:25:18.149 --> 04:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to avoid that's
 
04:25:20.710 --> 04:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
why we made the decision not to at that
 
04:25:22.389 --> 04:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
time we were afraid
 
04:25:24.550 --> 04:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
but in the end of the day we did do the
 
04:25:24.560 --> 04:25:25.510 align:start position:0%
but in the end of the day we did do the
federal

04:25:25.510 --> 04:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
federal
 
04:25:27.189 --> 04:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
all this is talking about is the person
 
04:25:29.030 --> 04:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
signing up this is not about
 
04:25:31.750 --> 04:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates or whatever to the
 
04:25:34.229 --> 04:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
providers this is simply the collecting
 
04:25:35.349 --> 04:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
the money
 
04:25:38.469 --> 04:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
so think about it how much does it cost
 
04:25:41.510 --> 04:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
to have you go online to amazon and
 
04:25:44.469 --> 04:25:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:45.990 --> 04:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's all they care about these guys
 
04:25:47.510 --> 04:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
are just taking the order and they
 
04:25:49.110 --> 04:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully they get you a card in your
 
04:25:50.950 --> 04:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
hand and then you can take that to a
 
04:25:53.110 --> 04:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
provider and at that point they've
 
04:25:54.469 --> 04:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
earned their
 
04:25:54.479 --> 04:25:57.429 align:start position:0%
earned their
2.75

04:25:57.429 --> 04:25:57.439 align:start position:0%
2.75
 
04:25:58.710 --> 04:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
that's all the federal government is
 
04:26:01.670 --> 04:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:05.429 --> 04:26:05.439 align:start position:0%
okay um i have one further further uh oh
 
04:26:08.070 --> 04:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
and it's a policy question and that is
 
04:26:10.630 --> 04:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh that even though the uh uh the
 
04:26:13.990 --> 04:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
business uh this man represents is a a
 
04:26:14.000 --> 04:26:15.349 align:start position:0%
business uh this man represents is a a
technical

04:26:15.349 --> 04:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
technical
 
04:26:17.349 --> 04:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
technocratic pitch
 
04:26:19.189 --> 04:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
in terms of software company software
 
04:26:21.030 --> 04:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
company in terms of
 
04:26:22.950 --> 04:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
i'm still concerned about
 
04:26:26.070 --> 04:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:29.030 --> 04:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
there is nobody there
 
04:26:31.830 --> 04:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
to uh worry about policy
 
04:26:34.309 --> 04:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
and and the fact of the matter is
 
04:26:35.910 --> 04:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
some of the policies i'm seeing in this
 
04:26:38.550 --> 04:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
state right now i'm very very concerned
 
04:26:41.510 --> 04:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
about so it's they're just going to do
 
04:26:43.349 --> 04:26:43.359 align:start position:0%
what they're told to do their their
 
04:26:45.030 --> 04:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
answer is going to be very simple their
 
04:26:47.269 --> 04:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
job is to make sure we don't have any
 
04:26:49.189 --> 04:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
problems that nobody no constituent
 
04:26:51.030 --> 04:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
complains that they had a problem
 
04:26:52.389 --> 04:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
getting signed up
 
04:26:54.229 --> 04:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
that's their mission
 
04:26:55.510 --> 04:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
simple as that
 
04:26:57.510 --> 04:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
and mr chairman if i could add
 
04:27:01.670 --> 04:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
um we actually do have um a a policy
 
04:27:01.680 --> 04:27:02.469 align:start position:0%
um we actually do have um a a policy
team

04:27:02.469 --> 04:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
team
 
04:27:02.479 --> 04:27:03.590 align:start position:0%
team
in-house

04:27:03.590 --> 04:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
in-house
 
04:27:03.600 --> 04:27:04.710 align:start position:0%
in-house
um

04:27:04.710 --> 04:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:07.030 --> 04:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
through our our years of experience
 
04:27:08.790 --> 04:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
establishing exchanges
 
04:27:11.030 --> 04:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
and helping states to to stand up
 
04:27:13.110 --> 04:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
state-based exchanges we've learned a
 
04:27:15.750 --> 04:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
lot um we've learned a lot that that
 
04:27:17.349 --> 04:27:17.359 align:start position:0%
works we've learned a lot that doesn't
 
04:27:20.229 --> 04:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
work frankly um and we've
 
04:27:21.510 --> 04:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
been able to
 
04:27:22.710 --> 04:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
we've learned that we've been able to
 
04:27:22.720 --> 04:27:23.830 align:start position:0%
we've learned that we've been able to
offer

04:27:23.830 --> 04:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
offer
 
04:27:27.590 --> 04:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
advice um and and be consultative
 
04:27:29.030 --> 04:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
during the
 
04:27:29.040 --> 04:27:30.710 align:start position:0%
during the
um

04:27:30.710 --> 04:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:32.790 --> 04:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
implementation process
 
04:27:34.710 --> 04:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
and so we have
 
04:27:37.110 --> 04:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh we have we have some policy folks on
 
04:27:39.830 --> 04:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
staff that are able to assist in that
 
04:27:43.590 --> 04:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
process um we naturally defer to
 
04:27:45.830 --> 04:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
you know the state's policy
 
04:27:47.670 --> 04:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh experts
 
04:27:50.149 --> 04:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
but we're able to
 
04:27:55.429 --> 04:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:55.439 --> 04:27:56.309 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

04:27:56.309 --> 04:27:56.319 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
04:27:57.750 --> 04:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:28:01.750 --> 04:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
okay well said thank you very much
 
04:28:03.670 --> 04:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh tyler brennan from the insurance
 
04:28:07.030 --> 04:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
department that uh is neutral on this
 
04:28:07.040 --> 04:28:23.670 align:start position:0%
department that uh is neutral on this
bill

04:28:23.670 --> 04:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:25.349 --> 04:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
thank you tyler brandon life and health
 
04:28:26.389 --> 04:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
director with the new hampshire
 
04:28:28.389 --> 04:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
insurance department and yes we don't
 
04:28:30.950 --> 04:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
have a position on the bill we do have
 
04:28:33.030 --> 04:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
a couple of concerns but um
 
04:28:33.910 --> 04:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
just to give you a little bit of
 
04:28:35.910 --> 04:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
background new hampshire is considered a
 
04:28:38.149 --> 04:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
partnership state so we work with the
 
04:28:39.830 --> 04:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
federal government the exchange
 
04:28:41.990 --> 04:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
mechanism through healthcare.gov
 
04:28:43.750 --> 04:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
and what we do is we get the products
 
04:28:46.070 --> 04:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
sent to us by the insurance carriers we
 
04:28:47.990 --> 04:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
make sure they comply with with state
 
04:28:50.070 --> 04:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
and in turn federal laws and then we
 
04:28:52.950 --> 04:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
recommend those products for approval
 
04:28:54.870 --> 04:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
by the federal government and to be
 
04:28:56.790 --> 04:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
included on that that federal exchange
 
04:28:58.309 --> 04:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
where people can buy it
 
04:28:59.510 --> 04:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
i you know listening to some of the
 
04:29:00.950 --> 04:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
questions i think it's appropriate that
 
04:29:03.110 --> 04:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
there is a level of confusion about what
 
04:29:04.229 --> 04:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
we're talking about that's sort of the
 
04:29:05.990 --> 04:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
technical interface what's the policy
 
04:29:08.550 --> 04:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
decision what's the insurance regulation
 
04:29:08.560 --> 04:29:10.950 align:start position:0%
decision what's the insurance regulation
um

04:29:10.950 --> 04:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:12.710 --> 04:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
it's a little both or potentially could
 
04:29:14.870 --> 04:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
be and uh and i think that there were a
 
04:29:15.830 --> 04:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
number of
 
04:29:17.429 --> 04:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
quotes out there about the costs and the
 
04:29:19.510 --> 04:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
potential savings and i think we agree
 
04:29:21.590 --> 04:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
with all of them there's we're spending
 
04:29:23.189 --> 04:29:23.199 align:start position:0%
close to eight million now
 
04:29:25.429 --> 04:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
um potentially you could save some money
 
04:29:27.030 --> 04:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
if you went with a kind of a state-based
 
04:29:27.040 --> 04:29:28.070 align:start position:0%
if you went with a kind of a state-based
system

04:29:28.070 --> 04:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:29:29.590 --> 04:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
we actually got a request from senator
 
04:29:32.630 --> 04:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
bradley last year to to look into this
 
04:29:34.950 --> 04:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
and do some research about sort of the
 
04:29:36.550 --> 04:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
opportunities and the risks associated
 
04:29:37.830 --> 04:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
with the state-based exchange in new
 
04:29:37.840 --> 04:29:38.950 align:start position:0%
with the state-based exchange in new
hampshire

04:29:38.950 --> 04:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:29:41.110 --> 04:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
nothing like a robust in-depth analysis
 
04:29:42.389 --> 04:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
of whether or not new hampshire should
 
04:29:44.790 --> 04:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
do a should do in a state-based exchange
 
04:29:46.149 --> 04:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
but really one that just tees up the
 
04:29:47.429 --> 04:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
issues does some research about
 
04:29:49.189 --> 04:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
different states that's what's actually
 
04:29:51.189 --> 04:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
what i'm handing around there's a letter
 
04:29:52.790 --> 04:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
from the commissioner and there's the
 
04:29:54.790 --> 04:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
front page and the executive summary
 
04:29:56.950 --> 04:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
from the report this morning i emailed
 
04:29:58.790 --> 04:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
you a link to the full report that's on
 
04:29:58.800 --> 04:30:00.229 align:start position:0%
you a link to the full report that's on
there

04:30:00.229 --> 04:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:30:02.070 --> 04:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
but the actual estimate provided by our
 
04:30:04.469 --> 04:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
contractor suggested that the cost to
 
04:30:06.070 --> 04:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
the state would be between four and a
 
04:30:09.110 --> 04:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
half and 8.9 million and part of that is
 
04:30:10.710 --> 04:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
what kind of decisions you have at the
 
04:30:12.229 --> 04:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
state level
 
04:30:13.429 --> 04:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
there are obviously a number of
 
04:30:14.630 --> 04:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
advantages when you've got state
 
04:30:17.269 --> 04:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
flexibility the elephant in the room is
 
04:30:19.990 --> 04:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
geez we really hope this works um it's
 
04:30:22.389 --> 04:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
not only tied to commercial carriers
 
04:30:25.189 --> 04:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
this uh the link to medicaid and dhhs is
 
04:30:27.269 --> 04:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
a big part of the process
 
04:30:28.950 --> 04:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
so they're a huge stakeholder in all
 
04:30:31.429 --> 04:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
this obviously sort of the in order to
 
04:30:33.269 --> 04:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
get the premium subsidies that most
 
04:30:34.950 --> 04:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
people do when they go through the
 
04:30:37.110 --> 04:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
exchange even in a wealthier state like
 
04:30:38.950 --> 04:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire you have to buy the
 
04:30:41.030 --> 04:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
products from the exchange you can't get
 
04:30:42.710 --> 04:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
the subsidies if you buy the product
 
04:30:45.030 --> 04:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
separately off the exchange so that's
 
04:30:46.469 --> 04:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
kind of a big thing it's a really
 
04:30:48.070 --> 04:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
important role and indeed there were a
 
04:30:49.830 --> 04:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
lot of technical challenges initially
 
04:30:51.590 --> 04:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
with the pedal exchange some many of
 
04:30:53.990 --> 04:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
them very public most the systems today
 
04:30:57.670 --> 04:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
do work pretty well um looking back on
 
04:30:59.990 --> 04:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
the fees associated they've mostly gone
 
04:31:01.830 --> 04:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
down uh they were three and a half
 
04:31:05.510 --> 04:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
percent as recently as 2019
 
04:31:07.910 --> 04:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
they are 2.75 now there was the
 
04:31:11.030 --> 04:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
reference to 27.75 being higher the
 
04:31:13.110 --> 04:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
initial proposal last year did suggest
 
04:31:14.309 --> 04:31:14.319 align:start position:0%
it was going to be lower and then they
 
04:31:19.830 --> 04:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:21.590 --> 04:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
that analysis i think that you could
 
04:31:23.429 --> 04:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
take a look at does tee up some
 
04:31:26.309 --> 04:31:26.319 align:start position:0%
questions that are big policy decisions
 
04:31:27.750 --> 04:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
and that brings me really to kind of the
 
04:31:29.349 --> 04:31:29.359 align:start position:0%
insurance department's main concern with
 
04:31:31.030 --> 04:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
the bill is that you're asking the
 
04:31:32.389 --> 04:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
insurance department to really play a
 
04:31:34.309 --> 04:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
much more significant role in a policy
 
04:31:37.269 --> 04:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
decision than we normally would um even
 
04:31:39.269 --> 04:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
the sort of that the investment in
 
04:31:40.790 --> 04:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
something like a state-based exchange on
 
04:31:43.189 --> 04:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
the low end of the scale would increase
 
04:31:45.990 --> 04:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
our budget probably by 50 percent
 
04:31:47.670 --> 04:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
senator ray white who really championed
 
04:31:49.429 --> 04:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
the effort in new hampshire when it was
 
04:31:52.229 --> 04:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
initially being debated i had four-hour
 
04:31:53.590 --> 04:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
meetings of hearing from different
 
04:31:55.269 --> 04:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
stakeholders about what the state-based
 
04:31:56.870 --> 04:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
exchange would be what it would look
 
04:31:59.189 --> 04:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
like and um and really what kind of
 
04:32:01.670 --> 04:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
investment we'd have at a local level
 
04:32:03.990 --> 04:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
they're uh one of the the pieces of
 
04:32:05.590 --> 04:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
information that didn't wasn't mentioned
 
04:32:07.429 --> 04:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
i think is an advantage when you do a
 
04:32:08.950 --> 04:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
state flexibility
 
04:32:12.710 --> 04:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
um during the years i think 2016 to 2018
 
04:32:14.070 --> 04:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
the federal government actually scaled
 
04:32:15.990 --> 04:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
back so the investment in
 
04:32:18.309 --> 04:32:18.319 align:start position:0%
navigators and outreach to people get
 
04:32:20.389 --> 04:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
people on the on the exchanges
 
04:32:22.070 --> 04:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
the state-based exchanges didn't see a
 
04:32:23.429 --> 04:32:23.439 align:start position:0%
drop in enrollment because they were
 
04:32:25.510 --> 04:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
doing that themselves but at the federal
 
04:32:27.990 --> 04:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
level we did see a bit of a drop so that
 
04:32:29.349 --> 04:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
might be kind of another consideration
 
04:32:31.990 --> 04:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
between state and federal um but some of
 
04:32:33.510 --> 04:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
the questions that did relate to kind of
 
04:32:36.149 --> 04:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
policy design insurance benefit designs
 
04:32:37.510 --> 04:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
those are our things that we would
 
04:32:38.550 --> 04:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
maintain at the state level the
 
04:32:40.309 --> 04:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
insurance department would let's
 
04:32:42.389 --> 04:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
presumably continue to play a very key
 
04:32:43.590 --> 04:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
role in that
 
04:32:44.870 --> 04:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
coordinating with the new sort of
 
04:32:47.110 --> 04:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
state-based exchange entity and indeed
 
04:32:48.550 --> 04:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
in some states they're quite large
 
04:32:50.630 --> 04:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
business enterprises um they do a lot of
 
04:32:51.670 --> 04:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
different work they've got a lot of
 
04:32:53.590 --> 04:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
different staff not only technical
 
04:32:55.910 --> 04:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
pieces but um but a lot of policy work
 
04:32:57.990 --> 04:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
so it's um you know i think that the
 
04:32:59.510 --> 04:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
door is fairly open on this in terms of
 
04:33:01.030 --> 04:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
what the state wants to do and we're
 
04:33:03.110 --> 04:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
happy to support that process but we
 
04:33:05.029 --> 04:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
prefer not to certainly not to be the
 
04:33:06.310 --> 04:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
decision maker about whether or not it's
 
04:33:09.349 --> 04:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
a good idea for new hampshire
 
04:33:14.470 --> 04:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:18.390 --> 04:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
great thank you tyler that was perfect
 
04:33:21.269 --> 04:33:21.279 align:start position:0%

bill

04:33:29.349 --> 04:33:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:30.709 --> 04:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
thank you committee chair thank you
 
04:33:32.789 --> 04:33:32.799 align:start position:0%

is russian chester i am a
 
04:33:37.269 --> 04:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
resident of bedford new hampshire
 
04:33:40.551 --> 04:33:40.561 align:start position:0%
i am opposed to this bill
 
04:33:42.230 --> 04:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
we here in new hampshire are very
 
04:33:45.830 --> 04:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
fortunate to have the kind of
 
04:33:48.470 --> 04:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
government that allows us to be a lot
 
04:33:50.551 --> 04:33:50.561 align:start position:0%
more involved with through our
 
04:33:52.869 --> 04:33:52.879 align:start position:0%
representative process in making
 
04:33:52.879 --> 04:33:53.990 align:start position:0%
representative process in making
decisions

04:33:53.990 --> 04:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
04:33:56.709 --> 04:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
this kind of bill takes that away from
 
04:33:59.109 --> 04:33:59.119 align:start position:0%
us and i am extremely concerned about
 
04:34:01.429 --> 04:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
that this is something that was done
 
04:34:03.510 --> 04:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
back in the early uh
 
04:34:04.949 --> 04:34:04.959 align:start position:0%
or mid
 
04:34:08.709 --> 04:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
80s or 90s with our um dhhs child
 
04:34:11.109 --> 04:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
protective system we brought a bridges
 
04:34:14.949 --> 04:34:14.959 align:start position:0%
system a state system um and we've had
 
04:34:17.029 --> 04:34:17.039 align:start position:0%
problems with it since
 
04:34:20.070 --> 04:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
it saved us money but the money that we
 
04:34:24.150 --> 04:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
have spent in violations and fines and
 
04:34:28.869 --> 04:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and the people and the staff to
 
04:34:32.070 --> 04:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
maintain and change it to meet the
 
04:34:35.830 --> 04:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
ever-changing needs of policy because
 
04:34:38.551 --> 04:34:38.561 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we are still collecting
 
04:34:38.561 --> 04:34:39.429 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we are still collecting
money

04:34:39.429 --> 04:34:39.439 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:34:41.510 --> 04:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
we are getting our tax money back from
 
04:34:43.590 --> 04:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
the federal government so bottom line is
 
04:34:45.189 --> 04:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
we are beholden
 
04:34:47.830 --> 04:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
um i want to talk a little bit about
 
04:34:47.840 --> 04:34:48.869 align:start position:0%
um i want to talk a little bit about
trust

04:34:48.869 --> 04:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
trust
 
04:34:48.879 --> 04:34:49.670 align:start position:0%
trust
uh

04:34:49.670 --> 04:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:34:53.349 --> 04:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
i trust you guys i know you guys i voted
 
04:34:54.629 --> 04:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
for you guys
 
04:34:56.150 --> 04:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know anything about the
 
04:34:57.510 --> 04:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
insurance guys that are going to be
 
04:34:59.349 --> 04:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
making the decisions about my health
 
04:34:59.359 --> 04:35:00.310 align:start position:0%
making the decisions about my health
care

04:35:00.310 --> 04:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
care
 
04:35:02.470 --> 04:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
or about whether or not i can get on a
 
04:35:05.269 --> 04:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
system or about whether or not i am
 
04:35:07.590 --> 04:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
being protected from
 
04:35:10.310 --> 04:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
maybe a nefarious sort that's wanting to
 
04:35:11.990 --> 04:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
line their pocket
 
04:35:13.910 --> 04:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
i want to talk a little bit about lead
 
04:35:17.189 --> 04:35:17.199 align:start position:0%
time we're talking um pence
 
04:35:19.590 --> 04:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
is it virginia it's going to take four
 
04:35:19.600 --> 04:35:20.709 align:start position:0%
is it virginia it's going to take four
years

04:35:20.709 --> 04:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:35:22.789 --> 04:35:22.799 align:start position:0%
how much happens in four years of
 
04:35:25.189 --> 04:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
government we don't have time for four
 
04:35:27.590 --> 04:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
years and then by the time that we
 
04:35:29.830 --> 04:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
decide we're going to do the state thing
 
04:35:31.510 --> 04:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's completely obsolete and the
 
04:35:33.670 --> 04:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
insurance guys and our representatives
 
04:35:36.310 --> 04:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
whoever's in power at that time has to
 
04:35:38.070 --> 04:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
start over
 
04:35:39.590 --> 04:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
let's talk about
 
04:35:42.310 --> 04:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
the company that that spoke
 
04:35:43.750 --> 04:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
they have been
 
04:35:45.029 --> 04:35:45.039 align:start position:0%
from what i understand they've been in
 
04:35:47.429 --> 04:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
business since 2010
 
04:35:48.949 --> 04:35:48.959 align:start position:0%
they currently according to their
 
04:35:51.109 --> 04:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
website have seven states
 
04:35:51.119 --> 04:35:53.910 align:start position:0%
website have seven states
enrolled

04:35:53.910 --> 04:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:56.070 --> 04:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
that's not great
 
04:35:57.910 --> 04:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know it doesn't sound great to
 
04:35:57.920 --> 04:35:58.629 align:start position:0%
i don't know it doesn't sound great to
me

04:35:58.629 --> 04:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:35:58.639 --> 04:36:00.470 align:start position:0%
me
um

04:36:00.470 --> 04:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:02.949 --> 04:36:02.959 align:start position:0%
if we go with something like this then
 
04:36:05.429 --> 04:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
we have no alternative but to approve
 
04:36:07.750 --> 04:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
the membership option that is also
 
04:36:10.551 --> 04:36:10.561 align:start position:0%
before our legislative body here today
 
04:36:12.949 --> 04:36:12.959 align:start position:0%
or not today but in this session
 
04:36:12.959 --> 04:36:13.990 align:start position:0%
or not today but in this session
um

04:36:13.990 --> 04:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:15.990 --> 04:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
the other the last piece i want to talk
 
04:36:18.949 --> 04:36:18.959 align:start position:0%
about is uh i used to work for a private
 
04:36:22.390 --> 04:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
non-profit in uh insurance company in
 
04:36:25.910 --> 04:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
massachusetts prior to the aca
 
04:36:29.510 --> 04:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that
 
04:36:29.520 --> 04:36:30.949 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that
cms

04:36:30.949 --> 04:36:30.959 align:start position:0%
cms
 
04:36:32.629 --> 04:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
is a broken system
 
04:36:34.230 --> 04:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
everybody knows it
 
04:36:37.269 --> 04:36:37.279 align:start position:0%
so the fact that we're just going to add
 
04:36:41.109 --> 04:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
another layer concerns me tremendously
 
04:36:43.189 --> 04:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
additionally i
 
04:36:45.830 --> 04:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
brought forward some significant
 
04:36:49.670 --> 04:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
concerns i i was receiving gift cards i
 
04:36:52.230 --> 04:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
worked within the psychiatric units
 
04:36:54.949 --> 04:36:54.959 align:start position:0%
i was receiving gift cards if i could
 
04:36:58.470 --> 04:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
get my patients on more meds because
 
04:37:00.709 --> 04:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
more meds meant more money for my
 
04:37:03.029 --> 04:37:03.039 align:start position:0%
private nonprofit agency
 
04:37:05.189 --> 04:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
i walked away because of that
 
04:37:07.269 --> 04:37:07.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's not the reality for
 
04:37:09.990 --> 04:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of people today good people don't
 
04:37:12.230 --> 04:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
stay in these kind of jobs anymore
 
04:37:14.390 --> 04:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
because it's not worth it
 
04:37:17.990 --> 04:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's not worth selling your soul
 
04:37:18.000 --> 04:37:18.869 align:start position:0%
it's it's not worth selling your soul
and

04:37:18.869 --> 04:37:18.879 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:37:21.109 --> 04:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this
 
04:37:23.349 --> 04:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
i don't love the federal government
 
04:37:26.150 --> 04:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
option but the state option i think
 
04:37:29.109 --> 04:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
we're going from the fire to the fryer
 
04:37:31.750 --> 04:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
and i will we i'm more than willing to
 
04:37:34.070 --> 04:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
take any questions that you have regards
 
04:37:38.789 --> 04:37:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:40.709 --> 04:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs yeah just a
 
04:37:43.510 --> 04:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
quick question i'm trying to understand
 
04:37:46.150 --> 04:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
um you we're talking of this system
 
04:37:47.830 --> 04:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a technology
 
04:37:49.670 --> 04:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
framework so i'm not really clear how
 
04:37:51.349 --> 04:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
that takes away
 
04:37:53.429 --> 04:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
control from the citizens it's not a
 
04:37:53.439 --> 04:37:54.551 align:start position:0%
control from the citizens it's not a
policy

04:37:54.551 --> 04:37:54.561 align:start position:0%
policy
 
04:37:56.869 --> 04:37:56.879 align:start position:0%
it's not a new policy it's a technical
 
04:37:59.349 --> 04:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
software implementation so that's what
 
04:38:00.629 --> 04:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
bridges was
 
04:38:02.949 --> 04:38:02.959 align:start position:0%
um it was a technology program that we
 
04:38:05.590 --> 04:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
put in place so we had a we had an
 
04:38:07.670 --> 04:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
antiquated system for
 
04:38:09.670 --> 04:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
taking care of our child protection
 
04:38:09.680 --> 04:38:10.949 align:start position:0%
taking care of our child protection
units

04:38:10.949 --> 04:38:10.959 align:start position:0%
units
 
04:38:13.189 --> 04:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
so we brought the bridges system it was
 
04:38:15.670 --> 04:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
it was a state system we bought it
 
04:38:17.670 --> 04:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
instead of um
 
04:38:20.470 --> 04:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
instead of leasing it or working with
 
04:38:22.230 --> 04:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
them so we bought it and we said we were
 
04:38:27.029 --> 04:38:27.039 align:start position:0%
going to use are our folks to do it
 
04:38:29.670 --> 04:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
it costs the state of new hampshire on
 
04:38:33.429 --> 04:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
average six million dollars more a year
 
04:38:35.910 --> 04:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
than if we had built it from ourselves
 
04:38:37.590 --> 04:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
from the ground up and if we had
 
04:38:40.789 --> 04:38:40.799 align:start position:0%
maintained it i was just in another
 
04:38:40.799 --> 04:38:41.990 align:start position:0%
maintained it i was just in another
committee

04:38:41.990 --> 04:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:38:43.269 --> 04:38:43.279 align:start position:0%
before this
 
04:38:44.869 --> 04:38:44.879 align:start position:0%
and we
 
04:38:46.949 --> 04:38:46.959 align:start position:0%
just bought a system less than a year
 
04:38:49.269 --> 04:38:49.279 align:start position:0%
ago it is just starting to get up and
 
04:38:51.910 --> 04:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
running now they're saying well if you
 
04:38:54.629 --> 04:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
want to change the policy it'll be 45
 
04:38:56.230 --> 04:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
million because we can't use that one
 
04:38:59.029 --> 04:38:59.039 align:start position:0%
that's one is obsolete now so the bottom
 
04:39:00.551 --> 04:39:00.561 align:start position:0%
line is we're saving four million
 
04:39:02.869 --> 04:39:02.879 align:start position:0%
dollars a year to potentially pay 45
 
04:39:05.349 --> 04:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
million next year because now the
 
04:39:09.189 --> 04:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
technology that we bought in 2022 is no
 
04:39:09.199 --> 04:39:10.230 align:start position:0%
technology that we bought in 2022 is no
longer

04:39:10.230 --> 04:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
longer
 
04:39:12.150 --> 04:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
capable of being used and that's what
 
04:39:14.390 --> 04:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
happened during the bridges system and
 
04:39:16.789 --> 04:39:16.799 align:start position:0%
that's actually what happens with all
 
04:39:18.949 --> 04:39:18.959 align:start position:0%
the different technology systems that
 
04:39:21.269 --> 04:39:21.279 align:start position:0%
try to interface with cms
 
04:39:23.990 --> 04:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
every single year we have a huge problem
 
04:39:26.789 --> 04:39:26.799 align:start position:0%
when our our systems whether it be
 
04:39:29.830 --> 04:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
federal or state on the billing side of
 
04:39:33.189 --> 04:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
things um try to interface with cms
 
04:39:35.510 --> 04:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:39:37.510 --> 04:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
so let's let's just agree that the state
 
04:39:40.150 --> 04:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire does not have the best
 
04:39:41.750 --> 04:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
of luck when it
 
04:39:43.830 --> 04:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
buys a new software program for any of
 
04:39:46.070 --> 04:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
its departments would you believe i
 
04:39:49.510 --> 04:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
agree with you 100 percent
 
04:39:52.948 --> 04:39:52.958 align:start position:0%
okay uh with that uh i've got
 
04:39:54.868 --> 04:39:54.878 align:start position:0%
no more cards left
 
04:39:56.788 --> 04:39:56.798 align:start position:0%
um from
 
04:39:56.798 --> 04:39:57.830 align:start position:0%
um from
the

04:39:57.830 --> 04:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:39:57.840 --> 04:39:58.628 align:start position:0%
the
oh

04:39:58.628 --> 04:39:58.638 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:39:58.638 --> 04:40:02.868 align:start position:0%
oh
remember

04:40:02.868 --> 04:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:05.990 --> 04:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't see your hand
 
04:40:07.030 --> 04:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:40:09.910 --> 04:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
um i'm sorry no problem
 
04:40:11.110 --> 04:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
would you
 
04:40:12.150 --> 04:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
would you
 
04:40:14.708 --> 04:40:14.718 align:start position:0%
would you say or would you agree that it
 
04:40:17.110 --> 04:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
isn't it isn't just a software and we
 
04:40:19.190 --> 04:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
spent my career in software development
 
04:40:21.910 --> 04:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
and implementation it's not
 
04:40:24.868 --> 04:40:24.878 align:start position:0%
is it true that it's not just about the
 
04:40:27.270 --> 04:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
technical parts of the software and how
 
04:40:29.670 --> 04:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
it gets installed but it's the policies
 
04:40:31.270 --> 04:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
behind that
 
04:40:33.910 --> 04:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
that drives some of the
 
04:40:33.920 --> 04:40:35.590 align:start position:0%
that drives some of the
problems

04:40:35.590 --> 04:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
problems
 
04:40:38.708 --> 04:40:38.718 align:start position:0%
i would agree that it's it's it's it's
 
04:40:42.150 --> 04:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
multiple layers it's policy it's it's
 
04:40:44.390 --> 04:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
people so so
 
04:40:47.350 --> 04:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
we are putting our we are choosing if we
 
04:40:49.350 --> 04:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
were to do something like this
 
04:40:51.110 --> 04:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire is putting
 
04:40:54.310 --> 04:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
our trust in a third party techno
 
04:40:57.270 --> 04:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
technological type of thing similar to
 
04:41:00.070 --> 04:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
what we do with our election process and
 
04:41:02.390 --> 04:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
there are there are not necessarily
 
04:41:06.070 --> 04:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
checks and balances um because you heard
 
04:41:07.430 --> 04:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
the insurance department say we're
 
04:41:09.030 --> 04:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
looking at a 50
 
04:41:10.628 --> 04:41:10.638 align:start position:0%
increase in budget and something like
 
04:41:13.110 --> 04:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
that and the reality is is we can't get
 
04:41:15.670 --> 04:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
people to fill our our state positions
 
04:41:15.680 --> 04:41:17.510 align:start position:0%
people to fill our our state positions
now

04:41:17.510 --> 04:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:41:19.190 --> 04:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:41:20.948 --> 04:41:20.958 align:start position:0%

okay so uh online overnight we had 20
 
04:41:28.230 --> 04:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
people in support and one opposed
 
04:41:29.750 --> 04:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
and i would say i look through the list
 
04:41:32.230 --> 04:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
and there are four people from rindge my
 
04:41:32.240 --> 04:41:34.550 align:start position:0%
and there are four people from rindge my
constituency

04:41:34.550 --> 04:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
constituency
 
04:41:36.868 --> 04:41:36.878 align:start position:0%

pangino still here
 
04:41:48.310 --> 04:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
and this time she is opposed to the
 
04:41:49.830 --> 04:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
legislation she represents the new
 
04:41:52.150 --> 04:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire association of insurance
 
04:41:54.470 --> 04:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
agents who knows what it's like to have
 
04:41:57.830 --> 04:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
unhappy customers
 
04:41:59.910 --> 04:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
okay with that we will close the public
 
04:41:59.920 --> 04:42:06.708 align:start position:0%
okay with that we will close the public
hearing

04:42:06.708 --> 04:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:10.070 --> 04:42:10.080 align:start position:0%

again
roswell

04:43:12.470 --> 04:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:14.390 --> 04:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:43:16.868 --> 04:43:16.878 align:start position:0%
for the record cindy rosenwald from
 
04:43:19.270 --> 04:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
senate district 13

and that is nashua
 
04:43:23.590 --> 04:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
and i am pleased to
 
04:43:23.600 --> 04:43:25.350 align:start position:0%
and i am pleased to
introduce

04:43:25.350 --> 04:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
introduce
 
04:43:28.628 --> 04:43:28.638 align:start position:0%
senate bill 319 this is also enabling
 
04:43:28.638 --> 04:43:30.150 align:start position:0%
senate bill 319 this is also enabling
legislation

04:43:30.150 --> 04:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:43:32.070 --> 04:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
that would allow health insurance to
 
04:43:32.080 --> 04:43:33.590 align:start position:0%
that would allow health insurance to
voluntarily

04:43:33.590 --> 04:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
voluntarily
 
04:43:36.470 --> 04:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
offer a wellness incentive to people who
 
04:43:36.480 --> 04:43:37.590 align:start position:0%
offer a wellness incentive to people who
choose

04:43:37.590 --> 04:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
choose
 
04:43:40.550 --> 04:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
to supply documentation they are fully
 
04:43:43.350 --> 04:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
vaccinated against covet 19 at the time
 
04:43:45.190 --> 04:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
they are enrolling
 
04:43:47.030 --> 04:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
for that plan
 
04:43:47.040 --> 04:43:48.230 align:start position:0%
for that plan
this

04:43:48.230 --> 04:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:43:51.430 --> 04:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
bill applies to the state regulated full
 
04:43:53.910 --> 04:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
risk insurance market
 
04:43:53.920 --> 04:43:55.110 align:start position:0%
risk insurance market
and

04:43:55.110 --> 04:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:43:58.150 --> 04:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
it is designed to sunset at the end of
 
04:43:59.350 --> 04:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
next year
 
04:44:01.910 --> 04:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
when we hope it will no longer
 
04:44:03.990 --> 04:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
be necessary
 
04:44:04.000 --> 04:44:04.948 align:start position:0%
be necessary
as

04:44:04.948 --> 04:44:04.958 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:44:07.910 --> 04:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
required by federal law an insurer
 
04:44:10.868 --> 04:44:10.878 align:start position:0%
choosing to offer this benefit would
 
04:44:13.750 --> 04:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
also have to make it available to anyone
 
04:44:15.990 --> 04:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
who's not medically able
 
04:44:18.948 --> 04:44:18.958 align:start position:0%
to receive the covid vaccination
 
04:44:18.958 --> 04:44:20.390 align:start position:0%
to receive the covid vaccination
and

04:44:20.390 --> 04:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:44:22.310 --> 04:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
i'm sure just for context you're all
 
04:44:24.708 --> 04:44:24.718 align:start position:0%
aware there are a number of health plans
 
04:44:27.990 --> 04:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
that offer a similar kind of incentive
 
04:44:31.270 --> 04:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
for people to get their annual flu shots
 
04:44:34.628 --> 04:44:34.638 align:start position:0%
the reason for this bill is to reduce
 
04:44:37.350 --> 04:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
cost in the health care system
 
04:44:37.360 --> 04:44:39.350 align:start position:0%
cost in the health care system
which

04:44:39.350 --> 04:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:44:42.070 --> 04:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
that higher cost will inevitably lead to
 
04:44:44.868 --> 04:44:44.878 align:start position:0%
higher health insurance premiums
 
04:44:47.190 --> 04:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
earlier this year
 
04:44:50.230 --> 04:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
kaiser health foundation reported that
 
04:44:52.948 --> 04:44:52.958 align:start position:0%
the per capita health cost
 
04:44:55.670 --> 04:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
of people who were not vaccinated
 
04:44:57.670 --> 04:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
against kovid west twenty thousand
 
04:45:00.628 --> 04:45:00.638 align:start position:0%
dollars whether they got sick or not
 
04:45:03.670 --> 04:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
this is driven by the high expense of
 
04:45:03.680 --> 04:45:05.190 align:start position:0%
this is driven by the high expense of
covid

04:45:05.190 --> 04:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
covid
 
04:45:07.750 --> 04:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
related hospitalizations for people who
 
04:45:09.990 --> 04:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
did get it which
 
04:45:11.750 --> 04:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
as reported
 
04:45:14.868 --> 04:45:14.878 align:start position:0%
by the new york times averages at least
 
04:45:17.070 --> 04:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars per
 
04:45:17.080 --> 04:45:18.788 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars per
hospitalization

04:45:18.788 --> 04:45:18.798 align:start position:0%
hospitalization
 
04:45:21.110 --> 04:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
and the cost of
 
04:45:23.430 --> 04:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
covered hospitalizations
 
04:45:24.948 --> 04:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
04:45:28.390 --> 04:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
has also been very high
 
04:45:31.350 --> 04:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
at dartmouth-hitchcock for example
 
04:45:33.430 --> 04:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
the cost for
 
04:45:35.670 --> 04:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
a covid related
 
04:45:38.868 --> 04:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
intensive care unit stay
 
04:45:42.628 --> 04:45:42.638 align:start position:0%
on a ventilator for at least four days
 
04:45:45.430 --> 04:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
is almost a hundred and thirty thousand
 
04:45:48.310 --> 04:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
dollars and about three quarters
 
04:45:49.590 --> 04:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
of their
 
04:45:52.868 --> 04:45:52.878 align:start position:0%
icu ventilator stays are at least four
 
04:45:55.430 --> 04:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
days long so we're talking about a
 
04:45:57.910 --> 04:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
significant cost
 
04:45:57.920 --> 04:45:59.430 align:start position:0%
significant cost
um

04:45:59.430 --> 04:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:02.390 --> 04:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
that is going to be recouped through
 
04:46:05.030 --> 04:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
private health insurance so
 
04:46:05.040 --> 04:46:06.708 align:start position:0%
private health insurance so
recently

04:46:06.708 --> 04:46:06.718 align:start position:0%
recently
 
04:46:09.670 --> 04:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
the there were reports that full
 
04:46:12.788 --> 04:46:12.798 align:start position:0%
vaccination with booster shots were 90
 
04:46:14.550 --> 04:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
percent effective
 
04:46:17.430 --> 04:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
at reducing hospitalizations
 
04:46:20.230 --> 04:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
so the fewer hospitalizations the less
 
04:46:23.030 --> 04:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
expense we will incur
 
04:46:25.910 --> 04:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
and therefore reduce pressure on
 
04:46:25.920 --> 04:46:27.110 align:start position:0%
and therefore reduce pressure on
premiums

04:46:27.110 --> 04:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
premiums
 
04:46:29.750 --> 04:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
i think this bill will enable insurers
 
04:46:32.788 --> 04:46:32.798 align:start position:0%
and individuals to make informed choices
 
04:46:34.868 --> 04:46:34.878 align:start position:0%
that could save us all money on our
 
04:46:37.590 --> 04:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
health insurance premiums i deliver it
 
04:46:39.990 --> 04:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
to the commerce committee and hope you
 
04:46:42.070 --> 04:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
will agree with me
 
04:46:43.750 --> 04:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
04:46:46.628 --> 04:46:46.638 align:start position:0%
so but my first question was is there
 
04:46:48.628 --> 04:46:48.638 align:start position:0%
anything barring an insurance company to
 
04:46:49.910 --> 04:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
do it now
 
04:46:51.910 --> 04:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
why do we need this legislation great
 
04:46:54.788 --> 04:46:54.798 align:start position:0%
question the insurance department
 
04:46:58.070 --> 04:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
believes that the federal guidance is
 
04:46:58.080 --> 04:46:59.590 align:start position:0%
believes that the federal guidance is
unclear

04:46:59.590 --> 04:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
unclear
 
04:47:03.110 --> 04:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not insurers
 
04:47:05.190 --> 04:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
could do it now so
 
04:47:05.200 --> 04:47:07.750 align:start position:0%
could do it now so
therefore

04:47:07.750 --> 04:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
04:47:11.270 --> 04:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
we would need this enabling
 
04:47:14.948 --> 04:47:14.958 align:start position:0%
statute to allow any to do it if they
 
04:47:18.868 --> 04:47:18.878 align:start position:0%
thought that it was going to be a good
 
04:47:21.910 --> 04:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
market solution but then and then that
 
04:47:23.350 --> 04:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
and so your statement when you first
 
04:47:25.430 --> 04:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
started out saying was however if
 
04:47:27.670 --> 04:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
somebody is medically
 
04:47:30.070 --> 04:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to get a vaccine they can
 
04:47:33.430 --> 04:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
still get a check they would have to if
 
04:47:36.150 --> 04:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
the carrier offered this
 
04:47:40.070 --> 04:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
incentive right they would have to also
 
04:47:41.670 --> 04:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
offer it to
 
04:47:44.550 --> 04:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
anyone who is medically
 
04:47:44.560 --> 04:47:45.830 align:start position:0%
anyone who is medically
unable

04:47:45.830 --> 04:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
unable
 
04:47:47.350 --> 04:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
that's a little awkward
 
04:47:49.190 --> 04:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
okay so my other question is is there
 
04:47:51.270 --> 04:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
anything stopping a uh since this is
 
04:47:52.788 --> 04:47:52.798 align:start position:0%
only affecting small
 
04:47:54.868 --> 04:47:54.878 align:start position:0%
employer health insurance is there
 
04:47:56.550 --> 04:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
anything that's stopping small employers
 
04:47:58.310 --> 04:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
now to give an incentive to their
 
04:47:58.320 --> 04:47:59.270 align:start position:0%
now to give an incentive to their
employee

04:47:59.270 --> 04:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
employee
 
04:48:01.030 --> 04:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
to get vaccinated
 
04:48:02.470 --> 04:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
rather rather than having to go through
 
04:48:04.708 --> 04:48:04.718 align:start position:0%
insurance can any employer say to other
 
04:48:05.990 --> 04:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
employees you know
 
04:48:07.830 --> 04:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
i'll give everybody a
 
04:48:09.270 --> 04:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
well i don't know
 
04:48:12.310 --> 04:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
only small employers it's the full risk
 
04:48:15.510 --> 04:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
market so that's the school small group
 
04:48:17.830 --> 04:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
market small group market and i think
 
04:48:21.030 --> 04:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
also the large group market large group
 
04:48:23.270 --> 04:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
well let's say anybody's not erisa
 
04:48:26.310 --> 04:48:26.320 align:start position:0%
pardon right anyone is not in risa and
 
04:48:27.350 --> 04:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
04:48:30.708 --> 04:48:30.718 align:start position:0%
to help benefit exchange right and
 
04:48:34.310 --> 04:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
not medicaid or medicare or
 
04:48:37.190 --> 04:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
so it's it is a
 
04:48:37.200 --> 04:48:39.190 align:start position:0%
so it's it is a
limited

04:48:39.190 --> 04:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
limited
 
04:48:41.670 --> 04:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
part of the insurance market okay and so
 
04:48:44.550 --> 04:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
my last question is since um 70 of us
 
04:48:45.830 --> 04:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
are already vaccinated isn't this kind
 
04:48:48.070 --> 04:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
of johnny too late
 
04:48:50.708 --> 04:48:50.718 align:start position:0%
we don't really have good information on
 
04:48:53.430 --> 04:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
what our vaccination rates are
 
04:48:53.440 --> 04:48:55.190 align:start position:0%
what our vaccination rates are
because

04:48:55.190 --> 04:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:48:55.200 --> 04:48:57.830 align:start position:0%
because
um

04:48:57.830 --> 04:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:00.310 --> 04:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
since the pharmacies
 
04:49:01.910 --> 04:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
opened up
 
04:49:04.470 --> 04:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
they're reporting
 
04:49:06.310 --> 04:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
federally but we don't really have a
 
04:49:09.750 --> 04:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
good sense of who's had one shot or two
 
04:49:09.760 --> 04:49:10.628 align:start position:0%
good sense of who's had one shot or two
shots

04:49:10.628 --> 04:49:10.638 align:start position:0%
shots
 
04:49:12.310 --> 04:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
or three or now
 
04:49:14.470 --> 04:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
some people might have had
 
04:49:16.470 --> 04:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
already a fourth
 
04:49:20.830 --> 04:49:20.840 align:start position:0%
we don't have really accurate
 
04:49:25.430 --> 04:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
information but it is a time limited
 
04:49:27.430 --> 04:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
right and if you're on medicare you
 
04:49:29.750 --> 04:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
can't do it or medicaid you can't do it
 
04:49:30.948 --> 04:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
and and
 
04:49:33.270 --> 04:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
and i guess and the word fully is always
 
04:49:34.788 --> 04:49:34.798 align:start position:0%
kind of funny because you know how many
 
04:49:37.990 --> 04:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:38.000 --> 04:49:40.310 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:49:40.310 --> 04:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:47.510 --> 04:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:50.948 --> 04:49:50.958 align:start position:0%
currently fully vaccinated for covet 19
 
04:49:52.550 --> 04:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
at the time of enrollment his current
 
04:49:53.750 --> 04:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
right now is
 
04:49:55.270 --> 04:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
if you're current right now if you're
 
04:49:59.030 --> 04:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
over 50 you can there's two boosters
 
04:50:01.270 --> 04:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
yes you can get a fourth shot
 
04:50:02.830 --> 04:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
04:50:08.948 --> 04:50:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:11.190 --> 04:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
so i i would say the implementation of
 
04:50:12.788 --> 04:50:12.798 align:start position:0%
this is going to be could be very
 
04:50:12.798 --> 04:50:14.310 align:start position:0%
this is going to be could be very
problematic

04:50:14.310 --> 04:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
04:50:15.270 --> 04:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
i mean i understand where you're trying
 
04:50:17.190 --> 04:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
to get from but it's going to be you
 
04:50:19.430 --> 04:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
know who's foley who's not fully
 
04:50:23.190 --> 04:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh and and and having a job and i i know
 
04:50:25.030 --> 04:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
for myself when i went travel to the
 
04:50:28.150 --> 04:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
caribbean and uh they they wanted the
 
04:50:30.868 --> 04:50:30.878 align:start position:0%
documentation of my covet and my of my
 
04:50:34.470 --> 04:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
vaccines and um
 
04:50:35.670 --> 04:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
we didn't really get it with those
 
04:50:37.270 --> 04:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
little cards and then how important
 
04:50:39.030 --> 04:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
those little cards were and then they
 
04:50:41.910 --> 04:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
were given to us and and and frankly
 
04:50:43.910 --> 04:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
um i only used it for my date of my
 
04:50:45.510 --> 04:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
appointment which i didn't go to because
 
04:50:46.788 --> 04:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
i went to
 
04:50:48.470 --> 04:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
like four or five days before it i was
 
04:50:50.230 --> 04:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
able to get in before it
 
04:50:52.550 --> 04:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
um so i didn't had to go into vans had
 
04:50:55.110 --> 04:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
to go back to old vans and print that
 
04:50:55.120 --> 04:50:56.310 align:start position:0%
to go back to old vans and print that
out

04:50:56.310 --> 04:50:56.320 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:50:58.628 --> 04:50:58.638 align:start position:0%
and so and then when it came to my
 
04:51:00.708 --> 04:51:00.718 align:start position:0%
booster that i now i get it about how
 
04:51:02.788 --> 04:51:02.798 align:start position:0%
important those little cards are and you
 
04:51:05.190 --> 04:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
know kept my card so it's awkward in
 
04:51:07.190 --> 04:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
terms of documenting
 
04:51:10.150 --> 04:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
that full vaccination so i'm sure that
 
04:51:13.190 --> 04:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
this this is a kind of a bureaucrat
 
04:51:14.788 --> 04:51:14.798 align:start position:0%
offer offer to the insurance company
 
04:51:15.830 --> 04:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
that the insurance companies are going
 
04:51:16.788 --> 04:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
to say
 
04:51:19.270 --> 04:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
we don't really want to have to
 
04:51:21.110 --> 04:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
make this decision which card is
 
04:51:23.350 --> 04:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
legitimate which one it's not how do we
 
04:51:25.190 --> 04:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
know your information is correct how do
 
04:51:27.030 --> 04:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
you know why would an insurance company
 
04:51:28.708 --> 04:51:28.718 align:start position:0%
know which how many boosters is right
 
04:51:30.230 --> 04:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
for you
 
04:51:32.390 --> 04:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
so i mean i think you're still
 
04:51:34.868 --> 04:51:34.878 align:start position:0%
considered fully vaccinated if you've
 
04:51:35.990 --> 04:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
had two
 
04:51:36.000 --> 04:51:36.788 align:start position:0%
had two
yeah

04:51:36.788 --> 04:51:36.798 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:51:37.910 --> 04:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
i mean two
 
04:51:39.990 --> 04:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
you know a first shot and a second shot
 
04:51:41.350 --> 04:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
oh you were saying the boosters are not
 
04:51:43.670 --> 04:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
concerned i don't think that they are
 
04:51:43.680 --> 04:51:46.550 align:start position:0%
concerned i don't think that they are
um

04:51:46.550 --> 04:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:49.350 --> 04:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
required to call someone fully
 
04:51:49.360 --> 04:51:51.590 align:start position:0%
required to call someone fully
vaccinated

04:51:51.590 --> 04:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
04:51:53.350 --> 04:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
yes i do but okay
 
04:51:56.310 --> 04:51:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative goes first
 
04:51:58.948 --> 04:51:58.958 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for your testimony
 
04:52:01.190 --> 04:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
is it am i correct in seeing this just
 
04:52:03.270 --> 04:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
as enabling legislation so that
 
04:52:05.350 --> 04:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
insurance companies can encourage people
 
04:52:07.270 --> 04:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
to get a vaccine if they haven't by
 
04:52:09.670 --> 04:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
offering an incentive pardon could you
 
04:52:11.830 --> 04:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
say that again there was some noise
 
04:52:13.350 --> 04:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
all right let me see if i can say that
 
04:52:15.670 --> 04:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes you do i mean this is
 
04:52:18.470 --> 04:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
just enabling legislation that an
 
04:52:20.470 --> 04:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
insurance company can use this to
 
04:52:22.550 --> 04:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
incentivize people who haven't been
 
04:52:25.590 --> 04:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
vaccinated to get a vaccine
 
04:52:28.310 --> 04:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
to help reduce hospital
 
04:52:30.550 --> 04:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
stays that have been caused by covid
 
04:52:33.190 --> 04:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
correct this is just enabling
 
04:52:35.910 --> 04:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
and the insurance company to incentivize
 
04:52:38.070 --> 04:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
people who haven't been vaccinated yet
 
04:52:39.670 --> 04:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
that's correct and it's strictly
 
04:52:42.470 --> 04:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
voluntary it's yes there's there's no
 
04:52:45.030 --> 04:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
mandate here there's no
 
04:52:46.230 --> 04:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
this is just
 
04:52:48.628 --> 04:52:48.638 align:start position:0%
allowing them to encourage people to
 
04:52:53.190 --> 04:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
reduce costs they cannot do this now
 
04:52:54.868 --> 04:52:54.878 align:start position:0%
because the insurance department
 
04:52:57.510 --> 04:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
believes federal guidance is unclear
 
04:52:59.910 --> 04:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you
 
04:53:02.230 --> 04:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
unless tyler brannon has changed his
 
04:53:03.910 --> 04:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
mind well i can beat him up a little
 
04:53:10.230 --> 04:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:12.070 --> 04:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you your testimony
 
04:53:13.910 --> 04:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
question answering questions
 
04:53:13.920 --> 04:53:15.590 align:start position:0%
question answering questions
um

04:53:15.590 --> 04:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:17.910 --> 04:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
so what are the uh i'm wondering what
 
04:53:20.390 --> 04:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
are the range of wellness financial
 
04:53:22.708 --> 04:53:22.718 align:start position:0%
incentives that you envision in this
 
04:53:22.718 --> 04:53:24.470 align:start position:0%
incentives that you envision in this
legislation

04:53:24.470 --> 04:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:53:24.480 --> 04:53:25.990 align:start position:0%
legislation
um

04:53:25.990 --> 04:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:27.830 --> 04:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
that i'll start with that if i may
 
04:53:29.510 --> 04:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you
 
04:53:33.190 --> 04:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
i would imagine that any carrier would
 
04:53:34.470 --> 04:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
look at
 
04:53:35.910 --> 04:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
the cost
 
04:53:39.350 --> 04:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
to do this and their cost for
 
04:53:42.868 --> 04:53:42.878 align:start position:0%
possibly preventable hospitalizations
 
04:53:42.878 --> 04:53:44.070 align:start position:0%
possibly preventable hospitalizations
and

04:53:44.070 --> 04:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:53:45.590 --> 04:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
look at
 
04:53:45.600 --> 04:53:48.470 align:start position:0%
look at
um

04:53:48.470 --> 04:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:50.150 --> 04:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
what they thought
 
04:53:54.150 --> 04:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
would be necessary there was a study
 
04:53:57.350 --> 04:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
conducted i think by the university of
 
04:53:57.360 --> 04:53:58.868 align:start position:0%
conducted i think by the university of
texas

04:53:58.868 --> 04:53:58.878 align:start position:0%
texas
 
04:54:00.470 --> 04:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
that looked
 
04:54:00.480 --> 04:54:01.590 align:start position:0%
that looked
at

04:54:01.590 --> 04:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:54:04.310 --> 04:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
this i mean they
 
04:54:07.990 --> 04:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
they asked people would a
 
04:54:08.788 --> 04:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:54:11.190 --> 04:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars gift card or a hundred
 
04:54:13.110 --> 04:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
dollar gift card
 
04:54:15.270 --> 04:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
make you more likely to get this
 
04:54:15.280 --> 04:54:16.470 align:start position:0%
make you more likely to get this
vaccination

04:54:16.470 --> 04:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
04:54:16.480 --> 04:54:17.510 align:start position:0%
vaccination
and

04:54:17.510 --> 04:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:54:20.708 --> 04:54:20.718 align:start position:0%
it there was a substantial
 
04:54:20.718 --> 04:54:21.990 align:start position:0%
it there was a substantial
increase

04:54:21.990 --> 04:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
increase
 
04:54:23.430 --> 04:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
with even
 
04:54:25.750 --> 04:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
that amount now for the state employees
 
04:54:27.590 --> 04:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire which this wouldn't
 
04:54:27.600 --> 04:54:28.948 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire which this wouldn't
affect

04:54:28.948 --> 04:54:28.958 align:start position:0%
affect
 
04:54:31.670 --> 04:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:54:31.680 --> 04:54:33.110 align:start position:0%
the state
plan

04:54:33.110 --> 04:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
plan
 
04:54:36.230 --> 04:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
will pay state employees 200
 
04:54:38.948 --> 04:54:38.958 align:start position:0%
to get an annual flu shot
 
04:54:38.958 --> 04:54:40.390 align:start position:0%
to get an annual flu shot
so

04:54:40.390 --> 04:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:54:44.948 --> 04:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
the cost of hospitalization for this is
 
04:54:46.470 --> 04:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
very high
 
04:54:49.110 --> 04:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
but there's also costs and lost
 
04:54:51.350 --> 04:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
productivity and
 
04:54:54.708 --> 04:54:54.718 align:start position:0%
i mean so that that's the one i know of
 
04:54:54.718 --> 04:54:55.510 align:start position:0%
i mean so that that's the one i know of
um

04:54:55.510 --> 04:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:56.788 --> 04:54:56.798 align:start position:0%
further for the question may inquire
 
04:54:56.798 --> 04:54:58.470 align:start position:0%
further for the question may inquire
clear

04:54:58.470 --> 04:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
clear
 
04:54:59.990 --> 04:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
so who's providing the financial
 
04:55:02.070 --> 04:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
incentive the employer
 
04:55:04.150 --> 04:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
or the insurance company
 
04:55:07.590 --> 04:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
this legislation is about the insurance
 
04:55:10.310 --> 04:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
company so the insurance company
 
04:55:12.390 --> 04:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
could provide a policy
 
04:55:15.750 --> 04:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
provision such that if the
 
04:55:18.868 --> 04:55:18.878 align:start position:0%
employee of an insured company
 
04:55:18.878 --> 04:55:20.628 align:start position:0%
employee of an insured company
was

04:55:20.628 --> 04:55:20.638 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:55:23.510 --> 04:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
currently fully vaccinated that he or
 
04:55:24.708 --> 04:55:24.718 align:start position:0%
she might
 
04:55:27.670 --> 04:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
pay less than an insurance premium might
 
04:55:28.948 --> 04:55:28.958 align:start position:0%
receive a
 
04:55:31.590 --> 04:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
discount of 50 on their insurance
 
04:55:34.788 --> 04:55:34.798 align:start position:0%
premium or a gift card or something
 
04:55:38.470 --> 04:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
they could not do it as a discount on
 
04:55:42.150 --> 04:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
the premium it can only be done as a
 
04:55:43.990 --> 04:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
financial incentive
 
04:55:44.000 --> 04:55:45.030 align:start position:0%
financial incentive
so

04:55:45.030 --> 04:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:55:47.510 --> 04:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire does
 
04:55:49.830 --> 04:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
an actual cash payment for people to get
 
04:55:52.788 --> 04:55:52.798 align:start position:0%
flu shots it could be gift cards but it
 
04:55:56.550 --> 04:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
can it cannot be a reduction
 
04:55:56.560 --> 04:55:57.830 align:start position:0%
can it cannot be a reduction
of

04:55:57.830 --> 04:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:55:59.910 --> 04:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
insurance premiums because that would so
 
04:56:01.830 --> 04:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
the insurance company so the insurance
 
04:56:03.590 --> 04:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
company would give
 
04:56:06.470 --> 04:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
through the employer a a cash gift of
 
04:56:08.788 --> 04:56:08.798 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars for getting a covered 19
 
04:56:12.470 --> 04:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine might be that might be higher uh
 
04:56:14.230 --> 04:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
are there any other vaccinations further
 
04:56:15.830 --> 04:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
questions sorry are there any other
 
04:56:17.830 --> 04:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
vaccinations or emanations of which you
 
04:56:20.150 --> 04:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
are aware where there is a a model such
 
04:56:22.948 --> 04:56:22.958 align:start position:0%
as this yes the flu vaccine
 
04:56:24.868 --> 04:56:24.878 align:start position:0%
in in the private sector
 
04:56:24.878 --> 04:56:26.628 align:start position:0%
in in the private sector
um

04:56:26.628 --> 04:56:26.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:29.270 --> 04:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
that i don't know about but i'm not i
 
04:56:31.110 --> 04:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be surprised if there were
 
04:56:31.120 --> 04:56:32.310 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be surprised if there were
since

04:56:32.310 --> 04:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
since
 
04:56:34.310 --> 04:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
there is one for
 
04:56:36.708 --> 04:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
our state employees thank you for the
 
04:56:38.230 --> 04:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
state employees
 
04:56:40.070 --> 04:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
state employees we have per se so that
 
04:56:42.948 --> 04:56:42.958 align:start position:0%
oh let's go which is an erisa plan
 
04:56:45.590 --> 04:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
exempt from this so yeah so i i guess
 
04:56:48.150 --> 04:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
when i saw that uh wellness financial
 
04:56:48.160 --> 04:56:49.510 align:start position:0%
when i saw that uh wellness financial
incentive

04:56:49.510 --> 04:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
incentive
 
04:56:51.110 --> 04:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
i was thinking that you know that
 
04:56:53.030 --> 04:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
there's some if you do health clubs
 
04:56:55.190 --> 04:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
there's some insurance there are some
 
04:56:55.200 --> 04:56:55.830 align:start position:0%
there's some insurance there are some
yeah

04:56:55.830 --> 04:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:56:57.830 --> 04:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
but i have no idea what is the benefit
 
04:57:00.230 --> 04:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
they give to those people today can they
 
04:57:02.310 --> 04:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
reimburse them back for their health
 
04:57:04.390 --> 04:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
care cost i mean has anybody ever gotten
 
04:57:06.390 --> 04:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
one of those ever anybody ever filed for
 
04:57:08.470 --> 04:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
one of those um
 
04:57:13.270 --> 04:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:15.510 --> 04:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
i could qualify for
 
04:57:18.470 --> 04:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
partial payment of my gym membership
 
04:57:20.070 --> 04:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
but as i say
 
04:57:22.628 --> 04:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
federal law would prevent
 
04:57:25.750 --> 04:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
the carrier from reducing premiums right
 
04:57:27.830 --> 04:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
because you can't reach so they did they
 
04:57:31.270 --> 04:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
pay you did you have to go pay your
 
04:57:33.670 --> 04:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh your health at the gym
 
04:57:35.990 --> 04:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
and then you submitted the bill to you
 
04:57:37.590 --> 04:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
and then they sent you
 
04:57:40.150 --> 04:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
a check to pay for part of it yep okay
 
04:57:42.150 --> 04:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
so there is some cash there is some cash
 
04:57:44.310 --> 04:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
flow there's some value in that
 
04:57:50.070 --> 04:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:53.590 --> 04:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
our current medicaid law allow managed
 
04:57:55.350 --> 04:57:55.360 align:start position:0%
care companies
 
04:57:57.110 --> 04:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
and again this isn't the full risk
 
04:57:59.590 --> 04:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
market but it's another example
 
04:57:59.600 --> 04:58:00.868 align:start position:0%
market but it's another example
to

04:58:00.868 --> 04:58:00.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:58:00.878 --> 04:58:02.390 align:start position:0%
to
um

04:58:02.390 --> 04:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:05.350 --> 04:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
offer incentives to
 
04:58:08.628 --> 04:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
the people they're covering on medicaid
 
04:58:12.150 --> 04:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:15.750 --> 04:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh tyler brennan who's
 
04:58:15.760 --> 04:58:29.350 align:start position:0%
thank you uh tyler brennan who's
neutral

04:58:29.350 --> 04:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:31.270 --> 04:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh so yeah tyler brandon life and health
 
04:58:32.390 --> 04:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
director with the new hampshire
 
04:58:34.310 --> 04:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
insurance department we don't have a
 
04:58:37.430 --> 04:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
position in the bill and um i think uh
 
04:58:39.190 --> 04:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
by way of background it's i think most
 
04:58:41.030 --> 04:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
people realize there are certain market
 
04:58:43.270 --> 04:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
rules that apply to what is the group
 
04:58:45.510 --> 04:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
market fully deter group market that
 
04:58:47.430 --> 04:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about um
 
04:58:48.788 --> 04:58:48.798 align:start position:0%
and this bill is appropriately
 
04:58:50.550 --> 04:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
structured just to make changes for the
 
04:58:52.230 --> 04:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
group market so
 
04:58:53.750 --> 04:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
those market rules say you can adjust
 
04:58:56.390 --> 04:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
premiums for certain reasons
 
04:58:57.990 --> 04:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
the biggest thing is that the way the
 
04:58:59.590 --> 04:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
premiums are structured cannot be
 
04:59:02.230 --> 04:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
discriminatory wellness programs which
 
04:59:02.240 --> 04:59:03.030 align:start position:0%
discriminatory wellness programs which
are

04:59:03.030 --> 04:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:59:04.230 --> 04:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
not available if you're in the
 
04:59:06.470 --> 04:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
individual market
 
04:59:08.550 --> 04:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
can make an adjustment or do a benefit
 
04:59:10.708 --> 04:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
such as financial incentive it could be
 
04:59:14.150 --> 04:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
a reward it could be a surcharge
 
04:59:16.470 --> 04:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
the thing is those structure of those
 
04:59:18.150 --> 04:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
wellness programs can't be
 
04:59:19.510 --> 04:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
discriminatory and there are certain
 
04:59:21.830 --> 04:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
rules that go along with it for a long
 
04:59:23.270 --> 04:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
time we weren't sure whether or not the
 
04:59:25.430 --> 04:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
federal government would say a covid
 
04:59:28.310 --> 04:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine was a health factor or whether
 
04:59:30.390 --> 04:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
or not it was a wellness program in
 
04:59:32.310 --> 04:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
october they probably provided some some
 
04:59:34.470 --> 04:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
faq some guidance that said well you
 
04:59:36.230 --> 04:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
know it's a reward and it's a covered
 
04:59:38.070 --> 04:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine we're okay with that there's
 
04:59:39.990 --> 04:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
nothing that addresses it in state law
 
04:59:41.910 --> 04:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
so to the extent that you were to pass
 
04:59:44.070 --> 04:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
legislation like this it clarifies that
 
04:59:45.990 --> 04:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
for all the parties that consistent with
 
04:59:47.430 --> 04:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
the federal guidance there's nothing in
 
04:59:49.430 --> 04:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
state law that would consider
 
04:59:51.430 --> 04:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
consideration of a co-bed vaccine to be
 
04:59:52.628 --> 04:59:52.638 align:start position:0%
a health factor or otherwise
 
04:59:54.708 --> 04:59:54.718 align:start position:0%
discriminatory as long as it meets the
 
04:59:57.110 --> 04:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
rules that are are spelled out
 
04:59:58.390 --> 04:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
and those are the program must be
 
05:00:00.230 --> 05:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
available to all similarly situated
 
05:00:01.910 --> 05:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
individuals regardless of their health
 
05:00:01.920 --> 05:00:02.868 align:start position:0%
individuals regardless of their health
status

05:00:02.868 --> 05:00:02.878 align:start position:0%
status
 
05:00:05.350 --> 05:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
individuals must must be allowed to
 
05:00:07.350 --> 05:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
qualify for the award at least once a
 
05:00:10.150 --> 05:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
year the reward cannot exceed 30 percent
 
05:00:12.470 --> 05:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
of the total cost of the employee only
 
05:00:12.480 --> 05:00:13.510 align:start position:0%
of the total cost of the employee only
coverage

05:00:13.510 --> 05:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
05:00:15.270 --> 05:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
the program must be reasonably designed
 
05:00:17.910 --> 05:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
to promote health or prevent disease it
 
05:00:20.310 --> 05:00:20.320 align:start position:0%
must be disclosed in all plan materials
 
05:00:21.670 --> 05:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
the terms of the program and the
 
05:00:23.110 --> 05:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
availability of the reasonable
 
05:00:25.030 --> 05:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
alternative if the individual cannot
 
05:00:27.590 --> 05:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
satisfy the standard due to a medical
 
05:00:27.600 --> 05:00:29.830 align:start position:0%
satisfy the standard due to a medical
condition

05:00:29.830 --> 05:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
condition
 
05:00:32.070 --> 05:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
so it is enabling in the way it says may
 
05:00:34.150 --> 05:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
it clarifies that coveted vaccines are
 
05:00:35.590 --> 05:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
not a health consideration of a health
 
05:00:37.830 --> 05:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
factor which is a very sensitive area
 
05:00:39.910 --> 05:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
and it is consistent with the federal
 
05:00:41.990 --> 05:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
guidance that we have that was it took a
 
05:00:43.670 --> 05:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
while for us to get anything and of
 
05:00:45.110 --> 05:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
course the october guidance doesn't
 
05:00:47.270 --> 05:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
cover all scenarios but it does suggest
 
05:00:49.430 --> 05:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
that if it's financial incentive isn't a
 
05:00:52.470 --> 05:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
reward then it's permissible
 
05:00:54.470 --> 05:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions okay so do
 
05:00:57.670 --> 05:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
we now have under that is is it that
 
05:00:57.680 --> 05:00:58.868 align:start position:0%
we now have under that is is it that
structure

05:00:58.868 --> 05:00:58.878 align:start position:0%
structure
 
05:01:00.470 --> 05:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
for someone uh
 
05:01:03.270 --> 05:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
to get the flu shot
 
05:01:04.948 --> 05:01:04.958 align:start position:0%
so the flu shot hasn't had the same
 
05:01:06.788 --> 05:01:06.798 align:start position:0%
concern that it's actually consideration
 
05:01:08.230 --> 05:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
of a health factor
 
05:01:10.390 --> 05:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
the cova vaccine has had some
 
05:01:11.750 --> 05:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
consideration that it is more of a
 
05:01:13.910 --> 05:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
health factor than it is actually a
 
05:01:16.070 --> 05:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
wellness type program but the flu
 
05:01:17.830 --> 05:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine hasn't been considered the same
 
05:01:19.510 --> 05:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
way so that's been permissible and
 
05:01:21.750 --> 05:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
that's fine so there's no problem there
 
05:01:24.550 --> 05:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
but the vaccine only because the
 
05:01:24.560 --> 05:01:25.350 align:start position:0%
but the vaccine only because the
because

05:01:25.350 --> 05:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:01:26.868 --> 05:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
the idea was that keeping you out of the
 
05:01:29.110 --> 05:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
hospital keeping away off the ventilator
 
05:01:30.550 --> 05:01:30.560 align:start position:0%
was the
 
05:01:32.470 --> 05:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
um i think there are a range of reasons
 
05:01:34.628 --> 05:01:34.638 align:start position:0%
that it's considered different um some
 
05:01:35.750 --> 05:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
of them could even be considered
 
05:01:35.760 --> 05:01:40.788 align:start position:0%
of them could even be considered
political

05:01:40.788 --> 05:01:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:44.230 --> 05:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
okay so at the end of the day
 
05:01:46.708 --> 05:01:46.718 align:start position:0%
uh are there
 
05:01:49.750 --> 05:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
any so if the flu is there any vaccines
 
05:01:51.110 --> 05:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
now that
 
05:01:53.270 --> 05:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
you can be given incentive for in other
 
05:01:53.280 --> 05:01:54.230 align:start position:0%
you can be given incentive for in other
words

05:01:54.230 --> 05:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
words
 
05:01:55.350 --> 05:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
i know that i
 
05:01:57.750 --> 05:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
my shingles one shot single wasn't good
 
05:01:59.990 --> 05:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
enough now i got to go back and get a
 
05:02:00.000 --> 05:02:00.948 align:start position:0%
enough now i got to go back and get a
2-1

05:02:00.948 --> 05:02:00.958 align:start position:0%
2-1
 
05:02:03.190 --> 05:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
is there any incen is there any
 
05:02:04.470 --> 05:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
insurance company that's offering
 
05:02:08.390 --> 05:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:10.550 --> 05:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
i'd have to go back and look um i mean
 
05:02:12.550 --> 05:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
typically it's when often vaccines are
 
05:02:13.990 --> 05:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
considered preventive so they don't have
 
05:02:15.430 --> 05:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
cost sharing so in some ways that could
 
05:02:17.270 --> 05:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
be that could be considered incentive
 
05:02:19.030 --> 05:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
well isn't it the same
 
05:02:20.310 --> 05:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
this is different because it's more like
 
05:02:22.070 --> 05:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
the gym membership
 
05:02:23.750 --> 05:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
getting you think this is more like the
 
05:02:24.948 --> 05:02:24.958 align:start position:0%
gym members well that's the way it's
 
05:02:27.030 --> 05:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
phrased the wellness finance way it's
 
05:02:29.350 --> 05:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
phrased that way right but that's that's
 
05:02:32.070 --> 05:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
the wording of the bill i'm just
 
05:02:34.150 --> 05:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
it would be to be honest you know tyler
 
05:02:35.830 --> 05:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
you know me a long time
 
05:02:38.070 --> 05:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
legislation you know for one-time events
 
05:02:39.750 --> 05:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
at sunsets
 
05:02:41.590 --> 05:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
you start to wonder why you know why why
 
05:02:44.230 --> 05:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
we're bothering so but if it's a if it's
 
05:02:44.240 --> 05:02:44.948 align:start position:0%
we're bothering so but if it's a if it's
an

05:02:44.948 --> 05:02:44.958 align:start position:0%
an
 
05:02:46.948 --> 05:02:46.958 align:start position:0%
issue that we we really want to solve
 
05:02:49.110 --> 05:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
forever in other words that you know are
 
05:02:51.270 --> 05:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
there situations where we think
 
05:02:53.830 --> 05:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies should be
 
05:02:56.310 --> 05:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
doing that and and that's what the
 
05:02:58.230 --> 05:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
wellness financial incentive is right
 
05:02:59.670 --> 05:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
that we thought that was a good idea
 
05:03:01.350 --> 05:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
that insurance companies
 
05:03:03.750 --> 05:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
pay people to if they go to you know to
 
05:03:03.760 --> 05:03:05.270 align:start position:0%
pay people to if they go to you know to
the

05:03:05.270 --> 05:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:03:07.030 --> 05:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
to the gym yeah
 
05:03:09.670 --> 05:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
well we we try to um encourage sort of
 
05:03:12.470 --> 05:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
competition uh when you don't need
 
05:03:14.230 --> 05:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
regulations so i think to the extent
 
05:03:16.470 --> 05:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
that it's clear this is permissible
 
05:03:18.550 --> 05:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps employers would drive it perhaps
 
05:03:20.628 --> 05:03:20.638 align:start position:0%
insurers who think that people are going
 
05:03:22.550 --> 05:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
to be less expensive if they get a
 
05:03:24.310 --> 05:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine are going to drive it but
 
05:03:25.750 --> 05:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
clearly there's going to be a cost to
 
05:03:27.510 --> 05:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
the insurer to set up the program make
 
05:03:29.910 --> 05:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
sure it complies with all requirements
 
05:03:31.030 --> 05:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
and then of course they're going to be
 
05:03:33.830 --> 05:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
paying this reward or potentially
 
05:03:35.110 --> 05:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
collecting some sort of surcharge
 
05:03:36.390 --> 05:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
associated with so there has to be sort
 
05:03:38.948 --> 05:03:38.958 align:start position:0%
of the business reason to do it um even
 
05:03:41.270 --> 05:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
with permissible legislation like this
 
05:03:42.948 --> 05:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
the legislation doesn't say they shall
 
05:03:44.150 --> 05:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
do it that might be a different
 
05:03:45.750 --> 05:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
discussion well that would be dead in
 
05:03:47.430 --> 05:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
the water yeah
 
05:03:48.708 --> 05:03:48.718 align:start position:0%
but clearly it's a polish decision
 
05:03:49.670 --> 05:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not you want to do it for a
 
05:03:52.150 --> 05:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
year something longer or not at all
 
05:03:52.160 --> 05:03:54.868 align:start position:0%
year something longer or not at all
okay

05:03:54.868 --> 05:03:54.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:57.030 --> 05:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
representative patusek
 
05:03:58.708 --> 05:03:58.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
05:04:00.150 --> 05:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr brennan for taking my
 
05:04:01.190 --> 05:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for your
 
05:04:01.200 --> 05:04:02.470 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for your
testimony

05:04:02.470 --> 05:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:04:04.868 --> 05:04:04.878 align:start position:0%
is there any in any
 
05:04:08.550 --> 05:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
rules in the insurance
 
05:04:10.868 --> 05:04:10.878 align:start position:0%
world that prevent
 
05:04:10.878 --> 05:04:11.250 align:start position:0%
world that prevent
a

05:04:11.250 --> 05:04:11.260 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:04:11.260 --> 05:04:12.788 align:start position:0%
a
[Music]

05:04:12.788 --> 05:04:12.798 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:04:15.110 --> 05:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
health carrier from offering any of
 
05:04:18.788 --> 05:04:18.798 align:start position:0%
these incentives already
 
05:04:20.470 --> 05:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
if so it would be because it's
 
05:04:22.150 --> 05:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
considered discriminatory because it's
 
05:04:24.390 --> 05:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
consideration of a health factor
 
05:04:25.910 --> 05:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
the insurance department hasn't taken
 
05:04:28.550 --> 05:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
that position but somebody could argue
 
05:04:35.910 --> 05:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:37.830 --> 05:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
 
05:04:40.230 --> 05:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
brennan i just have a quick nuts and
 
05:04:43.110 --> 05:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
bolts question uh the terminology at the
 
05:04:45.910 --> 05:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
time of enrollment is that the time of
 
05:04:48.070 --> 05:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
enrollment and of re-enrollment or is it
 
05:04:49.910 --> 05:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
just a one-shot deal when one enters a
 
05:04:49.920 --> 05:04:50.868 align:start position:0%
just a one-shot deal when one enters a
program

05:04:50.868 --> 05:04:50.878 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:04:50.878 --> 05:04:52.390 align:start position:0%
program
um

05:04:52.390 --> 05:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:54.470 --> 05:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
i would interpret that to mean when your
 
05:04:56.550 --> 05:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
plan year begins
 
05:04:58.708 --> 05:04:58.718 align:start position:0%
okay which of course happens every year
 
05:05:01.350 --> 05:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
so theoretically it could happen in 2022
 
05:05:04.708 --> 05:05:04.718 align:start position:0%
and also in 2023 before sunset thank you
 
05:05:06.390 --> 05:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
that's right that's not necessarily sort
 
05:05:08.150 --> 05:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
of our legal analysis but that's i think
 
05:05:13.110 --> 05:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:13.120 --> 05:05:14.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:05:14.470 --> 05:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:05:17.990 --> 05:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:21.030 --> 05:05:21.040 align:start position:0%

chester i'm a resident of bedford new
 
05:05:38.150 --> 05:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire i oppose this bill
 
05:05:41.190 --> 05:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
primarily because
 
05:05:44.708 --> 05:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
bottom line this is a form of bribery
 
05:05:46.788 --> 05:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
plain and simple um
 
05:05:49.270 --> 05:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
i worked for a private nonprofit health
 
05:05:49.280 --> 05:05:50.390 align:start position:0%
i worked for a private nonprofit health
insurance

05:05:50.390 --> 05:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
05:05:53.110 --> 05:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh company in another state
 
05:05:57.030 --> 05:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
and we received gift cards for
 
05:05:59.830 --> 05:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
incentives for things like if we could
 
05:06:01.830 --> 05:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
get our patients to
 
05:06:04.470 --> 05:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
add additional medications to their
 
05:06:08.628 --> 05:06:08.638 align:start position:0%
regime if we could get patients to take
 
05:06:11.430 --> 05:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
the flu vaccine or
 
05:06:11.440 --> 05:06:13.110 align:start position:0%
the flu vaccine or
become

05:06:13.110 --> 05:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
become
 
05:06:14.868 --> 05:06:14.878 align:start position:0%
consistent with
 
05:06:16.948 --> 05:06:16.958 align:start position:0%
prenatal vitamins if they happen to be
 
05:06:18.868 --> 05:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
pregnant we had incentives for
 
05:06:18.878 --> 05:06:21.190 align:start position:0%
pregnant we had incentives for
everything

05:06:21.190 --> 05:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
everything
 
05:06:21.200 --> 05:06:22.390 align:start position:0%
everything
and

05:06:22.390 --> 05:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:06:25.590 --> 05:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
the reality is is what that did is the
 
05:06:27.830 --> 05:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
people that really needed the money the
 
05:06:30.310 --> 05:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
ones that the ones that we try not to
 
05:06:30.320 --> 05:06:31.670 align:start position:0%
ones that the ones that we try not to
discriminate

05:06:31.670 --> 05:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
discriminate
 
05:06:33.350 --> 05:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
discriminate against
 
05:06:35.830 --> 05:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
were the ones that were taking that
 
05:06:38.470 --> 05:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
money taking those bribes because that
 
05:06:40.708 --> 05:06:40.718 align:start position:0%
meant that that was like
 
05:06:43.510 --> 05:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
50 extra dollars for groceries that's
 
05:06:46.390 --> 05:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
awesome i'll do it i'll do anything
 
05:06:48.470 --> 05:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
it started getting really hairy when
 
05:06:50.868 --> 05:06:50.878 align:start position:0%
they started giving not only our
 
05:06:53.110 --> 05:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
patients but us
 
05:06:56.070 --> 05:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
200 gift card incentives
 
05:06:57.910 --> 05:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
for ect
 
05:06:59.350 --> 05:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
now i don't know if you folks know what
 
05:07:02.390 --> 05:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
ect is but that's electroshock therapy
 
05:07:04.628 --> 05:07:04.638 align:start position:0%
and no one should be recommending that
 
05:07:06.788 --> 05:07:06.798 align:start position:0%
kind of therapy without going through a
 
05:07:09.750 --> 05:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
significant risk benefit analysis with
 
05:07:10.868 --> 05:07:10.878 align:start position:0%
the patient
 
05:07:12.948 --> 05:07:12.958 align:start position:0%
we were not told that we had to do that
 
05:07:15.910 --> 05:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
we were an insurance company our job was
 
05:07:17.830 --> 05:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
to get the most money
 
05:07:20.230 --> 05:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
from the federal government without with
 
05:07:23.270 --> 05:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
and spend the least on the patient
 
05:07:25.510 --> 05:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
um that's the main reason why i'm
 
05:07:27.270 --> 05:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill
 
05:07:30.230 --> 05:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
um additionally health care should
 
05:07:31.510 --> 05:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
health care
 
05:07:31.520 --> 05:07:32.628 align:start position:0%
health care
really

05:07:32.628 --> 05:07:32.638 align:start position:0%
really
 
05:07:35.190 --> 05:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
i don't understand why healthcare ever
 
05:07:37.350 --> 05:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
became such the political beast that it
 
05:07:37.360 --> 05:07:38.230 align:start position:0%
became such the political beast that it
did

05:07:38.230 --> 05:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
did
 
05:07:41.350 --> 05:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:44.070 --> 05:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
this is my nephew matthew
 
05:07:46.788 --> 05:07:46.798 align:start position:0%
after his fourth birth booster he got a
 
05:07:50.708 --> 05:07:50.718 align:start position:0%
he was an emt he got a 500 bonus
 
05:07:53.430 --> 05:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
in flight so that he could go visit his
 
05:07:53.440 --> 05:07:54.788 align:start position:0%
in flight so that he could go visit his
mom

05:07:54.788 --> 05:07:54.798 align:start position:0%
mom
 
05:07:57.830 --> 05:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
he died the day he arrived in florida
 
05:08:00.868 --> 05:08:00.878 align:start position:0%
from the cove vaccine booster now i'm
 
05:08:03.110 --> 05:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
not saying that the coveted vaccine
 
05:08:06.070 --> 05:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
booster did or did not cause his death
 
05:08:11.030 --> 05:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
but that com but he may not have chosen
 
05:08:14.390 --> 05:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
to take that vaccine booster had he not
 
05:08:18.310 --> 05:08:18.320 align:start position:0%
been given that 500 incentive plane fare
 
05:08:20.390 --> 05:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
and that's why something like this can
 
05:08:22.868 --> 05:08:22.878 align:start position:0%
never happen to new hampshire
 
05:08:27.510 --> 05:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:31.270 --> 05:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs has a question
 
05:08:31.280 --> 05:08:33.030 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs has a question
please

05:08:33.030 --> 05:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
please
 
05:08:35.670 --> 05:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair um
 
05:08:37.110 --> 05:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
do you think it might be in the public
 
05:08:39.430 --> 05:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
good for um
 
05:08:41.750 --> 05:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
this is a voluntary program
 
05:08:41.760 --> 05:08:42.708 align:start position:0%
this is a voluntary program
that

05:08:42.708 --> 05:08:42.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:08:45.190 --> 05:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
we save money on somebody if somebody
 
05:08:47.510 --> 05:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
chooses to do this and we can save a
 
05:08:49.670 --> 05:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
hundred and thirty thousand dollars on
 
05:08:51.990 --> 05:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
somebody being in a ventilator which we
 
05:08:53.270 --> 05:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
all pay for
 
05:08:55.910 --> 05:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
we we would all pay for so this with
 
05:08:58.150 --> 05:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
this this enabling legislation which is
 
05:08:59.990 --> 05:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
not a requirement means that it would
 
05:09:02.470 --> 05:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
lower insurance costs for everybody and
 
05:09:04.550 --> 05:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
would also free up beds we don't know
 
05:09:05.670 --> 05:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen in the future
 
05:09:08.070 --> 05:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
with covid there were not beds available
 
05:09:10.150 --> 05:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
for people who had had other things that
 
05:09:12.310 --> 05:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
needed to be treated including ongoing
 
05:09:14.470 --> 05:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
cancer treatments because there were no
 
05:09:16.470 --> 05:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
beds available because of covet do you
 
05:09:18.390 --> 05:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
think that that might be a public good
 
05:09:20.868 --> 05:09:20.878 align:start position:0%
that that outweighs some of the other
 
05:09:20.878 --> 05:09:21.990 align:start position:0%
that that outweighs some of the other
concerns

05:09:21.990 --> 05:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
05:09:25.190 --> 05:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
i wish i could agree with you um what we
 
05:09:27.830 --> 05:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
know now that we did not know then
 
05:09:29.830 --> 05:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
is that had we taken a different
 
05:09:32.390 --> 05:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
approach to covert 19 that a lot of the
 
05:09:35.110 --> 05:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
people that went on ventilators and died
 
05:09:37.910 --> 05:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
from being ventilated may not have that
 
05:09:41.030 --> 05:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
may not have happened we don't know had
 
05:09:45.270 --> 05:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
we done more robust preventative type of
 
05:09:45.280 --> 05:09:47.430 align:start position:0%
we done more robust preventative type of
stuff

05:09:47.430 --> 05:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
05:09:50.550 --> 05:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
in work on natural immunity increasing
 
05:09:52.230 --> 05:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
our you know all that stuff that they
 
05:09:54.310 --> 05:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
talk about now i'm not saying whether
 
05:09:56.310 --> 05:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
that would have made a difference but
 
05:09:59.190 --> 05:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
one of the things we know in 2022
 
05:10:03.190 --> 05:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
is that this covid19 vaccine and all the
 
05:10:07.270 --> 05:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
all the approaches that we have taken to
 
05:10:10.628 --> 05:10:10.638 align:start position:0%
covert 19 has caused more problems than
 
05:10:10.638 --> 05:10:11.830 align:start position:0%
covert 19 has caused more problems than
solutions

05:10:11.830 --> 05:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
solutions
 
05:10:14.230 --> 05:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
um within the mental health
 
05:10:17.590 --> 05:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
situation uh within like i said with
 
05:10:17.600 --> 05:10:19.350 align:start position:0%
situation uh within like i said with
matthew

05:10:19.350 --> 05:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
matthew
 
05:10:21.190 --> 05:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
he wasn't ever put on a ventilator he
 
05:10:22.948 --> 05:10:22.958 align:start position:0%
died his heart burst
 
05:10:22.958 --> 05:10:24.788 align:start position:0%
died his heart burst
um

05:10:24.788 --> 05:10:24.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:24.798 --> 05:10:26.230 align:start position:0%
um
so

05:10:26.230 --> 05:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:10:29.510 --> 05:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
i i can't say that it would have saved
 
05:10:33.670 --> 05:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
money the last piece is is that
 
05:10:36.390 --> 05:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
and let a piece of legis in my opinion a
 
05:10:38.788 --> 05:10:38.798 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation like this
 
05:10:42.550 --> 05:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
would open the doors for all kinds of
 
05:10:45.750 --> 05:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
litigation with regards to
 
05:10:45.760 --> 05:10:48.830 align:start position:0%
litigation with regards to
discrimination

05:10:48.830 --> 05:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:51.990 --> 05:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
coercion uh and potentially even crimes
 
05:10:55.030 --> 05:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
against humanity if if it comes out
 
05:11:01.430 --> 05:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:03.190 --> 05:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
representative greeson
 
05:11:04.628 --> 05:11:04.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you ma'am
 
05:11:07.510 --> 05:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
for coming and testifying uh
 
05:11:09.750 --> 05:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
don't you think by this point everybody
 
05:11:11.990 --> 05:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
who wanted a shot or a booster shot has
 
05:11:13.910 --> 05:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
pretty much already done that so we
 
05:11:15.590 --> 05:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
should pretty much do like elsa and let
 
05:11:19.030 --> 05:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:21.910 --> 05:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
i understand the reason i understand the
 
05:11:21.920 --> 05:11:22.868 align:start position:0%
i understand the reason i understand the
intent

05:11:22.868 --> 05:11:22.878 align:start position:0%
intent
 
05:11:24.628 --> 05:11:24.638 align:start position:0%
um and that's
 
05:11:27.110 --> 05:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
that's part of the reason why i think a
 
05:11:29.590 --> 05:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
lot of this coven 19 legislation is
 
05:11:31.350 --> 05:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
still coming before us similar to the
 
05:11:33.590 --> 05:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
masks and the other things is we don't
 
05:11:35.350 --> 05:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
know what the next variant is we don't
 
05:11:36.708 --> 05:11:36.718 align:start position:0%
know what the next
 
05:11:40.150 --> 05:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
thing is but what we do know is that
 
05:11:40.160 --> 05:11:41.270 align:start position:0%
thing is but what we do know is that
um

05:11:41.270 --> 05:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:44.470 --> 05:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
we really people that have people that
 
05:11:47.590 --> 05:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
have chosen to take the vax the coven 19
 
05:11:50.310 --> 05:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine have um i don't know if i told
 
05:11:52.708 --> 05:11:52.718 align:start position:0%
you folks but i'm vaccine injured not
 
05:11:55.510 --> 05:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
from the coven 19 vaccine um
 
05:11:57.990 --> 05:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
but i've been told that i should not
 
05:12:01.590 --> 05:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
take the coven 19 vaccine at this time
 
05:12:04.070 --> 05:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
until it's until it's been
 
05:12:08.470 --> 05:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:10.948 --> 05:12:10.958 align:start position:0%
however i can't get a i can't get a
 
05:12:12.708 --> 05:12:12.718 align:start position:0%
doctor to sign off saying i shouldn't
 
05:12:15.430 --> 05:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
take the vaccine my doctor who is no
 
05:12:17.110 --> 05:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
longer my doctor
 
05:12:19.750 --> 05:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
made it very clear that the only way she
 
05:12:22.628 --> 05:12:22.638 align:start position:0%
could give me a sign off to not take the
 
05:12:24.788 --> 05:12:24.798 align:start position:0%
vaccine is if she knew beyond a shadow
 
05:12:28.150 --> 05:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
of a doubt that it would kill me
 
05:12:31.670 --> 05:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
um that being said that's exactly why
 
05:12:33.270 --> 05:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
this kind of thing
 
05:12:35.830 --> 05:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
can't go into place and we need to keep
 
05:12:38.390 --> 05:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
fighting against it
 
05:12:39.830 --> 05:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:12:42.070 --> 05:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
represent van gaal
 
05:12:44.868 --> 05:12:44.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um first of all i'm
 
05:12:46.708 --> 05:12:46.718 align:start position:0%

05:12:48.390 --> 05:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
loss of your nephew thank you and i
 
05:12:49.670 --> 05:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the passion and the
 
05:12:52.788 --> 05:12:52.798 align:start position:0%
information that you bring to us um
 
05:12:54.550 --> 05:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately some of the circumstances
 
05:12:56.070 --> 05:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
you've mentioned regarding your
 
05:12:56.080 --> 05:12:57.270 align:start position:0%
you've mentioned regarding your
employment

05:12:57.270 --> 05:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
employment
 
05:12:59.350 --> 05:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
are aligned with unscrupulous
 
05:13:02.150 --> 05:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
incentivizing this is incentivizing
 
05:13:05.190 --> 05:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
about health care as opposed to
 
05:13:07.190 --> 05:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
the unscrupulous nature of what you have
 
05:13:09.990 --> 05:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
have seen do you not do you recognize
 
05:13:12.550 --> 05:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
that some people see this as
 
05:13:15.910 --> 05:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
a value to society to incentivize what
 
05:13:18.150 --> 05:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
we believe to be good health bearing in
 
05:13:19.670 --> 05:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
mind of course that there's so much
 
05:13:21.750 --> 05:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
unknown about covet i respect that and i
 
05:13:23.830 --> 05:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
respect you um do you believe that
 
05:13:26.390 --> 05:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
that's a possibility i believe that the
 
05:13:29.190 --> 05:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
intent is absolutely that um
 
05:13:31.110 --> 05:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
um when i started working for this
 
05:13:34.070 --> 05:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
private non-profit profit agency that
 
05:13:35.910 --> 05:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
was their intent too this private
 
05:13:37.750 --> 05:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
non-profit agency was started by a
 
05:13:40.390 --> 05:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
doctor and a nurse
 
05:13:40.940 --> 05:13:40.950 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:13:40.950 --> 05:13:45.750 align:start position:0%
and then
[Music]

05:13:45.750 --> 05:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:48.948 --> 05:13:48.958 align:start position:0%
insurance took over or or
 
05:13:51.430 --> 05:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
the humanity went out of the insurance
 
05:13:53.830 --> 05:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
business and i think that that happens
 
05:13:58.150 --> 05:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
too much um with regards to like uh
 
05:14:00.070 --> 05:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
comparing this to a gym membership a gym
 
05:14:02.708 --> 05:14:02.718 align:start position:0%
membership when you are involved
 
05:14:04.310 --> 05:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
enrolled in a gym membership you're
 
05:14:06.310 --> 05:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
going sometimes they'll pay for your
 
05:14:08.230 --> 05:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
membership or portion of your membership
 
05:14:10.150 --> 05:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes they'll reimburse you but the
 
05:14:11.990 --> 05:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
other thing that you have to do is you
 
05:14:14.470 --> 05:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
have to sign a contract saying you will
 
05:14:18.550 --> 05:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
attend two to three times a week for six
 
05:14:21.190 --> 05:14:21.200 align:start position:0%
months to be able to get any of that
 
05:14:23.750 --> 05:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
benefit the problem with the covet 19
 
05:14:27.190 --> 05:14:27.200 align:start position:0%
vaccine is there is no there is at this
 
05:14:30.390 --> 05:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
time there is no real cost analysis
 
05:14:33.350 --> 05:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
benefit to the coven 19 vaccine and or
 
05:14:35.110 --> 05:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
the boosters

manage
 
05:18:12.788 --> 05:18:12.798 align:start position:0%

from our public jurisdictions risk pools
 
05:18:19.030 --> 05:18:19.040 align:start position:0%

independent advisor
 
05:18:25.190 --> 05:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
currently a company that's located in

currently a company that's located in
philadelphia

05:18:26.948 --> 05:18:26.958 align:start position:0%
philadelphia
 
05:18:30.628 --> 05:18:30.638 align:start position:0%
and since the its creation 30 years ago
 
05:18:33.830 --> 05:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's really grown it's now
 
05:18:37.150 --> 05:18:37.160 align:start position:0%
got assets of just under
 
05:18:40.390 --> 05:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
235 million dollars
 
05:18:42.390 --> 05:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
and is currently earning a rate of
 
05:18:42.400 --> 05:18:43.510 align:start position:0%
and is currently earning a rate of
return

05:18:43.510 --> 05:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
return
 
05:18:47.350 --> 05:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
that is two point it's point
 
05:18:47.360 --> 05:18:48.550 align:start position:0%
that is two point it's point
two

05:18:48.550 --> 05:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:18:51.030 --> 05:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
eight seven five percent
 
05:18:52.390 --> 05:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
05:18:55.030 --> 05:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
under point three percent
 
05:18:59.190 --> 05:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
um but while this fund has really grown
 
05:19:01.750 --> 05:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
it really hasn't been looked at
 
05:19:04.550 --> 05:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
since it was created 30 years ago
 
05:19:07.670 --> 05:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
and we think over in the senate and my
 
05:19:10.708 --> 05:19:10.718 align:start position:0%
house co-sponsors that it's worth
 
05:19:13.590 --> 05:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
taking a study committee look at
 
05:19:17.590 --> 05:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
oversight and regulation so for example
 
05:19:20.230 --> 05:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
is the banking commissioner's regulatory
 
05:19:23.990 --> 05:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
role in need of tweaks and mr hale from
 
05:19:26.230 --> 05:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
the bankers association is here and he
 
05:19:28.310 --> 05:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
can speak more to that are the
 
05:19:31.590 --> 05:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
investments maximizing the return
 
05:19:35.750 --> 05:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
along with the liquidity and safety
 
05:19:37.830 --> 05:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
that i would
 
05:19:41.430 --> 05:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
be considering that a friendly amendment
 
05:19:44.628 --> 05:19:44.638 align:start position:0%
it seems like a very complex issue with
 
05:19:44.638 --> 05:19:45.590 align:start position:0%
it seems like a very complex issue with
um

05:19:45.590 --> 05:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:47.990 --> 05:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
with a lot of moving parts it might take
 
05:19:50.868 --> 05:19:50.878 align:start position:0%
a little bit longer to really make it
 
05:19:52.310 --> 05:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
well via i mean to come up with
 
05:19:55.590 --> 05:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
something i wouldn't be opposed

participants they are created by and are
 
05:21:39.830 --> 05:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
governed by government rather than

states
 
05:21:46.948 --> 05:21:46.958 align:start position:0%
and generally they've been formed either
 
05:21:48.548 --> 05:21:48.558 align:start position:0%
by the state itself
 
05:21:50.070 --> 05:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
like in new hampshire
 
05:21:52.230 --> 05:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
or by a single municipality or by a
 
05:21:54.708 --> 05:21:54.718 align:start position:0%
group of municipalities and the typical
 
05:21:57.670 --> 05:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
goals of an lgip's investment portfolio
 
05:21:59.270 --> 05:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
again like new hampshire
 
05:22:01.350 --> 05:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
are safety of principle
 
05:22:03.110 --> 05:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
sufficient liquidity
 
05:22:05.910 --> 05:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
and offering a competitive yield
 
05:22:08.230 --> 05:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
lgip strive to be compliant with all
 
05:22:10.470 --> 05:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
relevant state statutes and their own
 
05:22:12.310 --> 05:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
investment policy permissions or
 
05:22:12.320 --> 05:22:13.670 align:start position:0%

05:22:13.670 --> 05:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
05:22:15.750 --> 05:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
they seek between risk and yield
 
05:22:18.548 --> 05:22:18.558 align:start position:0%
diversification and convenience and
 
05:22:20.948 --> 05:22:20.958 align:start position:0%
because of these features every investor
 
05:22:23.270 --> 05:22:23.280 align:start position:0%

rate
 
05:22:25.910 --> 05:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
rather than different yields or rates
 
05:22:28.628 --> 05:22:28.638 align:start position:0%
determined by an offering corporation's
 
05:22:31.190 --> 05:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
measurement of acceptable profits
 
05:22:33.430 --> 05:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
total relationship revenue or preference
 
05:22:36.470 --> 05:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
for one local unit over another
 
05:22:37.990 --> 05:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire pool was established
 
05:22:41.430 --> 05:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
by legislation 30 years ago in 92 and
 
05:22:44.310 --> 05:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
was created to provide choices to meet
 
05:22:46.548 --> 05:22:46.558 align:start position:0%
the unique needs of the state and local
 
05:22:48.628 --> 05:22:48.638 align:start position:0%
government units specifically the need
 
05:22:51.110 --> 05:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
for prudent management of public funds
 
05:22:52.548 --> 05:22:52.558 align:start position:0%
that have been entrusted to local

uh representative greeson has a question
 
05:24:50.390 --> 05:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and and uh thank you
 
05:24:52.708 --> 05:24:52.718 align:start position:0%
ma'am for your testimony i guess i
 
05:24:54.070 --> 05:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
actually have a little bit of a two-part
 
05:24:56.628 --> 05:24:56.638 align:start position:0%
question here how much was the fund when
 
05:24:59.390 --> 05:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
you took over uh administration of it in
 
05:25:01.750 --> 05:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
2015 so how much growth have we
 
05:25:04.788 --> 05:25:04.798 align:start position:0%
experienced since then and i reiterate
 
05:25:07.510 --> 05:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
my question of do you have a fiduciary
 
05:25:09.190 --> 05:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
obligation to
 
05:25:12.470 --> 05:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh your investor uh your customer here
 
05:25:15.350 --> 05:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh that you are obligated to maximize
 
05:25:19.350 --> 05:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
the rate of return on those investments
 
05:25:22.390 --> 05:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
are you under fiduciary obligation
 
05:25:22.400 --> 05:25:23.910 align:start position:0%
are you under fiduciary obligation
okay

05:25:23.910 --> 05:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:25:26.230 --> 05:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
i can tell you our fiduciary obligation
 
05:25:28.230 --> 05:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
is to every investor
 
05:25:29.830 --> 05:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
every investor that is involved in the
 
05:25:29.840 --> 05:25:31.270 align:start position:0%
every investor that is involved in the
pool

05:25:31.270 --> 05:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
pool
 
05:25:32.470 --> 05:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
so that is
 
05:25:35.910 --> 05:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
all of those entities that i mentioned
 
05:25:35.920 --> 05:25:36.708 align:start position:0%
all of those entities that i mentioned
um

05:25:36.708 --> 05:25:36.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:38.390 --> 05:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
the amount at the time of the pool in
 
05:25:38.400 --> 05:25:41.110 align:start position:0%
the amount at the time of the pool in
2015

05:25:41.110 --> 05:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
2015
 
05:25:42.868 --> 05:25:42.878 align:start position:0%
i don't know an exact number i'm happy
 
05:25:46.948 --> 05:25:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:48.948 --> 05:25:48.958 align:start position:0%
i wanted to say 150 million but i could
 
05:25:50.868 --> 05:25:50.878 align:start position:0%
be wrong so i'd rather
 
05:25:56.868 --> 05:25:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:00.470 --> 05:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative mack later thank you um
 
05:26:02.948 --> 05:26:02.958 align:start position:0%
not all this money is short-term money
 
05:26:06.868 --> 05:26:06.878 align:start position:0%
is that correct um we have
 
05:26:08.868 --> 05:26:08.878 align:start position:0%
short term is in there is there is no
 
05:26:12.390 --> 05:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
investment longer than 360 days and we
 
05:26:14.788 --> 05:26:14.798 align:start position:0%
have investments that have call features
 
05:26:16.868 --> 05:26:16.878 align:start position:0%
so if we find an industry
 
05:26:19.830 --> 05:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
that maybe not be doing so well we can
 
05:26:21.990 --> 05:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
pull that investment but typically they
 
05:26:23.910 --> 05:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
are short-term investments
 
05:26:26.310 --> 05:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
well you you mentioned that you have uh
 
05:26:29.510 --> 05:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
trustees of trust funds correct and uh i
 
05:26:31.910 --> 05:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
i'm from jackson i'm on the trustees of
 
05:26:33.750 --> 05:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
trust funds in jackson
 
05:26:35.590 --> 05:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
and i think when i came there we were
 
05:26:38.230 --> 05:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
invested with you folks and our rate of
 
05:26:40.230 --> 05:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
return at that time was
 
05:26:40.240 --> 05:26:42.070 align:start position:0%
return at that time was
.38 0.38

05:26:42.070 --> 05:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
.38 0.38
 
05:26:44.390 --> 05:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
the problem with that is obviously we
 
05:26:44.400 --> 05:26:45.270 align:start position:0%
the problem with that is obviously we
have

05:26:45.270 --> 05:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:26:47.990 --> 05:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
public funds that are short-term
 
05:26:50.868 --> 05:26:50.878 align:start position:0%
but we had private funds so for example
 
05:26:54.390 --> 05:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
we had private funds with with durations
 
05:26:56.868 --> 05:26:56.878 align:start position:0%
of uh you know they've been in a couple
 
05:26:58.628 --> 05:26:58.638 align:start position:0%
30 years or so
 
05:27:01.350 --> 05:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
so what we did is we took it from the
 
05:27:03.030 --> 05:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
the prudent uh
 
05:27:03.040 --> 05:27:04.230 align:start position:0%
the prudent uh
uh

05:27:04.230 --> 05:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:27:06.708 --> 05:27:06.718 align:start position:0%
the prudent man rule on the private
 
05:27:09.430 --> 05:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
funds to the prudent investor rule
 
05:27:11.910 --> 05:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
and we went from .38
 
05:27:14.470 --> 05:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
over the last five years we've made uh
 
05:27:17.830 --> 05:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
nine percent compounded um it seems to
 
05:27:20.390 --> 05:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
me that a lot of those funds that you
 
05:27:21.990 --> 05:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
have you're
 
05:27:24.868 --> 05:27:24.878 align:start position:0%
totally invested wrong if i've got a
 
05:27:27.110 --> 05:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
10-year time frame and i'm investing in
 
05:27:28.470 --> 05:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
a cd
 
05:27:30.470 --> 05:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make sense
 
05:27:33.590 --> 05:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:35.990 --> 05:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
investment policy where the private
 
05:27:39.590 --> 05:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
funds were approximately 65 equities and
 
05:27:41.430 --> 05:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
and 35
 
05:27:43.590 --> 05:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
fixed income it would seem to me that a
 
05:27:45.350 --> 05:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
lot of the money that you have i don't
 
05:27:48.390 --> 05:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
know how much maybe maybe 20 maybe a 30
 
05:27:48.400 --> 05:27:49.430 align:start position:0%
know how much maybe maybe 20 maybe a 30
percent

05:27:49.430 --> 05:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
percent
 
05:27:52.390 --> 05:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
should be under the uh prudent investor
 
05:27:55.030 --> 05:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
rule as opposed to the prudent man rule
 
05:27:57.190 --> 05:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
anything that you know again somebody
 
05:27:59.830 --> 05:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
establishes a a
 
05:27:59.840 --> 05:28:00.868 align:start position:0%
establishes a a
a

05:28:00.868 --> 05:28:00.878 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:28:03.350 --> 05:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
private trust fund that the principal
 
05:28:05.430 --> 05:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
can never be invaded and they put a
 
05:28:07.190 --> 05:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars in there it
 
05:28:10.470 --> 05:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense at all to to
 
05:28:12.310 --> 05:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
invest that in a
 
05:28:14.628 --> 05:28:14.638 align:start position:0%
cd or something like that
 
05:28:16.708 --> 05:28:16.718 align:start position:0%
what is your answer to that to be
 
05:28:19.590 --> 05:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
perfectly honest i do not delve into the
 
05:28:21.510 --> 05:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
investments i'm not on the trading desk
 
05:28:23.270 --> 05:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
that's not my forte
 
05:28:26.150 --> 05:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
um again happy to provide information
 
05:28:29.990 --> 05:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
from our our portfolio managers
 
05:28:33.270 --> 05:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
well i would definitely like to know why
 
05:28:35.190 --> 05:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
that is the case that everything is
 
05:28:36.628 --> 05:28:36.638 align:start position:0%
invested in
 
05:28:39.030 --> 05:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
in minimal fixed income it just should
 
05:28:40.470 --> 05:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
not be that way
 
05:28:47.990 --> 05:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:50.070 --> 05:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh she's writing a note down
 
05:28:51.910 --> 05:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's okay okay
 
05:28:53.510 --> 05:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative herbert and you have a
 
05:28:57.430 --> 05:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
real question now right uh yeah
 
05:28:58.868 --> 05:28:58.878 align:start position:0%
if i can hear you
 
05:28:58.878 --> 05:29:00.230 align:start position:0%
if i can hear you
um

05:29:00.230 --> 05:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:01.910 --> 05:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know if she can answer actually
 
05:29:03.990 --> 05:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
but uh it sounded to me with that rate
 
05:29:05.910 --> 05:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
of return you're very short-term and
 
05:29:07.590 --> 05:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
you're very liquid
 
05:29:10.310 --> 05:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
is there much need for liquidity in this
 
05:29:10.320 --> 05:29:11.590 align:start position:0%
is there much need for liquidity in this
uh

05:29:11.590 --> 05:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:29:13.910 --> 05:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
um amount of money that's one of our
 
05:29:16.548 --> 05:29:16.558 align:start position:0%
selling points actually so that you can
 
05:29:17.590 --> 05:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
if you
 
05:29:19.350 --> 05:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
deposited a million dollars today and
 
05:29:21.670 --> 05:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
your fire truck was was wrecked tomorrow
 
05:29:25.030 --> 05:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
that you have absolute liquidity to
 
05:29:27.590 --> 05:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
to withdraw the funds so so it's the
 
05:29:30.708 --> 05:29:30.718 align:start position:0%
risk for the question um thank you so
 
05:29:34.070 --> 05:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
the risk component of risk return
 
05:29:35.190 --> 05:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
05:29:37.830 --> 05:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
probably higher than most because of the
 
05:29:41.110 --> 05:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
need to be liquid
 
05:29:43.590 --> 05:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say that i'd say because we
 
05:29:46.070 --> 05:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
are required to invest in very high
 
05:29:48.548 --> 05:29:48.558 align:start position:0%
quality whether it be treasuries
 
05:29:51.830 --> 05:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
agencies and commercial paper
 
05:29:51.840 --> 05:29:52.708 align:start position:0%
agencies and commercial paper
that

05:29:52.708 --> 05:29:52.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:29:54.708 --> 05:29:54.718 align:start position:0%
that's why the risk is low is because we
 
05:29:56.708 --> 05:29:56.718 align:start position:0%
are constantly monitoring that and if
 
05:29:58.708 --> 05:29:58.718 align:start position:0%
again if we see an industry that looks
 
05:30:00.150 --> 05:30:00.160 align:start position:0%
like it may not be going in the right
 
05:30:01.830 --> 05:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
direction we pull that security and
 
05:30:01.840 --> 05:30:04.470 align:start position:0%
direction we pull that security and
reinvest

05:30:04.470 --> 05:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
reinvest
 
05:30:06.310 --> 05:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:30:09.110 --> 05:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative johnson
 
05:30:10.868 --> 05:30:10.878 align:start position:0%
so the reason why you're trying to stay
 
05:30:15.670 --> 05:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
so liquids as an example if you have a
 
05:30:17.750 --> 05:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
local city or town
 
05:30:20.310 --> 05:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
and they are in between
 
05:30:22.948 --> 05:30:22.958 align:start position:0%
their big
 
05:30:25.430 --> 05:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
tax revenues coming in
 
05:30:27.590 --> 05:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
and that falls in that just before that
 
05:30:29.350 --> 05:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
next round of payments come in they
 
05:30:31.110 --> 05:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
could tap into if they had a major
 
05:30:31.120 --> 05:30:32.390 align:start position:0%
could tap into if they had a major
project

05:30:32.390 --> 05:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
project
 
05:30:34.150 --> 05:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
where they needed to
 
05:30:35.590 --> 05:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
tap into that
 
05:30:35.600 --> 05:30:36.548 align:start position:0%
tap into that
money

05:30:36.548 --> 05:30:36.558 align:start position:0%
money
 
05:30:39.190 --> 05:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
and then they repay it if they had to oh
 
05:30:41.350 --> 05:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
then they could to pay it back
 
05:30:43.430 --> 05:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
is that the reason for the liquid
 
05:30:45.910 --> 05:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
it's not a loan it's it's the
 
05:30:48.788 --> 05:30:48.798 align:start position:0%
municipalities money
 
05:30:50.788 --> 05:30:50.798 align:start position:0%
okay and as long as it's not restricted
 
05:30:52.390 --> 05:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
funds for instance like trustees of
 
05:30:54.788 --> 05:30:54.798 align:start position:0%
trust funds you know the town couldn't
 
05:30:56.868 --> 05:30:56.878 align:start position:0%
pull money from the trust funds and then
 
05:31:00.390 --> 05:31:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:08.070 --> 05:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:10.230 --> 05:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
okay and i think somebody had mentioned
 
05:31:12.548 --> 05:31:12.558 align:start position:0%
about is there a flow of money obviously
 
05:31:14.070 --> 05:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
when taxes come in
 
05:31:15.190 --> 05:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
or um
 
05:31:17.590 --> 05:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
it's like you're when people do the tans
 
05:31:19.030 --> 05:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
in and out
 
05:31:20.708 --> 05:31:20.718 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't think many people do tans
 
05:31:22.548 --> 05:31:22.558 align:start position:0%
anymore but certainly when tax payments
 
05:31:24.548 --> 05:31:24.558 align:start position:0%
come in and you know our rate is
 
05:31:26.628 --> 05:31:26.638 align:start position:0%
competitive that's when the the higher
 
05:31:28.470 --> 05:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
deposits will come in right okay
 
05:31:29.990 --> 05:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative fargo
 
05:31:32.390 --> 05:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
um yes and thank you for your testimony
 
05:31:32.400 --> 05:31:33.110 align:start position:0%
um yes and thank you for your testimony
and

05:31:33.110 --> 05:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:31:35.510 --> 05:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm misinterpreting this but
 
05:31:38.628 --> 05:31:38.638 align:start position:0%
i don't think this bill is a pointing
 
05:31:41.030 --> 05:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
fingers kind of thing to say that you're
 
05:31:41.040 --> 05:31:42.150 align:start position:0%
fingers kind of thing to say that you're
not

05:31:42.150 --> 05:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:31:44.948 --> 05:31:44.958 align:start position:0%
doing it properly my impression was just
 
05:31:46.548 --> 05:31:46.558 align:start position:0%
there's been a tremendous amount of
 
05:31:48.310 --> 05:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
growth and it's just a study committee
 
05:31:50.310 --> 05:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
to look at it and determine is it in the
 
05:31:52.470 --> 05:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
right place or should we be using some
 
05:31:54.548 --> 05:31:54.558 align:start position:0%
of this money for something else
 
05:31:56.150 --> 05:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:31:58.470 --> 05:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
am i mistaken i mean this is a study
 
05:32:00.150 --> 05:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
committee really to answer some of the
 
05:32:03.270 --> 05:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
questions we seem to be posing not to
 
05:32:05.910 --> 05:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
well it seemed to me um and correct me
 
05:32:08.230 --> 05:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
if i'm wrong anyone um that the first
 
05:32:10.070 --> 05:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
issue on the bill was to
 
05:32:12.310 --> 05:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
study to determine is the banking
 
05:32:14.470 --> 05:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
department really the place that should
 
05:32:16.390 --> 05:32:16.400 align:start position:0%
have the oversight and we certainly
 
05:32:17.750 --> 05:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
understand the bank commissioner's
 
05:32:19.270 --> 05:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
conflict yeah
 
05:32:23.910 --> 05:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:26.150 --> 05:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
so so just make sure i follow all this
 
05:32:27.990 --> 05:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
now how long have you been
 
05:32:30.390 --> 05:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
with us with the pool yeah since
 
05:32:32.390 --> 05:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
halloween of 2017
 
05:32:34.948 --> 05:32:34.958 align:start position:0%
2000 who so who had your job who was
 
05:32:36.708 --> 05:32:36.718 align:start position:0%
running this program before joanne
 
05:32:39.430 --> 05:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
clattskin joanne joanne had been with
 
05:32:42.070 --> 05:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
the pool for many years okay okay all
 
05:32:44.470 --> 05:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
right so if i
 
05:32:46.310 --> 05:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure i understand
 
05:32:49.190 --> 05:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
all this correctly because i i see in
 
05:32:50.948 --> 05:32:50.958 align:start position:0%
this letter there were some issues about
 
05:32:53.190 --> 05:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
how it's being paid for this
 
05:32:55.110 --> 05:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
department's being paid for you know
 
05:32:57.830 --> 05:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
through the banking department um
 
05:33:00.548 --> 05:33:00.558 align:start position:0%
and i assume uh the two this rate here
 
05:33:00.558 --> 05:33:01.430 align:start position:0%
and i assume uh the two this rate here
you're

05:33:01.430 --> 05:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
you're
 
05:33:03.590 --> 05:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
two four eight nine that you you're
 
05:33:05.110 --> 05:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
taking your fees
 
05:33:06.390 --> 05:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
fees are already out of it that's the
 
05:33:08.230 --> 05:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
net rate that's the net and we have
 
05:33:10.390 --> 05:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
resolved the issue with who pays for the
 
05:33:12.708 --> 05:33:12.718 align:start position:0%
banking department's time okay
 
05:33:14.708 --> 05:33:14.718 align:start position:0%
so i think the the
 
05:33:17.350 --> 05:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
the agonizing question and as i i
 
05:33:18.628 --> 05:33:18.638 align:start position:0%
actually said is the treasure of the
 
05:33:21.510 --> 05:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
ringed historical society and the and uh
 
05:33:23.910 --> 05:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
and our library fund so that we you know
 
05:33:25.510 --> 05:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
they can bypass the selectmen when
 
05:33:26.948 --> 05:33:26.958 align:start position:0%
people donate money
 
05:33:29.590 --> 05:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
um and that is that yes you can you can
 
05:33:31.350 --> 05:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
be you know
 
05:33:34.230 --> 05:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
buy cds but that if you want if you want
 
05:33:36.070 --> 05:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
to be more aggressive and you want to
 
05:33:37.510 --> 05:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
build the fund
 
05:33:40.868 --> 05:33:40.878 align:start position:0%
you know you actually tell your investor
 
05:33:43.590 --> 05:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
in my case i have a schwab for one in td
 
05:33:45.750 --> 05:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
ameritrade with the other that we want
 
05:33:47.670 --> 05:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
them to be more aggressive
 
05:33:49.590 --> 05:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
and so obviously
 
05:33:51.510 --> 05:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
at your with your lower rate we're
 
05:33:54.548 --> 05:33:54.558 align:start position:0%
assuming that you're not aggressive you
 
05:33:54.558 --> 05:33:55.510 align:start position:0%
assuming that you're not aggressive you
are

05:33:55.510 --> 05:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:33:55.520 --> 05:33:56.470 align:start position:0%
are
somehow

05:33:56.470 --> 05:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
05:33:58.708 --> 05:33:58.718 align:start position:0%
guaranteeing that that there will not be
 
05:34:01.030 --> 05:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
loss of funds well that is our first
 
05:34:03.430 --> 05:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
priority but when you say our rate is
 
05:34:03.440 --> 05:34:04.628 align:start position:0%
priority but when you say our rate is
low

05:34:04.628 --> 05:34:04.638 align:start position:0%
low
 
05:34:07.670 --> 05:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
at this time compared to what
 
05:34:09.270 --> 05:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
could have been yeah it had been right
 
05:34:10.628 --> 05:34:10.638 align:start position:0%
yeah right well
 
05:34:12.628 --> 05:34:12.638 align:start position:0%
last year our rates were very low we
 
05:34:13.990 --> 05:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
were waiting for the feds to make their
 
05:34:16.150 --> 05:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
move and it was at a point zero two and
 
05:34:18.868 --> 05:34:18.878 align:start position:0%
now we're at point two nine
 
05:34:20.708 --> 05:34:20.718 align:start position:0%
which is the significant increase over
 
05:34:23.590 --> 05:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
the last i i actually once i realized
 
05:34:25.270 --> 05:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
that this was just bonds and this is a
 
05:34:26.708 --> 05:34:26.718 align:start position:0%
guaranteed fund
 
05:34:29.030 --> 05:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
i was saying that 2.4 does sound
 
05:34:31.430 --> 05:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
actually pretty good for a guaranteed
 
05:34:35.270 --> 05:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
fund right well it's not guaranteed fun
 
05:34:38.390 --> 05:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
it's not guaranteed so there is a risk
 
05:34:41.190 --> 05:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
of loss there is there is but i can tell
 
05:34:43.110 --> 05:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
you in the 30 years of this pool's
 
05:34:46.310 --> 05:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
existence and the 40 years of pfm's
 
05:34:49.030 --> 05:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
managed pools never has a penny been
 
05:34:51.110 --> 05:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
lost to any municipality and that's
 
05:34:53.030 --> 05:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
because of that trading desk keeping an
 
05:34:55.190 --> 05:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
eyes on every investment
 
05:34:56.788 --> 05:34:56.798 align:start position:0%
and following all of the right
 
05:34:59.430 --> 05:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
regulations and then just to last two
 
05:35:01.190 --> 05:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
more questions
 
05:35:04.390 --> 05:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
excuse me i interject yes um i note that
 
05:35:06.390 --> 05:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
you are a sponsor on this bill is it
 
05:35:07.750 --> 05:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate for you to continue
 
05:35:09.910 --> 05:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
questioning on hearings i don't know
 
05:35:12.230 --> 05:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
represent representatives no idea that i
 
05:35:13.990 --> 05:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
was just blonde sort of
 
05:35:14.000 --> 05:35:16.230 align:start position:0%
was just blonde sort of
11.

05:35:23.110 --> 05:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:25.030 --> 05:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
it's clear that i had no idea that my
 
05:35:27.030 --> 05:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
name is i don't ever remember putting my
 
05:35:28.788 --> 05:35:28.798 align:start position:0%
name on this bill but okay
 
05:35:30.788 --> 05:35:30.798 align:start position:0%
so i just want to make sure i understand
 
05:35:34.548 --> 05:35:34.558 align:start position:0%
the so towns uh the treasure of the town
 
05:35:36.788 --> 05:35:36.798 align:start position:0%
when let's say after the quarterly tax
 
05:35:38.948 --> 05:35:38.958 align:start position:0%
rate or semi-annual taxes they'll have a
 
05:35:40.708 --> 05:35:40.718 align:start position:0%
windfall and they're going to send this
 
05:35:42.230 --> 05:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
money up to you
 
05:35:43.990 --> 05:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
for a short term
 
05:35:45.990 --> 05:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
yes or it could be long term
 
05:35:47.590 --> 05:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
we have a number of trustees accounts
 
05:35:47.600 --> 05:35:48.390 align:start position:0%
we have a number of trustees accounts
that

05:35:48.390 --> 05:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:35:50.070 --> 05:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
have been in there for many many many
 
05:35:52.788 --> 05:35:52.798 align:start position:0%
years even before pfm took over so even
 
05:35:54.230 --> 05:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
though this is running to the bank
 
05:35:56.150 --> 05:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
department you're you're
 
05:35:58.310 --> 05:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
you're um
 
05:36:00.788 --> 05:36:00.798 align:start position:0%
the people are sending you the check
 
05:36:05.110 --> 05:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
and you then go invest it and then they
 
05:36:07.270 --> 05:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
you you will send the town the check
 
05:36:09.990 --> 05:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
back so our we our let's say new
 
05:36:10.000 --> 05:36:11.110 align:start position:0%
back so our we our let's say new
hampshire

05:36:11.110 --> 05:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:36:13.270 --> 05:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh private wealth banks and all our
 
05:36:15.670 --> 05:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
banks that we might be good advisors and
 
05:36:18.070 --> 05:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
investors actually don't get to
 
05:36:20.390 --> 05:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
participate in this program at all but
 
05:36:22.548 --> 05:36:22.558 align:start position:0%
that's by choice by a town making that
 
05:36:25.190 --> 05:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
decision that's correct um
 
05:36:25.200 --> 05:36:26.868 align:start position:0%
decision that's correct um
we

05:36:26.868 --> 05:36:26.878 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:36:29.430 --> 05:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
the bank the banking department is
 
05:36:32.788 --> 05:36:32.798 align:start position:0%
oversight is the oversight for the pool
 
05:36:34.948 --> 05:36:34.958 align:start position:0%
but it's pfm it's the investment advisor
 
05:36:36.310 --> 05:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
at the time that does all of the
 
05:36:39.190 --> 05:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
investing all of the administration
 
05:36:40.868 --> 05:36:40.878 align:start position:0%
we meet with the banking department and
 
05:36:43.350 --> 05:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
advisory committee on a quarterly basis
 
05:36:47.190 --> 05:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
and just review what pfm has done and
 
05:36:48.788 --> 05:36:48.798 align:start position:0%
any changes in
 
05:36:50.708 --> 05:36:50.718 align:start position:0%
investments we review the investments
 
05:36:51.750 --> 05:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
with them
 
05:36:54.820 --> 05:36:54.830 align:start position:0%

this is the purpose of this is as uh
 
05:38:42.948 --> 05:38:42.958 align:start position:0%
former speakers have our prior speakers
 
05:38:44.548 --> 05:38:44.558 align:start position:0%
have indicated it's really to take a
 
05:38:46.948 --> 05:38:46.958 align:start position:0%
look at the banking department's role
 
05:38:48.628 --> 05:38:48.638 align:start position:0%
impede up as well as the impact on the
 
05:38:50.470 --> 05:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
fund on new hampshire's economy and the
 
05:38:52.150 --> 05:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
general performance safety and
 
05:38:54.230 --> 05:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
diversification and rate return of the
 
05:38:54.240 --> 05:38:55.190 align:start position:0%
diversification and rate return of the
pool

05:38:55.190 --> 05:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
pool
 
05:38:58.230 --> 05:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
this pool again as prior speakers have
 
05:39:01.670 --> 05:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
said was developed back in the early 90s
 
05:39:03.430 --> 05:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
05:39:05.990 --> 05:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
banks were going through a pretty rocky
 
05:39:09.510 --> 05:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
part uh rocky road um
 
05:39:11.910 --> 05:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
they they were this was set up
 
05:39:15.430 --> 05:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
to provide an option uh for for towns
 
05:39:18.310 --> 05:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities the state and others to
 
05:39:20.868 --> 05:39:20.878 align:start position:0%
put their money however today banks are
 
05:39:25.990 --> 05:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:26.000 --> 05:39:27.430 align:start position:0%
 
additionally

05:39:27.430 --> 05:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
05:39:30.628 --> 05:39:30.638 align:start position:0%
the regulators have have indicated
 
05:39:33.190 --> 05:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
how strong position banks are
 
05:39:36.150 --> 05:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:38.548 --> 05:39:38.558 align:start position:0%
and there is significant regulatory
 
05:39:40.628 --> 05:39:40.638 align:start position:0%
oversight of banks to ensure that we do
 
05:39:42.628 --> 05:39:42.638 align:start position:0%
not get back to the places we were in
 
05:39:45.750 --> 05:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
back in the early 90s
 
05:39:47.110 --> 05:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
one of the things i really want to point
 
05:39:50.788 --> 05:39:50.798 align:start position:0%
out is over the past couple years um the
 
05:39:53.510 --> 05:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
bank former banker commissioner uh jerry
 
05:39:55.990 --> 05:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
little um who was in charge of
 
05:39:59.030 --> 05:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
overseeing um pdip the oversight of pete
 
05:40:00.788 --> 05:40:00.798 align:start position:0%
up in the advisory committee
 
05:40:02.788 --> 05:40:02.798 align:start position:0%
continuously would say he feels in
 
05:40:05.110 --> 05:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
conflict he feels in conflict because
 
05:40:07.590 --> 05:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
his job at the time was to oversee the
 
05:40:09.350 --> 05:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
safety and soundness of new hampshire's
 
05:40:11.670 --> 05:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
state chartered banks
 
05:40:14.708 --> 05:40:14.718 align:start position:0%
however with the oversight of this
 
05:40:17.270 --> 05:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
this pool
 
05:40:18.548 --> 05:40:18.558 align:start position:0%
the majority of the money or all the
 
05:40:20.788 --> 05:40:20.798 align:start position:0%
money and at this time it's around 230
 
05:40:22.310 --> 05:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
05:40:23.990 --> 05:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
is leaving the state
 
05:40:25.910 --> 05:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
as the sponsor indicated
 
05:40:27.430 --> 05:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
leaving the state is not in new
 
05:40:30.230 --> 05:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire charter banks and is leaving
 
05:40:31.910 --> 05:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
in some cases the country all together
 
05:40:34.150 --> 05:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
and some of the investments
 
05:40:36.628 --> 05:40:36.638 align:start position:0%
this puts and again this puts
 
05:40:38.628 --> 05:40:38.638 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's
 
05:40:40.070 --> 05:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
charge of overseeing safety and
 
05:40:42.070 --> 05:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
soundness of state charter banks in
 
05:40:44.310 --> 05:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
conflict and was always looking to find
 
05:40:45.830 --> 05:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
another home for it so i think that's
 
05:40:48.548 --> 05:40:48.558 align:start position:0%
really where um where a lot of this has
 
05:40:50.708 --> 05:40:50.718 align:start position:0%
come from and talking with the sponsor
 
05:40:52.628 --> 05:40:52.638 align:start position:0%
over the past few months
 
05:40:53.910 --> 05:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
i won't get into any more details
 
05:40:55.030 --> 05:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
because i know a lot of it has already
 
05:40:57.270 --> 05:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
been said so i'll pause there um and see
 
05:41:01.670 --> 05:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:02.948 --> 05:41:02.958 align:start position:0%
well yeah
 
05:41:04.628 --> 05:41:04.638 align:start position:0%
where would it go
 
05:41:06.390 --> 05:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
what's that where would it go if it's
 
05:41:07.990 --> 05:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
not the banking department well that's
 
05:41:09.910 --> 05:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
part of the study no they'd touch the
 
05:41:12.230 --> 05:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
legislators we don't
 
05:41:14.230 --> 05:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
we would be looking to you and tell us
 
05:41:16.390 --> 05:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
where it should be going well i know i
 
05:41:18.628 --> 05:41:18.638 align:start position:0%
guess i'll call jerry you know get home
 
05:41:21.030 --> 05:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
tonight and ask him what he was thinking
 
05:41:23.110 --> 05:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
but you know it's
 
05:41:24.708 --> 05:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
legislators when we do a legislative
 
05:41:26.230 --> 05:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
study committee you got to give us a
 
05:41:30.070 --> 05:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
little you know i think it's guidelines
 
05:41:32.230 --> 05:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
go with it been had with the treasurer
 
05:41:34.548 --> 05:41:34.558 align:start position:0%
um new hampshire municipal association
 
05:41:35.990 --> 05:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
on whether or not they'd be interested
 
05:41:38.628 --> 05:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
in taking it um over the over the years
 
05:41:38.638 --> 05:41:39.430 align:start position:0%

regarding the department's role in
 
05:43:08.628 --> 05:43:08.638 align:start position:0%
operation of the pool um i understand
 
05:43:09.590 --> 05:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
there's been
 
05:43:11.110 --> 05:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
a number of testimony already provided
 
05:43:12.628 --> 05:43:12.638 align:start position:0%
that's given quite
 
05:43:14.948 --> 05:43:14.958 align:start position:0%
in detail information as to the pool and
 
05:43:17.750 --> 05:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
we i did provide a testimony handout as
 
05:43:19.990 --> 05:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
well which really describes
 
05:43:21.990 --> 05:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
our um
 
05:43:25.270 --> 05:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:28.310 --> 05:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
okay well just given the late nature of
 
05:43:29.990 --> 05:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
the hour i really wanted to more so be
 
05:43:31.030 --> 05:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
here to
 
05:43:32.628 --> 05:43:32.638 align:start position:0%
provide any answers to questions you
 
05:43:33.990 --> 05:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
might have regarding the banking
 
05:43:36.470 --> 05:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
department's role as i feel like that
 
05:43:38.230 --> 05:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
so how many other states have one of
 
05:43:39.910 --> 05:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
these things and
 
05:43:41.590 --> 05:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
i do not know the number of states i can
 
05:43:43.590 --> 05:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
certainly look that up for you i believe
 
05:43:45.270 --> 05:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
you take these notes down how many other
 
05:43:45.280 --> 05:43:46.470 align:start position:0%
you take these notes down how many other
states

05:43:46.470 --> 05:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
states
 
05:43:48.150 --> 05:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
yeah you're the only one that has what
 
05:43:49.910 --> 05:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
housed within the banking department
 
05:43:53.350 --> 05:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
okay that's the 64 so what what we'd
 
05:43:55.350 --> 05:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
like to know is what other states are
 
05:43:57.110 --> 05:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
doing and who they have for overseas
 
05:43:58.628 --> 05:43:58.638 align:start position:0%
where they might be located yeah that'd
 
05:44:02.628 --> 05:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:03.830 --> 05:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
even though i'm not supposed to ask
 
05:44:03.840 --> 05:44:05.430 align:start position:0%
even though i'm not supposed to ask
questions

05:44:05.430 --> 05:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:44:07.750 --> 05:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
but that was a chairman type question
 
05:44:10.150 --> 05:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
they couldn't get any information
 
05:44:12.230 --> 05:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
i have a committee type of question am i
 
05:44:15.910 --> 05:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
after mr representative uh
 
05:44:17.590 --> 05:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
i'm still interested in the question i
 
05:44:18.788 --> 05:44:18.798 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
05:44:20.868 --> 05:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
okay but now i'm gonna represent van
 
05:44:22.628 --> 05:44:22.638 align:start position:0%
halen first
 
05:44:24.310 --> 05:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
because ladies first
 
05:44:25.510 --> 05:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
05:44:27.670 --> 05:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
well you pulled that one out fast
 
05:44:29.590 --> 05:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
thank you my question is is a very
 
05:44:31.670 --> 05:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
simple question um would the department
 
05:44:34.310 --> 05:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
have any issue in exploring
 
05:44:36.150 --> 05:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
a 30-year history of something just to
 
05:44:37.750 --> 05:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
see if we have it right at this point in
 
05:44:39.350 --> 05:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
time which i believe is the focus of
 
05:44:41.350 --> 05:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
this bill and uh so as a department
 
05:44:43.430 --> 05:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
we're not taking a position on us we're
 
05:44:45.670 --> 05:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
not in opposition or in support as to
 
05:44:47.990 --> 05:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
looking into this we would be glad to
 
05:44:50.070 --> 05:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
provide any information i do respect
 
05:44:53.670 --> 05:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:55.670 --> 05:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
now representative herbert um what i
 
05:44:58.628 --> 05:44:58.638 align:start position:0%
heard i thought i heard uh was that
 
05:45:01.910 --> 05:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
um there was some concern or uh interest
 
05:45:03.350 --> 05:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
there was some concern that the money
 
05:45:06.230 --> 05:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
was being invested elsewhere outside the
 
05:45:09.510 --> 05:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
state outside the country and that
 
05:45:12.390 --> 05:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
i i read into that statement that the
 
05:45:12.400 --> 05:45:13.430 align:start position:0%
i i read into that statement that the
bank

05:45:13.430 --> 05:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
bank
 
05:45:16.070 --> 05:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
making you know a 300 plus million
 
05:45:19.430 --> 05:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
dollars in liquidity that maybe some of
 
05:45:21.350 --> 05:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
that money could go out into the
 
05:45:21.360 --> 05:45:22.708 align:start position:0%
that money could go out into the
communities

05:45:22.708 --> 05:45:22.718 align:start position:0%
communities
 
05:45:25.190 --> 05:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
they they put the money into the fund to
 
05:45:27.590 --> 05:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
begin with
 
05:45:30.070 --> 05:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
so as um the banking department i would
 
05:45:31.350 --> 05:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
have to defer that question more so to
 
05:45:34.470 --> 05:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
pfm as to where the money is invested
 
05:45:36.708 --> 05:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
outside of the country um
 
05:45:39.670 --> 05:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
so we as a department really deal with
 
05:45:42.070 --> 05:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
oversight of the pool as well along with
 
05:45:44.390 --> 05:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
the advisory committee so more so
 
05:45:44.400 --> 05:45:45.750 align:start position:0%
the advisory committee so more so
um

05:45:45.750 --> 05:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:48.150 --> 05:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
doing the rfp and the contracts and the
 
05:45:50.628 --> 05:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
like for the management of the pool um
 
05:45:53.670 --> 05:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
pfm is the entity as miss galperin is
 
05:45:57.190 --> 05:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
here that does the actual investing um
 
05:45:59.190 --> 05:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
so she would be able to more properly
 
05:46:01.590 --> 05:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
answer your question as to
 
05:46:03.190 --> 05:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
where the funds may go or to what extent
 
05:46:04.628 --> 05:46:04.638 align:start position:0%
could they be reinvested in the
 
05:46:04.638 --> 05:46:05.670 align:start position:0%
could they be reinvested in the
community

05:46:05.670 --> 05:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
community
 
05:46:08.070 --> 05:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
i think so i would agree that the more
 
05:46:09.430 --> 05:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
money should be
 
05:46:11.670 --> 05:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
this is would you believe yeah would you
 
05:46:11.680 --> 05:46:12.628 align:start position:0%
this is would you believe yeah would you
believe

05:46:12.628 --> 05:46:12.638 align:start position:0%
believe
 
05:46:14.628 --> 05:46:14.638 align:start position:0%
i think it's a good idea to have some
 
05:46:16.470 --> 05:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
more of that money stay in the in new
 
05:46:17.910 --> 05:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire as an event i certainly hope
 
05:46:21.110 --> 05:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:23.510 --> 05:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative mclaren oh thank you
 
05:46:25.830 --> 05:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh real quick question if you don't know
 
05:46:28.390 --> 05:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
it maybe you could find it out but what
 
05:46:31.990 --> 05:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
what is the approximate annual liquidity
 
05:46:34.548 --> 05:46:34.558 align:start position:0%
need from this fund in other words
 
05:46:38.310 --> 05:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh is there a 10 15 20
 
05:46:41.110 --> 05:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
how much each year is actually withdrawn
 
05:46:42.788 --> 05:46:42.798 align:start position:0%
and i would um i'll have to check with
 
05:46:45.750 --> 05:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
pfm but i can get you that
 
05:46:47.670 --> 05:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you um and to speak generally in
 
05:46:50.548 --> 05:46:50.558 align:start position:0%
regards to mr hale's point regarding mr
 
05:46:50.558 --> 05:46:51.350 align:start position:0%
regards to mr hale's point regarding mr
well

05:46:51.350 --> 05:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:46:53.990 --> 05:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
former uh commissioner little um
 
05:46:56.390 --> 05:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
concerns regarding
 
05:46:58.628 --> 05:46:58.638 align:start position:0%
having the pool
 
05:47:00.150 --> 05:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
housed within the banking department
 
05:47:02.310 --> 05:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
what we did do last legislative session
 
05:47:05.750 --> 05:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
and hb 610 um was to address some of
 
05:47:08.548 --> 05:47:08.558 align:start position:0%
that inherent conflict where
 
05:47:09.830 --> 05:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
the banking departments of the bank
 
05:47:11.350 --> 05:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner as well as banking
 
05:47:14.948 --> 05:47:14.958 align:start position:0%
department staff were spending time
 
05:47:18.150 --> 05:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
working on the pool so the rfp the
 
05:47:19.910 --> 05:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
quarterly meetings
 
05:47:22.150 --> 05:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
so technically that time spent was being
 
05:47:24.628 --> 05:47:24.638 align:start position:0%
subsidized by our regulated entities
 
05:47:25.910 --> 05:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
because we did not have a funding
 
05:47:29.590 --> 05:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
mechanism to address this concern um h.b
 
05:47:32.230 --> 05:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
610 back the last legislative session
 
05:47:35.510 --> 05:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
was passed which added section 5 to rsa
 
05:47:38.948 --> 05:47:38.958 align:start position:0%
383 colon 22 which now allows the
 
05:47:40.390 --> 05:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner as well as all banking
 
05:47:42.470 --> 05:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
department staff to
 
05:47:44.868 --> 05:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
track our times we use our per diem rate
 
05:47:46.788 --> 05:47:46.798 align:start position:0%
calculated and build that directly to
 
05:47:49.110 --> 05:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
the pool that is processed by pfm of a
 
05:47:52.310 --> 05:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
way of a quarterly invoice so yeah
 
05:47:54.070 --> 05:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i did see that and the other thing
 
05:47:55.270 --> 05:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
that i
 
05:47:56.470 --> 05:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
kind of struck by
 
05:47:59.110 --> 05:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
it says the bank commissioner in an
 
05:48:01.590 --> 05:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
advisory committee yes who's on the
 
05:48:02.868 --> 05:48:02.878 align:start position:0%
advisory campaign so the advisory
 
05:48:05.990 --> 05:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
committee um it's actually per statute
 
05:48:08.390 --> 05:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
the members on it at home so we have the
 
05:48:10.708 --> 05:48:10.718 align:start position:0%
treasurer um see treasure's on there
 
05:48:12.948 --> 05:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
anyway yes monica pelly is on there as
 
05:48:14.708 --> 05:48:14.718 align:start position:0%
well as i can
 
05:48:17.590 --> 05:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
various representatives from municipal
 
05:48:19.590 --> 05:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
um boards let me
 
05:48:21.270 --> 05:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
pull it up sorry
 
05:48:22.628 --> 05:48:22.638 align:start position:0%
i don't have it memorized at the top of
 
05:48:24.390 --> 05:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
my head but um
 
05:48:27.110 --> 05:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
as well as so we have a department of
 
05:48:29.030 --> 05:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
revenue designee
 
05:48:30.628 --> 05:48:30.638 align:start position:0%
normally as well as new hampshire
 
05:48:32.150 --> 05:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
government how many name how many people
 
05:48:33.990 --> 05:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
are on this advisory board there are
 
05:48:34.000 --> 05:48:35.110 align:start position:0%
are on this advisory board there are
currently

05:48:35.110 --> 05:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
currently
 
05:48:42.470 --> 05:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:44.548 --> 05:48:44.558 align:start position:0%
so theoretically they're meeting on a
 
05:48:47.270 --> 05:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis correct and i guess the
 
05:48:50.548 --> 05:48:50.558 align:start position:0%
agenda item is uh uh having discussing
 
05:48:51.830 --> 05:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
whether this is really should be under
 
05:48:53.670 --> 05:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
the banking department or not
 
05:48:57.830 --> 05:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
has never been an agenda item i assume
 
05:48:59.750 --> 05:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
for the actual advisory committee there
 
05:49:01.750 --> 05:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
has been discussions as mr hale had
 
05:49:04.310 --> 05:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
noted um commissioner little in the past
 
05:49:06.310 --> 05:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
did reach out i believe that was a
 
05:49:08.948 --> 05:49:08.958 align:start position:0%
begrudging you know comment by jerry we
 
05:49:10.150 --> 05:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
05:49:11.990 --> 05:49:12.000 align:start position:0%

05:49:14.868 --> 05:49:14.878 align:start position:0%
advisory committee yes yes so we don't
 
05:49:16.788 --> 05:49:16.798 align:start position:0%
