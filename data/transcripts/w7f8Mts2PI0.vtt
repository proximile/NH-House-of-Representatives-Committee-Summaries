is um Senate Bill 127 and I'll recognize
 
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 align:start position:0%

back here
 
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 align:start position:0%
I sponsored this bill as I've done for I
 
00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 align:start position:0%
think the last three or four sessions
 
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Health and Human
 
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.950 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Health and Human
Services

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
to make certain
 
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
technical changes and this is largely a
 
00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
technical change bill
 
00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:35.930 align:start position:0%
technical change bill
um

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 align:start position:0%
past the Senate unanimously as I recall
 
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
and I bring it to you I can walk through
 
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
very briefly what these changes are
 
00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259 align:start position:0%
there are some 10 or 12 of them but I
 
00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:53.090 align:start position:0%
there are some 10 or 12 of them but I
think

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
your time might be better spent hearing
 
00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
from the Department who asked me to file
 
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
the bills so with that I'll take any
 
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
questions or I can you know touch base
 
00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 align:start position:0%
on what each of the sections does but I
 
00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 align:start position:0%
think John Williams will do a much
 
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
better job than me if that's all right
 
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
with you sir sure attorney Williams has
 
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
made that offer and he's indicated there
 
00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
are a number of Department individual
 
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 align:start position:0%
people from the Department to uh to do
 
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
so while Senator Bradley is before us
 
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 align:start position:0%
does anyone have a question for him or
 
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sitting on so and I would just
 
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
thank you again for the very gracious
 
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 align:start position:0%

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 align:start position:0%

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
thank the committee and also our Prime
 
00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
sponsor Senator Bradley for bringing
 
00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:15.419 align:start position:0%
this important legislation uh forward
 
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
and we look forward uh to presenting
 
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:19.860 align:start position:0%
this to you uh you may recall last
 
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
session we did bring Senate Bill 430
 
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
that Bill had 73 sections the bill
 
00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
before you I had to report to you that
 
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
has 16 sections so we did get the memo
 
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
on making sure that we were more tight
 
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
and that we made sure that the
 
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:35.220 align:start position:0%
appropriate subject matter went to the
 
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
respective committee so containing this
 
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
bill are issues subject matters that
 
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
would be relevant to this group and we
 
00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:42.419 align:start position:0%
we thank you for your time and
 
00:07:44.809 --> 00:07:44.819 align:start position:0%
appreciation so as I walk you through
 
00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:46.139 align:start position:0%
the legislation we're going to start
 
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
with sections one and two of the bill
 
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
and that begins on page one lines one
 
00:07:55.249 --> 00:07:55.259 align:start position:0%
three Row 18 and you may recall for
 
00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
those of you who served on the committee
 
00:07:59.330 --> 00:07:59.340 align:start position:0%
last session that we brought before you
 
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
a request to establishing a dedicated
 
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
fund within our opioid treatment
 
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
prevention program and at the time you
 
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
did establish the fund and as we learned
 
00:08:11.809 --> 00:08:11.819 align:start position:0%
after the bill had been signed into law
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
it could have been fixed through an
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
enrolled build process but there was an
 
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
incorrect cross-reference to the
 
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
legislation as to where the fees would
 
00:08:22.129 --> 00:08:22.139 align:start position:0%
be collected from so fees are collected
 
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:24.660 align:start position:0%
in support of the in support of the
 
00:08:27.529 --> 00:08:27.539 align:start position:0%
program through a provision under the
 
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:30.180 align:start position:0%
controlled Drug Act and it allows for
 
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
the Department to use those fees that
 
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
are collected to support the program
 
00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:36.659 align:start position:0%
activities around the opioid treatment
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
prevention program so the underlying
 
00:08:41.389 --> 00:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
policy for that change was adopted by
 
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
the legislature and passed this
 
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:45.300 align:start position:0%
committee but we're here today to
 
00:08:47.329 --> 00:08:47.339 align:start position:0%
correcting the improper cross reference
 
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
and getting you to the correct
 
00:08:50.449 --> 00:08:50.459 align:start position:0%
cross-reference as it relates to that
 
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:52.740 align:start position:0%
particular section and I would just draw
 
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
your attention on sections one and two
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
first starting on line eight you'll see
 
00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:58.740 align:start position:0%
that we're making the appropriate
 
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
cross-reference to the fund that you
 
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
created under RSA 172 eight
 
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:08.100 align:start position:0%
see within the controlled Drug Act
 
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:10.260 align:start position:0%
section where the fees are established
 
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:11.700 align:start position:0%
and then made the appropriate
 
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
cross-reference within that particular
 
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
RSA in the fund so that the funding
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
as I go through this if it's helpful I
 
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
can break for questions and move on to
 
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
the next section so I sing no questions
 
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:31.740 align:start position:0%
any questions so far
 
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:34.140 align:start position:0%
okay all right well that will take us up
 
00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:37.019 align:start position:0%
to sections uh three and four and I'd
 
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:38.580 align:start position:0%
like to invite up at this time attorney
 
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:42.180 align:start position:0%
Brian Clark Brian Clark and he is
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
general counsel within our legal and
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
Regulatory services but particularly
 
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:50.820 align:start position:0%
he's here on the sections three and four
 
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
as it relates to his role as general
 
00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
counsel for the Bureau of elderly and
 
00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
Adult Services and so sections three and
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
four the bill address a Workforce
 
00:10:02.329 --> 00:10:02.339 align:start position:0%
capacity issue you may recall that you
 
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
folks passed legislation recently to
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
expand the scope of who could provide uh
 
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
care personal care services for
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
individuals who have been deemed both
 
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
financially and clinically eligible for
 
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
purposes of receiving long-term care in
 
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
a community-based setting particularly
 
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:20.700 align:start position:0%
up in the rural areas where there is not
 
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:22.740 align:start position:0%
a sufficient Workforce to meet the
 
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
demand for those individuals who have
 
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
been found eligible that this Builds on
 
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
what we've done in past sessions where
 
00:10:33.769 --> 00:10:33.779 align:start position:0%
we've opened it up to allowing family
 
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
members who are you know qualified to
 
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:38.220 align:start position:0%
doing these kind of services to provide
 
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
for those individuals who are eligible
 
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:42.180 align:start position:0%
so that's already an existing law so
 
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
this expands on that to include also
 
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
Guardians and those have been quarter
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
pointed with powers of attorneys and
 
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
you'll see those changes represented in
 
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:53.220 align:start position:0%
sections uh three and four of the
 
00:10:56.569 --> 00:10:56.579 align:start position:0%
legislation which takes you from page
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
one line 19 through page two line uh 20
 
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
hello chairman any questions for
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
attorney Clark or myself any questions
 
00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
so far
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
no so far so good all right thank you
 
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
that takes us now to page two line 21 uh
 
00:11:21.769 --> 00:11:21.779 align:start position:0%
through uh page three line four uh these
 
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
sections excuse me representative Weber
 
00:11:26.509 --> 00:11:26.519 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm a little similar on the
 
00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
would you remind
 
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
counter-intuitive as I look at the
 
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:36.180 align:start position:0%
language I know that's because I don't
 
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
have the rest of the statute in front of
 
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:40.740 align:start position:0%
me but if you could just explain it to
 
00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:43.820 align:start position:0%
me quickly uh
 
00:11:45.889 --> 00:11:45.899 align:start position:0%
the first
 
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
part uh on lines 19 through uh
 
00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:56.700 align:start position:0%
when she through 30 and and following uh
 
00:11:59.329 --> 00:11:59.339 align:start position:0%
says personal care service provider and
 
00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:01.380 align:start position:0%
who they are and who they're not and and
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
the legally responsible relative is
 
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:07.519 align:start position:0%
accepted out there
 
00:12:11.569 --> 00:12:11.579 align:start position:0%
but I'm remembering that we said we put
 
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
in at one point the fact that we
 
00:12:16.009 --> 00:12:16.019 align:start position:0%
recognized that responsible relatives
 
00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:17.820 align:start position:0%
are providing an enormous amount of care
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
and perhaps they ought to be reimbursed
 
00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:23.839 align:start position:0%
by it uh so
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
it takes them out all the way up to line
 
00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:30.839 align:start position:0%
five and then uh
 
00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
so it just we're just saying that's not
 
00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
a personal care
 
00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:39.660 align:start position:0%
services provider but we're allowing
 
00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:43.079 align:start position:0%
them to earn anyway under section four
 
00:12:45.949 --> 00:12:45.959 align:start position:0%
is that how it works
 
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct so okay by default
 
00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:50.220 align:start position:0%
they would not be included but we have
 
00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
ways to authorize them and when they're
 
00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
needed yes and you wanted specifically
 
00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
to keep those separate is that correct
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
right so we're also adding the process
 
00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
to authorize Guardians and Powers of
 
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
Attorney okay thank you appreciate it
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead thank you and Joe McDonald
 
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
thank you that now brings us to the next
 
00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
two related sections which are sections
 
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
five and six of the bill on found on
 
00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:16.980 align:start position:0%
page two uh line 21 through Page Three
 
00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
line 24 and uh this also relates to law
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
um long-term care and as you know
 
00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
individuals who are in settings either
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
assist living or nursing facilities they
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
are allowed a small amount of money per
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
month for personal care items such as
 
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
things for toothbrushes and things like
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
that for their care so what this section
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
does is to ensure that that money is not
 
00:13:43.009 --> 00:13:43.019 align:start position:0%
to be used for other things such as
 
00:13:45.949 --> 00:13:45.959 align:start position:0%
providing for room and board we have
 
00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
discuss this with the provider community
 
00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:49.620 align:start position:0%
and they have been universally
 
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
supportive of this particular provision
 
00:13:53.449 --> 00:13:53.459 align:start position:0%
and I didn't know if you've had any
 
00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
questions I know that attorney Clark
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
might want to add on to section six of
 
00:13:59.569 --> 00:13:59.579 align:start position:0%
the bill what that piece of the bill
 
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:02.519 align:start position:0%
does uh also in as we work through the
 
00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
process in advance of the hearing in the
 
00:14:05.569 --> 00:14:05.579 align:start position:0%
Senate we also work with New Hampshire
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
legal assistants and I thoughtfully work
 
00:14:09.889 --> 00:14:09.899 align:start position:0%
through some of the issues relative to
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.090 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:16.100 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
six of the bill
 
00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
um adds a requirement to a residential
 
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
care facility residency agreements that
 
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:27.180 align:start position:0%
um they cannot require third parties to
 
00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
pay for the residential care facility
 
00:14:29.639 --> 00:14:30.650 align:start position:0%
pay for the residential care facility
service

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
other than for add-ons like a private
 
00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
I thought that it was already a
 
00:14:39.769 --> 00:14:39.779 align:start position:0%
requirement that a certain amount of
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
money be put into a discretionary fund
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
for a nursing home patient that wasn't
 
00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
that there was the piece that dick
 
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
supposed to be protected within the
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
processary but um apparently that's not
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
the case that the shores up the issues
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
okay you understand the question to go
 
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
ahead uh could you restate the question
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
sure right now my mother was in a
 
00:15:07.009 --> 00:15:07.019 align:start position:0%
nursing home and they had told me years
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
ago when she was there that they were
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
required to put a certain amount of
 
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
money aside for personal needs like
 
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes they take them out to riding
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
around Christmas lights or whatever or
 
00:15:20.329 --> 00:15:20.339 align:start position:0%
whatever it was like they'd stop for an
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
ice cream or something and just
 
00:15:23.569 --> 00:15:23.579 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous personal things and I
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
thought that was already a requirement
 
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
but but it isn't actually so so there is
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
a provision and your memory is spot on
 
00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
there's a provision in state law that
 
00:15:35.569 --> 00:15:35.579 align:start position:0%
requires the facility that's holding the
 
00:15:36.829 --> 00:15:36.839 align:start position:0%
individual like for even at New
 
00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:38.519 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital we have similar trust
 
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:40.740 align:start position:0%
funds that are set up for personal care
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
allowances so there is that in place
 
00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
however invading that trust for these
 
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:47.100 align:start position:0%
purposes need to be clarified in state
 
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
law because apparently there have been
 
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
in some instances where those funds have
 
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
been sought for purposes of
 
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
um somewhat reimbursement for these room
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
and board items so okay thank you
 
00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:03.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
go ahead continue please and that now
 
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
takes us up to section seven I'd like to
 
00:16:12.769 --> 00:16:12.779 align:start position:0%
invite up at this time attorney Robert F
 
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
Berry Jr to join me he is the general
 
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
counsel for our Department's division
 
00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid services he works with
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
Henry Lipman so it means he's the Brain
 
00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:23.820 align:start position:0%
Trust in a very bright man uh very
 
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
bright attorney uh in the next section
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
of the bill that we're here before you
 
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
is section seven found on page three
 
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
lines 15 through 13. this is one that um
 
00:16:38.269 --> 00:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
we've been actually identifying for for
 
00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:40.740 align:start position:0%
a few years now for
 
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
um trying to to address and it's it's
 
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:44.820 align:start position:0%
meant to be business friendly so we have
 
00:16:46.249 --> 00:16:46.259 align:start position:0%
this thing called the nursing facility
 
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
quality assessment uh and those those
 
00:16:51.949 --> 00:16:51.959 align:start position:0%
assessments are used as part of our our
 
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
rates that we we provide around certain
 
00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:55.820 align:start position:0%
Lawn Care
 
00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
matters so what this bill does is it
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
says to the provider to the nursing
 
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
facility who's having to report to the
 
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Health Unit services and
 
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
also to revenue Administration who
 
00:17:08.929 --> 00:17:08.939 align:start position:0%
receives these fees that you don't have
 
00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
to report to us at hhf we're trying to
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
take one unnecessary step away for them
 
00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:15.419 align:start position:0%
because we get that information directly
 
00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Revenue
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
Administration as part of the process so
 
00:17:21.409 --> 00:17:21.419 align:start position:0%
with that um it's meant to be business
 
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:23.220 align:start position:0%
friendly and it's it's an item that
 
00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:24.839 align:start position:0%
we've been looking to take care of for a
 
00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:26.339 align:start position:0%
few years now and I'd like to turn it
 
00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
over to attorney Barry if he has any
 
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
other thoughts uh nothing more to add
 
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
other than it just really is meant to
 
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate duplicate duplicative
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
processes and ensure some efficiency
 
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
among paperwork that's moving between
 
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
various agencies and the nursing
 
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
facility industry
 
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Shapiro
 
00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:49.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I did not catch
 
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
where that is in the bill oh
 
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
that's okay thank you very much section
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
seven is found on page three lines 5
 
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
another questions uh representative
 
00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
for taking the question out of curiosity
 
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
why would apple cider not be considered
 
00:18:18.289 --> 00:18:18.299 align:start position:0%
a fruit juice to begin with and that
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
would be the next section that we'll be
 
00:18:19.679 --> 00:18:20.870 align:start position:0%
would be the next section that we'll be
addressing

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay representative Nagel
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking
 
00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:28.380 align:start position:0%
like I'm just curious why that you would
 
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
have had to report to two different
 
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
entities in the beginning why that was
 
00:18:36.409 --> 00:18:36.419 align:start position:0%
me so so the way that uh the imequip
 
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
payment used to be calculated which is
 
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:39.900 align:start position:0%
Medicaid quality incentive and I forget
 
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
the P stands for payment or program so
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
forgive me for that
 
00:18:45.169 --> 00:18:45.179 align:start position:0%
um but what would happen was the
 
00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
department would originally get the uh
 
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
the information and use that to
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
calculate the mqp payment uh CMS is uh
 
00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:53.220 align:start position:0%
subsequently said that we can't do that
 
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
we need it based on actual uh monies
 
00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
received which we get from dra
 
00:19:00.529 --> 00:19:00.539 align:start position:0%
subsequent to that so this makes the the
 
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:06.529 --> 00:19:06.539 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:19:06.539 --> 00:19:07.789 align:start position:0%
other questions
okay

00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you and chairman McDonald that now
 
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
takes us to sections eight and none of
 
00:19:15.169 --> 00:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
the bill I'd like to invite up uh Miss
 
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
Pauline Smith she's an administrator
 
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
with the Department's division of Public
 
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
Health Services Under food protection
 
00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
and we are here today now on sections
 
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
eight and nine of the bill found on page
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
three lines 14 through 32 and that gets
 
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
us to represent Merchant's question
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
regarding the change to uh apple cider
 
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
and from a food Protection Service we
 
00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:38.820 align:start position:0%
have the best person to answer the
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
question here because you'll see that we
 
00:19:42.409 --> 00:19:42.419 align:start position:0%
deleted other types of fruit juices so
 
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
we needed to get more clarity about what
 
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
was actually being required to getting a
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
license under the water bottling and
 
00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
juices item so I will turn it over to
 
00:19:54.529 --> 00:19:54.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for allowing me
 
00:19:59.210 --> 00:19:59.220 align:start position:0%
to speak to this bill the beverage and
 
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
bottled water program it primarily
 
00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:04.919 align:start position:0%
regulates hosts wholesalers of Beverages
 
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
and bottled water in the state there are
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
a few exceptions to that milk products
 
00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:10.980 align:start position:0%
because they're regulated under the
 
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
dairy sanitation program within the
 
00:20:15.409 --> 00:20:15.419 align:start position:0%
department but there was also a part of
 
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
the statute that allowed someone that's
 
00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:19.559 align:start position:0%
making a fruit juice or bottled water
 
00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
direct to Consumer to be to not have a
 
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
license so we're amending that so if you
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
are making a fruit juice or bottled
 
00:20:30.289 --> 00:20:30.299 align:start position:0%
water you would be required to have a
 
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
license but with the exception of 100
 
00:20:36.169 --> 00:20:36.179 align:start position:0%
apple cider so this would allow apple
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
orchards that are pressing cider
 
00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:40.860 align:start position:0%
exclusively for distribution direct to
 
00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:43.559 align:start position:0%
Consumer to not have our license as as
 
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
has been the case in the past the other
 
00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:48.900 align:start position:0%
substantial change is is that there was
 
00:20:51.409 --> 00:20:51.419 align:start position:0%
also a provision that if someone was
 
00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
bottling a beverage regardless and this
 
00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
would be like a lemonade if so if it's a
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
grocery store bottling lemon Aid they
 
00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:00.780 align:start position:0%
would require this beverage license plus
 
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
they could also hold a regular retail
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
food license so this would eliminate
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
that double licensing so if they were
 
00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
regulated under the retail food program
 
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:13.740 align:start position:0%
they could just have the one license and
 
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
it will have minimal fiscal impact but
 
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
certainly the the industry would it's
 
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
it's streamlining regulation over the
 
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
the industry not having two regular two
 
00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:25.860 align:start position:0%
regulatory inspectors oversee the same
 
00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
operation essentially
 
00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
and and if I could just uh just restate
 
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
at a very high level because
 
00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
um Miss Smith is very knowledgeable in
 
00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
her area what what is happening here in
 
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
the state there are what we call
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
self-inspecting towns uh like Concord
 
00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
and some of the larger towns and um and
 
00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:44.940 align:start position:0%
then there are ones that fall under the
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
oversight of the department as it
 
00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
currently exists if you have a
 
00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:49.860 align:start position:0%
restaurant for example that you sell
 
00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
bottled water and you have a license to
 
00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:56.220 align:start position:0%
under our food protection what this bill
 
00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
would do is say you don't also have to
 
00:22:00.289 --> 00:22:00.299 align:start position:0%
have a second license for bottled water
 
00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:01.980 align:start position:0%
that's what this does it's business
 
00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
friendly and it's meant to uh there is a
 
00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:08.220 align:start position:0%
modicum of small loss of some uh fees to
 
00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:09.900 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire as a result
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
of it but we think it's a positive
 
00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
because we're covering for that entity
 
00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
based upon that one license as opposed
 
00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
to requiring a second duplicative
 
00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
license uh
 
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Merchant
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and also thank you
 
00:22:27.169 --> 00:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
for taking a question and sorry for
 
00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:28.860 align:start position:0%
jumping the gun
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
um my apologies
 
00:22:33.409 --> 00:22:33.419 align:start position:0%
in regards to I would be a nitpicky here
 
00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
but if I read this
 
00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
the way it's written
 
00:22:39.649 --> 00:22:39.659 align:start position:0%
if I have a lemonade stand do I have to
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
have a license
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
if you if you have a lemonade stand do I
 
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
have to have a license because it's a
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
root gun straight
 
00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
because I
 
00:22:50.029 --> 00:22:50.039 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be under this program it would
 
00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
if it meant the criteria of a retail
 
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
food license because you're selling
 
00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
direct to Consumer
 
00:22:57.169 --> 00:22:57.179 align:start position:0%
um you wouldn't have these are this
 
00:22:59.529 --> 00:22:59.539 align:start position:0%
right this program is is
 
00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
mainly wholesaling of beverages it
 
00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:03.529 align:start position:0%
mainly wholesaling of beverages it
wouldn't

00:23:03.529 --> 00:23:03.539 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
00:23:06.049 --> 00:23:06.059 align:start position:0%
um if you if your lemonade stand met the
 
00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
criteria for a retail food license then
 
00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
it would be under that program
 
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:15.169 --> 00:23:15.179 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:23:15.179 --> 00:23:16.190 align:start position:0%
other questions
okay

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
go ahead and Sherman McDonald thank you
 
00:23:21.049 --> 00:23:21.059 align:start position:0%
very much uh Smith I'd like to invite up
 
00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
at this time attorney Francesca
 
00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.610 align:start position:0%
at this time attorney Francesca
Hennessey

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:24.620 align:start position:0%
Hennessey
 
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
and the next section we're going to be
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
covering is section 10 of the bill and
 
00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
that is found on page three lines 33
 
00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
through Page four lines five and for
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
those of you who served on the committee
 
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
last session you'll recall that our
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
agency came before you to identify that
 
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
under a program and it's actually two
 
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
separate programs but they serve a very
 
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
similar purpose one is called the Mead
 
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
program uh and I know if chairman uh
 
00:23:54.409 --> 00:23:54.419 align:start position:0%
over across the hall made a joke about
 
00:23:57.049 --> 00:23:57.059 align:start position:0%
it being a beverage but in this case it
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
actually stands for Medicaid for
 
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
employed adults with disabilities and it
 
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
makes individuals who have certain uh
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
needs for accommodations uh much more
 
00:24:07.549 --> 00:24:07.559 align:start position:0%
attractive from an employment standpoint
 
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
by employer because they can subject to
 
00:24:12.049 --> 00:24:12.059 align:start position:0%
some income eligibility and also
 
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
clinical eligibility can receive
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
Medicaid so it does help offset the cost
 
00:24:18.289 --> 00:24:18.299 align:start position:0%
for employer relative to medical
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
coverage so that's the bigger program
 
00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
that's out there so this this isn't
 
00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
about anything about the program other
 
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
than the fact that last session we came
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
before this group to identify that the
 
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
premiums paid by the individuals who
 
00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:31.740 align:start position:0%
participate in these programs actually
 
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
our cost of trying to recover those fees
 
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
was close to being Awash in terms of an
 
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
impact to the state so it made sense at
 
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
that point that this is such an
 
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
important program to go ahead and
 
00:24:45.169 --> 00:24:45.179 align:start position:0%
eliminate the premium fees as it relates
 
00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:48.200 align:start position:0%
to the Mead program the mode program
 
00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
moad is for Medicaid for older adults
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
with disabilities it was recently passed
 
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
within about the past five or six years
 
00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
identifying that as we're having an
 
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
aging population the meat program covers
 
00:25:03.649 --> 00:25:03.659 align:start position:0%
from 18 to 64 years but the thought
 
00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:05.220 align:start position:0%
would be we have folks that are working
 
00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
well past 65 and folks who have
 
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
challenges and so they created the
 
00:25:12.049 --> 00:25:12.059 align:start position:0%
Medicaid for the older adults with
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
disabilities and also that program
 
00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:16.860 align:start position:0%
likewise the premiums were eliminated by
 
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
this body and signed into law by the
 
00:25:21.289 --> 00:25:21.299 align:start position:0%
governor last year what this does is
 
00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:22.980 align:start position:0%
additional cleanup with all thoughtful
 
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
legislation you always seem to fine when
 
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
you're doing your gardening that there's
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
other Provisions that touch upon that so
 
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
we just need to go through that and make
 
00:25:32.769 --> 00:25:32.779 align:start position:0%
those adjustments to remove the outdated
 
00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
references to either premiums or other
 
00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:37.980 align:start position:0%
items that this group that the
 
00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
legislature already took action on so I
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have questions for
 
00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:44.820 align:start position:0%
myself or attorneys Hennessy
 
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
uh representative Shapiro
 
00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
taking this question
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
if I understand the Mead program
 
00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
correctly and I'm not sure I do it's
 
00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
it's a program that allows people to con
 
00:26:00.769 --> 00:26:00.779 align:start position:0%
who are meet certain conditions who are
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
disabled to continue to receive Medicaid
 
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
after they would have otherwise been
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
financially ineligible because they've
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
started to working start working so I'm
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
very interested in this because I think
 
00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
it's a real problem
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
um that in some cases people are
 
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:25.140 align:start position:0%
don't have the incentive to work more or
 
00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:26.700 align:start position:0%
get a higher paid job because they're
 
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
going to lose health insurance and so
 
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
they're going to lose
 
00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.130 align:start position:0%
they're going to lose
um

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:31.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:32.820 align:start position:0%
overall it's going to be a losing
 
00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:35.940 align:start position:0%
proposition so my question is how long
 
00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
can someone stay on the Mead program
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
once they've gone past Financial
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
eligibility and
 
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:43.970 align:start position:0%
eligibility and
um

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
and also I know this is not relative to
 
00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:50.220 align:start position:0%
the bill itself but also how successful
 
00:26:53.149 --> 00:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
is it in terms of encouraging people who
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
are disabled to
 
00:26:58.250 --> 00:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
get jobs work and
 
00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:58.850 align:start position:0%
get jobs work and
um

00:26:58.850 --> 00:26:58.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:01.140 align:start position:0%
be more ambitious in that area of their
 
00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:06.830 align:start position:0%
be more ambitious in that area of their
life

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:09.169 --> 00:27:09.179 align:start position:0%
right I mean what I will say to your
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
question is let's make it makes it much
 
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
easier for people to obtain this program
 
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
because there are no premiums anymore
 
00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
that was done last session this is
 
00:27:18.289 --> 00:27:18.299 align:start position:0%
simply a cleanup to take that out of the
 
00:27:21.409 --> 00:27:21.419 align:start position:0%
rest of the bill I don't know of how
 
00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
long a person can stay on I can
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
certainly get back to you on that I also
 
00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
consult with more of our policy
 
00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
in Medicaid to see if they have
 
00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
measurables on the success of the
 
00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
program that's a really good question I
 
00:27:36.529 --> 00:27:36.539 align:start position:0%
just don't know this at this time
 
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
okay I'd appreciate anything I'll write
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
down your name so I can get back to you
 
00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
representative Weber did you have a
 
00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.029 align:start position:0%
representative Weber did you have a
question

00:27:46.029 --> 00:27:46.039 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:27:48.529 --> 00:27:48.539 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:27:51.289 --> 00:27:51.299 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm just making
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
sure that this is only about section 10
 
00:27:56.029 --> 00:27:56.039 align:start position:0%
is that right and we're going to deal
 
00:27:58.970 --> 00:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
with Section 11 differently or is
 
00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:00.500 align:start position:0%
section 11
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
included in this particular yeah my
 
00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:05.820 align:start position:0%
apologies if I did not make it clear
 
00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:07.980 align:start position:0%
we're just right now on Section 10 of
 
00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
the bill in the accepted Instinct
 
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:11.940 align:start position:0%
heading into section 11. I'm sure you
 
00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
did but I was writing something else so
 
00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:19.799 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:28:22.669 --> 00:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
and that takes us to section 11 of the
 
00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:28.919 align:start position:0%
uh section 11 of the bill
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
um and so I'm going to turn this over to
 
00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
um attorney Hennessy to give you the
 
00:28:38.269 --> 00:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
overview but uh this uh okay well let me
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
just slow up a bit okay here we go this
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
these sections of laws that we're going
 
00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
to touch upon both sections 10 and also
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
um upgrad strike that 11 and 12. uh do
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
touch upon our supplemental nutrition
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
assistance program and so working along
 
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire legal assistance
 
00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
we thought we did amend the bill in the
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
Senate to reflect that no longer is a
 
00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:01.799 align:start position:0%
program referred to as food stamps
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's just the Vestige of the fact that
 
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
this statute hasn't been amended in
 
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
large measure since the mid 90s and so
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
we're here today essentially on both of
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
those two sections to do something very
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
simple which is to align under state law
 
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
the federal law as it relates to
 
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
overpayments in other words if an agency
 
00:29:24.289 --> 00:29:24.299 align:start position:0%
overpays the amount of um that you're to
 
00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
receive for the supplemental nutritions
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
program there is a process already in
 
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
place in law but we just want to make
 
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
sure that our state law is aligned with
 
00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
with the federal law it's one of the
 
00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:35.700 align:start position:0%
requirements that we have with what they
 
00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:37.380 align:start position:0%
call the federal nutrition services
 
00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:40.860 align:start position:0%
program uh FNS is another acronym that's
 
00:29:42.049 --> 00:29:42.059 align:start position:0%
out there that you might be hearing us
 
00:29:44.269 --> 00:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
talking about I know your your chair is
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
very familiar with all the subject
 
00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:46.980 align:start position:0%
matter and perhaps would do a much
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
better job than myself in terms of
 
00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
giving into the background but that's
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
essentially what we're trying to do is
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
to have it tie in with the provisions of
 
00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
the federal laws that really so
 
00:29:59.510 --> 00:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
overpayment in section 11 and in section
 
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
12 of the bill uh it's in terms of
 
00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
disregards if we have individuals who
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
have been deemed not to do the right
 
00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:08.700 align:start position:0%
things uh and three times I guess is not
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
the charm you're not doing the right
 
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
things that the disqualification pieces
 
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
of this also plan so that gets into the
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
area of safeguarding uh you know
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
valuable taxpayer dollars as it relates
 
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
to disqualifications and so we're
 
00:30:24.289 --> 00:30:24.299 align:start position:0%
aligning also with federal law because
 
00:30:27.169 --> 00:30:27.179 align:start position:0%
one of the best practices is is to make
 
00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:29.940 align:start position:0%
a reference to the federal citations or
 
00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
whatever it's a great practice of doing
 
00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
that in in law the problem with that is
 
00:30:36.049 --> 00:30:36.059 align:start position:0%
you can't see what those cfrs are so
 
00:30:37.789 --> 00:30:37.799 align:start position:0%
certainly I'm looking to the venerable
 
00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
members of your committee who might be
 
00:30:42.169 --> 00:30:42.179 align:start position:0%
attorneys as well uh to also supplement
 
00:30:45.409 --> 00:30:45.419 align:start position:0%
what we are providing here but we have
 
00:30:47.149 --> 00:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
gone through the process to making sure
 
00:30:49.549 --> 00:30:49.559 align:start position:0%
with great detail that the provisions
 
00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:51.659 align:start position:0%
we're referring to here do refer back to
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
the correct Federal citations and law so
 
00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:55.860 align:start position:0%
with that I'd like to turn it over to
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
fraternity uh Hennessey
 
00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
terms of section 11 and 12. uh starting
 
00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:06.620 align:start position:0%
with Section 11 we
 
00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:10.740 align:start position:0%
this was a provision that we identified
 
00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
um in going over our law in terms of
 
00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:16.740 align:start position:0%
cleaning up what uh what our practices
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
and aligning that with the law of the
 
00:31:21.769 --> 00:31:21.779 align:start position:0%
food and nutrition services are federal
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
oversight agency has approved a
 
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
particular claims management plan for us
 
00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
and in that plan they have approved that
 
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
for any errors the department makes we
 
00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
are required under federal law to
 
00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
collect back that money however they
 
00:31:40.669 --> 00:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
have allowed us to Simply make the
 
00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:43.940 align:start position:0%
statement that if it's not more than 450
 
00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
please don't go after it and so we
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
continue to do that we've always done
 
00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
that the second section they've never
 
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.430 align:start position:0%
that the second section they've never
approved

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
approved
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
um and we're we don't know that it is
 
00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
approvable by FNS so we're taking out
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
the hard to measure recipients income
 
00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
being less than or equal to two times
 
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
the federal poverty level it brought up
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions for us such as at
 
00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
what time at what point in their life
 
00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
are they under this federal poverty
 
00:32:13.559 --> 00:32:14.630 align:start position:0%
are they under this federal poverty
level

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:17.940 align:start position:0%
um it was a it was a hard thing to
 
00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
quantify in addition to it never being
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
approved by the federal government
 
00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:26.940 align:start position:0%
um the second section section 12
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
um this is all federal law so under
 
00:32:32.529 --> 00:32:32.539 align:start position:0%
seven CFR section
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
273.16 these are the current
 
00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
disqualification penalties and John's
 
00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
right three times is the charm if you
 
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:44.220 align:start position:0%
um are overpaid as representative
 
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:46.740 align:start position:0%
McDonald knows after three times and you
 
00:32:48.889 --> 00:32:48.899 align:start position:0%
did that on purpose we're not you are
 
00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:50.820 align:start position:0%
not no longer eligible for food stamps
 
00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
and that has never changed what has
 
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
changed is that they have up the
 
00:32:57.049 --> 00:32:57.059 align:start position:0%
disqualification penalties and we're
 
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
I think it was the um
 
00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
back in 96 when as far back as that but
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
that was changed right to 12 and any I
 
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
think any claims prior to 96 was 6 12
 
00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
and permanent then it went up after the
 
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
96 welfare reform Act
 
00:33:24.529 --> 00:33:24.539 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you I wasn't exactly sure but
 
00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
um it it is long overdue for being
 
00:33:30.049 --> 00:33:30.059 align:start position:0%
updated so thank you I remember the new
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
Statue of books we get every year when I
 
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
was at the department they still said 6
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
12 and permanent so and it may confuse
 
00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:38.700 align:start position:0%
judges where these cases are going
 
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
before yes thank you representative
 
00:33:43.669 --> 00:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chairman so I don't
 
00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:46.580 align:start position:0%
have it in front of me RSA 167
 
00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:49.860 align:start position:0%
17-b is that the section in State
 
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
Statute that spells out
 
00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:54.289 align:start position:0%
Statute that spells out
um

00:33:54.289 --> 00:33:54.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:57.289 --> 00:33:57.299 align:start position:0%
it is the violation and the penalty yes
 
00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
and the violation is accepting more
 
00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:03.889 align:start position:0%
and the violation is accepting more
snap

00:34:03.889 --> 00:34:03.899 align:start position:0%
snap
 
00:34:03.899 --> 00:34:04.610 align:start position:0%
snap
um

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:04.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.529 align:start position:0%
um
benefits

00:34:06.529 --> 00:34:06.539 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.149 align:start position:0%
 
ah

00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:17.089 --> 00:34:17.099 align:start position:0%
yes if you have been receiving SNAP
 
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
benefits and you are convicted under
 
00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:22.730 align:start position:0%
benefits and you are convicted under
167.17b

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
um your first violation you will be
 
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
disqualified for
 
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
in the updated Lot 12 months your second
 
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:32.460 align:start position:0%
time you do that it's 24 months
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
um and after that it's permanently so
 
00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:36.060 align:start position:0%
you do need a conviction so it would
 
00:34:38.109 --> 00:34:38.119 align:start position:0%
have to be intentional
 
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
intentional violation so that assumes
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
it's something that the consumer did to
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
get more benefits than they should have
 
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:48.780 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't just a a never on the
 
00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
part of the state yes thank you
 
00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:52.919 align:start position:0%
important clarification between the two
 
00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
statutes the first one I mentioned was
 
00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
just errors on behalf of the department
 
00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
this section is intentional violations
 
00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
on the part of the recipient thank you
 
00:35:04.609 --> 00:35:04.619 align:start position:0%
and there's also agents there's also
 
00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
Plein error claims that can be collected
 
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
still right but no yes absolutely
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative Weber did you have a
 
00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.530 align:start position:0%
representative Weber did you have a
question

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
it's been clarified thank you okay
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
thank you and chairman McDonald that
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
takes us to the final coupling of
 
00:35:25.609 --> 00:35:25.619 align:start position:0%
sections and I want to invite up at this
 
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
time Miss Danielle Hernandez she is an
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
administrator with the Department's uh
 
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
um division for public health services
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
and she is here in her capacity as
 
00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
administrator with our State Office of
 
00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
rural Health she does incredible work
 
00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
particularly for underserved regions
 
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
within the state and this is a request
 
00:35:47.569 --> 00:35:47.579 align:start position:0%
from the Department to take a reporting
 
00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
requirement that we currently have from
 
00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
an annual basis all the way to making it
 
00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:54.599 align:start position:0%
a three-year reporting requirement and
 
00:35:57.170 --> 00:35:57.180 align:start position:0%
this comes with the endorsement of the
 
00:35:58.370 --> 00:35:58.380 align:start position:0%
underlying commission that actually
 
00:36:00.349 --> 00:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
looks at primary care and Workforce
 
00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
issues and at their January 25th meeting
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
if that's a Thursday which I believe it
 
00:36:07.849 --> 00:36:07.859 align:start position:0%
is they actually formally voted and
 
00:36:09.849 --> 00:36:09.859 align:start position:0%
approved these sections of the bill
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
recognizing the importance of the work
 
00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:13.380 align:start position:0%
but that the frequency of the
 
00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:16.140 align:start position:0%
information certainly based upon the
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
good works that are done that a
 
00:36:19.849 --> 00:36:19.859 align:start position:0%
three-year cycle is is helpful there are
 
00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:21.180 align:start position:0%
additional reporting requirements that
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
the State Office of rural Health has to
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
make on an annual basis in addition to
 
00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:26.460 align:start position:0%
this so I would just turn it over to Mr
 
00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
Hernandez who does an amazing job in her
 
00:36:31.069 --> 00:36:31.079 align:start position:0%
capacity as administrator with our State
 
00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:32.940 align:start position:0%
Office of rural health
 
00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:34.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
um what we're asking is really just to
 
00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:38.839 align:start position:0%
separate two fundamentally different
 
00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements when legislation
 
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
passed on health Workforce data
 
00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:46.980 align:start position:0%
collection what it did was required an
 
00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:49.740 align:start position:0%
annual report to be incorporated into
 
00:36:53.089 --> 00:36:53.099 align:start position:0%
this health disparities report and so
 
00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
really what we want to do is because
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
they're so different we want to separate
 
00:36:59.329 --> 00:36:59.339 align:start position:0%
them out so that it makes it easier for
 
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
stakeholders like yourselves to find the
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
information you're really looking for
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
instead of you know scouring through a
 
00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
50 you know 50 plus page report to find
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
you know Health disparities information
 
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
by geography or primary care supply and
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
data collection efforts work and also
 
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
what this would do is give consideration
 
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
to limited staff resources for multiple
 
00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:26.460 align:start position:0%
offices this takes a better part of
 
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
about half a year to put together to
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
coordinate to compile statistics for um
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
and it would also allow for a consistent
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
reporting of measures and current
 
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
estimates where we don't currently have
 
00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
that because the data isn't collected
 
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
annually or analyzed by the respective
 
00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
office annually so often
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
um the data in the annual reports for uh
 
00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
the health status of rural residents
 
00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:55.980 align:start position:0%
will be unchanged or even excluded so we
 
00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
know that changes in health status are
 
00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
incremental right they happen they very
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
rarely happen year to year so we know
 
00:38:05.089 --> 00:38:05.099 align:start position:0%
that we wouldn't be limiting our you
 
00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:06.900 align:start position:0%
know knowledge our understanding of
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
Health disparities in the state if we
 
00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
change it to a three-year reporting
 
00:38:14.329 --> 00:38:14.339 align:start position:0%
cycle the health statistics that we have
 
00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:16.740 align:start position:0%
seen changed it's only because of the
 
00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:20.220 align:start position:0%
change of a survey tool or you know the
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
analysis methodology it's not because
 
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
our actual changes in the health between
 
00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
populations in the state
 
00:38:29.089 --> 00:38:29.099 align:start position:0%
and just for a point of reference that
 
00:38:31.609 --> 00:38:31.619 align:start position:0%
these um changes for the three-year
 
00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement are found in
 
00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
sections 13 and 14 of the legislation
 
00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:39.180 align:start position:0%
found on page for line 25 through page
 
00:38:42.109 --> 00:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
five line nine uh and if there's no
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
questions on this section that takes us
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
the last two sections of the bills that
 
00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
are coupled together which are sections
 
00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:52.140 align:start position:0%
uh 15 and 16. this is a question I'm
 
00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm trying thank you Mr chairman
 
00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:56.220 align:start position:0%
yeah nice try
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
um I I thank you I just had a how do I
 
00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:01.460 align:start position:0%
access this data the report
 
00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
yes so the report is actually published
 
00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
on the DHHS website on the rural health
 
00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
and Primary Care uh page we also present
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
the report to the HHS oversight
 
00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
committee which is scheduled for the end
 
00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
of the month of this month
 
00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:19.500 align:start position:0%
um yeah so uh but the information is
 
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
always available and I think you will
 
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
find if you do locate that report I can
 
00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
certainly send it over to you as well
 
00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:29.460 align:start position:0%
but it is difficult to be able to find
 
00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:31.140 align:start position:0%
um you know the information depending
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
again are you looking for a primary
 
00:39:34.609 --> 00:39:34.619 align:start position:0%
Supply statistics are you looking for
 
00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
our health Workforce efforts or are you
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
looking for health disparities
 
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
information it is sort of hard to locate
 
00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:42.660 align:start position:0%
the information the report because it's
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
all gone together oh okay all right
 
00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Plaza
 
00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh maybe I'm missing
 
00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:55.740 align:start position:0%
something but help me understand like
 
00:39:59.390 --> 00:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
this speech from another report to have
 
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
this idea because sometimes things
 
00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
happen uh fast and we want to know
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
what's going on like three years ago
 
00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:12.660 align:start position:0%
maybe there was no covet pandemic so if
 
00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
we would go and wait for three years
 
00:40:17.329 --> 00:40:17.339 align:start position:0%
until the report we would miss some
 
00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
important information
 
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
so um I I want to clarify that they're
 
00:40:26.329 --> 00:40:26.339 align:start position:0%
one of the reports on for the health
 
00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
Workforce data collection and that's the
 
00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
primary care supply piece that of course
 
00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
is you know important to track uh the
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
trends of annual Aid that would still be
 
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
required to be reported on annually so
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
that's the intent here
 
00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
um the report the initial report that
 
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
has been a statutory requirement since
 
00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
2009 on health disparities by geography
 
00:40:50.329 --> 00:40:50.339 align:start position:0%
basically health status of rural
 
00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:52.380 align:start position:0%
residence would change to every three
 
00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
years so it's really just separating out
 
00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
that report one the one that you know we
 
00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
really do want to have our eyes on and
 
00:41:01.069 --> 00:41:01.079 align:start position:0%
report on annually is going to stay as
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
an annual submission the other is going
 
00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:04.140 align:start position:0%
to be every three years
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
um because we found that since reporting
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
there really hasn't been any incremental
 
00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
changes and
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
um or excuse me there are very slight
 
00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
incremental changes and when that does
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
happen it's you know it spends really
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
five years or so
 
00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:20.220 align:start position:0%
um and we know we wouldn't be losing any
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
information limiting any of information
 
00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
that's necessary for for State policy
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
and work
 
00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:28.740 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and uh Miss Rogers I was
 
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
going to call up next uh had to leave
 
00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:36.839 align:start position:0%
for another hearing in the Senate HHS
 
00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
but we are loyal to this committee and
 
00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
Ms Hernandez is going to stick with me
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
because it also involves Public Health
 
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
uh the sections 15 and 16 of the bill
 
00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:47.460 align:start position:0%
were made as an accommodation a request
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
by Senator Apprentice who serves on the
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
and if we can look at the title together
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
because it's a very long title it is the
 
00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:56.990 align:start position:0%
because it's a very long title it is the
commission

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:41:59.690 --> 00:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
um uh on um we're here we'll start right
 
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
over here here we go commission to study
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
the delivery of Public Health Services
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire through Regional public
 
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
health networks and all this is doing is
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
extending the sunset provision for this
 
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
year for an additional year to allow
 
00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
them to do their important work and I
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
didn't know if Miss Hernandez has any
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
underlying subject matter knowledge as
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
it relates to to this but otherwise we
 
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
were fine with this bill being used as a
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
vehicle for those two sections
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
and chairman McDonald if there's no
 
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
question that completes the Department's
 
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
presentation on Senate Bill 127. okay I
 
00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
see no uh I see no questions so I want
 
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
to thank you and all your committee
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
members for your patience and us getting
 
00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
through otherwise what would have been
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
eight different uh legislative hearings
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
so we appreciate that and thank you very
 
00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:45.060 align:start position:0%
much for your thoughtfulness and your
 
00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:46.380 align:start position:0%
consideration of this Bill thank you
 
00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you all for coming
 
00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:55.609 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you all for coming
today

00:42:55.609 --> 00:42:55.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
they also signed up to speak as
 
00:42:59.690 --> 00:42:59.700 align:start position:0%
representative Jess Edwards from
 
00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:16.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh committee members
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
I'm uh representing Jess Edwards
 
00:43:20.089 --> 00:43:20.099 align:start position:0%
representing Rockingham District
 
00:43:23.809 --> 00:43:23.819 align:start position:0%
district 31 that's Auburn Candia Chester
 
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
and Deerfield since redistricting I have
 
00:43:28.609 --> 00:43:28.619 align:start position:0%
to keep practicing that that's why I say
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
it but I'm also here today
 
00:43:35.329 --> 00:43:35.339 align:start position:0%
fulfilling part of my duties as the
 
00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
chairman of division three I'm looking
 
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
at house bill or Senate Bill 127 FN and
 
00:43:44.329 --> 00:43:44.339 align:start position:0%
I notice there are some things in here
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
that might have been hb2 kind of items
 
00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:51.180 align:start position:0%
or proposals either from the governor or
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
something brought to US during the
 
00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:56.700 align:start position:0%
hospital two phase that that did not
 
00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
come over to us so I wanted to just
 
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
comment on it first I'd say that most of
 
00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839 align:start position:0%
the experienced Representatives when you
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
first saw this bill I hope you thought
 
00:44:12.109 --> 00:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
as I did oh no it's a Christmas tree
 
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
there's the problem with Christmas tree
 
00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:17.700 align:start position:0%
bills when you identify a bunch of items
 
00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
in one bill it really gets to be hard to
 
00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
draw focus and get the right witnesses
 
00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
to talk about each specific item things
 
00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:30.420 align:start position:0%
go kind of quickly and I it's just a
 
00:44:32.809 --> 00:44:32.819 align:start position:0%
process that makes me nervous that we
 
00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
might Overlook something
 
00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
so specifically on page one
 
00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
um of
 
00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:46.460 align:start position:0%
the bill lines three through
 
00:44:50.569 --> 00:44:50.579 align:start position:0%
18. it it there's a policy issue here
 
00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:53.700 align:start position:0%
where we want to take opioid we want to
 
00:44:56.809 --> 00:44:56.819 align:start position:0%
establish fees for the opiate treatment
 
00:44:59.630 --> 00:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
programs and we want to put those into
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds and we don't want them
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
to be deposited into the general fund
 
00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
and and and I would just tell you that
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
uh as as somebody who looks at the
 
00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:14.220 align:start position:0%
budget a lot these kinds of things
 
00:45:17.809 --> 00:45:17.819 align:start position:0%
reduce the legislative Authority that I
 
00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:19.740 align:start position:0%
think we have under our constitution to
 
00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
pay attention to how money is getting
 
00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:24.839 align:start position:0%
spent so as a general principle putting
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
money of taking it out of the general
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
fund and putting it into a dedicated
 
00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
fund I think is a policy issue that I I
 
00:45:34.609 --> 00:45:34.619 align:start position:0%
don't particularly like and there needs
 
00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:37.260 align:start position:0%
to be a high threshold before we do that
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
kind of thing of why that's really
 
00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:42.780 align:start position:0%
necessary and then I I think there may
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
be sort of some missing math here if you
 
00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:50.220 align:start position:0%
if you look at page five or excuse me
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
line five into line six it says if the
 
00:45:58.130 --> 00:45:58.140 align:start position:0%
provider had no clients in the previous
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
calendar year then the fee shall be a
 
00:46:02.329 --> 00:46:02.339 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
okay so what if they only had one
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
patient then according to that section
 
00:46:10.609 --> 00:46:10.619 align:start position:0%
they would have to pay eight dollars
 
00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:14.460 align:start position:0%
so I I think what this is attempting to
 
00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
do is to say the minimum amount that any
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
provider must pay is at least a thousand
 
00:46:24.829 --> 00:46:24.839 align:start position:0%
dollars plus eight dollars per patient
 
00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
and so so that's a that's a policy
 
00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:28.980 align:start position:0%
question whether or not it makes sense
 
00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
but I just think we missed part of the
 
00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:33.380 align:start position:0%
math there
 
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
otherwise it wouldn't make any sense if
 
00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
I were a provider and I didn't have any
 
00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
patience in December I would go
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
pay somebody five hundred dollars to be
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
my patient then I'd only have to pay an
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
eight dollar fee and I'd still make a
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
lot of money so it just it's just not
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
um good math
 
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.710 align:start position:0%
um good math
then

00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
I I don't know this to be true and if
 
00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
this comes over to division three I'll
 
00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:04.980 align:start position:0%
I'll be asking questions about this
 
00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:11.300 align:start position:0%
on pages four lines 25 down
 
00:47:14.569 --> 00:47:14.579 align:start position:0%
talking about reports for the office of
 
00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
rural health I I would I I asked the
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
question is this redundant and and I
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
wonder if it's redundant because we have
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
a dedicated office called Health Equity
 
00:47:32.569 --> 00:47:32.579 align:start position:0%
Health Equity has seven ftes in it I
 
00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
think we appropriated like 2.4 million
 
00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
dollars for it and one of their roles is
 
00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:40.190 align:start position:0%
dollars for it and one of their roles is
to

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
take a look overall at the distribution
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
of clinical care around the state and to
 
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
make recommendations if there are
 
00:47:52.849 --> 00:47:52.859 align:start position:0%
shortages particularly if there are
 
00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
problems that we can associate with it
 
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
we we have all kinds of groups running
 
00:47:58.190 --> 00:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
around right now trying to deal with our
 
00:48:01.609 --> 00:48:01.619 align:start position:0%
Workforce issues so so I would just say
 
00:48:06.109 --> 00:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
that this section 13 and maybe 14 I'd
 
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
have to look at a little bit more maybe
 
00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
redundant and perhaps there there are
 
00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
more questions still to be asked to make
 
00:48:17.569 --> 00:48:17.579 align:start position:0%
sure that we're not duplicating efforts
 
00:48:17.579 --> 00:48:20.870 align:start position:0%
sure that we're not duplicating efforts
so

00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
that's it okay thank you questions for
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
oh the representative that
 
00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards raised demeanor
 
00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:44.270 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards raised demeanor
sure

00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
specifically I was wondering about
 
00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:47.450 align:start position:0%
specifically I was wondering about
um

00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:47.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards catching the math
 
00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
um issue which
 
00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
um makes sense to me so
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
Tony Williams can you help us with this
 
00:48:57.359 --> 00:49:04.609 align:start position:0%
Tony Williams can you help us with this
or

00:49:04.609 --> 00:49:04.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:06.660 align:start position:0%
there are two things you don't do on a
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
legislation like this you don't say a
 
00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
word that I'm not going to say although
 
00:49:12.589 --> 00:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
Summer Staff did use the word clean up I
 
00:49:14.329 --> 00:49:14.339 align:start position:0%
think um and the other one is definitely
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
making sure you contact all the right
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
people in advance and certainly
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
recognizing Edwards leadership um it
 
00:49:22.849 --> 00:49:22.859 align:start position:0%
needs to be applauded for the work that
 
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
he's done on behalf of New Hampshire
 
00:49:25.849 --> 00:49:25.859 align:start position:0%
citizens and also uh here at the
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
legislature with that said what I want
 
00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:29.220 align:start position:0%
to bring to your attention on sections
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
one and two of the bill but this body
 
00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
and I think it was part of my original
 
00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:35.220 align:start position:0%
testimony to the committee was actually
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
passed last session as part of HB 1661
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
originally it was in the department
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
requested bill which was Senate Bill 430
 
00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
but that bill got held up in the process
 
00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
and then eventually through the
 
00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:50.220 align:start position:0%
committee conference process it was uh
 
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
it was added in advance of the process
 
00:49:56.329 --> 00:49:56.339 align:start position:0%
to um HP 1661 so in terms of an
 
00:49:58.490 --> 00:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
articulation of the policy both the
 
00:49:59.930 --> 00:49:59.940 align:start position:0%
Senate and the house has already acted
 
00:50:02.329 --> 00:50:02.339 align:start position:0%
on the underlying policy relative to
 
00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
creating this fund for the opioid
 
00:50:07.790 --> 00:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
enjoyed treatment programs those that
 
00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:10.380 align:start position:0%
was already on the books all what was
 
00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
being attempted to be done with this is
 
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
reflected in the physical analysis of
 
00:50:16.849 --> 00:50:16.859 align:start position:0%
the bill was to clean up an incorrect
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
statutory reference originally it made
 
00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
reference back to the fund itself and
 
00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:25.380 align:start position:0%
the fees that are being collected are
 
00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:27.660 align:start position:0%
not in that same statute they're in the
 
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
controlled Drug Act and that is where
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
those fees are being collected so again
 
00:50:34.930 --> 00:50:34.940 align:start position:0%
it was correcting a incorrect
 
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
cross-reference to where those fees were
 
00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:38.700 align:start position:0%
located but the underlying policy was
 
00:50:41.089 --> 00:50:41.099 align:start position:0%
passed by the legislature this um this
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
past session in HP 1661. with that I
 
00:50:46.609 --> 00:50:46.619 align:start position:0%
always have to recognize that new eyes
 
00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:48.420 align:start position:0%
can look and have further conversations
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
but it is something that we weren't
 
00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:52.140 align:start position:0%
trying to do anything different than
 
00:50:53.809 --> 00:50:53.819 align:start position:0%
wasn't already passed by the legislature
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
so if I'm hearing you correctly that
 
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:08.700 align:start position:0%
explains the origin of the dedicated
 
00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:10.130 align:start position:0%
explains the origin of the dedicated
fund

00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:10.140 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:14.460 align:start position:0%
um whether or not we agree with it uh
 
00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:18.740 align:start position:0%
but the question about the math
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
is still unresolved and I was wondering
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
if anybody I think representative
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
Shapiro also asked this if anybody could
 
00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
speak to the issue of if you have one
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
client you pay uh eight dollars
 
00:51:37.609 --> 00:51:37.619 align:start position:0%
and if you have zero clients you pay a
 
00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and I'm actually
 
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
wondering why if you have no clients for
 
00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
an entire year you're paying a fee of a
 
00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in any case uh and I I
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
think clarification would be very
 
00:51:55.849 --> 00:51:55.859 align:start position:0%
helpful on that yeah so just so folks
 
00:51:57.890 --> 00:51:57.900 align:start position:0%
understand that the fee structure here
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
has been placed in in statute and I
 
00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
believe also adopted through
 
00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
administrative rules so what you're
 
00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:06.420 align:start position:0%
talking about is an existing law this is
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
not a new provision of law in terms of
 
00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
the funding mix should that be
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
re-examined again I leave that question
 
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
open for others to look at but what I
 
00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:17.220 align:start position:0%
could represent to the committee is that
 
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
um the sums of money we're looking at
 
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
are total fees collected range anywhere
 
00:52:23.089 --> 00:52:23.099 align:start position:0%
between the upper thirty thousand uh
 
00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:25.740 align:start position:0%
dollar range annually to around forty
 
00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:27.420 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars around Ball parking but
 
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
I can get you specific and also
 
00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:31.140 align:start position:0%
represent Edward specific uh fees from
 
00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:32.940 align:start position:0%
our financial managers around that we're
 
00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:34.260 align:start position:0%
not looking at a large sum of money but
 
00:52:36.049 --> 00:52:36.059 align:start position:0%
it isn't important to support the
 
00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
important efforts around opioid
 
00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:40.700 align:start position:0%
treatment prevention and the the the
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
identification of any issues are in
 
00:52:44.329 --> 00:52:44.339 align:start position:0%
existing law it's not anything we're
 
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
attempting to do with this legislation
 
00:52:49.849 --> 00:52:49.859 align:start position:0%
right I follow I get that I just I would
 
00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:51.180 align:start position:0%
be more
 
00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:53.569 align:start position:0%
be more
um

00:52:53.569 --> 00:52:53.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:56.809 --> 00:52:56.819 align:start position:0%
I would be happier in my mind if if it
 
00:52:59.210 --> 00:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
was explained to us with more details so
 
00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
we understand
 
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at understood like
 
00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:05.220 align:start position:0%
because I agree on the the words that we
 
00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:06.780 align:start position:0%
have here
 
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
do imply
 
00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:12.650 align:start position:0%
do imply
um

00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
an oddity and I certainly can get back
 
00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
to the committee with a further
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
explanation on the number of programs
 
00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
that we actually oversee how the
 
00:53:22.849 --> 00:53:22.859 align:start position:0%
breakdown Works in terms of each
 
00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
individual program and the payments that
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
they make to us and and once you get
 
00:53:28.609 --> 00:53:28.619 align:start position:0%
that information that data it may make
 
00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:30.420 align:start position:0%
more sense once you see it I can just
 
00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
give you the derivative which is the
 
00:53:35.809 --> 00:53:35.819 align:start position:0%
cumulative fees that we we do see from
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
these programs range anywhere between
 
00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
the upper thirty thousand to around
 
00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:42.780 align:start position:0%
forty thousand dollars uh in 2022 so our
 
00:53:44.569 --> 00:53:44.579 align:start position:0%
snapshot looking at about a three-year
 
00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:46.380 align:start position:0%
perspective retroactively but certainly
 
00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:48.180 align:start position:0%
we'll follow up with the committee uh
 
00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
and also with Edwards uh with more
 
00:53:53.089 --> 00:53:53.099 align:start position:0%
detail around that okay representative
 
00:53:55.609 --> 00:53:55.619 align:start position:0%
Nagel and then representative Seth King
 
00:53:58.250 --> 00:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
I kind of had my hand halfway up but I
 
00:53:59.870 --> 00:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
do want to ask the question this is
 
00:54:01.849 --> 00:54:01.859 align:start position:0%
really more of a policy issue but I'm
 
00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
like totally blurry-eyed now from moving
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
really reviewing a lot of policy
 
00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
statements about the tenure mental
 
00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:11.700 align:start position:0%
health program the
 
00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:14.700 align:start position:0%
um uh the drug abuse all the governor's
 
00:54:17.089 --> 00:54:17.099 align:start position:0%
um task forces on these things and one
 
00:54:18.890 --> 00:54:18.900 align:start position:0%
of the statements that's made over and
 
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
over and over again is about our
 
00:54:23.089 --> 00:54:23.099 align:start position:0%
deficiency in terms of medication
 
00:54:26.089 --> 00:54:26.099 align:start position:0%
assisted therapies access to methadone
 
00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:28.020 align:start position:0%
treatments and things like that and I'm
 
00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
really struggling with the concept of
 
00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
actually having these groups pay us
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
money when I think we are desperate and
 
00:54:35.569 --> 00:54:35.579 align:start position:0%
we should be paying other people money
 
00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
to subsidizing them to provide the
 
00:54:40.609 --> 00:54:40.619 align:start position:0%
service so I'm lost why we're even
 
00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:43.140 align:start position:0%
charging them at all
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
um that's a statement that's policy
 
00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:48.300 align:start position:0%
statement that's probably I know is not
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
reflected in this bill but since it was
 
00:54:51.589 --> 00:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
brought up I thought I should bring it
 
00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
up and chairman uh if I can just address
 
00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
briefly represent Nagel
 
00:54:58.130 --> 00:54:58.140 align:start position:0%
um that those have already been
 
00:54:59.870 --> 00:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
articulated by the legislature uh the
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
legislature you this body and the Senate
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
that body and the governor whoever
 
00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
signed off established that policy prior
 
00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:07.980 align:start position:0%
to us coming here today on the bill and
 
00:55:09.770 --> 00:55:09.780 align:start position:0%
certainly I think getting the data under
 
00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
understanding is going to be helpful uh
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
we certainly think supporting those
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
medication and treatment programs are
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
very very important as well and we also
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
think that supporting our efforts and
 
00:55:22.490 --> 00:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
our agency which was already passed last
 
00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
session in HB 1661 to allow that model
 
00:55:28.549 --> 00:55:28.559 align:start position:0%
to support our efforts to supporting
 
00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:29.940 align:start position:0%
those programs would be particularly
 
00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
helpful and all we're trying to do is
 
00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
correct the cross-reference to the
 
00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:35.460 align:start position:0%
correct funding mechanism in this
 
00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:36.670 align:start position:0%
correct funding mechanism in this
legislation

00:55:36.670 --> 00:55:36.680 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:39.420 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King thank you Mr
 
00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:42.300 align:start position:0%
chairman I hope I'm not speaking um out
 
00:55:44.030 --> 00:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
of line here but I think this makes
 
00:55:46.990 --> 00:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
perfect sense to me the thousand dollars
 
00:55:49.549 --> 00:55:49.559 align:start position:0%
every provider at some point wasn't a
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
provider and this is basically just a
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
startup fee it's like imagine joining a
 
00:55:57.530 --> 00:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
gym uh your startup fee might be 300 new
 
00:55:58.970 --> 00:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
and then it's thirty dollars a month
 
00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:00.900 align:start position:0%
after that but if you've been a member
 
00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:02.220 align:start position:0%
of the gym for the last 20 years you're
 
00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:03.900 align:start position:0%
just paying 30 a month you don't need to
 
00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
keep you don't ever have to pay that
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
three you were already kind of
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
grandfathered in so the thousand dollars
 
00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:11.220 align:start position:0%
is just a startup fee so that's how I
 
00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:13.380 align:start position:0%
understand it thank you thank you
 
00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:15.780 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro thank you Mr
 
00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:16.910 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro thank you Mr
chairman

00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:56:19.069 --> 00:56:19.079 align:start position:0%
um in regard to um representative
 
00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
Edwards last point about
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
um page four line 27.
 
00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:26.450 align:start position:0%
um page four line 27.
um

00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:26.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:28.250 --> 00:56:28.260 align:start position:0%
the report on Health Equity being
 
00:56:31.609 --> 00:56:31.619 align:start position:0%
changed to three every three years
 
00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
um is that a redundancy or is that a
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
requirement of some of receiving some
 
00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:39.180 align:start position:0%
kind of federal funds
 
00:56:41.329 --> 00:56:41.339 align:start position:0%
and it could still be over redundancy
 
00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:43.500 align:start position:0%
even if it is if I understood
 
00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
representative uh representative Edwards
 
00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
observations correctly and I'm going to
 
00:56:49.370 --> 00:56:49.380 align:start position:0%
look back at him and he can shake his
 
00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:50.940 align:start position:0%
head yes or no as I'm speaking that
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
would be helpful
 
00:56:54.770 --> 00:56:54.780 align:start position:0%
um that in the presentation by the
 
00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
department uh before division three
 
00:56:59.450 --> 00:56:59.460 align:start position:0%
house finance we did agency
 
00:57:01.490 --> 00:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
presentations that broke it down to
 
00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
particular either offices or boroughs
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
within our agency one of the briefings
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
would have likely involved our office of
 
00:57:10.609 --> 00:57:10.619 align:start position:0%
Health Equity and I think what
 
00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:12.540 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards has identified is
 
00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:15.300 align:start position:0%
an overlap between the mission and I'm I
 
00:57:16.730 --> 00:57:16.740 align:start position:0%
don't want to be too broad the mission
 
00:57:19.549 --> 00:57:19.559 align:start position:0%
of that entity within the department and
 
00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:22.140 align:start position:0%
then branching over to the work that Ms
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
Hernandez and her folks do Under The
 
00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:26.940 align:start position:0%
State Office of rural Health as an
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
agency we are always responsive to
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
looking at appropriate alignments and
 
00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:33.059 align:start position:0%
I'm not in a position to articulating
 
00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
anything because I'm not at that level
 
00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
represent Edwards to make that happen
 
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
others could perhaps but for example in
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
the the area of homelessness in Housing
 
00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
Services we recently transitioned that
 
00:57:48.589 --> 00:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
Bureau that was under our division for
 
00:57:51.049 --> 00:57:51.059 align:start position:0%
economic and housing stability which is
 
00:57:52.849 --> 00:57:52.859 align:start position:0%
now called the division of economic
 
00:57:54.349 --> 00:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
stability because we moved the housing
 
00:57:57.530 --> 00:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
from that program and that program was
 
00:57:59.569 --> 00:57:59.579 align:start position:0%
around other types of assistance and
 
00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
supports that we provide to people like
 
00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
the SNAP benefits and other kind of of
 
00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:06.900 align:start position:0%
assistance that we provide we moved it
 
00:58:08.809 --> 00:58:08.819 align:start position:0%
that program under homelessness and
 
00:58:12.109 --> 00:58:12.119 align:start position:0%
housing to the division for Behavioral
 
00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
Health and we did that because the
 
00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
population being served in Behavioral
 
00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:18.300 align:start position:0%
Health better aligned with the needs for
 
00:58:21.530 --> 00:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
housing because you can't you can't you
 
00:58:23.569 --> 00:58:23.579 align:start position:0%
know fully systemically treat people
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
unless during the process they have a
 
00:58:26.930 --> 00:58:26.940 align:start position:0%
place to live when they're going out the
 
00:58:28.370 --> 00:58:28.380 align:start position:0%
door you got to have something to
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
address coming in the door and something
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
coming out the door so our I do think
 
00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
that there is a receptiveness to looking
 
00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:35.940 align:start position:0%
at alignment issues and I think that
 
00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:37.740 align:start position:0%
that's what representative Edwards on a
 
00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:39.900 align:start position:0%
much higher level we were just asking
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
for a one year to three year change and
 
00:58:43.849 --> 00:58:43.859 align:start position:0%
not a complete realignment of the
 
00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:45.420 align:start position:0%
department but I do think I understood
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
what your observations were
 
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
close it's a question about potential
 
00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
redundancy and then aligning the
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
missions of the work so we're not
 
00:58:59.829 --> 00:58:59.839 align:start position:0%
funding the same thing twice
 
00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions and if Mr
 
00:59:05.569 --> 00:59:05.579 align:start position:0%
Hernandez she's actually going to give
 
00:59:06.890 --> 00:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
you the the correct answer to
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards question and I
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
didn't know if representative Edwards
 
00:59:11.569 --> 00:59:11.579 align:start position:0%
even wanted to be invited I'm happy to
 
00:59:14.089 --> 00:59:14.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:16.980 align:start position:0%
all right I just wanted to expound on
 
00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:17.870 align:start position:0%
all right I just wanted to expound on
that

00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
um that yes the State Office of rural
 
00:59:21.289 --> 00:59:21.299 align:start position:0%
Health under rural health and Primary
 
00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:22.980 align:start position:0%
Care in the state
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
um is established as the soar in statute
 
00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:29.460 align:start position:0%
since 2009 we're actually
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
um almost the soar is exclusively funded
 
00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
by hersa by a grant under under hersa so
 
00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:39.900 align:start position:0%
while this report is a statutory
 
00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:42.839 align:start position:0%
oh the health services and Health
 
00:59:44.569 --> 00:59:44.579 align:start position:0%
Resources and services Administration
 
00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:45.839 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
um so although this is a statutory
 
00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:50.220 align:start position:0%
requirement to provide this report
 
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
um it's just one of several activities
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
that is conducted under Federal funding
 
00:59:58.190 --> 00:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:59.569 --> 00:59:59.579 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:04.370 --> 01:00:04.380 align:start position:0%
so you know other questions
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
good thank you thank you
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
I have no one else signed up to testify
 
01:00:12.289 --> 01:00:12.299 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 127 does anyone else wish
 
01:00:14.569 --> 01:00:14.579 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:16.260 align:start position:0%
saying no one else I'm going to close
 
01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:18.900 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on Senate bill 127.
 
01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:22.140 align:start position:0%
thank you all for your testimony
 
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
and I am going to open the public
 
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate bill 200. and
 
01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
recognize the prime sponsor who is
 
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for the record I'm
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
Cindy Rosenwald I represents Senate
 
01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
District 13 which is most of Nashua and
 
01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:47.700 align:start position:0%
I'm very pleased to introduce Senate
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
Bill 200 which will open up another
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
means to make certain vaccines more
 
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
conveniently accessible and at lower
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
costs to Consumers it does so by
 
01:01:03.970 --> 01:01:03.980 align:start position:0%
allowing optometrists to administer
 
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
influenza kovid and shingles vaccines to
 
01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:10.270 align:start position:0%
influenza kovid and shingles vaccines to
adults

01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
adults
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
optometrists or doctoral Level Health
 
01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:15.660 align:start position:0%
Care providers who are highly
 
01:01:18.589 --> 01:01:18.599 align:start position:0%
experienced in sterile techniques they
 
01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
are represented here today and they can
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
explain why this bill is good idea from
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
their perspective I just say that we
 
01:01:31.549 --> 01:01:31.559 align:start position:0%
have allowed people to get vaccines in
 
01:01:35.049 --> 01:01:35.059 align:start position:0%
pharmacies from a variety of different
 
01:01:38.829 --> 01:01:38.839 align:start position:0%
licensing levels of Pharmacy
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
employees for 15 years it's worked
 
01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:46.140 align:start position:0%
really well it's less expensive for
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
people and it's very very convenient
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
so from my perspective consumers will
 
01:01:54.849 --> 01:01:54.859 align:start position:0%
save money on these three vaccines
 
01:01:58.970 --> 01:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
because just as at a pharmacy they won't
 
01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
need to pay a separate copay if they're
 
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
already at the optometrist office so if
 
01:02:07.789 --> 01:02:07.799 align:start position:0%
they went to their physician to get
 
01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
these vaccines they would have to pay a
 
01:02:10.079 --> 01:02:11.210 align:start position:0%
these vaccines they would have to pay a
copay

01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:11.220 align:start position:0%
copay
 
01:02:14.930 --> 01:02:14.940 align:start position:0%
and these three vaccines I think make a
 
01:02:16.030 --> 01:02:16.040 align:start position:0%
lot of sense
 
01:02:19.490 --> 01:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
influenza and covid are recommended for
 
01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:23.220 align:start position:0%
broad groups of adults and shingles is
 
01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
recommended for people over 50. also
 
01:02:31.390 --> 01:02:31.400 align:start position:0%
shingles is a disease that can have
 
01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
devastating effects on Vision so makes
 
01:02:38.349 --> 01:02:38.359 align:start position:0%
sense to me for optometrists
 
01:02:43.069 --> 01:02:43.079 align:start position:0%
to administer shingles vaccines we
 
01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
thought we had allowed optometrists to
 
01:02:49.549 --> 01:02:49.559 align:start position:0%
administer covid vaccines during the
 
01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:52.940 align:start position:0%
public health emergency but it turns out
 
01:02:57.049 --> 01:02:57.059 align:start position:0%
we will need to make a statutory change
 
01:03:00.289 --> 01:03:00.299 align:start position:0%
I hope the committee will look favorably
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
on this bill and I'm happy to answer
 
01:03:04.730 --> 01:03:04.740 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Senator Senator
 
01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and welcome back
 
01:03:09.839 --> 01:03:11.210 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and welcome back
Senator

01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:11.220 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:13.809 align:start position:0%
Senator
um yeah

01:03:13.809 --> 01:03:13.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:18.049 --> 01:03:18.059 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
about record keeping
 
01:03:25.609 --> 01:03:25.619 align:start position:0%
people have gotten used to
 
01:03:25.619 --> 01:03:26.390 align:start position:0%
people have gotten used to
um

01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
medical records being kept at Physician
 
01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
Offices or primary care provider offices
 
01:03:34.609 --> 01:03:34.619 align:start position:0%
they're also now used to record keeping
 
01:03:37.030 --> 01:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
at pharmacies
 
01:03:41.530 --> 01:03:41.540 align:start position:0%
an initial glance of that is is that
 
01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:46.140 align:start position:0%
although although the the shingles
 
01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
um connection seems pretty intuitive to
 
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
me the other two are kind of
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
counter-intuitive Could you
 
01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
um talk a little bit about record
 
01:03:59.210 --> 01:03:59.220 align:start position:0%
keeping and how people as the places
 
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
that you can get
 
01:04:03.789 --> 01:04:03.799 align:start position:0%
uh vaccinated
 
01:04:08.829 --> 01:04:08.839 align:start position:0%
become more and more diffuse how people
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
appropriately access their records to
 
01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
know when they need to get shots and
 
01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
when uh they're overdue or when they
 
01:04:21.049 --> 01:04:21.059 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be getting shots
 
01:04:21.059 --> 01:04:22.549 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be getting shots
well

01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:04:26.569 --> 01:04:26.579 align:start position:0%
if you look at them starting on page one
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
of the Bell line 29.
 
01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
this would require the optometrist to
 
01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
check the vaccine okay registry ahead of
 
01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:41.700 align:start position:0%
time and then record
 
01:04:43.450 --> 01:04:43.460 align:start position:0%
the vaccine
 
01:04:45.890 --> 01:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
Administration and the registry unless
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
the individual opt-out but if your
 
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
question is how does just random me know
 
01:04:57.230 --> 01:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
that I need a shingles vaccine I think
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's helpful when a provider says have
 
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
you had a shingles vaccine and I
 
01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
probably would say I
 
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
can't remember but they would be able to
 
01:05:16.270 --> 01:05:16.280 align:start position:0%
check the vaccine registry unless I had
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
opted out okay they would be able to say
 
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
we've already had it you're all set or
 
01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:25.140 align:start position:0%
you haven't had it yeah you're over 50.
 
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
you should have it because shingles can
 
01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
make you go blind right and I well I I
 
01:05:34.849 --> 01:05:34.859 align:start position:0%
just thank you for the question and
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
apologize for not having done my
 
01:05:38.530 --> 01:05:38.540 align:start position:0%
homework a little better
 
01:05:41.030 --> 01:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
not necessary representative Shapiro
 
01:05:43.309 --> 01:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:05:45.530 --> 01:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
taking this question would you envision
 
01:05:47.450 --> 01:05:47.460 align:start position:0%
maybe this would be better directed
 
01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:48.410 align:start position:0%
maybe this would be better directed
towards

01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
towards
 
01:05:50.270 --> 01:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
um optometrists but would you envision
 
01:05:52.849 --> 01:05:52.859 align:start position:0%
that this being a kind of a sideline for
 
01:05:54.530 --> 01:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
optometrists where there would be
 
01:05:56.990 --> 01:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
advertising that these vaccines were
 
01:05:59.930 --> 01:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
available at optometrist's office or do
 
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
you envision it more as in the course of
 
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
getting your eyes checked that you would
 
01:06:08.690 --> 01:06:08.700 align:start position:0%
be asked about and reminded that these
 
01:06:11.089 --> 01:06:11.099 align:start position:0%
are good things to do and that they're
 
01:06:13.730 --> 01:06:13.740 align:start position:0%
available at that very office
 
01:06:16.450 --> 01:06:16.460 align:start position:0%
that's a really interesting question
 
01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:19.940 align:start position:0%
personally I think not that many
 
01:06:24.529 --> 01:06:24.539 align:start position:0%
optometrists would do it because
 
01:06:26.690 --> 01:06:26.700 align:start position:0%
um there's record keeping
 
01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
you for covid vaccines anyway you need
 
01:06:32.809 --> 01:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
that super cold storage
 
01:06:32.819 --> 01:06:33.490 align:start position:0%
that super cold storage
um

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:33.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:37.069 --> 01:06:37.079 align:start position:0%
I don't know that very many of them
 
01:06:39.890 --> 01:06:39.900 align:start position:0%
would make a business decision that what
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
they would get reimbursed was worth the
 
01:06:45.049 --> 01:06:45.059 align:start position:0%
time and expense
 
01:06:48.349 --> 01:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
of doing it so I think maybe some very
 
01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
large practices might decide and I think
 
01:06:54.770 --> 01:06:54.780 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear from from one of
 
01:06:58.510 --> 01:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
them after me that this is a service
 
01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:01.799 align:start position:0%
that if they have if they put eye drops
 
01:07:04.970 --> 01:07:04.980 align:start position:0%
in somebody's eye and then the patient
 
01:07:08.450 --> 01:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
is sitting around for 15 or 20 minutes
 
01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
that it would be an opportunity while
 
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
they're in the office to have that
 
01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:14.510 align:start position:0%
they're in the office to have that
conversation

01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:07:18.349 --> 01:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
and then do this other service I don't
 
01:07:22.609 --> 01:07:22.619 align:start position:0%
think it would be broadly adopted I
 
01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:25.980 align:start position:0%
might be wrong but just looking at
 
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
that the effort and the expense that
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
goes into stocking these things and the
 
01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
paperwork I'd be surprised if that many
 
01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:37.329 align:start position:0%
paperwork I'd be surprised if that many
practices

01:07:37.329 --> 01:07:37.339 align:start position:0%
practices
 
01:07:40.010 --> 01:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
decided it was worth it we do have
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
someone signed up from the New Hampshire
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
Optometric Association we'll be
 
01:07:45.049 --> 01:07:45.059 align:start position:0%
testifying so
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
but for sure go ahead I would just as
 
01:07:51.230 --> 01:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
someone who just uh a week ago or so got
 
01:07:53.210 --> 01:07:53.220 align:start position:0%
my shingles vaccine
 
01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
um you're so young
 
01:07:59.150 --> 01:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank you and um and having put it off
 
01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
for many many years so I'm not that
 
01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
young and in part that it just became
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
free but also that um you know they
 
01:08:09.049 --> 01:08:09.059 align:start position:0%
didn't have it at my doctor's office for
 
01:08:11.329 --> 01:08:11.339 align:start position:0%
whatever reason so
 
01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:13.799 align:start position:0%
um I put it off for
 
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
decades I guess and um had I been
 
01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
someplace where someone said oh if you
 
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
want that we can just give it to you I
 
01:08:23.269 --> 01:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
probably would have done it a long time
 
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
ago and um it would have been safer
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
well I'm glad you didn't get shingles in
 
01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
the meantime
 
01:08:35.150 --> 01:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
another question just representative
 
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
King thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
senator for taking questions
 
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm Reed I don't have the full RSA
 
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
that's being amended in front of me I
 
01:08:45.050 --> 01:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
apologize but um
 
01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
um I'm reading this year and I see that
 
01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:51.179 align:start position:0%
they can currently apply topicals and
 
01:08:55.789 --> 01:08:55.799 align:start position:0%
oral medications are there currently any
 
01:08:59.150 --> 01:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
um vaccines that optometrists can can
 
01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
currently you know use subcutaneous
 
01:09:05.329 --> 01:09:05.339 align:start position:0%
injections for like or is or is this
 
01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:06.900 align:start position:0%
going to be opening it up to a whole new
 
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
section of things that they can do thank
 
01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
you I think probably
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
one of the optometrists could better
 
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
answer that question I'm going to say I
 
01:09:18.669 --> 01:09:18.679 align:start position:0%
think they can't but
 
01:09:21.530 --> 01:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to give you a better
 
01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:24.410 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to give you a better
response

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
response
 
01:09:26.269 --> 01:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Nagel
 
01:09:29.209 --> 01:09:29.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Senator
 
01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
um to me there's three important
 
01:09:33.289 --> 01:09:33.299 align:start position:0%
questions involved in this bill
 
01:09:34.729 --> 01:09:34.739 align:start position:0%
um the first is
 
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
and you don't need to answer the third
 
01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
one's the one that's most important but
 
01:09:39.709 --> 01:09:39.719 align:start position:0%
like why
 
01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
uh why are we doing this secondly are
 
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
they qualified but thirdly which is most
 
01:09:45.530 --> 01:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
important to me from a public health
 
01:09:47.689 --> 01:09:47.699 align:start position:0%
point of view obviously access is
 
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
important I think we did demonstrate we
 
01:09:52.450 --> 01:09:52.460 align:start position:0%
were pretty accessible to a broad
 
01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
pandemic is this absolutely necessary to
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
increase success accessibility and is
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:06.729 --> 01:10:06.739 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
I think you'll hear
 
01:10:15.070 --> 01:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
from some of these optometrists that
 
01:10:17.209 --> 01:10:17.219 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
a provider that somebody sees even when
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
I hate to say this to you they don't go
 
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
see their physician so sometimes they're
 
01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
the only provider that someone sees and
 
01:10:34.570 --> 01:10:34.580 align:start position:0%
let me just say that in my own family my
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
53 year old nephew
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
hadn't seen a doctor in 10 or 15 years
 
01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
but does regularly see the optometrist
 
01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:49.140 align:start position:0%
because his
 
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
his vision needs change so
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
it I know already one person who only
 
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
um let's let me also just try to answer
 
01:11:08.090 --> 01:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
your other question about are they the
 
01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:17.689 --> 01:11:17.699 align:start position:0%
that allows pharmacies to
 
01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
um give a way bigger range of vaccines
 
01:11:27.970 --> 01:11:27.980 align:start position:0%
we allow pharmacy technicians Pharmacy
 
01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
interns not just pharmacists so not just
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
the doctoral level
 
01:11:36.890 --> 01:11:36.900 align:start position:0%
person but people under their
 
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
supervision who I think have a lot less
 
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
education and experience than a doctoral
 
01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:47.050 align:start position:0%
education and experience than a doctoral
level

01:11:47.050 --> 01:11:47.060 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:51.900 align:start position:0%
optometrist who is well versed in in
 
01:11:53.689 --> 01:11:53.699 align:start position:0%
sterile technique
 
01:11:56.450 --> 01:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
so I think they're capable
 
01:11:59.390 --> 01:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
but wonderful answers what do I know
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions uh yes
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative Palazzo thank you Mr
 
01:12:07.850 --> 01:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:12:10.729 --> 01:12:10.739 align:start position:0%
questions Senator uh what was the logic
 
01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
uh to footage limitations in this bill
 
01:12:16.970 --> 01:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
about 18 years old so
 
01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:19.610 align:start position:0%
about 18 years old so
um

01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
we allow pharmacies and have for 15
 
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
years to give a broad range of
 
01:12:31.850 --> 01:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
vaccinations only to adults
 
01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:33.110 align:start position:0%
vaccinations only to adults
um

01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
when I
 
01:12:39.290 --> 01:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
asked the state's chief medical officer
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
Dr Ballard
 
01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
about the other bill then I think you
 
01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
heard the RSV vaccine
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
he said we want to make sure that
 
01:12:53.330 --> 01:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
children are still
 
01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
getting their vaccinations within their
 
01:12:59.810 --> 01:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
Pediatric Care settings because there's
 
01:13:01.729 --> 01:13:01.739 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
01:13:01.739 --> 01:13:03.110 align:start position:0%
a lot of
other

01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:04.189 align:start position:0%
other
care

01:13:04.189 --> 01:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
and counseling and thought
 
01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:10.980 align:start position:0%
that goes into it so
 
01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:11.750 align:start position:0%
that goes into it so
um

01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:13.430 align:start position:0%
um
there's

01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:15.950 align:start position:0%
there's
not

01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
thinking among the medical
 
01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
establishment of the state that it's a
 
01:13:26.090 --> 01:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
good idea for children and we have not
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
allowed children to receive vaccines in
 
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
pharmacies over the 15 years so this is
 
01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.430 align:start position:0%
pharmacies over the 15 years so this is
consistent

01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
01:13:40.970 --> 01:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
with that statute and I personally think
 
01:13:43.130 --> 01:13:43.140 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you Mr
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you again for taking
 
01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
another one of my questions as the
 
01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
crafter of the bill why did you only
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
include those three vaccines why not
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
just open it up to everything thank you
 
01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
okay that's a great question
 
01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
first of all we don't
 
01:14:05.630 --> 01:14:05.640 align:start position:0%
open it up to everything in pharmacies
 
01:14:08.810 --> 01:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
um and this question has come up because
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
most states do allow pharmacies to
 
01:14:16.610 --> 01:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
administer any vaccine that's authorized
 
01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:20.699 align:start position:0%
by the FDA we don't here's why I think
 
01:14:23.570 --> 01:14:23.580 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate
 
01:14:26.209 --> 01:14:26.219 align:start position:0%
there are some vaccines that are given
 
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
to very to smaller groups of adults
 
01:14:33.649 --> 01:14:33.659 align:start position:0%
based on their specific
 
01:14:39.770 --> 01:14:39.780 align:start position:0%
travel plans or their social habits or
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
their medical history
 
01:14:46.850 --> 01:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
um and so I think if we're going to open
 
01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:47.990 align:start position:0%
um and so I think if we're going to open
up

01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:14:52.450 --> 01:14:52.460 align:start position:0%
all vaccines I think it's going to
 
01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
result in some people getting
 
01:14:58.370 --> 01:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
vaccinations that they really don't need
 
01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:01.340 align:start position:0%
and it's going to add expense
 
01:15:04.669 --> 01:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
unnecessary expense to the Health Care
 
01:15:07.850 --> 01:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
System overall because these vaccines
 
01:15:10.910 --> 01:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
you might get them without a copay
 
01:15:13.370 --> 01:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
but there's cost
 
01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
to your health insurer so so I think the
 
01:15:25.870 --> 01:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
I'm an incremental kind of a gal
 
01:15:33.970 --> 01:15:33.980 align:start position:0%
and this is a new scope of practice for
 
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
optometrists these are three vaccines
 
01:15:39.530 --> 01:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
that as as I said are given to Broad
 
01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:40.850 align:start position:0%
that as as I said are given to Broad
groups

01:15:40.850 --> 01:15:40.860 align:start position:0%
groups
 
01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
of people you don't need
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
you no need to know if the person is
 
01:15:50.570 --> 01:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
traveling to you know this part of
 
01:15:54.890 --> 01:15:54.900 align:start position:0%
Panama not that part of Panama or
 
01:15:58.610 --> 01:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
whether they're sexual habits make them
 
01:16:01.610 --> 01:16:01.620 align:start position:0%
someone who should get a monkey box
 
01:16:04.850 --> 01:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
vaccine it's just basically oh you're an
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
adult have you had your flu shot this
 
01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
year no one in
 
01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
so so that's why I just think it's
 
01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:14.570 align:start position:0%
so so that's why I just think it's
prudent

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:14.580 align:start position:0%
prudent
 
01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:23.090 --> 01:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
say no other questions okay thank you so
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
much I'm sorry I can't stay no that's
 
01:16:36.290 --> 01:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Dr Angelique

01:16:51.290 --> 01:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
thank you to Senator Rosenwald for her

time and for answering all of those
 
01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:53.930 align:start position:0%
time and for answering all of those
questions

01:16:53.930 --> 01:16:53.940 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:16:56.450 --> 01:16:56.460 align:start position:0%
um I have some thoughts and words I'd
 
01:16:57.709 --> 01:16:57.719 align:start position:0%
like to share but then I do invite you
 
01:16:59.810 --> 01:16:59.820 align:start position:0%
if any of those questions were not fully
 
01:17:01.790 --> 01:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
addressed by her or any others please
 
01:17:03.890 --> 01:17:03.900 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to answer those
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
um my name is Dr Angelique Sawyer I am a
 
01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire native and a practicing
 
01:17:09.770 --> 01:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
doctor of Optometry in our rural North
 
01:17:11.689 --> 01:17:11.699 align:start position:0%
Country with offices in both North
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
Conway and Berlin New Hampshire
 
01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:15.780 align:start position:0%
I thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
01:17:17.450 --> 01:17:17.460 align:start position:0%
to you today in support of Senate Bill
 
01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:19.980 align:start position:0%
200 a bill that seeks to accomplish two
 
01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
goals to authorize Doctors of Optometry
 
01:17:24.530 --> 01:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
to administer vaccines and to allow
 
01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:25.980 align:start position:0%
Doctors of Optometry to prescribe
 
01:17:27.290 --> 01:17:27.300 align:start position:0%
medications for the treatment of the
 
01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
lacrimal gland
 
01:17:30.649 --> 01:17:30.659 align:start position:0%
first some background Doctors of
 
01:17:32.209 --> 01:17:32.219 align:start position:0%
Optometry do not simply prescribe
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
glasses and contact lenses to correct
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
vision as was the case well over 50
 
01:17:37.310 --> 01:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
since the 1970s Doctors of Optometry
 
01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
have been prescribing medication for the
 
01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
treatment of disease
 
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
we are recognized federally by CMS as
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
independent Physicians
 
01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
while our focus is on treatment of the
 
01:17:50.890 --> 01:17:50.900 align:start position:0%
eye and visual system we understand
 
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
assess and educate our patients on how
 
01:17:56.689 --> 01:17:56.699 align:start position:0%
the entire body impacts their Eye Health
 
01:17:58.430 --> 01:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
all day long I discussed with my
 
01:18:00.229 --> 01:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
patients not only their diabetes but
 
01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
their rheumatoid arthritis their thyroid
 
01:18:04.189 --> 01:18:04.199 align:start position:0%
disease their shingles and how those
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
conditions impact their eyes and their
 
01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:07.189 align:start position:0%
conditions impact their eyes and their
vision

01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
vision
 
01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:09.060 align:start position:0%
next I'll speak briefly about the
 
01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:10.860 align:start position:0%
lacrimal gland restriction that this
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
bill would address since 1993 Doctors of
 
01:18:15.169 --> 01:18:15.179 align:start position:0%
Optometry in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
have been able to prescribe oral
 
01:18:19.010 --> 01:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
medications for the treatment of all
 
01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
anterior structures of the eye with the
 
01:18:23.390 --> 01:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
exception of the lacrimal gland the
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
lacrimal gland is located in the upper
 
01:18:27.169 --> 01:18:27.179 align:start position:0%
outer corner of the orbit produces the
 
01:18:29.930 --> 01:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
watery layer of the tears if it becomes
 
01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
inflamed and if it's due to an
 
01:18:33.290 --> 01:18:33.300 align:start position:0%
infectious cause that infection can
 
01:18:35.630 --> 01:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
spread leading to something that's
 
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
called orbital cellulitis that can be
 
01:18:40.450 --> 01:18:40.460 align:start position:0%
vision and life-threatening
 
01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
we are able to treat orbital orbital
 
01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
cellulitis but we are not currently
 
01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
allowed to treat the dacrio adenitis
 
01:18:49.729 --> 01:18:49.739 align:start position:0%
that then may lead to that
 
01:18:53.450 --> 01:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
um we have for uh for decades Doctors of
 
01:18:55.250 --> 01:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
Optometry have been trained in the
 
01:18:56.990 --> 01:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
diagnosis and treatment of lacrimal
 
01:18:59.149 --> 01:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
gland infections by accredited colleges
 
01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
of Optometry and in fact as I said we
 
01:19:04.189 --> 01:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
can treat the the complications of but
 
01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
not the precursors to prevent that
 
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
complication in these situations a delay
 
01:19:11.149 --> 01:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
in treatment while referring to an
 
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
ophthalmologist is critical and um and
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
unnecessary when we have the training
 
01:19:18.890 --> 01:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
and um uh and the ability to treat this
 
01:19:20.810 --> 01:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
uh before more serious complications
 
01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:21.890 align:start position:0%
uh before more serious complications
develop

01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:21.900 align:start position:0%
develop
 
01:19:24.290 --> 01:19:24.300 align:start position:0%
the second aspect of this bill is what
 
01:19:26.090 --> 01:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
we've been talking primarily about is
 
01:19:28.610 --> 01:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
the administering of the vaccinations
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
um during the height of the covid-19
 
01:19:31.610 --> 01:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
pandemic when the governor issued
 
01:19:33.649 --> 01:19:33.659 align:start position:0%
emergency orders to address the
 
01:19:35.090 --> 01:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
immediate need for additional medical
 
01:19:37.729 --> 01:19:37.739 align:start position:0%
trained Personnel to administer covid-19
 
01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
vaccines Doctors of Optometry could not
 
01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:42.300 align:start position:0%
be included because of our outdated
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
statute which strictly prohibited this
 
01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
an independent doctorate level health
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
care provider was refused from providing
 
01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
this aspect of care while individuals
 
01:19:53.689 --> 01:19:53.699 align:start position:0%
with far less training were permitted
 
01:19:56.030 --> 01:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
including medical assistance licensed
 
01:19:58.430 --> 01:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners dental hygienists
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
and pharmacy technicians
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire if I have a high school
 
01:20:04.189 --> 01:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
diploma or a GED I can administer
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
vaccines but if I've gone on to have
 
01:20:08.630 --> 01:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
four years of college education and four
 
01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
years of doctorate Level Training and
 
01:20:12.530 --> 01:20:12.540 align:start position:0%
Optometry I'm now restricted from being
 
01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
able to provide that care
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is not about doctors about
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
palmettry feeling left out during the
 
01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic nor is it an opportunity for
 
01:20:23.209 --> 01:20:23.219 align:start position:0%
generating Revenue as some may suggest
 
01:20:25.370 --> 01:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
this bill is about removing Antiquated
 
01:20:27.530 --> 01:20:27.540 align:start position:0%
restrictions in order to allow Doctors
 
01:20:29.570 --> 01:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
of Optometry to use their training to
 
01:20:31.490 --> 01:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
provide better quality and greater
 
01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
access to care for our patients
 
01:20:36.410 --> 01:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
we are We Are The Eye Care the primary
 
01:20:38.689 --> 01:20:38.699 align:start position:0%
care provider for the eye we have many
 
01:20:40.250 --> 01:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
patients who are in exam chairs more
 
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
often than in their Primary Care
 
01:20:43.310 --> 01:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
provider's office
 
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
access to care is not just about
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
geographic location and travel distances
 
01:20:48.770 --> 01:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
but also about patient convenience
 
01:20:50.810 --> 01:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
patients who may be interested in
 
01:20:52.189 --> 01:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
receiving a vaccine while in a
 
01:20:53.930 --> 01:20:53.940 align:start position:0%
provider's office may not always take
 
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
the extra steps to make an appointment
 
01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
and travel elsewhere to receive that
 
01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.310 align:start position:0%
and travel elsewhere to receive that
vaccine

01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
01:20:59.689 --> 01:20:59.699 align:start position:0%
the truth is that most Doctors of
 
01:21:01.130 --> 01:21:01.140 align:start position:0%
Optometry are not planning to offer
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines in their offices at this time
 
01:21:04.850 --> 01:21:04.860 align:start position:0%
but the landscape of Health Care is
 
01:21:06.770 --> 01:21:06.780 align:start position:0%
changing and provider shortages are
 
01:21:09.169 --> 01:21:09.179 align:start position:0%
increasing Doctors of Optometry should
 
01:21:10.850 --> 01:21:10.860 align:start position:0%

this bill specifies just as with all

other medical professionals who
 
01:21:19.669 --> 01:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
vaccinate that Doctors of Optometry will
 
01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
be required to fulfill the appropriate
 
01:21:23.630 --> 01:21:23.640 align:start position:0%

01:21:26.990 --> 01:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
training Administration safety reporting
 
01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
and Adverse Events
 
01:21:30.590 --> 01:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time for serving our
 
01:21:31.729 --> 01:21:31.739 align:start position:0%
patients and the citizens of New
 
01:21:33.290 --> 01:21:33.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I ask that you please support
 
01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 200 I'm happy to answer any
 
01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:36.350 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 200 I'm happy to answer any
questions

01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative Shapiro thank you Mr
 
01:21:42.649 --> 01:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
chairman um I have two questions one is
 
01:21:42.659 --> 01:21:43.310 align:start position:0%
chairman um I have two questions one is
um

01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:47.330 --> 01:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
why not include the pneumococcal vaccine
 
01:21:49.850 --> 01:21:49.860 align:start position:0%
which seems like a I don't really know
 
01:21:51.530 --> 01:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
anything about vaccines but it seems
 
01:21:54.530 --> 01:21:54.540 align:start position:0%
like a seasonal vaccine like like the
 
01:21:57.530 --> 01:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
flu vaccine that's my first question and
 
01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
second question is how well equipped are
 
01:22:05.090 --> 01:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
not the doctorate level
 
01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:05.870 align:start position:0%
not the doctorate level
um

01:22:05.870 --> 01:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:08.270 --> 01:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
not the doctorate level optometrists but
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
your office is equipped to deal with
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
immediate severe side effects should
 
01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
those occur
 
01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:16.370 align:start position:0%
those occur
absolutely

01:22:16.370 --> 01:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:22:19.790 --> 01:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
um so first in regards to the vaccines
 
01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:21.780 align:start position:0%
um again it is similar to what you know
 
01:22:24.290 --> 01:22:24.300 align:start position:0%
Dr Rosenwald said starting incrementally
 
01:22:28.250 --> 01:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
um these are ones that uh we so
 
01:22:31.010 --> 01:22:31.020 align:start position:0%
frequently and wide population range and
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
particularly in the case of shingles
 
01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing the outcomes of it um
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
on a frequent basis we are certainly
 
01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
open to including additional vaccines in
 
01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
the future just as
 
01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
um as she indicated even Pharmacy is
 
01:22:47.330 --> 01:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
restricted as to which ones they they
 
01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:49.490 align:start position:0%
restricted as to which ones they they
provide

01:22:49.490 --> 01:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:22:54.530 --> 01:22:54.540 align:start position:0%
um as for training in the office our
 
01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
we would not have other providers in our
 
01:22:58.490 --> 01:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
office that would be administering the
 
01:23:01.430 --> 01:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine that would be done by the doctor
 
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
of Optometry however we do train our
 
01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
staff on all emergency situations we
 
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
offer CPR training to all of our staff
 
01:23:14.689 --> 01:23:14.699 align:start position:0%
um we there we have um you know uh
 
01:23:18.350 --> 01:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
crash kits not not crash car but we have
 
01:23:20.030 --> 01:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
um medications throughout the office we
 
01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
have um smelling salts they're all
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
prepared for if a patient is is you know
 
01:23:24.719 --> 01:23:25.430 align:start position:0%
prepared for if a patient is is you know
um

01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:28.610 --> 01:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
uh having syncope fainting the proper
 
01:23:30.290 --> 01:23:30.300 align:start position:0%
way to respond to that patient to get
 
01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
them in a safe situation and to have the
 
01:23:33.530 --> 01:23:33.540 align:start position:0%
doctor of Optometry immediately
 
01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:36.410 align:start position:0%
doctor of Optometry immediately
available

01:23:36.410 --> 01:23:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:39.649 --> 01:23:39.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:42.410 --> 01:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you Mr
 
01:23:43.490 --> 01:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:23:46.130 --> 01:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
question uh my question I guess in this
 
01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
sense uh refers back to representative
 
01:23:50.630 --> 01:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
Nagel's question is why now
 
01:23:52.669 --> 01:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
um right now I understand that we have
 
01:23:55.490 --> 01:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
about 98 percent coverage for vaccine
 
01:23:58.130 --> 01:23:58.140 align:start position:0%
access uh for everybody in the state of
 
01:24:00.649 --> 01:24:00.659 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire within 30 minutes or a 30
 
01:24:02.649 --> 01:24:02.659 align:start position:0%
minute drive from their home
 
01:24:06.050 --> 01:24:06.060 align:start position:0%
the pandemic has the emergency will be
 
01:24:07.970 --> 01:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
lifted in May but also was told we were
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
told yesterday that for all intents and
 
01:24:12.290 --> 01:24:12.300 align:start position:0%
purpose it's over at this point in time
 
01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:15.060 align:start position:0%
the reason I asked that question is I
 
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
think sometimes patients get confused as
 
01:24:19.130 --> 01:24:19.140 align:start position:0%
to what vaccines they've had how many
 
01:24:20.330 --> 01:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
they've had the various types of
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
vaccines the vaccinations they have so
 
01:24:24.890 --> 01:24:24.900 align:start position:0%
my question is why now why wasn't this
 
01:24:27.050 --> 01:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
done and introduced two years ago at the
 
01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
peak of the pandemic
 
01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
um and as you may know that there are
 
01:24:33.530 --> 01:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
multiple vaccines that are given with
 
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
covet you know there's a bivalent there
 
01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
was the initial you know that is both
 
01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
modern there's Pfizer
 
01:24:41.689 --> 01:24:41.699 align:start position:0%
and my concern is that in the bill it
 
01:24:44.209 --> 01:24:44.219 align:start position:0%
says that if a patient
 
01:24:46.970 --> 01:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
um basically
 
01:24:49.070 --> 01:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
when designated by the patient it's it's
 
01:24:52.610 --> 01:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
allowed the primary care is notified of
 
01:24:55.370 --> 01:24:55.380 align:start position:0%
getting a vaccine so my my concern also
 
01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:56.510 align:start position:0%
getting a vaccine so my my concern also
is

01:24:56.510 --> 01:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:24:59.390 --> 01:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
that the um that the patient if they
 
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
have many areas many ear Avenues to get
 
01:25:04.669 --> 01:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
these vaccines and they're not sure
 
01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
which ones they got which one was a
 
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
bivalent which one was Modern versus
 
01:25:12.770 --> 01:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
Pfizer versus JJ whomever the record
 
01:25:15.290 --> 01:25:15.300 align:start position:0%
keeping in the accountability to the
 
01:25:16.970 --> 01:25:16.980 align:start position:0%
primary care I think sometimes can be
 
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
potentially diluted and I'm just
 
01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:21.659 align:start position:0%
concerned about them getting vaccines at
 
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
multiple different sites
 
01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.729 align:start position:0%
multiple different sites
understandable

01:25:25.729 --> 01:25:25.739 align:start position:0%
understandable
 
01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
um we would follow the same recording
 
01:25:31.610 --> 01:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
reporting guidelines as with
 
01:25:34.610 --> 01:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
um pharmacies we already probably to an
 
01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
even greater extent do record sharing
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
with primary care offices we are very
 
01:25:40.910 --> 01:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
frequently sending reports back and
 
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
forth when I'm beginning a topical
 
01:25:44.630 --> 01:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
treatment that may interact with
 
01:25:47.090 --> 01:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
somebody's other medications I'm making
 
01:25:48.770 --> 01:25:48.780 align:start position:0%
sure that their provider knows new
 
01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
medications that are that are being
 
01:25:52.130 --> 01:25:52.140 align:start position:0%
added to them
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
um I would not treat a patient if I do
 
01:25:56.450 --> 01:25:56.460 align:start position:0%
not have access to registry information
 
01:25:59.450 --> 01:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
or their health care records and know
 
01:26:01.070 --> 01:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
whether that is appropriate for them
 
01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
that is part of the training and part of
 
01:26:05.090 --> 01:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
the you know indication as to whether we
 
01:26:06.050 --> 01:26:06.060 align:start position:0%
offer these and there are some
 
01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
optometrists who may choose not to and
 
01:26:11.090 --> 01:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
there are some optometrists who who uh
 
01:26:12.649 --> 01:26:12.659 align:start position:0%
won't go through the training to be able
 
01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
to do this but particularly where I'm
 
01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:16.790 align:start position:0%
to do this but particularly where I'm
located

01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
located
 
01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
um 30 minutes is very far for somebody
 
01:26:21.410 --> 01:26:21.420 align:start position:0%
to get to a provider many Primary Care
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
Providers uh are not available we have a
 
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
shortage in our area we have primary
 
01:26:30.110 --> 01:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
care provider offices that have very
 
01:26:33.709 --> 01:26:33.719 align:start position:0%
long wait lists to get in and so um this
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
is about being able to provide access
 
01:26:38.209 --> 01:26:38.219 align:start position:0%
when we have the patients in front of us
 
01:26:40.669 --> 01:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
this is about removing a restriction
 
01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
that prevented us from being able to be
 
01:26:45.890 --> 01:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
included even when there was an
 
01:26:48.169 --> 01:26:48.179 align:start position:0%
emergency order and
 
01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
we can't allow for just an emergency
 
01:26:53.689 --> 01:26:53.699 align:start position:0%
order to address this in the future if
 
01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
something were to come up this needs to
 
01:26:57.830 --> 01:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
be fixed at this level so that when
 
01:26:59.870 --> 01:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
things come up we're prepared to to
 
01:27:03.169 --> 01:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
address that well thank you um you
 
01:27:06.830 --> 01:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you do offer staff CPR
 
01:27:09.890 --> 01:27:09.900 align:start position:0%
training yes is it mandated it is not at
 
01:27:11.570 --> 01:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
the staff level for optometrists it is
 
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
for Doctors of Optometry it is yes it is
 
01:27:15.890 --> 01:27:15.900 align:start position:0%
mandated for you to have CPR yes you
 
01:27:18.709 --> 01:27:18.719 align:start position:0%
know okay and
 
01:27:21.649 --> 01:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
how often how often does a patient come
 
01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
into your office into an optometrist
 
01:27:25.370 --> 01:27:25.380 align:start position:0%
because again it's foreign to me I
 
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
usually think of the CVS a pharmacist
 
01:27:29.390 --> 01:27:29.400 align:start position:0%
the hospital the primary care how often
 
01:27:30.530 --> 01:27:30.540 align:start position:0%
does a patient come into an
 
01:27:32.090 --> 01:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
optometrist's office and say I would
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
like the coveted vaccine or the um the
 
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
flu vaccine or the shingles vaccine well
 
01:27:40.610 --> 01:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
well right now never because they do not
 
01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
they're not aware that we they're we're
 
01:27:44.689 --> 01:27:44.699 align:start position:0%
not allowed to offer it
 
01:27:46.490 --> 01:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
um we don't advertise that to the
 
01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
question that was asked earlier I don't
 
01:27:49.850 --> 01:27:49.860 align:start position:0%
think that that is going to be something
 
01:27:52.370 --> 01:27:52.380 align:start position:0%
that we're promoting hey come here to
 
01:27:53.810 --> 01:27:53.820 align:start position:0%
get your vaccine
 
01:27:55.250 --> 01:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
um there are places where people are
 
01:27:57.290 --> 01:27:57.300 align:start position:0%
seeking out their vaccines that they can
 
01:27:59.270 --> 01:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
have that available to them if they are
 
01:28:01.250 --> 01:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
if they do learn and this becomes
 
01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
available and something that we can
 
01:28:03.709 --> 01:28:03.719 align:start position:0%
offer and they seek it out to us
 
01:28:05.149 --> 01:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely we would like to be able to
 
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
provide that
 
01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:07.860 align:start position:0%
um but that's not why we're doing this
 
01:28:09.410 --> 01:28:09.420 align:start position:0%
we're not doing this because people are
 
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
knocking down our doors and saying Hey I
 
01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
want my vaccine why can't you give it to
 
01:28:12.719 --> 01:28:13.790 align:start position:0%
want my vaccine why can't you give it to
me

01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
um we are are trying to add to that
 
01:28:18.890 --> 01:28:18.900 align:start position:0%
access for those patients that are there
 
01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
in front of of us I have many patients
 
01:28:22.610 --> 01:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
that I see every year I have many
 
01:28:24.110 --> 01:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
patients that I see three four five
 
01:28:26.810 --> 01:28:26.820 align:start position:0%
times a year I see shingles
 
01:28:29.450 --> 01:28:29.460 align:start position:0%
very frequently and many of those
 
01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
patients have not been seeing a primary
 
01:28:32.689 --> 01:28:32.699 align:start position:0%
care provider have not had that
 
01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have that vaccine and are
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
not thinking oh I need to go ask for
 
01:28:39.649 --> 01:28:39.659 align:start position:0%
somebody to provide that so as part of
 
01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
our Primary Care Service that we're
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
providing to our patients when we're
 
01:28:46.250 --> 01:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
discussing their Total Eye Health that
 
01:28:47.689 --> 01:28:47.699 align:start position:0%
question comes up have you had your
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
shingles vaccine no okay this is why
 
01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
it's important and this is some of the
 
01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
complications to your vision that can
 
01:28:57.169 --> 01:28:57.179 align:start position:0%
happen from this oh that's great oh but
 
01:28:58.370 --> 01:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
I have to go somewhere else to get it
 
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:00.719 align:start position:0%
well I don't have a primary care doctor
 
01:29:02.090 --> 01:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
um you know the pharmacist sitting in
 
01:29:04.430 --> 01:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
the hallway you know somebody that they
 
01:29:06.410 --> 01:29:06.420 align:start position:0%
don't know my my history they don't you
 
01:29:09.290 --> 01:29:09.300 align:start position:0%
know the the this technician does not
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
have the history with me that you have
 
01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
as my eye care provider but that's not
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
something that we're able to offer you
 
01:29:16.570 --> 01:29:16.580 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
01:29:19.850 --> 01:29:19.860 align:start position:0%
representative Palazzo thank you Mr
 
01:29:22.010 --> 01:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:29:27.050 --> 01:29:27.060 align:start position:0%
question uh it's uh first uh I wonder if
 
01:29:30.350 --> 01:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
you in your practice or others uh
 
01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
optometrist you are working with ever
 
01:29:37.689 --> 01:29:37.699 align:start position:0%
dealt with vaccine adverse reaction or
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
considered it or reported it to
 
01:29:45.070 --> 01:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine adverse reaction database files
 
01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:46.629 align:start position:0%
vaccine adverse reaction database files
and

01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:46.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:50.169 --> 01:29:50.179 align:start position:0%
the second part is like
 
01:29:54.229 --> 01:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
what's my concern that uh I'm here from
 
01:29:56.830 --> 01:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
other jurisdictions
 
01:30:00.890 --> 01:30:00.900 align:start position:0%
for example uh from optometrists in
 
01:30:03.410 --> 01:30:03.420 align:start position:0%
British islands that a very small
 
01:30:06.709 --> 01:30:06.719 align:start position:0%
percentage of people who got covet
 
01:30:09.310 --> 01:30:09.320 align:start position:0%
vaccines they have problems with vision
 
01:30:12.770 --> 01:30:12.780 align:start position:0%
but when we got it to Absolute numbers
 
01:30:16.850 --> 01:30:16.860 align:start position:0%
it's like hundreds people of people so
 
01:30:20.290 --> 01:30:20.300 align:start position:0%
my concern is if
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
already have some hesitation to consider
 
01:30:27.410 --> 01:30:27.420 align:start position:0%
a girl's reaction and Reporting like if
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
somebody is losing vision you probably
 
01:30:33.229 --> 01:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
want asking them when when was your last
 
01:30:37.370 --> 01:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
vaccination and now we will with this
 
01:30:39.729 --> 01:30:39.739 align:start position:0%
bill we will have situation when
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
optometrist will be the person who
 
01:30:45.649 --> 01:30:45.659 align:start position:0%
administered the vaccine and the
 
01:30:48.110 --> 01:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
organization profited from them so then
 
01:30:50.570 --> 01:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
they will be even more hesitation to
 
01:30:52.970 --> 01:30:52.980 align:start position:0%
investigate and Report those reactions
 
01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
so could you comment
 
01:30:58.430 --> 01:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not quite sure if I followed
 
01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
everything uh we we would absolutely be
 
01:31:03.410 --> 01:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
held to the same responsibility for
 
01:31:05.629 --> 01:31:05.639 align:start position:0%
reporting Adverse Events
 
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
um if I have a patient who has had an
 
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
adverse event and we determined that
 
01:31:13.850 --> 01:31:13.860 align:start position:0%
they've recently had a vaccine and I am
 
01:31:15.950 --> 01:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
currently on the receiving end of
 
01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:18.900 align:start position:0%
treating an adverse event
 
01:31:20.330 --> 01:31:20.340 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:21.110 align:start position:0%
um I
um

01:31:21.110 --> 01:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:23.629 --> 01:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
I typically work with their primary care
 
01:31:26.750 --> 01:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
provider to address that event and to
 
01:31:29.090 --> 01:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
discuss um you know the the relationship
 
01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:30.470 align:start position:0%
discuss um you know the the relationship
there

01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:31:33.410 --> 01:31:33.420 align:start position:0%
um and work with that provider to report
 
01:31:35.870 --> 01:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
that event because we do not currently
 
01:31:38.629 --> 01:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
have access and the ability to do um all
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
of that directly
 
01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:41.570 align:start position:0%
of that directly
um

01:31:41.570 --> 01:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:44.930 align:start position:0%
um
uh

01:31:44.930 --> 01:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:46.129 align:start position:0%
 
apologize

01:31:46.129 --> 01:31:46.139 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
um was there another question
 
01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:50.209 align:start position:0%
um was there another question
um

01:31:50.209 --> 01:31:50.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:52.850 --> 01:31:52.860 align:start position:0%
doing over a single case when
 
01:31:55.790 --> 01:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
optometrist in New Hampshire reported an
 
01:31:59.209 --> 01:31:59.219 align:start position:0%
adverse vaccine election ever
 
01:32:02.209 --> 01:32:02.219 align:start position:0%
right so I I would understand that no I
 
01:32:03.530 --> 01:32:03.540 align:start position:0%
don't believe that there is a case that
 
01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
that has been reported to date
 
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
um there may be in other states where
 
01:32:09.890 --> 01:32:09.900 align:start position:0%
other states where optometrists are
 
01:32:11.689 --> 01:32:11.699 align:start position:0%
providing vaccines
 
01:32:13.550 --> 01:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
um there has been no increase in
 
01:32:16.010 --> 01:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
malpractice or liability rates in other
 
01:32:17.810 --> 01:32:17.820 align:start position:0%
states where optometrists are providing
 
01:32:17.820 --> 01:32:19.370 align:start position:0%
states where optometrists are providing
vaccines

01:32:19.370 --> 01:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
01:32:23.090 --> 01:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
um there has been no increase in Adverse
 
01:32:25.250 --> 01:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
Events in those States
 
01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you Mr
 
01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking questions
 
01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the bill seemed to be
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
under the belief that very few
 
01:32:36.050 --> 01:32:36.060 align:start position:0%
optometrists really would take advantage
 
01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
of this and and offer vaccines in my
 
01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
mind's eye I imagine places like you
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
know Dartmouth health and search you
 
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
know certain places that offer a lot of
 
01:32:46.910 --> 01:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
different Services
 
01:32:49.070 --> 01:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
um probably would maybe take advantage
 
01:32:50.209 --> 01:32:50.219 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:32:51.890 --> 01:32:51.900 align:start position:0%
um in your opinion who do you think
 
01:32:53.810 --> 01:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
would really take advantage of this this
 
01:32:56.209 --> 01:32:56.219 align:start position:0%
new law do you think it would be a lot
 
01:32:58.250 --> 01:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
of optometrists or would it be more of
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
the larger providers thank you thank you
 
01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
um it would be primarily the larger
 
01:33:06.290 --> 01:33:06.300 align:start position:0%
providers in fact we do have one
 
01:33:08.510 --> 01:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
prepared to speak after me who would
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
plan to offer that in their office as
 
01:33:12.410 --> 01:33:12.420 align:start position:0%
they have multiple providers multiple
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
locations where I am located
 
01:33:17.629 --> 01:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
um it is something that I would like to
 
01:33:20.450 --> 01:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
be able to do because I am in such a
 
01:33:22.729 --> 01:33:22.739 align:start position:0%
rural location and access to care is so
 
01:33:25.610 --> 01:33:25.620 align:start position:0%
critical for my patients I do not have
 
01:33:27.890 --> 01:33:27.900 align:start position:0%
the facilities right now to be able to
 
01:33:29.810 --> 01:33:29.820 align:start position:0%
do that and that is something that I'm
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
working to address that as we grow I
 
01:33:34.189 --> 01:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
would like to be able to do that
 
01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
um and I I think that it's
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
um it's not prudent to just kick it down
 
01:33:42.050 --> 01:33:42.060 align:start position:0%
the road until I'm personally ready to
 
01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
offer that in my office there are
 
01:33:45.110 --> 01:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
offices that are available and able to
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
do it now
 
01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:47.570 align:start position:0%
do it now
okay

01:33:47.570 --> 01:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:33:50.510 --> 01:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:52.010 --> 01:33:52.020 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing no other questions thank you
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:00.239 align:start position:0%

approximately support staff members
 
01:36:10.970 --> 01:36:10.980 align:start position:0%
last year our providers provided care
 
01:36:14.270 --> 01:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
for 12 470 people suffice to say we
 
01:36:16.129 --> 01:36:16.139 align:start position:0%
provided Eric Eye Care to a lot of
 
01:36:16.139 --> 01:36:17.390 align:start position:0%
provided Eric Eye Care to a lot of
individuals

01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:36:19.729 --> 01:36:19.739 align:start position:0%
in my experience it is very common to
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
see patients who have not seen their
 
01:36:23.209 --> 01:36:23.219 align:start position:0%
primary care doctors in many years I
 
01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
also see patients daily who have not do
 
01:36:27.229 --> 01:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
not have a primary care physician due to
 
01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
Providers retiring relocating or the
 
01:36:31.729 --> 01:36:31.739 align:start position:0%
patient simply neglected to select to
 
01:36:33.050 --> 01:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
find one
 
01:36:35.450 --> 01:36:35.460 align:start position:0%
I frequently see patients who report not
 
01:36:37.610 --> 01:36:37.620 align:start position:0%
having flu covet and shingles vaccines
 
01:36:40.129 --> 01:36:40.139 align:start position:0%
despite it being in their best interest
 
01:36:41.930 --> 01:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
the shingles vaccination is probably the
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
most notable a shingles can cause
 
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
temporary and permanent vision loss when
 
01:36:46.910 --> 01:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
involving the eye
 
01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
ideally these patients would receive
 
01:36:50.689 --> 01:36:50.699 align:start position:0%
these vaccinations but Public Health
 
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
Data tells us that they are not doing so
 
01:36:55.729 --> 01:36:55.739 align:start position:0%
the shingles vaccination is about around
 
01:36:58.250 --> 01:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
for many years is well tested in adults
 
01:37:00.530 --> 01:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
50 to 69 years old with healthy immune
 
01:37:03.649 --> 01:37:03.659 align:start position:0%
systems this vaccine was 97 effective in
 
01:37:06.050 --> 01:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
preventing shingles an adult 70 years
 
01:37:09.649 --> 01:37:09.659 align:start position:0%
older and older it was 91 effective this
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
is a vaccine success story but only
 
01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:13.679 align:start position:0%
about 30 percent of adults who might
 
01:37:15.649 --> 01:37:15.659 align:start position:0%
benefit from this have received it and
 
01:37:17.390 --> 01:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
one in three adults over the age of 50
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
will get the disease
 
01:37:21.229 --> 01:37:21.239 align:start position:0%
this is just one example of how adding
 
01:37:22.610 --> 01:37:22.620 align:start position:0%
another well-trained group of doctors
 
01:37:24.649 --> 01:37:24.659 align:start position:0%
into the mix of providers will help the
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire improve health
 
01:37:28.729 --> 01:37:28.739 align:start position:0%
outcomes our patients come to see us as
 
01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
a matter of need so they can see to work
 
01:37:33.290 --> 01:37:33.300 align:start position:0%
and live better we regularly educate
 
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
them on smoking cessation the important
 
01:37:37.010 --> 01:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
of vaccines and other important
 
01:37:39.290 --> 01:37:39.300 align:start position:0%
preventative measures so it only makes
 
01:37:40.790 --> 01:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
sense that we could offer this if a
 
01:37:42.729 --> 01:37:42.739 align:start position:0%
patient is ready to do so
 
01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
optometrists could also be a critical
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
component of increasing vaccination
 
01:37:48.649 --> 01:37:48.659 align:start position:0%
rates and decreasing disease burden
 
01:37:50.330 --> 01:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
01:37:52.370 --> 01:37:52.380 align:start position:0%
Doctors of Optometry are fully capable
 
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
of Performing vaccinations
 
01:37:56.629 --> 01:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
intravenous and intramuscular injections
 
01:37:57.890 --> 01:37:57.900 align:start position:0%
are part of the curriculum at every
 
01:38:00.229 --> 01:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
optometry school across the country an
 
01:38:02.030 --> 01:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
injection certification is an optional
 
01:38:03.530 --> 01:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
part of the national board of exam for
 
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
optometrists optometrists are currently
 
01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
authorized to perform injections in 22
 
01:38:08.100 --> 01:38:09.590 align:start position:0%
authorized to perform injections in 22
States

01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
States
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the biggest question anyone
 
01:38:12.890 --> 01:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
would have would be what happens if a
 
01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
patient patient suffers a severe
 
01:38:17.629 --> 01:38:17.639 align:start position:0%
allergic anaphylactic reaction
 
01:38:19.970 --> 01:38:19.980 align:start position:0%
but emergency preparation is a critical
 
01:38:22.610 --> 01:38:22.620 align:start position:0%
process in all offices in our office we
 
01:38:23.629 --> 01:38:23.639 align:start position:0%
have always maintained emergency
 
01:38:26.209 --> 01:38:26.219 align:start position:0%
medications and automated defibrillator
 
01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:28.679 align:start position:0%
all of our providers are required to
 
01:38:30.410 --> 01:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
maintain CPR training and emergency
 
01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
training because it's required for
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
licensed training we also provide
 
01:38:35.930 --> 01:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
in-house CPR training for all our staff
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
it is not currently mandated but will
 
01:38:40.669 --> 01:38:40.679 align:start position:0%
continue to consider that in the future
 
01:38:43.129 --> 01:38:43.139 align:start position:0%
just like any doctor's office or
 
01:38:44.750 --> 01:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy where vaccines are administered
 
01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
we too rely on the emergency management
 
01:38:49.070 --> 01:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
system for otherwise more serious events
 
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
luckily this is very rare anaphylaxis
 
01:38:55.189 --> 01:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
rate for coveted vaccination is 11 per 1
 
01:38:56.930 --> 01:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
million individuals and for flu
 
01:38:59.750 --> 01:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
vaccinations it's 1.35 per million
 
01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:01.330 align:start position:0%
vaccinations it's 1.35 per million
individuals

01:39:01.330 --> 01:39:01.340 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:39:03.770 --> 01:39:03.780 align:start position:0%
recently in our office our preparation
 
01:39:05.629 --> 01:39:05.639 align:start position:0%
was tested we had a patient suffer a
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
severe seizure in our waiting room and
 
01:39:09.050 --> 01:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
our staff handled the situation
 
01:39:11.810 --> 01:39:11.820 align:start position:0%
perfectly and appropriately uh
 
01:39:14.330 --> 01:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
as we as we expected and as we are all
 
01:39:16.850 --> 01:39:16.860 align:start position:0%
trained so in summation authorizing
 
01:39:18.410 --> 01:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
optometrists to provide vaccinations
 
01:39:20.750 --> 01:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
could safely increase vaccination rates
 
01:39:22.850 --> 01:39:22.860 align:start position:0%
and prevent significant disease across
 
01:39:25.010 --> 01:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
the population of New Hampshire
 
01:39:27.649 --> 01:39:27.659 align:start position:0%
thank you could we get a copy of your
 
01:39:29.390 --> 01:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
written testimony please absolute
 
01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:31.490 align:start position:0%
written testimony please absolute
questions

01:39:31.490 --> 01:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:39:33.709 --> 01:39:33.719 align:start position:0%
yes representative Nagel
 
01:39:35.450 --> 01:39:35.460 align:start position:0%
um I want to ask the same question I'll
 
01:39:37.070 --> 01:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
my question the same question that was
 
01:39:42.110 --> 01:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
asked of Senator Rosenwald but why just
 
01:39:43.790 --> 01:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
these three
 
01:39:47.810 --> 01:39:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:51.050 --> 01:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
I would love to administer more we had
 
01:39:52.850 --> 01:39:52.860 align:start position:0%
to work with our sponsors and and I
 
01:39:54.350 --> 01:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
believe incremental changes is
 
01:39:56.810 --> 01:39:56.820 align:start position:0%
appropriate so I believe in the future
 
01:39:59.209 --> 01:39:59.219 align:start position:0%
we'll show our Merit and increase those
 
01:40:01.970 --> 01:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
those uh to more and other vaccinations
 
01:40:06.890 --> 01:40:06.900 align:start position:0%
but um I realize this is a new uh change
 
01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
and and change comes low so incremental
 
01:40:11.149 --> 01:40:11.159 align:start position:0%
changes is progress as far as I'm
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
concerned so we'll take what we can get
 
01:40:14.149 --> 01:40:14.159 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
01:40:15.950 --> 01:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy great thank you
 
01:40:17.090 --> 01:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
very much and thanks for taking my
 
01:40:19.070 --> 01:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
question Mike my question would be have
 
01:40:20.930 --> 01:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
you estimated what the what the cost
 
01:40:25.070 --> 01:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
would be for an office to set up for say
 
01:40:27.410 --> 01:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
covid vaccines or any other vaccines and
 
01:40:29.629 --> 01:40:29.639 align:start position:0%
the reason I ask that is oftentimes
 
01:40:31.550 --> 01:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
if you look at other you know services
 
01:40:34.129 --> 01:40:34.139 align:start position:0%
offered we think about the the concept
 
01:40:36.169 --> 01:40:36.179 align:start position:0%
of a certificate of need so that it's
 
01:40:37.729 --> 01:40:37.739 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary in a certain area
 
01:40:40.189 --> 01:40:40.199 align:start position:0%
otherwise you're incurring increased
 
01:40:42.050 --> 01:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
cost to your practice which then can be
 
01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
transferred to a patient so when I think
 
01:40:45.950 --> 01:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
about setting it up in the office
 
01:40:47.930 --> 01:40:47.940 align:start position:0%
there's a refrigeration this is a
 
01:40:50.330 --> 01:40:50.340 align:start position:0%
training of staff there is the reporting
 
01:40:53.149 --> 01:40:53.159 align:start position:0%
there I mean so time is money also so
 
01:40:54.770 --> 01:40:54.780 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand what the cost
 
01:40:56.930 --> 01:40:56.940 align:start position:0%
would be how would this affect patients
 
01:40:58.189 --> 01:40:58.199 align:start position:0%
how would this be transferred to a
 
01:40:59.930 --> 01:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
patient especially in light of the fact
 
01:41:01.729 --> 01:41:01.739 align:start position:0%
that the majority of patients in the or
 
01:41:04.430 --> 01:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
people in the state have access to the
 
01:41:06.850 --> 01:41:06.860 align:start position:0%
covid flu and
 
01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
other vaccines currently available
 
01:41:13.250 --> 01:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
there's a lot in that so have I done a
 
01:41:15.770 --> 01:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
cost benefit analysis quick quick and
 
01:41:18.350 --> 01:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
dirty not completely things like
 
01:41:20.330 --> 01:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
refrigeration and record keeping are
 
01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
things that happen every day in our
 
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
office we have lots of things that need
 
01:41:25.729 --> 01:41:25.739 align:start position:0%
to be refrigerated and some are frozen
 
01:41:28.370 --> 01:41:28.380 align:start position:0%
um you know so that is something we deal
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
with on a daily basis and that would not
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
apply any incurred costs if anything
 
01:41:34.970 --> 01:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
this is uh something that we're already
 
01:41:36.890 --> 01:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
doing it would be an incremental
 
01:41:36.900 --> 01:41:37.870 align:start position:0%
doing it would be an incremental
addition

01:41:37.870 --> 01:41:37.880 align:start position:0%
addition
 
01:41:41.810 --> 01:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
so as far as cost of vaccination no I I
 
01:41:44.030 --> 01:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
not being able to administer
 
01:41:46.209 --> 01:41:46.219 align:start position:0%
vaccinations I'm not able to really
 
01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
appropriately look into the cost we are
 
01:41:52.129 --> 01:41:52.139 align:start position:0%
a large office we have many resources I
 
01:41:54.609 --> 01:41:54.619 align:start position:0%
don't see it being a huge impediment
 
01:41:57.770 --> 01:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
but if we are authorized I can be sure
 
01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
we'll make it happen
 
01:42:03.649 --> 01:42:03.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
and representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
01:42:08.209 --> 01:42:08.219 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking the question
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
in regards to looking through this from
 
01:42:14.450 --> 01:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
the eyes of a business venture
 
01:42:17.930 --> 01:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
can you speak to how the office is going
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
to handle
 
01:42:22.669 --> 01:42:22.679 align:start position:0%
shingles vaccines my understanding is
 
01:42:24.290 --> 01:42:24.300 align:start position:0%
most of them are built to the pharmacy
 
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
benefits signed through a PBM I know on
 
01:42:28.490 --> 01:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
a Part D that's exactly where they have
 
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
to go because that's where a lot of
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
patients end up in the pharmacy is
 
01:42:33.290 --> 01:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that they have to be
 
01:42:35.390 --> 01:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
billed by the pharmacy or Bill to the
 
01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
pvm side of the equation
 
01:42:39.290 --> 01:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
can you speak to that as far as
 
01:42:41.570 --> 01:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
with optometrists in the office and the
 
01:42:42.850 --> 01:42:42.860 align:start position:0%
Billing System you can have in place
 
01:42:46.010 --> 01:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
that you can be able to bill the
 
01:42:48.290 --> 01:42:48.300 align:start position:0%
insurance company for it and not charge
 
01:42:49.970 --> 01:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
the patient for it and then have the
 
01:42:51.290 --> 01:42:51.300 align:start position:0%
patient try to get reimbursed by the
 
01:42:53.330 --> 01:42:53.340 align:start position:0%
insurance company
 
01:42:55.850 --> 01:42:55.860 align:start position:0%
I can say we currently bill for all
 
01:42:58.090 --> 01:42:58.100 align:start position:0%
sorts of different medical services
 
01:43:01.129 --> 01:43:01.139 align:start position:0%
and having it's always a challenge
 
01:43:03.470 --> 01:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
building for any medical services it
 
01:43:05.330 --> 01:43:05.340 align:start position:0%
does get complicated as we co-manage
 
01:43:07.370 --> 01:43:07.380 align:start position:0%
after surgical procedures in regards to
 
01:43:09.770 --> 01:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
cataracts and those rare occasions
 
01:43:11.330 --> 01:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
classes can be covered by medical
 
01:43:14.930 --> 01:43:14.940 align:start position:0%
insurance so it's not new territory as
 
01:43:16.490 --> 01:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
far as building medical insurance goes
 
01:43:17.810 --> 01:43:17.820 align:start position:0%
we haven't been able to bill for
 
01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
vaccinations so it'll be a learning
 
01:43:21.530 --> 01:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
curve for sure
 
01:43:23.810 --> 01:43:23.820 align:start position:0%
that follow-up yeah
 
01:43:26.330 --> 01:43:26.340 align:start position:0%
yes it will be the reason I'm trying to
 
01:43:28.430 --> 01:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
bring this up is to be sure that I'm
 
01:43:31.010 --> 01:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
trying to protect the patient from them
 
01:43:34.609 --> 01:43:34.619 align:start position:0%
being charged by the optometrist and
 
01:43:36.770 --> 01:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
then the honest is on them to try to get
 
01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%
back reimbursement from the insurance
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
companies because vaccines specifically
 
01:43:45.709 --> 01:43:45.719 align:start position:0%
most of them are built on the part D not
 
01:43:47.330 --> 01:43:47.340 align:start position:0%
which is a pharmacy benefit not a
 
01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
medical benefit so I want to make sure
 
01:43:51.649 --> 01:43:51.659 align:start position:0%
that the Optometry Community understands
 
01:43:54.590 --> 01:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
that the billing process is
 
01:43:56.689 --> 01:43:56.699 align:start position:0%
fundamentally different and I just want
 
01:43:58.370 --> 01:43:58.380 align:start position:0%
to be sure that the patient ultimately
 
01:43:59.930 --> 01:43:59.940 align:start position:0%
is not the person going to be charged
 
01:44:02.030 --> 01:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
for it it does go back to the billing
 
01:44:03.530 --> 01:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
process and the accomplishers will take
 
01:44:06.290 --> 01:44:06.300 align:start position:0%
care of that yeah I I can assure you
 
01:44:08.689 --> 01:44:08.699 align:start position:0%
that in my office we wouldn't plan on
 
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
balance billing anyone but you know we
 
01:44:14.570 --> 01:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
do this daily there are procedures that
 
01:44:16.669 --> 01:44:16.679 align:start position:0%
we expect to be covered that aren't most
 
01:44:18.709 --> 01:44:18.719 align:start position:0%
of the time it's not permitted to
 
01:44:21.950 --> 01:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
balance bill in our industry
 
01:44:24.169 --> 01:44:24.179 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer
 
01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
so this is related to representative
 
01:44:28.490 --> 01:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
Merchants thank you for
 
01:44:30.109 --> 01:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking a
 
01:44:30.119 --> 01:44:31.070 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking a
question

01:44:31.070 --> 01:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:44:33.410 --> 01:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
I always forget to say that sorry okay
 
01:44:37.129 --> 01:44:37.139 align:start position:0%
so um I just had my shingles vaccine and
 
01:44:39.169 --> 01:44:39.179 align:start position:0%
I had gone in to see my primary care
 
01:44:41.689 --> 01:44:41.699 align:start position:0%
physician I'm lucky enough to have one
 
01:44:41.699 --> 01:44:42.530 align:start position:0%
physician I'm lucky enough to have one
um

01:44:42.530 --> 01:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:44.330 --> 01:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
he said have you had the new shingles
 
01:44:49.490 --> 01:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
act no uh and I said okay and I then I
 
01:44:51.050 --> 01:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
was waiting for the nurse to come back
 
01:44:54.370 --> 01:44:54.380 align:start position:0%
and it said no they it it's exactly what
 
01:44:57.109 --> 01:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant said is that for
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
that office which is in a you know it's
 
01:45:01.669 --> 01:45:01.679 align:start position:0%
in a big Clinic to
 
01:45:03.770 --> 01:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
um provide the vaccine it's it's not
 
01:45:05.870 --> 01:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
financially reasonable for them to do
 
01:45:07.850 --> 01:45:07.860 align:start position:0%
that so they just give me a prescription
 
01:45:10.129 --> 01:45:10.139 align:start position:0%
to go down to Rite Aid and so my
 
01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
question to you is
 
01:45:13.609 --> 01:45:13.619 align:start position:0%
um would that be something you would be
 
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
able to do in in that instance if it's
 
01:45:18.530 --> 01:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
going to be an insurance issue
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
um just prescribe the medication so the
 
01:45:23.390 --> 01:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
patient can go and get their vaccine the
 
01:45:27.229 --> 01:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
um representative Palmer my
 
01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
understanding is they can administer it
 
01:45:32.090 --> 01:45:32.100 align:start position:0%
but they cannot prescribe for it unless
 
01:45:34.669 --> 01:45:34.679 align:start position:0%
it's through their formulary so I do
 
01:45:35.930 --> 01:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
understand where you're going it makes a
 
01:45:38.090 --> 01:45:38.100 align:start position:0%
lot of sense but the way this is written
 
01:45:39.649 --> 01:45:39.659 align:start position:0%
they can only administer the vaccine
 
01:45:41.570 --> 01:45:41.580 align:start position:0%
they cannot prescribe the vaccine to be
 
01:45:43.970 --> 01:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
given by somebody else
 
01:45:43.980 --> 01:45:48.169 align:start position:0%
given by somebody else
or

01:45:48.169 --> 01:45:48.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:48.179 --> 01:45:49.270 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:45:49.270 --> 01:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:45:51.169 --> 01:45:51.179 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:45:51.179 --> 01:45:52.490 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
sorry

01:45:52.490 --> 01:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:45:55.070 --> 01:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so and thank you for taking my
 
01:45:58.070 --> 01:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
questions so I'll I'll put the ball back
 
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
in your court
 
01:46:03.290 --> 01:46:03.300 align:start position:0%
um it's my understanding that
 
01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:03.970 align:start position:0%
um it's my understanding that
um

01:46:03.970 --> 01:46:03.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:07.910 --> 01:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
my optometrist prescribes medications
 
01:46:10.910 --> 01:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
for me regularly
 
01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:11.750 align:start position:0%
for me regularly
um

01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:14.270 --> 01:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
my optometrist is cited in Vermont
 
01:46:16.669 --> 01:46:16.679 align:start position:0%
rather than New Hampshire do New
 
01:46:18.770 --> 01:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire optometrists not have the
 
01:46:21.410 --> 01:46:21.420 align:start position:0%
ability to prescribe or do they
 
01:46:24.169 --> 01:46:24.179 align:start position:0%
currently have the the ability to
 
01:46:27.050 --> 01:46:27.060 align:start position:0%
prescribe some medications but not these
 
01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
and clearly clearly uh we're solving an
 
01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
issue with prescribing with regard to
 
01:46:35.330 --> 01:46:35.340 align:start position:0%
the lack of local program planned here
 
01:46:37.790 --> 01:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
so if you could explain to us what the
 
01:46:39.709 --> 01:46:39.719 align:start position:0%
current status is of prescribing
 
01:46:43.490 --> 01:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
Authority for optometrists here that
 
01:46:44.709 --> 01:46:44.719 align:start position:0%
would be helpful
 
01:46:44.719 --> 01:46:46.689 align:start position:0%
would be helpful
so

01:46:46.689 --> 01:46:46.699 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:50.149 --> 01:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
yes we do prescribe medications topical
 
01:46:52.370 --> 01:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
and oral on a daily basis that affect
 
01:46:55.090 --> 01:46:55.100 align:start position:0%
the eyes with some limitations
 
01:46:59.270 --> 01:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
so uh I do not have the whole statue
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
right in front of me but I can tell you
 
01:47:03.770 --> 01:47:03.780 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis I write probably eight
 
01:47:05.390 --> 01:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
to ten prescriptions every single day
 
01:47:08.410 --> 01:47:08.420 align:start position:0%
for oral or topical medications
 
01:47:11.689 --> 01:47:11.699 align:start position:0%
the lacrimal glanda was a previous
 
01:47:13.850 --> 01:47:13.860 align:start position:0%
exclusion hopefully we hope to have that
 
01:47:16.370 --> 01:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
going forward but I believe it's
 
01:47:18.410 --> 01:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
anything that's reasonable to treat the
 
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
eye and surrounding tissue
 
01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:23.750 align:start position:0%
eye and surrounding tissue
well

01:47:23.750 --> 01:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:47:26.450 --> 01:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to explore a little bit
 
01:47:30.109 --> 01:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
more about this question about is it
 
01:47:30.119 --> 01:47:31.609 align:start position:0%
more about this question about is it
preferable

01:47:31.609 --> 01:47:31.619 align:start position:0%
preferable
 
01:47:34.129 --> 01:47:34.139 align:start position:0%
sorry is it preferable
 
01:47:38.450 --> 01:47:38.460 align:start position:0%
to have for an optometrist to be able to
 
01:47:38.460 --> 01:47:40.729 align:start position:0%
to have for an optometrist to be able to
administer

01:47:40.729 --> 01:47:40.739 align:start position:0%
administer
 
01:47:44.510 --> 01:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
the vaccine or to be able to prescribe
 
01:47:46.669 --> 01:47:46.679 align:start position:0%
the vaccine which could then be obtained
 
01:47:48.830 --> 01:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
in a pharmacy or both
 
01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:50.149 align:start position:0%
in a pharmacy or both
ah

01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
ah
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
preferable for both that said the point
 
01:47:55.189 --> 01:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
of this bill is to offer it in office at
 
01:47:57.470 --> 01:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
the time to administer the vaccination
 
01:48:00.169 --> 01:48:00.179 align:start position:0%
to bring point of care to where the
 
01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
patient is instead of the reverse I see
 
01:48:05.450 --> 01:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
access as a care as a Continuum not an
 
01:48:07.250 --> 01:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
absolute you know if we can meet the
 
01:48:09.109 --> 01:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
patient where they are the access will
 
01:48:10.910 --> 01:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
be better vaccines will be more
 
01:48:13.550 --> 01:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
prevalent and disease will be prevented
 
01:48:15.709 --> 01:48:15.719 align:start position:0%
which is what the hope of this bill is
 
01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
so the opportunity to prescribe a
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
vaccination and have it later on I think
 
01:48:22.669 --> 01:48:22.679 align:start position:0%
misses the point the point here is to
 
01:48:24.649 --> 01:48:24.659 align:start position:0%
meet a patient where they are to have
 
01:48:27.050 --> 01:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
the vaccine at the time because what
 
01:48:28.729 --> 01:48:28.739 align:start position:0%
happens when we put something off it
 
01:48:29.890 --> 01:48:29.900 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen
 
01:48:32.209 --> 01:48:32.219 align:start position:0%
and when it doesn't happen across the
 
01:48:34.129 --> 01:48:34.139 align:start position:0%
population people get ill and there's
 
01:48:36.109 --> 01:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
burden and illness that could have been
 
01:48:38.950 --> 01:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
prevented so
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
representative Palazzo thank you Mr
 
01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
question uh I'm interested how do you
 
01:48:51.470 --> 01:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
see the legal framework especially
 
01:48:53.810 --> 01:48:53.820 align:start position:0%
around current very aggressive
 
01:48:56.209 --> 01:48:56.219 align:start position:0%
anti-vaccine hesitancy framework so
 
01:48:59.810 --> 01:48:59.820 align:start position:0%
let's take a scenario that healthy 18
 
01:49:04.370 --> 01:49:04.380 align:start position:0%
year old male comes to you and let's say
 
01:49:07.490 --> 01:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
you know the Department of Health and
 
01:49:09.370 --> 01:49:09.380 align:start position:0%
Human Services
 
01:49:13.070 --> 01:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
know that this demographic is uh has
 
01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:16.159 align:start position:0%
increased the risk of myocarditis after
 
01:49:19.790 --> 01:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccine Administration and also
 
01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
let's say you know that healthier 18
 
01:49:26.390 --> 01:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
year old is probably has a very low risk
 
01:49:29.870 --> 01:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
of severe covet and if you have risk
 
01:49:31.669 --> 01:49:31.679 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis
 
01:49:34.250 --> 01:49:34.260 align:start position:0%
and let's say as a doctor you think that
 
01:49:35.870 --> 01:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
maybe that person don't need that
 
01:49:39.709 --> 01:49:39.719 align:start position:0%
vaccine but would you be able to tell
 
01:49:41.689 --> 01:49:41.699 align:start position:0%
that client that you don't need it
 
01:49:44.810 --> 01:49:44.820 align:start position:0%
because like then you causing vaccine
 
01:49:47.810 --> 01:49:47.820 align:start position:0%
hesitancy and because that it's been
 
01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
frowned upon uh by licensing Authority
 
01:49:54.050 --> 01:49:54.060 align:start position:0%
so I'm worried that we are open on to
 
01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:56.639 align:start position:0%
the situation when you won't be able to
 
01:50:00.530 --> 01:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
honestly say to a healthy yet 18 year
 
01:50:02.450 --> 01:50:02.460 align:start position:0%
olds that maybe they don't need a
 
01:50:04.970 --> 01:50:04.980 align:start position:0%
commute vaccine shot could you comment
 
01:50:08.450 --> 01:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
thank you sure I mean with with any such
 
01:50:09.890 --> 01:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
procedure you're going to have an
 
01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
informed consent you're going to talk to
 
01:50:13.490 --> 01:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
this patient about the risks and the
 
01:50:15.709 --> 01:50:15.719 align:start position:0%
benefits and for them particularly in
 
01:50:18.350 --> 01:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
their their situation and that person I
 
01:50:20.510 --> 01:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
agree is low risk and there are some
 
01:50:22.370 --> 01:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
risks of side effects
 
01:50:24.649 --> 01:50:24.659 align:start position:0%
um so it's not my my job to make that
 
01:50:26.209 --> 01:50:26.219 align:start position:0%
decision for him is to make him an
 
01:50:27.709 --> 01:50:27.719 align:start position:0%
educated person about the potential
 
01:50:30.189 --> 01:50:30.199 align:start position:0%
risks and the potential benefits
 
01:50:32.689 --> 01:50:32.699 align:start position:0%
obviously risk tolerance is going to be
 
01:50:34.990 --> 01:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
very different Patient to Patient and
 
01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.910 align:start position:0%
very different Patient to Patient and
their

01:50:36.910 --> 01:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:50:38.990 --> 01:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
interpretation of each of those risks
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
may also be very different you know
 
01:50:42.290 --> 01:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
their personal experiences with covet
 
01:50:44.270 --> 01:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
and myocarditis are going to influence a
 
01:50:46.850 --> 01:50:46.860 align:start position:0%
lot of their decision making so it's my
 
01:50:48.590 --> 01:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
job to provide them the information on
 
01:50:50.450 --> 01:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
the vaccination and to make sure they
 
01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
understand that before I do anything you
 
01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
know so yes I think we're particularly
 
01:50:58.669 --> 01:50:58.679 align:start position:0%
Adept at doing that I think we have
 
01:51:01.070 --> 01:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
conversations with patients regarding
 
01:51:04.129 --> 01:51:04.139 align:start position:0%
treatment options daily about risks and
 
01:51:07.250 --> 01:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
benefits and and certainly that would be
 
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
an important part of that conversation
 
01:51:12.109 --> 01:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
with that individual and and it will go
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
different ways with different people
 
01:51:15.950 --> 01:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
depending on their their experiences in
 
01:51:17.330 --> 01:51:17.340 align:start position:0%
the past
 
01:51:17.340 --> 01:51:18.410 align:start position:0%
the past
okay

01:51:18.410 --> 01:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:51:21.050 --> 01:51:21.060 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:51:22.910 --> 01:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
see no other questions okay thank you
 
01:51:24.649 --> 01:51:24.659 align:start position:0%
very much and again if we could get a
 
01:51:25.850 --> 01:51:25.860 align:start position:0%
copy of your written testimony
 
01:51:25.860 --> 01:51:31.609 align:start position:0%
copy of your written testimony
absolutely

01:51:31.609 --> 01:51:31.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
have no one else signed up to speak on
 
01:51:36.229 --> 01:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 200 does anyone else wish to
 
01:51:36.239 --> 01:51:38.270 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 200 does anyone else wish to
testify

01:51:38.270 --> 01:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
testify
 
01:51:39.770 --> 01:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
seeing no one else I'm going to close
 
01:51:41.629 --> 01:51:41.639 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on Senate Bill 200
 
01:51:45.109 --> 01:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
and open the public hearing on uh yeah
 
01:51:48.109 --> 01:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
we have passed the appropriate time open
 
01:51:49.310 --> 01:51:49.320 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:51:52.550 --> 01:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
public hearing on Senate Bill 236 and
 
01:51:54.709 --> 01:51:54.719 align:start position:0%

01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:06.350 --> 01:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair members of the
 
01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:07.609 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair members of the
committee

01:52:07.609 --> 01:52:07.619 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:52:09.830 --> 01:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Shannon
 
01:52:13.490 --> 01:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
chandley I represent District 11 in the
 
01:52:14.990 --> 01:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
state senate those are the towns of
 
01:52:18.709 --> 01:52:18.719 align:start position:0%
Amherst Milford Merrimack and Wilton I
 
01:52:21.830 --> 01:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
come before you today to introduce SB
 
01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
236 it is a bill that establishes a
 
01:52:27.169 --> 01:52:27.179 align:start position:0%
committee to study
 
01:52:30.649 --> 01:52:30.659 align:start position:0%
um non-profit organizations that
 
01:52:32.689 --> 01:52:32.699 align:start position:0%
contract with the Department of Health
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
and Human Services and this bill
 
01:52:39.470 --> 01:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
um some of you may have seen a version
 
01:52:43.129 --> 01:52:43.139 align:start position:0%
of this bill either the study committee
 
01:52:45.410 --> 01:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
version or a policy version of the bill
 
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
one of the problems that a number of
 
01:52:50.450 --> 01:52:50.460 align:start position:0%
this agencies that contract with the
 
01:52:53.870 --> 01:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
state to act in lieu of the state with
 
01:52:55.970 --> 01:52:55.980 align:start position:0%
regards children in particular are
 
01:52:59.330 --> 01:52:59.340 align:start position:0%
running into Insurance problems they are
 
01:53:03.890 --> 01:53:03.900 align:start position:0%
concerned about their ability to um be
 
01:53:06.590 --> 01:53:06.600 align:start position:0%
insured sufficiently
 
01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:07.250 align:start position:0%
insured sufficiently
um

01:53:07.250 --> 01:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:09.290 --> 01:53:09.300 align:start position:0%
some of the bills in the past have
 
01:53:11.930 --> 01:53:11.940 align:start position:0%
proposed a cap on the insurance these it
 
01:53:14.330 --> 01:53:14.340 align:start position:0%
was sort of like coming to the solution
 
01:53:16.370 --> 01:53:16.380 align:start position:0%
before the problem had been fully
 
01:53:20.570 --> 01:53:20.580 align:start position:0%
identified and considered so this is a
 
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
standard study committee that includes a
 
01:53:24.890 --> 01:53:24.900 align:start position:0%
member of the Senate several members of
 
01:53:27.410 --> 01:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
the house and should put out a report
 
01:53:30.109 --> 01:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
after looking at the issue the Senate
 
01:53:32.629 --> 01:53:32.639 align:start position:0%
improved the bill somewhat
 
01:53:37.070 --> 01:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
um with an amendment uh to to
 
01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:38.030 align:start position:0%
um with an amendment uh to to
um

01:53:38.030 --> 01:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:42.109 --> 01:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
Define the scope or or actually that's a
 
01:53:45.890 --> 01:53:45.900 align:start position:0%
broader scope it set the the way it was
 
01:53:49.070 --> 01:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
in place prior
 
01:53:51.709 --> 01:53:51.719 align:start position:0%
um I believe it said uh
 
01:53:53.950 --> 01:53:53.960 align:start position:0%
the committee would study extended
 
01:53:56.810 --> 01:53:56.820 align:start position:0%
extending limited liability the problem
 
01:53:58.609 --> 01:53:58.619 align:start position:0%
with that it was is was that it was
 
01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
fairly prescriptive it was identifying
 
01:54:02.689 --> 01:54:02.699 align:start position:0%
the solution before looking at the
 
01:54:05.810 --> 01:54:05.820 align:start position:0%
problem so this way the problem will be
 
01:54:08.030 --> 01:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
identified the
 
01:54:10.810 --> 01:54:10.820 align:start position:0%
um potential Solutions considered
 
01:54:14.050 --> 01:54:14.060 align:start position:0%
hopefully a particular solution
 
01:54:17.330 --> 01:54:17.340 align:start position:0%
recommended and the report is due out in
 
01:54:17.340 --> 01:54:18.830 align:start position:0%
recommended and the report is due out in
November

01:54:18.830 --> 01:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
November
 
01:54:22.609 --> 01:54:22.619 align:start position:0%
um of this year I believe
 
01:54:24.770 --> 01:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
let's see I just want to make yes this
 
01:54:26.990 --> 01:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
year so the report would come out this
 
01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:27.890 align:start position:0%
year so the report would come out this
year

01:54:27.890 --> 01:54:27.900 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:54:29.570 --> 01:54:29.580 align:start position:0%
um I was talking to representative
 
01:54:32.209 --> 01:54:32.219 align:start position:0%
Edwards who thought that the bill needed
 
01:54:34.310 --> 01:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
to have a Sunset date or a repeal of the
 
01:54:37.070 --> 01:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
committee I am not sure that it is
 
01:54:39.950 --> 01:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
necessary my understanding is once um
 
01:54:42.649 --> 01:54:42.659 align:start position:0%
the bill comes out uh or the bill
 
01:54:45.590 --> 01:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
becomes law and that this report would
 
01:54:47.810 --> 01:54:47.820 align:start position:0%
be issued one time and that would be the
 
01:54:49.910 --> 01:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
end of it but if the committee does
 
01:54:52.129 --> 01:54:52.139 align:start position:0%
believe it's necessary to put a sunset
 
01:54:55.910 --> 01:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
or repeal of this committee uh in place
 
01:54:58.010 --> 01:54:58.020 align:start position:0%
that certainly is no problem obviously
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
the intent of the committee is to find a
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
solution uh now and not
 
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
um continuing hopefully a solution could
 
01:55:07.129 --> 01:55:07.139 align:start position:0%
be found this summer on there I know
 
01:55:09.590 --> 01:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
that there are some folks from the
 
01:55:11.450 --> 01:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
agencies that are affected by this
 
01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
problem who are able to speak they can
 
01:55:16.010 --> 01:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
probably answer any um specific
 
01:55:18.229 --> 01:55:18.239 align:start position:0%
questions better than I but I am more
 
01:55:20.330 --> 01:55:20.340 align:start position:0%
than happy to take any questions you may
 
01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:21.229 align:start position:0%
than happy to take any questions you may
have

01:55:21.229 --> 01:55:21.239 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:55:24.830 --> 01:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative
 
01:55:26.870 --> 01:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
all right I'm I'm feeling a little dumb
 
01:55:29.870 --> 01:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so
 
01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:30.590 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so
um

01:55:30.590 --> 01:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:33.109 --> 01:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
what is the problem here
 
01:55:35.870 --> 01:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
like so and I was trying to think of a
 
01:55:38.330 --> 01:55:38.340 align:start position:0%
non-profit children's organization so I
 
01:55:39.890 --> 01:55:39.900 align:start position:0%
was thinking like Nashua children's home
 
01:55:42.530 --> 01:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
so Waypoint folks from Waypoint are here
 
01:55:45.410 --> 01:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
and they can explain exactly what they
 
01:55:48.410 --> 01:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
are facing but the issue is that because
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
of um the perceived risks in delivering
 
01:55:55.850 --> 01:55:55.860 align:start position:0%
this kind of care to Children uh whether
 
01:55:57.890 --> 01:55:57.900 align:start position:0%
it's foster care working with any kind
 
01:56:01.850 --> 01:56:01.860 align:start position:0%
of the the risks that they face that
 
01:56:05.870 --> 01:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
their access to insurance coverage is
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
um shrinking and they are fearful that
 
01:56:10.970 --> 01:56:10.980 align:start position:0%
they may lose access to insurance
 
01:56:13.790 --> 01:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
coverage so this isn't insurance
 
01:56:15.890 --> 01:56:15.900 align:start position:0%
coverage for the children
 
01:56:18.830 --> 01:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
this is insurance coverage for the
 
01:56:21.410 --> 01:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
organizations yes that are liability for
 
01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:24.719 align:start position:0%
handling is difficult cases thank you I
 
01:56:26.750 --> 01:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
feel much smarter now and well my
 
01:56:28.430 --> 01:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
mistake I should have been clearer thank
 
01:56:30.950 --> 01:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
you other questions yes representative
 
01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:32.030 align:start position:0%
you other questions yes representative
Merchant

01:56:32.030 --> 01:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
Merchant
 
01:56:34.189 --> 01:56:34.199 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr also
 
01:56:36.950 --> 01:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question I do
 
01:56:38.689 --> 01:56:38.699 align:start position:0%
understand what representative Edwards
 
01:56:40.790 --> 01:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
was saying is that the way it's written
 
01:56:42.830 --> 01:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
it it sort of implied that there's going
 
01:56:45.890 --> 01:56:45.900 align:start position:0%
to be a dissolution of the
 
01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:47.629 align:start position:0%
to be a dissolution of the
commission

01:56:47.629 --> 01:56:47.639 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
um after November 1st but would you be
 
01:56:51.530 --> 01:56:51.540 align:start position:0%
opposed to putting a sunset clause in
 
01:56:53.629 --> 01:56:53.639 align:start position:0%
there basically to be clear that this is
 
01:56:56.629 --> 01:56:56.639 align:start position:0%
going to end come November 2nd 2019
 
01:56:59.149 --> 01:56:59.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:57:02.149 --> 01:57:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:03.470 --> 01:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
so you know other questions thank you
 
01:57:10.729 --> 01:57:10.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:13.790 --> 01:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Keith Koenig
 
01:57:21.850 --> 01:57:21.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:24.109 --> 01:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair members of the
 
01:57:26.270 --> 01:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Keith kinning
 
01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
I'm the advocacy director at Waypoint we
 
01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
sit here in support of SB 236
 
01:57:35.330 --> 01:57:35.340 align:start position:0%
um so Waypoint serves a critical role in
 
01:57:37.310 --> 01:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
the community by providing ISO level
 
01:57:40.310 --> 01:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
foster care and this is foster care that
 
01:57:42.109 --> 01:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
we provide in lieu of the state doing
 
01:57:44.209 --> 01:57:44.219 align:start position:0%
this these are children that have been
 
01:57:46.430 --> 01:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
identified as abused and neglected and
 
01:57:47.930 --> 01:57:47.940 align:start position:0%
the state doesn't have the ability to
 
01:57:50.629 --> 01:57:50.639 align:start position:0%
serve them we do this is the most high
 
01:57:52.669 --> 01:57:52.679 align:start position:0%
level intensive foster care that you can
 
01:57:55.790 --> 01:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
have this is wraparound services that
 
01:57:57.350 --> 01:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
have kids that have gone through the
 
01:57:59.870 --> 01:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
most horrific parts of their life almost
 
01:58:01.609 --> 01:58:01.619 align:start position:0%
unbelievable a few to hear some of the
 
01:58:01.619 --> 01:58:02.930 align:start position:0%
unbelievable a few to hear some of the
stories

01:58:02.930 --> 01:58:02.940 align:start position:0%
stories
 
01:58:02.940 --> 01:58:03.890 align:start position:0%
stories
um

01:58:03.890 --> 01:58:03.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:06.050 --> 01:58:06.060 align:start position:0%
these Services allow children to receive
 
01:58:07.729 --> 01:58:07.739 align:start position:0%
community-based services in the home
 
01:58:10.729 --> 01:58:10.739 align:start position:0%
there is a critical shortage of iso
 
01:58:13.790 --> 01:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
foster care programs in the state and
 
01:58:16.850 --> 01:58:16.860 align:start position:0%
right now we only have eight of them and
 
01:58:20.030 --> 01:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
the problem that we are finding is that
 
01:58:21.470 --> 01:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
our insurance company called
 
01:58:23.990 --> 01:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
Philadelphia has allowed us to keep our
 
01:58:26.089 --> 01:58:26.099 align:start position:0%
main policy but they have pulled away
 
01:58:29.450 --> 01:58:29.460 align:start position:0%
our umbrella policy so any lawsuit that
 
01:58:32.149 --> 01:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
involves us over a million dollars we no
 
01:58:34.490 --> 01:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
longer can get insurance for we have
 
01:58:37.250 --> 01:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
sought out other insurance and there is
 
01:58:40.070 --> 01:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
other insurance out there but it is so
 
01:58:42.530 --> 01:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
prohibitively expensive as to almost be
 
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
it's the same thing as not having
 
01:58:46.850 --> 01:58:46.860 align:start position:0%
insurance we get a certain amount of
 
01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
money every day to take care of these
 
01:58:51.770 --> 01:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
kits and if the insurance is so high
 
01:58:54.290 --> 01:58:54.300 align:start position:0%
that we can't pay it because our the
 
01:58:55.850 --> 01:58:55.860 align:start position:0%
funding that we get from the state has
 
01:58:57.410 --> 01:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
to go to the people that are taking care
 
01:58:59.330 --> 01:58:59.340 align:start position:0%
of these children it's like having no
 
01:59:02.750 --> 01:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
insurance at all so we sit here not as
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
Waypoint even though we're asking
 
01:59:07.790 --> 01:59:07.800 align:start position:0%
Waypoint for Waypoint is asking for help
 
01:59:09.470 --> 01:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
we're sitting here asking you to help
 
01:59:12.050 --> 01:59:12.060 align:start position:0%
the kids because this is a program that
 
01:59:14.570 --> 01:59:14.580 align:start position:0%
needs to continue and we just because of
 
01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
everything that's happening we can't get
 
01:59:18.410 --> 01:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
the insurance we need anymore in order
 
01:59:18.420 --> 01:59:19.370 align:start position:0%
the insurance we need anymore in order
to

01:59:19.370 --> 01:59:19.380 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:59:21.709 --> 01:59:21.719 align:start position:0%
um run the program safely that any
 
01:59:23.810 --> 01:59:23.820 align:start position:0%
lawsuit wouldn't impact all the other
 
01:59:25.910 --> 01:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
programs that we have we have over
 
01:59:29.209 --> 01:59:29.219 align:start position:0%
nearly 350 employees we serve hundreds
 
01:59:33.350 --> 01:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
of Elders and CFI programs we serve the
 
01:59:36.109 --> 01:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
voluntary services and right now we are
 
01:59:38.209 --> 01:59:38.219 align:start position:0%
at risk that something that happens in
 
01:59:40.129 --> 01:59:40.139 align:start position:0%
our ISO program could spill over that
 
01:59:43.370 --> 01:59:43.380 align:start position:0%
would in fact you know impact the entire
 
01:59:46.129 --> 01:59:46.139 align:start position:0%
organization so what we are merely
 
01:59:47.689 --> 01:59:47.699 align:start position:0%
asking and I know I've heard this from
 
01:59:49.129 --> 01:59:49.139 align:start position:0%
other committees and I know the speaker
 
01:59:50.810 --> 01:59:50.820 align:start position:0%
is not crazy about commissions and
 
01:59:53.629 --> 01:59:53.639 align:start position:0%
committees I understand that but last
 
01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
year this bill came before children and
 
01:59:59.270 --> 01:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
family law it made it that far and a
 
02:00:01.490 --> 02:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
representative on the committee said I
 
02:00:03.350 --> 02:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
will take care of this I will work with
 
02:00:05.209 --> 02:00:05.219 align:start position:0%
the insurance Department we don't need
 
02:00:07.970 --> 02:00:07.980 align:start position:0%
to set up a committee I bet I don't have
 
02:00:09.530 --> 02:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
to finish what I'm going to say for you
 
02:00:11.270 --> 02:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
to understand what happened was that
 
02:00:13.010 --> 02:00:13.020 align:start position:0%
never happened there was no connection
 
02:00:14.689 --> 02:00:14.699 align:start position:0%
with the insurance department there was
 
02:00:16.790 --> 02:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
no follow-up and here we are a year
 
02:00:19.070 --> 02:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
later and we're in just as much danger
 
02:00:21.290 --> 02:00:21.300 align:start position:0%
of not having the insurance that we need
 
02:00:24.350 --> 02:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
I know Spalding has also had their
 
02:00:26.510 --> 02:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
insurance taken away from them I believe
 
02:00:28.970 --> 02:00:28.980 align:start position:0%
Easter Seals I believe Lisa Britt said
 
02:00:30.530 --> 02:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
she was going to send in testimony maybe
 
02:00:32.930 --> 02:00:32.940 align:start position:0%
she had to see Senate online but this
 
02:00:34.910 --> 02:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
isn't again just about Waypoint this is
 
02:00:37.850 --> 02:00:37.860 align:start position:0%
this is a trend that's happening that um
 
02:00:39.770 --> 02:00:39.780 align:start position:0%
agencies like ours are losing their
 
02:00:41.209 --> 02:00:41.219 align:start position:0%
insurance and when we lose our insurance
 
02:00:43.010 --> 02:00:43.020 align:start position:0%
we can't serve the children that need to
 
02:00:45.530 --> 02:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
be served all we're asking is for a
 
02:00:47.689 --> 02:00:47.699 align:start position:0%
committee to look into a solution to
 
02:00:50.689 --> 02:00:50.699 align:start position:0%
this problem I understand and I would
 
02:00:52.370 --> 02:00:52.380 align:start position:0%
have to tell you what would make me
 
02:00:54.589 --> 02:00:54.599 align:start position:0%
happiest of all is if everybody was
 
02:00:56.629 --> 02:00:56.639 align:start position:0%
happy with the solution and the kids
 
02:00:58.910 --> 02:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
were protected that's that's the goal
 
02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
we're looking to go for and so if this
 
02:01:03.709 --> 02:01:03.719 align:start position:0%
involves an insurance pool that somehow
 
02:01:05.629 --> 02:01:05.639 align:start position:0%
that providers of these Services could
 
02:01:07.129 --> 02:01:07.139 align:start position:0%
do or any other thought thoughts that
 
02:01:09.530 --> 02:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
people bring together but we can't come
 
02:01:11.209 --> 02:01:11.219 align:start position:0%
to a solution to this problem until we
 
02:01:13.010 --> 02:01:13.020 align:start position:0%
all sit down and talk about this and
 
02:01:14.629 --> 02:01:14.639 align:start position:0%
that's what we need to do right now and
 
02:01:16.790 --> 02:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
this is something that if we thought
 
02:01:18.770 --> 02:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
this was a short Trend that it was going
 
02:01:20.089 --> 02:01:20.099 align:start position:0%
away we wouldn't be sitting here
 
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
bothering you but because ISO is so
 
02:01:24.830 --> 02:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
important to these children we would ask
 
02:01:26.990 --> 02:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
you to support this bill merely to
 
02:01:28.970 --> 02:01:28.980 align:start position:0%
establish a committee for us to look
 
02:01:31.970 --> 02:01:31.980 align:start position:0%
into how Us and other non-profits can
 
02:01:33.890 --> 02:01:33.900 align:start position:0%
find some kind of insurance company that
 
02:01:35.870 --> 02:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
we can continue to protect these
 
02:01:37.609 --> 02:01:37.619 align:start position:0%
children so
 
02:01:40.609 --> 02:01:40.619 align:start position:0%
um that is what I'm asking and and on
 
02:01:42.890 --> 02:01:42.900 align:start position:0%
behalf of the kids in these ISO foster
 
02:01:44.810 --> 02:01:44.820 align:start position:0%
care programs thank you for listening
 
02:01:48.350 --> 02:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative Weber
 
02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:01:53.330 --> 02:01:53.340 align:start position:0%
taking my question just so I'm grasping
 
02:01:56.629 --> 02:01:56.639 align:start position:0%
the extent of the problem and the focus
 
02:02:02.350 --> 02:02:02.360 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh when you're saying
 
02:02:06.229 --> 02:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about the insurance
 
02:02:09.890 --> 02:02:09.900 align:start position:0%
um I see the issue of liability from an
 
02:02:12.910 --> 02:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
organizational point of view
 
02:02:15.770 --> 02:02:15.780 align:start position:0%
and the impact it could have on other
 
02:02:17.689 --> 02:02:17.699 align:start position:0%
programs if there was a catastrophic
 
02:02:21.290 --> 02:02:21.300 align:start position:0%
event and a catastrophic recovery uh the
 
02:02:24.589 --> 02:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
question I have is does the insurance
 
02:02:28.430 --> 02:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
that you carry cover the liability of
 
02:02:31.729 --> 02:02:31.739 align:start position:0%
the individual ISO foster parents as
 
02:02:36.169 --> 02:02:36.179 align:start position:0%
well or is that a whole separate problem
 
02:02:38.030 --> 02:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
02:02:39.470 --> 02:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
question I can't answer that right now
 
02:02:41.330 --> 02:02:41.340 align:start position:0%
but I certainly can get back to that my
 
02:02:43.310 --> 02:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
understanding my understanding is this
 
02:02:45.129 --> 02:02:45.139 align:start position:0%
is this is the insurance for a waypoint
 
02:02:47.870 --> 02:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
this is strictly four-way point but I
 
02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
will check into that with our our CEO
 
02:02:52.189 --> 02:02:52.199 align:start position:0%
um and get back to you and I I want to
 
02:02:54.169 --> 02:02:54.179 align:start position:0%
make everybody completely understand we
 
02:02:56.270 --> 02:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
are not looking for immunity we are not
 
02:02:58.310 --> 02:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
we're we are looking for the ability to
 
02:03:00.169 --> 02:03:00.179 align:start position:0%
buy insurance that we can continue to
 
02:03:02.149 --> 02:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
provide this program but I will get back
 
02:03:04.490 --> 02:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
to you representative as soon as I can
 
02:03:07.669 --> 02:03:07.679 align:start position:0%
okay representative Shapiro
 
02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:03:12.169 --> 02:03:12.179 align:start position:0%
for taking the question uh you know my
 
02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
limited experience with these study
 
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
committees is that they identify the
 
02:03:20.270 --> 02:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
problems and make suggestions of some
 
02:03:21.890 --> 02:03:21.900 align:start position:0%
you know recommend some possible
 
02:03:23.629 --> 02:03:23.639 align:start position:0%
solutions and it sounds like you're way
 
02:03:26.629 --> 02:03:26.639 align:start position:0%
ahead of the game in in regard to this
 
02:03:28.550 --> 02:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
um that you have a very specific problem
 
02:03:30.109 --> 02:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
that you're trying to address and you
 
02:03:31.729 --> 02:03:31.739 align:start position:0%
are the experts on it you know all about
 
02:03:33.229 --> 02:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
it so
 
02:03:35.149 --> 02:03:35.159 align:start position:0%
um that does that's not to say that we
 
02:03:37.490 --> 02:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
don't need a study committee but
 
02:03:40.850 --> 02:03:40.860 align:start position:0%
um I wonder if you
 
02:03:43.609 --> 02:03:43.619 align:start position:0%
you did bring up one idea but if you've
 
02:03:45.530 --> 02:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
done research into what possible
 
02:03:49.070 --> 02:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
solutions there are or researched what
 
02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:49.689 align:start position:0%
solutions there are or researched what
um

02:03:49.689 --> 02:03:49.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:51.910 --> 02:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
what um
 
02:03:54.649 --> 02:03:54.659 align:start position:0%
nonprofits use in other states to to
 
02:03:57.109 --> 02:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
deal with this problem
 
02:03:59.270 --> 02:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
02:04:02.149 --> 02:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
um I we we do we definitely know the
 
02:04:02.159 --> 02:04:03.410 align:start position:0%
um I we we do we definitely know the
problem

02:04:03.410 --> 02:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:04:04.970 --> 02:04:04.980 align:start position:0%
because we've had our insurance taken
 
02:04:06.649 --> 02:04:06.659 align:start position:0%
away from us and we definitely know we
 
02:04:08.390 --> 02:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
can't find Insurance in an affordable
 
02:04:11.330 --> 02:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
range I think as I said before there are
 
02:04:14.109 --> 02:04:14.119 align:start position:0%
many solutions out there there are um
 
02:04:16.490 --> 02:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
organizations that are here that have
 
02:04:19.669 --> 02:04:19.679 align:start position:0%
legitimate concerns about some of the
 
02:04:22.129 --> 02:04:22.139 align:start position:0%
solutions that might be proposed and and
 
02:04:25.310 --> 02:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
and they may oppose that and I think the
 
02:04:27.290 --> 02:04:27.300 align:start position:0%
thing that the committee would allow us
 
02:04:31.129 --> 02:04:31.139 align:start position:0%
is to get into a room and make sure I I
 
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
think the last thing all of us want is
 
02:04:35.629 --> 02:04:35.639 align:start position:0%
to get to the end of the committee and
 
02:04:37.609 --> 02:04:37.619 align:start position:0%
come up with a solution that people
 
02:04:39.050 --> 02:04:39.060 align:start position:0%
don't agree with or that they fight
 
02:04:42.169 --> 02:04:42.179 align:start position:0%
against I mean our our goal would be to
 
02:04:44.209 --> 02:04:44.219 align:start position:0%
find a solution that everyone around the
 
02:04:45.890 --> 02:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
table says yeah we can live with this
 
02:04:48.109 --> 02:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
the insurance department the you know
 
02:04:50.089 --> 02:04:50.099 align:start position:0%
the different organizations and we can
 
02:04:52.250 --> 02:04:52.260 align:start position:0%
put a bill in for this next session that
 
02:04:54.530 --> 02:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
would solve this problem so
 
02:04:56.570 --> 02:04:56.580 align:start position:0%
um I do think we need the weight of the
 
02:04:56.580 --> 02:04:57.770 align:start position:0%
um I do think we need the weight of the
committee

02:04:57.770 --> 02:04:57.780 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:04:59.629 --> 02:04:59.639 align:start position:0%
um to bring everybody together so that
 
02:05:01.729 --> 02:05:01.739 align:start position:0%
we can work together this has been going
 
02:05:03.350 --> 02:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
on now for three years
 
02:05:05.149 --> 02:05:05.159 align:start position:0%
we've brought the bill on numerous
 
02:05:07.490 --> 02:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
occasions like last year we thought we
 
02:05:08.870 --> 02:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
were very close until the representative
 
02:05:10.850 --> 02:05:10.860 align:start position:0%
said that he would take care of it
 
02:05:12.229 --> 02:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
um but I
 
02:05:13.850 --> 02:05:13.860 align:start position:0%
I think you're right we're very far
 
02:05:15.770 --> 02:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
along except for that last piece is we
 
02:05:16.850 --> 02:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
don't have a solution that everyone
 
02:05:19.609 --> 02:05:19.619 align:start position:0%
agrees to and I I think that obviously
 
02:05:21.169 --> 02:05:21.179 align:start position:0%
is the solution we need to get through I
 
02:05:22.310 --> 02:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
don't know representative that answer
 
02:05:24.530 --> 02:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
your question
 
02:05:27.350 --> 02:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up yeah yes it does
 
02:05:28.970 --> 02:05:28.980 align:start position:0%
answer my question and I would just say
 
02:05:31.850 --> 02:05:31.860 align:start position:0%
from you know my experience that dealing
 
02:05:35.030 --> 02:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
with some of the kids and families that
 
02:05:37.450 --> 02:05:37.460 align:start position:0%
will be served by these um
 
02:05:40.490 --> 02:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
you know wraparound intensive needs
 
02:05:44.270 --> 02:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
foster homes is complicated enough
 
02:05:46.729 --> 02:05:46.739 align:start position:0%
um and um it's very difficult to be
 
02:05:49.129 --> 02:05:49.139 align:start position:0%
successful with the treatment
 
02:05:52.850 --> 02:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
um the this shouldn't be one more
 
02:05:55.669 --> 02:05:55.679 align:start position:0%
problem that you have to address yeah
 
02:05:57.229 --> 02:05:57.239 align:start position:0%
and I would have to say my experience
 
02:05:58.850 --> 02:05:58.860 align:start position:0%
with the committee one of the most
 
02:06:00.770 --> 02:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
impactful committees I've ever watched
 
02:06:02.750 --> 02:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
was Senator David Putin's committee on
 
02:06:02.760 --> 02:06:04.310 align:start position:0%
was Senator David Putin's committee on
dcyf

02:06:04.310 --> 02:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
dcyf
 
02:06:05.870 --> 02:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
um that was Senator Putin who really
 
02:06:07.850 --> 02:06:07.860 align:start position:0%
moved things forward with a lot of the
 
02:06:10.550 --> 02:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
changes that happened to dcyf and funds
 
02:06:13.550 --> 02:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
going into dcyf so I'm very optimistic
 
02:06:16.189 --> 02:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
that with people generally caring about
 
02:06:17.750 --> 02:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
the children and both sides everyone
 
02:06:19.370 --> 02:06:19.380 align:start position:0%
cares about the kids we have different
 
02:06:22.129 --> 02:06:22.139 align:start position:0%
perspectives on how to get there but I
 
02:06:23.450 --> 02:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
would agree with you you know this would
 
02:06:25.189 --> 02:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
this would be nice not to have to worry
 
02:06:26.990 --> 02:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
about so much we'd like to get past this
 
02:06:29.510 --> 02:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
and do the job which we do which is send
 
02:06:32.089 --> 02:06:32.099 align:start position:0%
in five six seven eight people into
 
02:06:33.410 --> 02:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
these homes and give these kids
 
02:06:36.229 --> 02:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
wrap-around services to save their lives
 
02:06:38.629 --> 02:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
and it truly is let these children have
 
02:06:40.189 --> 02:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
been through they need their lives saved
 
02:06:42.229 --> 02:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
they need people to come in and help put
 
02:06:43.550 --> 02:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
their feedback on the ground they need
 
02:06:45.169 --> 02:06:45.179 align:start position:0%
support of these foster care families
 
02:06:47.089 --> 02:06:47.099 align:start position:0%
and certain this is something
 
02:06:48.649 --> 02:06:48.659 align:start position:0%
administratively that if we could put
 
02:06:50.750 --> 02:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
behind us it'd give us more more time to
 
02:06:53.390 --> 02:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
focus on the children so thank you
 
02:06:58.010 --> 02:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:59.570 --> 02:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and also thank you
 
02:07:01.629 --> 02:07:01.639 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
02:07:05.810 --> 02:07:05.820 align:start position:0%
what I I'm struggling with I see people
 
02:07:08.209 --> 02:07:08.219 align:start position:0%
from the legislative body on this
 
02:07:11.870 --> 02:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
committee which is what committee's for
 
02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
however I don't see other representation
 
02:07:16.010 --> 02:07:16.020 align:start position:0%
from the insurance industry and
 
02:07:17.930 --> 02:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
stakeholder Community
 
02:07:19.189 --> 02:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
um I think the intent here is probably
 
02:07:21.709 --> 02:07:21.719 align:start position:0%
to have him come before the committee
 
02:07:24.229 --> 02:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
and talk about it but would you have any
 
02:07:26.510 --> 02:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
thoughts on having members who are
 
02:07:27.890 --> 02:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
voting members of the kind it's kind of
 
02:07:30.290 --> 02:07:30.300 align:start position:0%
a hybrid between the two where all of a
 
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
sudden you have
 
02:07:33.290 --> 02:07:33.300 align:start position:0%
the voting members on the committee
 
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:36.020 align:start position:0%
comprise the legislators but also
 
02:07:38.030 --> 02:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
non-voting members coming from the
 
02:07:39.229 --> 02:07:39.239 align:start position:0%
insurance industry coming from other
 
02:07:41.330 --> 02:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
stakeholder communities because they're
 
02:07:42.709 --> 02:07:42.719 align:start position:0%
the ones that need to be at the table
 
02:07:45.050 --> 02:07:45.060 align:start position:0%
it's not just legislative body but the
 
02:07:46.810 --> 02:07:46.820 align:start position:0%
people at the stakeholder Community
 
02:07:49.609 --> 02:07:49.619 align:start position:0%
including yourself from that part of it
 
02:07:50.810 --> 02:07:50.820 align:start position:0%
as far as the people from the insurance
 
02:07:53.390 --> 02:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
industry people coming from that part of
 
02:07:55.550 --> 02:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
it would you I'm looking at some of the
 
02:07:56.689 --> 02:07:56.699 align:start position:0%
channel lead out there as well but I
 
02:07:58.729 --> 02:07:58.739 align:start position:0%
mean I think it's important we have all
 
02:08:00.830 --> 02:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders at that table and not
 
02:08:03.770 --> 02:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
just have legislative bodies there
 
02:08:06.410 --> 02:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
sure sure
 
02:08:06.420 --> 02:08:09.950 align:start position:0%
sure sure
mm-hmm

02:08:09.950 --> 02:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:12.350 --> 02:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
02:08:14.209 --> 02:08:14.219 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is that
 
02:08:16.669 --> 02:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
traditionally a committee is comprised
 
02:08:19.850 --> 02:08:19.860 align:start position:0%
only of legislative members and those
 
02:08:21.830 --> 02:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
members of the legislature the Senate
 
02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
and the house can then call on any
 
02:08:26.270 --> 02:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
experts in the field and all the
 
02:08:29.270 --> 02:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
stakeholders certainly they would be
 
02:08:32.089 --> 02:08:32.099 align:start position:0%
charged with seeking out testimony from
 
02:08:35.810 --> 02:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
the insurance department from the New
 
02:08:38.750 --> 02:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association for Justice from
 
02:08:41.450 --> 02:08:41.460 align:start position:0%
um uh perhaps the various agencies
 
02:08:45.589 --> 02:08:45.599 align:start position:0%
families that are in um anyone any
 
02:08:47.990 --> 02:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholder that would be the charge of
 
02:08:50.570 --> 02:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
the legislative committee what you're
 
02:08:54.169 --> 02:08:54.179 align:start position:0%
describing is would really be more a com
 
02:08:55.910 --> 02:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
a commission
 
02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
um it is a larger undertaking and a
 
02:09:02.990 --> 02:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
little bit less Nimble this bill really
 
02:09:04.550 --> 02:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
is for a committee and I think a
 
02:09:06.470 --> 02:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
committee can do the job if it's
 
02:09:09.470 --> 02:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
properly chaired and orchestrated
 
02:09:12.169 --> 02:09:12.179 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome representative
 
02:09:12.179 --> 02:09:13.430 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome representative
Weber

02:09:13.430 --> 02:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
Weber
 
02:09:16.010 --> 02:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
let's see here as as a follow-up to that
 
02:09:19.070 --> 02:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
question would you believe that the one
 
02:09:22.250 --> 02:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
of the most effective committees I ever
 
02:09:25.550 --> 02:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
sat on uh was chaired by at the time
 
02:09:28.370 --> 02:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
representative Nancy Styles then she
 
02:09:30.890 --> 02:09:30.900 align:start position:0%
became went on to be a senator and it
 
02:09:33.229 --> 02:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
was on the issue of truancy and she
 
02:09:35.229 --> 02:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
managed to
 
02:09:37.990 --> 02:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
assemble about 15 different
 
02:09:41.570 --> 02:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
constituencies that uh ranged from
 
02:09:43.850 --> 02:09:43.860 align:start position:0%
school school board teachers teachers
 
02:09:43.860 --> 02:09:45.430 align:start position:0%
school school board teachers teachers
associations

02:09:45.430 --> 02:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
associations
 
02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:47.109 align:start position:0%
associations
homeschoolers

02:09:47.109 --> 02:09:47.119 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers
 
02:09:51.890 --> 02:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
probation officers you name it and came
 
02:09:54.470 --> 02:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
up with a very effective set of
 
02:10:00.169 --> 02:10:00.179 align:start position:0%
parameters so it is a format that can be
 
02:10:03.770 --> 02:10:03.780 align:start position:0%
very effective and that the experience
 
02:10:07.550 --> 02:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
on that committee was that
 
02:10:10.729 --> 02:10:10.739 align:start position:0%
the people who came and they all came
 
02:10:13.970 --> 02:10:13.980 align:start position:0%
regularly to every meeting had such a
 
02:10:15.950 --> 02:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
stake in the outcome
 
02:10:19.189 --> 02:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
that they were motivated to be there
 
02:10:19.199 --> 02:10:20.689 align:start position:0%
that they were motivated to be there
yes

02:10:20.689 --> 02:10:20.699 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:10:23.689 --> 02:10:23.699 align:start position:0%
I would believe and I have a follow-up
 
02:10:27.290 --> 02:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
question and and isn't it true that if
 
02:10:29.330 --> 02:10:29.340 align:start position:0%
you have a commission that requires the
 
02:10:32.689 --> 02:10:32.699 align:start position:0%
appointment of outside people and you
 
02:10:34.810 --> 02:10:34.820 align:start position:0%
start the appointment
 
02:10:38.689 --> 02:10:38.699 align:start position:0%
in July when the bill is signed getting
 
02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
anything actually done by November is
 
02:10:44.450 --> 02:10:44.460 align:start position:0%
almost impossible yes indeed thank you
 
02:10:47.030 --> 02:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chair do you mind if I just say so
 
02:10:48.530 --> 02:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
representative I just want to say to you
 
02:10:51.709 --> 02:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
you have my word that as part of the
 
02:10:52.970 --> 02:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
committee we will make sure that
 
02:10:54.589 --> 02:10:54.599 align:start position:0%
everybody that needs to be there needs
 
02:10:56.089 --> 02:10:56.099 align:start position:0%
to be there because it does US
 
02:10:57.649 --> 02:10:57.659 align:start position:0%
absolutely no good to get the end of
 
02:10:59.689 --> 02:10:59.699 align:start position:0%
this process and have somebody that we
 
02:11:01.790 --> 02:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
haven't invited come in and say we don't
 
02:11:04.430 --> 02:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
we don't approve of this and so we'll be
 
02:11:07.250 --> 02:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
looking anybody that we're we are happy
 
02:11:08.330 --> 02:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
um and we can work with other
 
02:11:10.430 --> 02:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to make sure if they say we
 
02:11:11.750 --> 02:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
think that these people should be here
 
02:11:13.189 --> 02:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
they they should all be there and the
 
02:11:15.290 --> 02:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
committee has that power
 
02:11:17.209 --> 02:11:17.219 align:start position:0%
um and to call anybody and we want to
 
02:11:18.530 --> 02:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
work with everybody that wants to be a
 
02:11:19.490 --> 02:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
part of it
 
02:11:23.810 --> 02:11:23.820 align:start position:0%

02:12:07.370 --> 02:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
to look at the reasons why insurance and
 
02:12:08.750 --> 02:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
is so difficult to get for the

Association for justice which was
 
02:12:48.830 --> 02:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned it's a euphemism for the trial
 
02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:50.089 align:start position:0%
mentioned it's a euphemism for the trial
lawyers

02:12:50.089 --> 02:12:50.099 align:start position:0%
lawyers
 
02:12:53.390 --> 02:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
um and I am the unfortunate naysayer of
 
02:12:55.250 --> 02:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
legislation that was proposed three
 
02:12:58.729 --> 02:12:58.739 align:start position:0%
years ago that would have extended the
 
02:13:00.530 --> 02:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
same sovereign immunity that the state
 
02:13:02.870 --> 02:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
enjoys as well as cap on damages to
 
02:13:04.370 --> 02:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
these non-profits when they contract
 
02:13:06.050 --> 02:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
with the state we had serious concerns
 
02:13:08.209 --> 02:13:08.219 align:start position:0%
about that legislation I've been very
 
02:13:10.629 --> 02:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
happy to work with Keith to get to
 
02:13:14.510 --> 02:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
the study committee before you and
 
02:13:16.490 --> 02:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
regardless if I am called or not I will
 
02:13:19.129 --> 02:13:19.139 align:start position:0%
be at those committee meetings and offer
 
02:13:22.069 --> 02:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
perhaps unsolicited input
 
02:13:25.970 --> 02:13:25.980 align:start position:0%
um but you know I understand the
 
02:13:28.550 --> 02:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
um you know ISO the iso Foster Care
 
02:13:30.770 --> 02:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
Program is an incredible asset to the
 
02:13:32.569 --> 02:13:32.579 align:start position:0%
state and it literally does save lives I
 
02:13:34.370 --> 02:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
will also say that is a very small
 
02:13:36.649 --> 02:13:36.659 align:start position:0%
portion of the functions that Waypoint
 
02:13:40.250 --> 02:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
Easter seal Spalding Etc carry out and
 
02:13:42.229 --> 02:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
when we talk about you know the the
 
02:13:45.490 --> 02:13:45.500 align:start position:0%
issue of insurance you know
 
02:13:48.290 --> 02:13:48.300 align:start position:0%
two things that I hope are not
 
02:13:48.300 --> 02:13:49.750 align:start position:0%
two things that I hope are not
contradictory

02:13:49.750 --> 02:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
contradictory
 
02:13:53.149 --> 02:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
one um I remember when I was 16 years
 
02:13:55.729 --> 02:13:55.739 align:start position:0%
old my car insurance under my parents
 
02:13:58.069 --> 02:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
policy was very high for a good reason I
 
02:13:59.629 --> 02:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
totaled my first car because I was 16
 
02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
years old so their insurance premiums
 
02:14:03.410 --> 02:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
were raised
 
02:14:06.589 --> 02:14:06.599 align:start position:0%
um however this is also not the
 
02:14:08.270 --> 02:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
insurance problem that I believe these
 
02:14:10.010 --> 02:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
nonprofits are facing and I don't intend
 
02:14:12.410 --> 02:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
to speak for them I believe it is an
 
02:14:13.910 --> 02:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
insurance problem and not a lawsuit
 
02:14:16.310 --> 02:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
problem there are very few lawyers in
 
02:14:18.709 --> 02:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
this state that do the kind of work that
 
02:14:20.589 --> 02:14:20.599 align:start position:0%
it takes to
 
02:14:24.050 --> 02:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
sue these entities or file suit I
 
02:14:26.089 --> 02:14:26.099 align:start position:0%
believe Waypoint was only and Keith
 
02:14:28.010 --> 02:14:28.020 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong only I've only
 
02:14:29.870 --> 02:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
ever been named in a lawsuit once in the
 
02:14:32.470 --> 02:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:36.709 --> 02:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
but it is rare for many reasons that I
 
02:14:39.830 --> 02:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
can get into today or I don't have to
 
02:14:42.229 --> 02:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
um but anyway this is all to say the
 
02:14:46.010 --> 02:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
bill before us has been years long work
 
02:14:49.370 --> 02:14:49.380 align:start position:0%
that Keith and I have engaged in and you
 
02:14:51.950 --> 02:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
know we will be participating with the
 
02:14:54.169 --> 02:14:54.179 align:start position:0%
hope that you know everybody understands
 
02:14:56.209 --> 02:14:56.219 align:start position:0%
that this is not a lawsuit problem that
 
02:14:58.129 --> 02:14:58.139 align:start position:0%
this is an insurance problem
 
02:15:00.109 --> 02:15:00.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank you are you taking questions
 
02:15:01.129 --> 02:15:01.139 align:start position:0%
for sure
 
02:15:04.010 --> 02:15:04.020 align:start position:0%
do we have any questions
 
02:15:07.729 --> 02:15:07.739 align:start position:0%

02:15:15.890 --> 02:15:15.900 align:start position:0%
uh how impressed I have been with
 
02:15:20.870 --> 02:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
Waypoint over the years that that it's
 
02:15:24.530 --> 02:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
unquestionable there uh professionalism
 
02:15:27.830 --> 02:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
and the commitment to the care of
 
02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
children and I'm very pleased to see a

02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:36.589 align:start position:0%
former remember be the chairman of this
legislation

02:15:36.589 --> 02:15:36.599 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:15:39.470 --> 02:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
she's a good friend from the past
 
02:15:42.830 --> 02:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
so that I would strongly support the
 
02:15:45.890 --> 02:15:45.900 align:start position:0%
passage of this legislation and be
 
02:15:47.750 --> 02:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
willing to participate
 
02:15:50.569 --> 02:15:50.579 align:start position:0%
in the work of it
 
02:15:52.729 --> 02:15:52.739 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:15:55.430 --> 02:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
our representative Shapiro
 
02:15:57.530 --> 02:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:16:00.709 --> 02:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I'm understanding
 
02:16:02.810 --> 02:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
your comments about this is not a
 
02:16:05.870 --> 02:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
lawsuit problem I get I understand that
 
02:16:07.310 --> 02:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
um you're saying that these agencies
 
02:16:09.169 --> 02:16:09.179 align:start position:0%
have not been sued a lot and that's why
 
02:16:11.089 --> 02:16:11.099 align:start position:0%
the insurance is so high
 
02:16:14.750 --> 02:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
but so what what are you saying is that
 
02:16:18.709 --> 02:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:22.310 --> 02:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
I so I represent the plaintiff's bar so
 
02:16:24.050 --> 02:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
the trial lawyers
 
02:16:27.290 --> 02:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
um most of the time when we are in
 
02:16:29.270 --> 02:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
opposition to legislation the folks
 
02:16:31.069 --> 02:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
proposing that legislation or vice versa
 
02:16:33.709 --> 02:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
are insurance companies so I believe
 
02:16:35.690 --> 02:16:35.700 align:start position:0%
that especially since the pandemic well
 
02:16:38.230 --> 02:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
insurance companies have been enjoying
 
02:16:40.370 --> 02:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
huge profits and I'm happy to provide
 
02:16:41.810 --> 02:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
the committee with studies that our
 
02:16:43.610 --> 02:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
national has done in surveys they have
 
02:16:45.830 --> 02:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
done across the country while insurance
 
02:16:48.549 --> 02:16:48.559 align:start position:0%
companies are making record profits
 
02:16:50.750 --> 02:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
their insureds are not seeing the
 
02:16:52.370 --> 02:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
benefit of those
 
02:16:55.129 --> 02:16:55.139 align:start position:0%
I get it yeah thank you
 
02:16:57.889 --> 02:16:57.899 align:start position:0%
