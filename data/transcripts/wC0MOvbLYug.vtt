okay we'll open up the executive
 
00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 align:start position:0%
session uh just want to uh let the
 
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 align:start position:0%
committee know that next week uh Tuesday
 
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
is town meeting day so we will not be
 
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
meeting at all um so we we will be
 
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
meeting on Wednesday um we've heard all
 
00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
our bills so the only thing we really
 
00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
have left um is uh subcommittees and and
 
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
I will try to actually uh schedule all
 
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
remaining 23 bills uh as subcommittees
 
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
for next week some of them are actually
 
00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:10.599 align:start position:0%
already been done taken care of but that
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
will go through everything and that
 
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
leads the following week uh for time for
 
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
us to um wrap up those bills and that um
 
00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
we have to have everything out of the
 
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
committee on the 20th so we would
 
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
probably be having an exec session the
 
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
day the 19th uh in the morning uh
 
00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:29.319 align:start position:0%
similar to this where we get all our
 
00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:30.589 align:start position:0%
similar to this where we get all our
work

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:40.350 align:start position:0%
work
done

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 align:start position:0%
okay okay one two three four five six
 
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
7even 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 I would
 
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
quorum I guess the next count is how our
 
00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:01.879 align:start position:0%
mix okay okay 1
 
00:07:07.869 --> 00:07:07.879 align:start position:0%
2 three four five 6 7
 
00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:11.469 align:start position:0%
2 three four five 6 7
8

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:11.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:21.070 align:start position:0%
 
nine

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
one did I count wrong somewhere you said
 
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
six one two three no one two
 
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:33.800 align:start position:0%
oh I did Count wrong so it's 10 we're
 
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:38.680 align:start position:0%
10 right because we have one two four
 
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:50.950 align:start position:0%
10 right because we have one two four
five

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:54.029 --> 00:07:54.039 align:start position:0%
six I guess my math is bad today we have
 
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
nine we have nine okay and that means
 
00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
there had to be has to be seven dams
 
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:02.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:06.469 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:09.950 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
four

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:13.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
have why am i counting numbers wrong how
 
00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
many people are here total again I

myself

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
two three four five six
 
00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:46.070 align:start position:0%
two three four five six
78

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
78
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
four n and six nine and six is correct
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:08.360 align:start position:0%
okay N9 to seven
 
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
okay yes all
 
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
right okay first bill uh House Bill 185
 
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh relative to reimbursement rat for
 
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
ambulance service provider
 
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
representative spear second might
 
00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:22.839 align:start position:0%
representative pusk moves in expedient
 
00:09:22.839 --> 00:09:25.110 align:start position:0%
representative pusk moves in expedient
to

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
legislate as you all know this is the
 
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
one that uh uh We've is The Perennial
 
00:09:34.269 --> 00:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
one um and uh it basically is an any
 
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:35.800 align:start position:0%
willing provider for the ambulance
 
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
company so whatever they want to be paid
 
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
they get paid uh which is problematic at
 
00:09:45.509 --> 00:09:45.519 align:start position:0%
best any discussion on the motion of
 
00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to
 
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
legislate the only thing I'd like to say
 
00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
yeah is that by having it
 
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
such that the pro the ambulance service
 
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
is provid is is getting paid whatever it
 
00:10:08.829 --> 00:10:08.839 align:start position:0%
is that they require doesn't allow this
 
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:11.720 align:start position:0%
committee to evaluate what the impact on
 
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
premiums will be because the impact is
 
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
different depending on where they are so
 
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to hold this and
 
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
to make note of the fact that we have
 
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
two other bills that we are working very
 
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
hard on that deal with the same issue
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
that at least help us bound the problem
 
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
and bound the issue so it's not like
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
it's going to go away way it's just a
 
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
matter of well that's why we're itail
 
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
because this one is just a non-starter
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
so okay the motion clear is inexpedient
 
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
to legislate on 185 and the clerk will
 
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:47.680 align:start position:0%

00:12:13.069 --> 00:12:13.079 align:start position:0%
here I had 17 and uh representative
 
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
spear made the
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
motion okay House Bill 186 uh relative
 
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
to the legalization and regulation of
 
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis and making Appropriations there
 
00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
are uh representative Sullivan moves to
 
00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:27.959 align:start position:0%
retain second by representative Hunt is
 
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
there any discussion on the retain any
 
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
motion ye yes yeah I so I just want to
 
00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
say my motivation behind this so that
 
00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:37.959 align:start position:0%
people are aware is the most important
 
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
thing is that we stop arresting people
 
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
in 2025 for the possession of marijuana
 
00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
and while this bill would do this I
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
think the complicated part that
 
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
continues to trip trip up Us in the
 
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
legislature uh historically has been the
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
the method by which we're going to sell
 
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
it in the state so I think retaining
 
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
this will give us a chance to kind of
 
00:12:59.949 --> 00:12:59.959 align:start position:0%
flesh out some of those details
 
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
it sound at at our initial subcommittee
 
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
hearing on this um we all kind of
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that that's a steep hill to
 
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
climb to allow legalization and sale and
 
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
so hopefully this will give us some time
 
00:13:14.189 --> 00:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
in the fall to talk about this and
 
00:13:16.269 --> 00:13:16.279 align:start position:0%
hopefully come to some agreement and I
 
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
look forward to passing something in
 
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
January at least out of the
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
house okay any other discussion on the

Krist could next couple of bills we have
 
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
amendments for which I think are going
 
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
to be stuck in in their files you mind
 
00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
just going in the files and so we have
 
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
them in case and people need to see them
 
00:18:28.029 --> 00:18:28.039 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh represent Ammon
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
recognized speak to his
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
motion yeah thank you Mr chair so the
 
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
amendment uh to House Bill 302
 
00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:38.360 align:start position:0%
simplifies the bill somewhat it it takes
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
out uh some of the things that were
 
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
probably too complicated for this period
 
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
in time um things about stable tokens
 
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
and staking stable tokens uh but
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
basically what the bill does as amended
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
is the treasurer has a list of approved
 
00:18:59.710 --> 00:18:59.720 align:start position:0%
Investments that they're able to make
 
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
and this uh bill would add digital
 
00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
assets above a certain threshold so uh
 
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
high quality digital assets and then
 
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
also precious metals and the likely uh
 
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
the likely uh method would probably be
 
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
an ETF which would be an an extra an
 
00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
exchange traded product um the treasurer
 
00:19:24.149 --> 00:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
expressed interest in having the option
 
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh but is uh still determining when when
 
00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:29.960 align:start position:0%
they would use use it when she would use
 
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
it so uh with that all for the
 
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
amendment okay any discussion on the
 
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
motion about about to pass on the
 
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
amendment so represent sha I do have a
 
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
question on this so does this bill also
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
mentions the mix or is it to be
 
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
whoever yes so the the original Bill had
 
00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:00.200 align:start position:0%
up to 10% of funds and this drops it
 
00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799 align:start position:0%
down to up to 5% so it's between zero
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
and 5% would be authorized by the
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
legislation so so there's there's a a
 
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
maximum of a small percentage okay and
 
00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:14.039 align:start position:0%
the second question would be that so
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
will the
 
00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
person State treasure oh oh this is a
 
00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:21.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
okay okay you said okay yes represent
 
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh what is the definition of
 
00:20:32.909 --> 00:20:32.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
assets is it's in the bill um under
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
definition should be over the top of the
 
00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:40.919 align:start position:0%
so there's a market so there's a market
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
capitalization an annual market
 
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
capitalization of 500 billion so half of
 
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
a trillion so for a digital asset to be
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
considered by the treasurer under this
 
00:20:53.149 --> 00:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
bill it would have to have at least a
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
market cap of half a trillion dollars in
 
00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
the previous year so that that sets a a
 
00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
very high threshold should for uh you
 
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
know it's not it's not meme coins it's
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
not you know uh tokens that people are
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
playing with it's serious digital assets
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
that companies and countries are are
 
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
considering putting on the balance sheet
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
including the United States government
 
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
amendment yes represen Gibbs yeah thank
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
you um
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh I know that's a very high threshold
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
um but our digital assets regardless of
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
the threshold sufficiently reliable to
 
00:21:42.029 --> 00:21:42.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
money so that would be the determination
 
00:21:47.789 --> 00:21:47.799 align:start position:0%
for the treasurer uh this gives gives
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
her the option to do it it doesn't

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
in it so I know it was good
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
okay you all right we are back in
 
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:32.320 align:start position:0%

00:33:33.389 --> 00:33:33.399 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
451 establishing the paint product
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:45.590 align:start position:0%

0458

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:49.389 --> 00:33:49.399 align:start position:0%
H okay yes this is exactly the bill that
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
we were looking at the other time it's
 
00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
just now formal correct okay and is this
 
00:33:59.310 --> 00:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
correct yep and it's not to pass yet it
 
00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
it's ought to pass the motion is ought
 
00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
to pass on the amendment okay okay yes
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
represent Gibs um since we just got this
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
amendment yes um could somebody uh give
 
00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:12.919 align:start position:0%
us a brief explanation of what changed
 
00:34:15.069 --> 00:34:15.079 align:start position:0%
from the original Bill to this amendment
 
00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:17.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely so what we did with this
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
amendment is that
 
00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
um fundamentally most important thing we
 
00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:24.919 align:start position:0%
did is we took the money out of it there
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
is no at this point that the
 
00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
um the paint
 
00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:34.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturers um are responsible for the
 
00:34:37.109 --> 00:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism and that will be built
 
00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:39.399 align:start position:0%
into the cost of the paint and will be
 
00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:43.839 align:start position:0%
unbeknownst to us the idea is that um it
 
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
is a marketing program for them they
 
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
want to be able to say that they uh have
 
00:34:50.109 --> 00:34:50.119 align:start position:0%
a little sticker on their pack on their
 
00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
paints and say uh we'll we'll take back
 
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
any paint and even if this is not the
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
can you've got another can in the paint
 
00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:00.440 align:start position:0%
laying around the house bring it on in
 
00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:03.320 align:start position:0%
and we'll take it back for you and uh so
 
00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
this is a um uh a program we're just is
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation uh it has been
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
passed in many other states but in other
 
00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
states they they had money involved and
 
00:35:14.589 --> 00:35:14.599 align:start position:0%
and as far as I was concerned the money
 
00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
was a tax and we don't we don't do taxes
 
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so in this way um if if
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
there if whatever cost it is because the
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
paints the man the manufacturer The
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
Entity that's taking the paint back is a
 
00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:31.880 align:start position:0%
is is controlled by the manufacturers so
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
for all tens of purposes this is their
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
their their uh nature of their business
 
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
is to now take back any unused paint so
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
will not be attacks um I had some
 
00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
problems with the original bill because
 
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
it seems to be overly complex is this
 
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
any simpler oh yes I I think this is a
 
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
model of Simplicity
 
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
and uh common uh we passed we did get a
 
00:35:58.910 --> 00:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
copy of this bill before it just didn't
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
have a number on it and we went through
 
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
it in a lot of detail uh one thing that
 
00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:04.839 align:start position:0%
should be pointed out is that we had all
 
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
the sponsors here and they were asked
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
how they have felt about this bill as it
 
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
is modified and they were fully on board
 
00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
with it they said it does everything
 
00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
that they wanted to do right and Dees
 
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
was was great you know grateful that uh
 
00:36:21.069 --> 00:36:21.079 align:start position:0%
that this this is a and obviously um
 
00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
waste management companies and and
 
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:24.599 align:start position:0%
everybody who who does deal with garbage
 
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
they are happy happy that we are
 
00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:29.960 align:start position:0%
implementing this program um it is it is
 
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
you know obviously very one of the one
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
of the let see the the I how to be funny
 
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
about it but you know it's it was it's
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
always been a problem for solid waste
 
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
you know everybody to do what to do with
 
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
old paint and people have been leaving
 
00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
it in their basement and not doing it
 
00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:49.880 align:start position:0%
and now they have a golden opportunity
 
00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
that to take it into the local hardware
 
00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
store or local whatever paint store
 
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
nearby and home and get rid of it so so
 
00:37:00.109 --> 00:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that uh when a person
 
00:37:02.589 --> 00:37:02.599 align:start position:0%
purchases the paint in the store they
 
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
won't see anything on their receipt uh
 
00:37:07.309 --> 00:37:07.319 align:start position:0%

you remember what this was
 
00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:05.240 align:start position:0%
about this this was the glitch in our
 
00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
the system that that how long do I get
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
to write the
 
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
blurb what's that how long do I get to
 
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
write the blurb you need to have it done
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
by noon can I dictate it dict I don't
 
00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:24.829 --> 00:46:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
something2 otherwise I'll do it
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
okay um yeah so this is just a clean up
 
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
making sure that uh it was a kind of a
 
00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
glitch in the state retirement chance
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
didn't identify um uh children who might
 
00:46:41.109 --> 00:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
be under 16 but how can be a state
 
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
employee who's retired but still have
 
00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
children under 26 but who who are are to
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
ask how many others are those but the
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
key thing about this is that the person
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
who is insured who is covered under the
 
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
retirement plan pays for their children
 
00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:57.720 align:start position:0%
anyway it's not like state is paying for
 
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
the children just makes it eligible in
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
the program
 
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
correct if you're you're a state
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
employee that's retired and you and it's
 
00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:08.920 align:start position:0%
up till
 
00:47:16.109 --> 00:47:16.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
yes they can actually drink too yes
 
00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:20.680 align:start position:0%
represent Ammon yes so this bill is very
 
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
simple It just strikes the requirement
 
00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
that the child under 26 has to be a
 
00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:28.280 align:start position:0%
student so that and that was the Old Law
 
00:47:31.309 --> 00:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
that's yeah right a
 
00:47:31.319 --> 00:47:33.150 align:start position:0%
that's yeah right a

want to speak to your
 
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
motion uh right uh the we we spent quite
 
00:49:41.589 --> 00:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
a bit of
 
00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
time uh working over the bill and
 
00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
figuring out what we liked or didn't
 
00:49:48.789 --> 00:49:48.799 align:start position:0%
like about it and as a result of that uh
 
00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:51.400 align:start position:0%
some very important changes were

made uh and some very important things
 
00:49:56.109 --> 00:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
were eliminated but one of the important
 
00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
things the changes that were made and I
 
00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:01.640 align:start position:0%
think is should be noted by everyone is
 
00:50:05.109 --> 00:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
that uh blockchain businesses if they if
 
00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:07.480 align:start position:0%
they the blockchain itself is a
 
00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
technology it is not a business it
 
00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
becomes a business when somebody does
 
00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
something with the blockchain and if
 
00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
they choose to do data mining we've read
 
00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
in the news a lot of problems with very
 
00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
large data mining
 
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
operations that uh use a lot of energy a
 
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
lot of noise and make a lot of noise
 
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
what we did in this bill in the
 
00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
amendment was to take the noise and and
 
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
delegate it down to the municipality so
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
whever such a thing was ever to exist if
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
somebody wanted to make an application
 
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
to put a data mining business as an IND
 
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
industry into a town that town has the
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
right to set a noise level and that
 
00:50:47.549 --> 00:50:47.559 align:start position:0%
noise level would apply to any business
 
00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:49.559 align:start position:0%
that went into it so that seems PR
 
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
pretty reasonable blockchain it could
 
00:50:53.109 --> 00:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
has to be the same it would be the same
 
00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
for any business and it would be very
 
00:50:58.109 --> 00:50:58.119 align:start position:0%
limiting to a blockchain operation if
 
00:50:59.870 --> 00:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
they tried to be big but the other thing
 
00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
and and I I I have to stress
 
00:51:05.309 --> 00:51:05.319 align:start position:0%
this in the state of New Hampshire we
 
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
pay the highest uh the eighth highest
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
electric rates in the
 
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
country data mining businesses use a lot
 
00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.390 align:start position:0%
country data mining businesses use a lot
of

00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
electricity this is not the state
 
00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to come to to set up a
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
data mining
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
operation and on top of that 52% of our
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
electricity comes from nuclear which is
 
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
going to be retired in 2050 and we have
 
00:51:33.069 --> 00:51:33.079 align:start position:0%
no replacement for it so I can only
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
Envision by 2050 that we're either going
 
00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
to pay more for electricity or I don't
 
00:51:39.069 --> 00:51:39.079 align:start position:0%
know what we're going to do but the
 
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
point is we are not an attractive site
 
00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:44.440 align:start position:0%
for a large scale data mining operation
 
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
so I think that the complaints that were
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
against this bill
 
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
regarding energy usage are just
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
misinformed this is not the place where
 
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to set that up now you
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
could do home data mining you know in
 
00:52:00.309 --> 00:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
your house with with a bunch of
 
00:52:02.589 --> 00:52:02.599 align:start position:0%
computers you can do that but if you try
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
to do that in an apartment an apartment
 
00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
has the right to say based on the the
 
00:52:09.789 --> 00:52:09.799 align:start position:0%
your rental agreement that you can't
 
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
disturb the piece and it's the same
 
00:52:13.789 --> 00:52:13.799 align:start position:0%
thing that would be in a condominium
 
00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:15.640 align:start position:0%
that they have bylaws that say you can't
 
00:52:17.549 --> 00:52:17.559 align:start position:0%
make this kind of noise if you should
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
make enough noise chances are you
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
probably can't the noise is air
 
00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
conditioners right so what's left in the
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
bill is something that's that kind of
 
00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:29.960 align:start position:0%
says okay we're we we blockchains are
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
okay businesses based on blockchains are
 
00:52:35.549 --> 00:52:35.559 align:start position:0%
okay uh but there's a lot of Hoops
 
00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to go through
 
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
essentially you know I mean and and in
 
00:52:41.349 --> 00:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
all honesty people should understand
 
00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
that we're working on bill hp310 which
 
00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
sets up a whole commission to study how
 
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
these businesses are going to be
 
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
regulated so this is just to
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
limit the
 
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
noise and a few little items and also to
 
00:52:58.430 --> 00:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
set up a docket which doesn't cost
 
00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
anything uh the docket itself I want to
 
00:53:04.789 --> 00:53:04.799 align:start position:0%
mention uh is is only allowed it is not
 
00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
mandated is not required so I mean if
 
00:53:10.349 --> 00:53:10.359 align:start position:0%
the H Judicial System wants to set one
 
00:53:12.309 --> 00:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
up if the governor wants to set one up
 
00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
fine if he doesn't want to he doesn't
 
00:53:17.309 --> 00:53:17.319 align:start position:0%
have to so the bill itself is uh pretty
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
straightforward and pretty pretty
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
innocuous I I would have to say it just
 
00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
gets the words out there and one thing I
 
00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
do like about it it has a lot of
 
00:53:26.789 --> 00:53:26.799 align:start position:0%
definitions that a lot of people don't
 
00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
know about and I think the definitions
 
00:53:31.549 --> 00:53:31.559 align:start position:0%
alone are worth having this thing out
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
there that's what I have to say about
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
that represent Ammon did you want to
 
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a pretty good overview um so
 
00:53:41.109 --> 00:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
the energy usage there there's talk
 
00:53:43.829 --> 00:53:43.839 align:start position:0%
about using it's called high performance
 
00:53:47.309 --> 00:53:47.319 align:start position:0%
compute HPC so the AI data centers and
 
00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
digital asset mining can can partner
 
00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
with uh new energy sources we heard just
 
00:53:54.549 --> 00:53:54.559 align:start position:0%
today we heard just today that
 
00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
geothermal is a big Push by by the
 
00:53:59.470 --> 00:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
administration small modular reactors
 
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
you know I'm a big fan of that and
 
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
Mining can help make those projects
 
00:54:09.549 --> 00:54:09.559 align:start position:0%
initially profitable so it may not be uh
 
00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:12.280 align:start position:0%
in the current state uh advisable to
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
mine in New Hampshire because of our
 
00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:15.160 align:start position:0%
energy rates but this could help
 
00:54:17.589 --> 00:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
incentivize New Generation true which is
 
00:54:19.549 --> 00:54:19.559 align:start position:0%
kind of kind of cool and I just wanted
 
00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:21.839 align:start position:0%
to stress the uh the blockchain dispute
 
00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:24.200 align:start position:0%
docket was a recommendation from the
 
00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
governor's uh digital asset Commission
 
00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
it's one of the recommendations that we
 
00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
hadn't implemented yet so I'm glad to
 
00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
see that's carried forward with this
 
00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
represent San thank you Mr chair um I'm
 
00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
actually GNA vote against this
 
00:54:43.789 --> 00:54:43.799 align:start position:0%
motion I think that this is a as as was
 
00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:45.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned in in the testimoni in initial
 
00:54:47.549 --> 00:54:47.559 align:start position:0%
hearing this is a bill that is not
 
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:49.240 align:start position:0%
actually addressing a problem it's sort
 
00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
of prophylactic if you will and so I
 
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
think there I would I would prefer just
 
00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
to be on record I would prefer for
 
00:54:58.510 --> 00:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
retaining this bill so we could work on
 
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
it understand it better and let some of
 
00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:02.200 align:start position:0%
the people who have been reaching out to
 
00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:04.520 align:start position:0%
us in recent weeks have a chance to sort
 
00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
of digest this amendment that just came
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
out basically last night to them um I
 
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
think that much of what representative
 
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
spear is true I agree at the current
 
00:55:16.109 --> 00:55:16.119 align:start position:0%
state with electricity prices in New
 
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire very high at the national
 
00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:19.960 align:start position:0%
level it's unlikely we'll see such a
 
00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
large Center that I think is what is
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
scaring a lot of people nevertheless
 
00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
things could change in the future where
 
00:55:27.029 --> 00:55:27.039 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire suddenly be becomes
 
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
cheaper energy and and these regulations
 
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
are um something that don't need to be
 
00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
rushed through and I think it'd be okay
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
if we waited a little bit to sort of
 
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
digest this amendment and let some of
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
the people who are act activists on this
 
00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
space have a chance to digest it and
 
00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
then you know maybe come in and work
 
00:55:49.069 --> 00:55:49.079 align:start position:0%
with us in the fall so that would be my
 
00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
preference so I'm going to vote against
 
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
this and if this motion doesn't pass
 
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
that would be my recommendation is to
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
put a next Motion in to
 
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
retain representative
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair um the problem
 
00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
I have the amendment uh is a problem
 
00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:08.200 align:start position:0%
that I had with the original bill as
 
00:56:12.589 --> 00:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
well and that is the fact that um under
 
00:56:20.309 --> 00:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
um oo 359 V3 section 3B um municipality
 
00:56:23.029 --> 00:56:23.039 align:start position:0%
uh aside from the noise which um has
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
been changed to the benefit of
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities municipalities cannot
 
00:56:29.309 --> 00:56:29.319 align:start position:0%
impose any requirement on a digital
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
mining business that does not equally
 
00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
apply to all industrial Zone Pro
 
00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
properties and the problem I have with
 
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
that is the energy us usage problem I
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
understand the fact that digital mining
 
00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:43.720 align:start position:0%
operations are not that likely to come
 
00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire and that does make
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
sense and I understand that there are
 
00:56:51.789 --> 00:56:51.799 align:start position:0%
possibilities uh for the future as to
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
less energy intensive methods of digital
 
00:56:56.670 --> 00:56:56.680 align:start position:0%
mining but that is still spec
 
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
speculative and I think that um if a
 
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
digital mining uh operation is going to
 
00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
be located in New Hampshire that the
 
00:57:08.109 --> 00:57:08.119 align:start position:0%
municipality should have the option of
 
00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
controlling the energy usage um and so
 
00:57:14.789 --> 00:57:14.799 align:start position:0%
uh so long as that's in there I cannot
 
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
support the amendment or the bill uh I
 
00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:19.400 align:start position:0%
think that should be left to the
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
commission um as one of the things that
 
00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
they should
 
00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
consider um so I guess
 
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
point out to everybody when you look at
 
00:57:32.109 --> 00:57:32.119 align:start position:0%
the bill uh on the very first page uh
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
purpose and
 
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
findings and I I do this because
 
00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
um I I want to remind everybody that
 
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
this might be the only time you'll ever
 
00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
read this because once a bill is put in
 
00:57:50.349 --> 00:57:50.359 align:start position:0%
the statute this
 
00:57:53.029 --> 00:57:53.039 align:start position:0%
disappears and it uh would only be in
 
00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
those little yellow books on on session
 
00:57:59.230 --> 00:57:59.240 align:start position:0%
session books and what's important is
 
00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:02.200 align:start position:0%
that the purpose of the commission that
 
00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:03.390 align:start position:0%
that the purpose of the commission that
was

00:58:03.390 --> 00:58:03.400 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
created well and the purpose as as
 
00:58:09.549 --> 00:58:09.559 align:start position:0%
stated here is that New Hampshire wants
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
to say that we
 
00:58:16.029 --> 00:58:16.039 align:start position:0%
want this Tech new technology we want
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
companies to consider come to New
 
00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and do business here we're
 
00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
inviting them to do business
 
00:58:27.029 --> 00:58:27.039 align:start position:0%
here so
 
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
can a zoning board or someone you know
 
00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:33.400 align:start position:0%
say you know uh worry about the
 
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
electrical usage of this industry
 
00:58:42.309 --> 00:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
versus aluminum making which has a huge
 
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
amount of electrical usage no it's not
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate that we that they either can
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
say you can Zone you can Zone and say
 
00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:53.480 align:start position:0%
yeah you can come in and and you know do
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
a factory or not but to to say you could
 
00:58:58.589 --> 00:58:58.599 align:start position:0%
pick out an industry and pick on them
 
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:02.799 align:start position:0%
then that is really does fly so I
 
00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
understand you know you have pressures
 
00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
from your communities who are are kind
 
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
of freaked out about it and and that
 
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
that can happen um but at the end of the
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
day it's whether they would want to
 
00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
invite one of these companies to being
 
00:59:18.829 --> 00:59:18.839 align:start position:0%
to to come to their
 
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
town and and so it's a lot more than
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
just this legislation and this is just a
 
00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
little examp a public state of State of
 
00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire says we want to be
 
00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
inviting but I understand in terms of
 
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
you know whether you have those concerns
 
00:59:35.950 --> 00:59:35.960 align:start position:0%
but uh no I I don't think it's
 
00:59:38.190 --> 00:59:38.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate to you know to to have spot
 
00:59:40.349 --> 00:59:40.359 align:start position:0%
zoning and say okay well this particular
 
00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
industry we're not going to allow you to
 
00:59:43.470 --> 00:59:43.480 align:start position:0%
do it simply because you're electrical
 
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
consumer where there's plenty of other
 
00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:47.640 align:start position:0%
industries that are huge electrical
 
00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:49.799 align:start position:0%
consumers um I was looking at that just
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
today I was noticing this old store
 
00:59:54.109 --> 00:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
there was a storefront that was used to
 
00:59:56.589 --> 00:59:56.599 align:start position:0%
be an ague type store and and I noticed
 
00:59:59.309 --> 00:59:59.319 align:start position:0%
that they had three-phase power coming
 
01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:01.240 align:start position:0%
to there and that three-phase power is
 
01:00:02.589 --> 01:00:02.599 align:start position:0%
very expensive because this was like
 
01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
three or four this is right outside of
 
01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
Peter bro there was three or four miles
 
01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:07.960 align:start position:0%
to get that three-phase power to that
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
location and it's sitting empty right
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
now so um to the idea is that we want to
 
01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
be inviting and that's that's the
 
01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
purpose of this legislation and the
 
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
zoning is specifically says is don't try
 
01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:24.440 align:start position:0%
to pick on this one industry and try to
 
01:00:27.309 --> 01:00:27.319 align:start position:0%
be accepting and and supportive yes
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative Gibs uh thank you Mr
 
01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:31.720 align:start position:0%
chair um usually the reason that we
 
01:00:33.549 --> 01:00:33.559 align:start position:0%
would want to invite an industry to come
 
01:00:35.789 --> 01:00:35.799 align:start position:0%
to the state is because it would provide
 
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
jobs does digital mining provide jobs
 
01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely it provides jobs somebody's
 
01:00:44.109 --> 01:00:44.119 align:start position:0%
got to be sitting in front of that
 
01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
computer typing in stuff to get the
 
01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
computer to do what it's supposed to
 
01:00:51.549 --> 01:00:51.559 align:start position:0%
do sorry that would be one person it's
 
01:00:54.309 --> 01:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
not like a factory that would provide
 
01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
hundreds of jobs when I've heard sto
 
01:00:58.990 --> 01:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
about the huge entities that are doing
 
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
this I can't imagine that they only have
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
one person
 
01:01:06.309 --> 01:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
inside but representative Ammon uh could
 
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
you provide any additional information
 
01:01:09.829 --> 01:01:09.839 align:start position:0%
on that we could I mean I feel like
 
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
we've beaten this bill of death we've
 
01:01:13.309 --> 01:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
talked about it in two subcommittee
 
01:01:16.109 --> 01:01:16.119 align:start position:0%
hearings so it feel like we're
 
01:01:18.829 --> 01:01:18.839 align:start position:0%
retreading uh ground that we've gone
 
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
over for weeks and the amendment was not
 
01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:23.240 align:start position:0%
available last night I emailed it to the
 
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
committee on February 18th so we've had
 
01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
a couple of weeks to just his his
 
01:01:30.589 --> 01:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
constituents that being on the housing
 
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
committee I wasn't able to attend all
 
01:01:35.029 --> 01:01:35.039 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee meetings no so for me
 
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
you're not retre right representative
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
melier uh thank you very much I I think
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
we would learn more about how this is
 
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
going to work by not putting it on the
 
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
back table I think we should pass the
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
bill um we may find that there are
 
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
things going on that we need to add to
 
01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:54.760 align:start position:0%
it or change to it but you know let's
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
get it out there and and see what
 
01:02:01.309 --> 01:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:04.269 --> 01:02:04.279 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question I
 
01:02:06.029 --> 01:02:06.039 align:start position:0%
just wanted to know about a little bit
 
01:02:08.910 --> 01:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
more about the compliance cost related
 
01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
to it because I have done some research
 
01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
in New York basically many of these
 
01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:16.799 align:start position:0%
operations got closed because of the
 
01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
compliance cost so did we think about it
 
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
what kind of compliance cost we have is
 
01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
it something doable we don't want lot of
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
business to come and then they just
 
01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
close the
 
01:02:31.109 --> 01:02:31.119 align:start position:0%
business yeah so when you go into
 
01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
business you risk your own Capital right
 
01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:35.240 align:start position:0%
so that's up to the business uh you know
 
01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:37.720 align:start position:0%
owners to decide now you mentioned New
 
01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:39.799 align:start position:0%
York which is a neighboring state you
 
01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
know a nearby State and they did exactly
 
01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:45.160 align:start position:0%
that they put a a moratorium on mining
 
01:02:47.069 --> 01:02:47.079 align:start position:0%
they drove all the miners out of their
 
01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
state we're right next door you know
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
potentially we could send you know a
 
01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
signal with the bill that we're open for
 
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
business and one thing we're not
 
01:02:58.230 --> 01:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
considering is tax revenue so if you
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
have a a if you have a business that's
 
01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
making millions and millions of dollars
 
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
through mining they're going to pay tax
 
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
to the state and and local community for
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
property tax so you know there's
 
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
benefits to this including jobs thank
 
01:03:16.269 --> 01:03:16.279 align:start position:0%
you okay one more one more time
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
representa gives thank you Mr chair um
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
excuse me but I would like to go back to
 
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon with my question
 
01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
about jobs because I really don't know
 
01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so a mining operation involves
 
01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
electricians it involves computer
 
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
scientists it involves uh people that
 
01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
keep the grounds maintain the building
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
right so there's a lot of jobs some of
 
01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:44.039 align:start position:0%
them are high technical jobs involved in
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
maintaining these mining operations and
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
you know when you buy a cell phone in a
 
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
couple years after you buy it it becomes
 
01:03:55.150 --> 01:03:55.160 align:start position:0%
more and more obsolete right so the same
 
01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
thing happens
 
01:03:57.950 --> 01:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
with these mining computers because it's
 
01:04:01.269 --> 01:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
a giant race it's a it's a global
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
competition this these mining operations
 
01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
so they have to keep up they have to
 
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
replace their Hardware every so often to
 
01:04:11.269 --> 01:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
to make sure it's more efficient and uh
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
is more competitive with their Global
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
competition in order to find the digital
 
01:04:18.910 --> 01:04:18.920 align:start position:0%
assets uh in the mining operation so
 
01:04:20.589 --> 01:04:20.599 align:start position:0%
there's a continual upgrade that needs
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
to happen so all that contributes to job
 
01:04:23.039 --> 01:04:26.430 align:start position:0%
to happen so all that contributes to job
creation

01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
okay question clear is or ought to pass
 
01:04:31.029 --> 01:04:31.039 align:start position:0%

second by representative Manon moves
 
01:05:26.109 --> 01:05:26.119 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended and discussion
 
01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:29.400 align:start position:0%

okay um excuse me representative
 
01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
Sullivan when I've written the um
 
01:06:57.390 --> 01:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
Minority Report would you take a look at
 
01:06:58.670 --> 01:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
it with
 
01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:00.510 align:start position:0%

you're going to put in the vote and then
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%

okay okay and we say adoption turn
 
01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
adopted okay and then we have down here
 
01:07:49.589 --> 01:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
going click on regular calendar and
 
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:59.390 --> 01:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
Gibs Gibbs
 
01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:02.839 align:start position:0%
gibs and her motion should say her
 
01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
motion and and her motion
 
01:08:05.359 --> 01:08:07.349 align:start position:0%
motion and and her motion
is

01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:08:07.359 --> 01:08:09.269 align:start position:0%
is
it

01:08:09.269 --> 01:08:09.279 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:08:09.279 --> 01:08:12.390 align:start position:0%
it
okay

01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.549 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:14.559 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:22.510 --> 01:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
have this is the blur by right I wanted
 
01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
to add should I give it to you or should
 
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.870 align:start position:0%
 
Rob

01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
Rob
 
01:08:32.829 --> 01:08:32.839 align:start position:0%
yeah here here I'll tell you what let me
 
01:08:32.839 --> 01:08:41.430 align:start position:0%
yeah here here I'll tell you what let me
initial

01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:48.309 --> 01:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
it okay all right next up so this is 4
 
01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:08:54.349 --> 01:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
was okay next up is 648 relative to
 
01:08:56.669 --> 01:08:56.679 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage for glucose
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
monitoring um she left the room so um I
 
01:09:05.789 --> 01:09:05.799 align:start position:0%
move I move to retain uh this bill
 
01:09:09.309 --> 01:09:09.319 align:start position:0%
648 so it'll be me and second by
 
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
representative spear uh basically we we
 
01:09:15.070 --> 01:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
had an amendment we're we're been trying
 
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
to work around the good terms of how to
 
01:09:20.349 --> 01:09:20.359 align:start position:0%
find the resolve the big issue was
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
finding out exactly where the committee
 
01:09:24.829 --> 01:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
is on this um the science is actually
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:35.070 --> 01:09:35.080 align:start position:0%
um in terms of of what what is what
 
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
medications you should be taking because
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
it seems to be right now insurance
 
01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
companies allow you to get these
 
01:09:46.709 --> 01:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
monitorings units um if you are um uh
 
01:09:46.719 --> 01:09:49.229 align:start position:0%
monitorings units um if you are um uh
taking

01:09:49.229 --> 01:09:49.239 align:start position:0%
taking
 
01:09:52.990 --> 01:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
um SP insulin insulin yeah taking
 
01:09:55.870 --> 01:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
insulin so um it turns out that that
 
01:09:57.470 --> 01:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
there is some you know the question is
 
01:09:59.669 --> 01:09:59.679 align:start position:0%
what they say like like I take met
 
01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
Foreman is that does that make me
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
qualify to get one of these and uh
 
01:10:07.229 --> 01:10:07.239 align:start position:0%
because I've just reached the the A1C
 
01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
number threshold so we clearly we need
 
01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
to know a little more what is the where
 
01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
what is the proper threshold what of
 
01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
when we think it's appropriate to have
 
01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
these devices I know that represent
 
01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
Teresa believes that uh if your doctor
 
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
says you you should get it then to get
 
01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
it you should just be able to get it um
 
01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
and and but
 
01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
um at the end of the day the the doctor
 
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't is not driven by Insurance the
 
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
issue is that um someone might say well
 
01:10:43.470 --> 01:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
gee I I'm afraid of blood I'm I'm afraid
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
of I'm afraid of pinking my pitching my
 
01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
finger I don't want to do this or
 
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
something like that and the doctor says
 
01:10:50.910 --> 01:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
okay fine you should get this device
 
01:10:52.270 --> 01:10:52.280 align:start position:0%
well then we find out that this device
 
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
is incredibly expensive and and and in
 
01:10:57.750 --> 01:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
that you know when maybe the patient
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
really didn't need it their their their
 
01:11:05.550 --> 01:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
um sugar level you know is not that bad
 
01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
and so whether they have the test you
 
01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:09.400 align:start position:0%
know get it so we would say sure go
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
ahead and get it but you you know in
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
terms of the having the doctor order it
 
01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
but to have the pharmaceutical company
 
01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know having insurance companies
 
01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
having to pay for something that you're
 
01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
doing it because you you have pin
 
01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
pricking fingers issues or those kind of
 
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
things seem a little uh unnecessary yeah
 
01:11:32.110 --> 01:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
I I do have I you know so like you
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned the main opposition was that
 
01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
because right now it's the insurance
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
company they are deciding the medical
 
01:11:43.870 --> 01:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
eligibility of the device which is I
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
feel is not it shouldn't be that way
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
the the eligibility of the device should
 
01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:53.080 align:start position:0%
be determined by the doctor who is
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
seeing the patient because it's the
 
01:11:56.669 --> 01:11:56.679 align:start position:0%
doctor to understand patient much better
 
01:11:58.390 --> 01:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
than an insurance company can understand
 
01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
now the scenario that you mentioned that
 
01:12:02.669 --> 01:12:02.679 align:start position:0%
somebody can just say okay I am you know
 
01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
uh afraid of you know poking every day
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
so I need a medical device like that the
 
01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
situation scenario you presented I don't
 
01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
think the doctor is going to prescribe
 
01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
just based on that and if the doctor
 
01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
prescribes based on that then probably
 
01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
doctor has the doctor in all good faith
 
01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
should be writing a report like that
 
01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:21.080 align:start position:0%
that I'm prescribing this because my
 
01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
patient is afraid of getting uh you know
 
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
poked every day so there there goes the
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
medical eligibility that's a convenience
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
it's not a Med medical eligibility my my
 
01:12:35.149 --> 01:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
take was that when you decide a medical
 
01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
eligibility of a situation between
 
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
patient and doctor it's the doctor
 
01:12:41.950 --> 01:12:41.960 align:start position:0%
should be the one who understands and
 
01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
they should be the one who decides that
 
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
this is really required for that uh
 
01:12:52.229 --> 01:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
situation to not get worse for the uh uh
 
01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
for the diabetes to not get out of
 
01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:55.910 align:start position:0%
for the diabetes to not get out of
control

01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
control
 
01:12:58.350 --> 01:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
because diabetes is not just one reading
 
01:12:59.790 --> 01:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
that you poke and take the reading
 
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes you know that sometime A1C can
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
give you right right value sometimes uh
 
01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
you know you might have a right A1C
 
01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
however your blood color fluctuate
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
depending upon the time of the day
 
01:13:12.149 --> 01:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
depending upon what you eat so there
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of factors which only
 
01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
doctor understand is so all I just want
 
01:13:18.430 --> 01:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
to make it simple that the eligibility
 
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
should be decided by the doctor and not
 
01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
the insurance company and if the doctor
 
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
makes a you know some exception because
 
01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
of convenience then the doctor will put
 
01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
that and obviously in that case the
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
pharmacy and the insurance company can
 
01:13:33.629 --> 01:13:33.639 align:start position:0%
reject it because it's a convenience is
 
01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
not a medical requirement there's a
 
01:13:39.229 --> 01:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
difference of word and that's exactly
 
01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
why we need to retain it to figure out
 
01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
how we're going to write that language
 
01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
that's the devil in the detail here that
 
01:13:46.669 --> 01:13:46.679 align:start position:0%
we trying to figure out how do we make
 
01:13:50.830 --> 01:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
sure that that the doctor's intent is
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
based on the medical necessity not
 
01:13:57.390 --> 01:13:57.400 align:start position:0%
because it's convenient or uh I assume
 
01:13:59.669 --> 01:13:59.679 align:start position:0%
that when doctor start practicing they
 
01:14:02.669 --> 01:14:02.679 align:start position:0%
do they do they do
 
01:14:04.590 --> 01:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
write yeah this is your first time in
 
01:14:06.990 --> 01:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
the term and that this is a great bill
 
01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
for you to understand exactly that Dr
 
01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
patient SL insurance company Department
 
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
relationship and you're going to learn a
 
01:14:18.149 --> 01:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
lot today Mr chair this is this is a
 
01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
this is not a subcommittee this is an
 
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
exact session and I don't think we
 
01:14:24.390 --> 01:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
should be legislating the bill right now
 
01:14:27.390 --> 01:14:27.400 align:start position:0%
okay so you can vote no on retaining
 
01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
that's fine but I'm saying right now we
 
01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
want that uh the motion is to retain
 
01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
this bill uh we will talk you know work
 
01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:36.560 align:start position:0%

September okay we can work it further
 
01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
you say we in September every bill
 
01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
that's retained okay has to be is worked
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
on in September and October remember I
 
01:14:46.350 --> 01:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
talked about this before in September
 
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
and October and gets voted on uh out of
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
the committee and it's on the house
 
01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
floor the first week of January remember
 
01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
right I talked about how you want to be
 
01:14:58.189 --> 01:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
around the first week of January because
 
01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
all the bills that are retained which is
 
01:15:03.629 --> 01:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
like this one will be voted on by the
 
01:15:07.149 --> 01:15:07.159 align:start position:0%
Full House on in
 
01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
January so okay so basically certain
 
01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
wordings you you want to just go through
 
01:15:16.629 --> 01:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
wsh uh I thought the delineating factor
 
01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
of this was if the person had to inject
 
01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
insulin I thought that's I'm searching
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
for it in
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
verbage was that's a decision we have to
 
01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
make yeah so I'm all for making that the
 
01:15:34.629 --> 01:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
delineating factor yes okay
 
01:15:34.639 --> 01:15:37.070 align:start position:0%

01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
legislate would you like to speak to
 
01:21:13.679 --> 01:21:15.709 align:start position:0%
legislate would you like to speak to
your

01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:15.719 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:21:18.270 --> 01:21:18.280 align:start position:0%
motion yeah I
 
01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
guess you don't have
 
01:21:28.189 --> 01:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:30.910 --> 01:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
most of us are familiar with the way I
 
01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
do things in this
 
01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
committee and I
 
01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
spent every single hour of every single
 
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
day during the time off that we had when
 
01:21:44.350 --> 01:21:44.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of people went on vacation
 
01:21:49.149 --> 01:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:58.910 --> 01:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
but one of the things I found is if you
 
01:22:02.669 --> 01:22:02.679 align:start position:0%
go online and you can find a lot of
 
01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
misinformation and what I chose to do is
 
01:22:08.350 --> 01:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
only accept information that was either
 
01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
issued by CMS the cers for Medicare and
 
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
Medicaid systems or whatever they call
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
it and the Kaiser Family Foundation
 
01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
those are the only two organizations
 
01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%
that I felt would give me the
 
01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
absolute bottom line of what was going
 
01:22:29.950 --> 01:22:29.960 align:start position:0%
on as I presented in the
 
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee Medicare Part B deductibles
 
01:22:36.189 --> 01:22:36.199 align:start position:0%
as of 2020 are
 
01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
gone there are no supplemental plans
 
01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:41.199 align:start position:0%
that pay for that anymore there was a
 
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
plan F but that got discontinued there
 
01:22:47.229 --> 01:22:47.239 align:start position:0%
was a plan C by the way I loved Plan F
 
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
there was a plan C but that became
 
01:22:52.110 --> 01:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
Medicare uh
 
01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
Advantage there are some plans out there
 
01:22:59.950 --> 01:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
uh G and N I think I I didn't bring the
 
01:23:01.870 --> 01:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
paper with me but there are a couple of
 
01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
plans that will pay Medicare part A
 
01:23:07.310 --> 01:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
deductibles but that is if you are in a
 
01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
hospital for more than a 100 days it
 
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
will pick up the deductible that happens
 
01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
after a 100
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
days so right now according to kff kaisa
 
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
Family Foundation the recommendation is
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
typically unless you live in two St
 
01:23:26.990 --> 01:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
States you want to go with Medicare
 
01:23:29.229 --> 01:23:29.239 align:start position:0%
Advantage and the reason I say that is
 
01:23:30.750 --> 01:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
the network for
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
Medicare standard with a supplemental
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
even whether you have a supplemental or
 
01:23:37.310 --> 01:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
not the network is the entire United
 
01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
States with Medicare Advantage the
 
01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
network is more local that is to say
 
01:23:43.470 --> 01:23:43.480 align:start position:0%
within a couple of states of where you
 
01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
live for instance Nash uh New Hampshire
 
01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:48.719 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts would be a region of
 
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
coverage and Medicare
 
01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:54.639 align:start position:0%
Advantage in the now when medic Care
 
01:23:56.590 --> 01:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
Advantage has a it's almost a cons
 
01:23:58.590 --> 01:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
sliding scale a continuous scale from
 
01:24:00.709 --> 01:24:00.719 align:start position:0%
the very least expensive to the very
 
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
most expensive so what depends on your
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
coverage is the size of your network and
 
01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
your network can be as small as the town
 
01:24:11.189 --> 01:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
of Nashua and as large as the as the
 
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
area of Nash of New Hampshire
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts then it depends on the
 
01:24:19.390 --> 01:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
depth of the doctors it can be 30% of
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
the doctors in that area all the way up
 
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
to 70% of the doctors in that area and
 
01:24:27.070 --> 01:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
you pay for what you want and you pick
 
01:24:29.070 --> 01:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
out what you want and it's not easy but
 
01:24:30.990 --> 01:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
you can do that and they and I put
 
01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
together some tables that I sent to
 
01:24:34.629 --> 01:24:34.639 align:start position:0%
everybody that showed the research of
 
01:24:37.390 --> 01:24:37.400 align:start position:0%
what that is the biggest advantage to
 
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage is that you can go
 
01:24:42.669 --> 01:24:42.679 align:start position:0%
from one plan to another plan every
 
01:24:45.669 --> 01:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
single year and your and your uh
 
01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
pre-existing condition is
 
01:24:50.310 --> 01:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
covered there was a lot of questions
 
01:24:52.189 --> 01:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
about well people are very dissatisfied
 
01:24:54.109 --> 01:24:54.119 align:start position:0%
with Medicare Advantage yes that was the
 
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
case up until about four years ago
 
01:24:59.629 --> 01:24:59.639 align:start position:0%
they've done some improvements whatever
 
01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
it is but according to the kaisa Family
 
01:25:05.229 --> 01:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
Foundation the acceptance rate or the
 
01:25:07.950 --> 01:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
the number of people that are pleased
 
01:25:09.669 --> 01:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
with their Medicare Advantage is now up
 
01:25:09.679 --> 01:25:11.470 align:start position:0%
with their Medicare Advantage is now up
around

01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
95% according to CMS the number of
 
01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
people that move from Medicare Advantage
 
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
to Medicare standard is about 2% and
 
01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
back and forth It's both ways that's
 
01:25:25.910 --> 01:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
switching in both directions so that I
 
01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
don't we can't do much with that
 
01:25:30.669 --> 01:25:30.679 align:start position:0%
information but 95% raise uh success
 
01:25:35.070 --> 01:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
rate for a medical coverage plan to me
 
01:25:37.470 --> 01:25:37.480 align:start position:0%
is almost phenomenal but that's just you
 
01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
know that's my opinion the point is the
 
01:25:42.790 --> 01:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
cases that were brought to US during the
 
01:25:44.350 --> 01:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
hearing that we
 
01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
discussed it was not clear to any there
 
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
was we did never we never got enough
 
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
information to figure out why whatever
 
01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage plan they had had
 
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
failed in that particular case that we
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
were given we were not
 
01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
told and as a result of that we can't
 
01:26:06.189 --> 01:26:06.199 align:start position:0%
point to what the problem really
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
was when we had our subcommittee meeting
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
no one showed up so we couldn't do
 
01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
anything any we couldn't get any more
 
01:26:14.790 --> 01:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
information as to what the problem was
 
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
because everything online is telling us
 
01:26:18.669 --> 01:26:18.679 align:start position:0%
from the kaisa family foundation and
 
01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
from CMS the plan is
 
01:26:23.709 --> 01:26:23.719 align:start position:0%
successful so we have no choice we were
 
01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
also told by the insurance companies
 
01:26:27.790 --> 01:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
that if they were forced after the
 
01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
enrollment period to start covering
 
01:26:32.990 --> 01:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
pre-existing conditions because remember
 
01:26:34.629 --> 01:26:34.639 align:start position:0%
they are commercial providers it's not
 
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
the feds it's the commercial provider
 
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
that the rates for everyone who are
 
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
currently in those plans that are left
 
01:26:44.229 --> 01:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
like I still left over from Plan F my
 
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
rates are going to go up to support that
 
01:26:50.350 --> 01:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
so before we risk losing people in those
 
01:26:53.070 --> 01:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
plans losing my coverage because I could
 
01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
not afford it anymore we need to know a
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
little more information as to what the
 
01:27:00.109 --> 01:27:00.119 align:start position:0%
problem was and we don't have it so
 
01:27:01.470 --> 01:27:01.480 align:start position:0%
right now without any further
 
01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
information and only seeing that
 
01:27:05.709 --> 01:27:05.719 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage is actually
 
01:27:08.550 --> 01:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
working uh I think we have to itl this
 
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry for the long-winded
 
01:27:11.229 --> 01:27:11.239 align:start position:0%
discussion but I know there's a lot of
 
01:27:12.669 --> 01:27:12.679 align:start position:0%
people that have been writing all kinds
 
01:27:15.550 --> 01:27:15.560 align:start position:0%
of things about but everything I've I've
 
01:27:17.390 --> 01:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
received in the mail and everything that
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
I've heard has been based on emotional
 
01:27:23.629 --> 01:27:23.639 align:start position:0%
feelings as opposed to numbers what
 
01:27:25.669 --> 01:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
other the numbers of what's going on and
 
01:27:27.109 --> 01:27:27.119 align:start position:0%
I I think that that's an important
 
01:27:29.550 --> 01:27:29.560 align:start position:0%
distinction to make and that's where I'm
 
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
at representative mle did you
 
01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
have well just just my thoughts on this
 
01:27:39.149 --> 01:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
it it it looks like and and I would vote
 
01:27:42.109 --> 01:27:42.119 align:start position:0%
for it by the way but reluctantly
 
01:27:44.430 --> 01:27:44.440 align:start position:0%
because I think that that people made
 
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
the wrong decision up front and now
 
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
they're saying hey give me another
 
01:27:50.990 --> 01:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
chance it's like if I you know somebody
 
01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
buys $100,000 of life insurance the next
 
01:27:54.990 --> 01:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
day they find they got a
 
01:27:57.310 --> 01:27:57.320 align:start position:0%
uh a terminal illness they go back to
 
01:27:59.550 --> 01:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
the insurance agent and say you owe me a
 
01:28:01.669 --> 01:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
million dollars worth no you don't you
 
01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
you made them mistake but I would vote
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
for it anyway but that's my thought can
 
01:28:07.790 --> 01:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
I respond vot for the itl motion pardon
 
01:28:12.590 --> 01:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
when you say vote for it I I itl it I
 
01:28:14.830 --> 01:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
would actually pass pass it I would like
 
01:28:17.310 --> 01:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
to address that go
 
01:28:19.750 --> 01:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
ahead if you made the mistake and you
 
01:28:22.149 --> 01:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
did not get the insurance correct in the
 
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
first place if you think now now let's
 
01:28:27.229 --> 01:28:27.239 align:start position:0%
say my case because I've been on plan f
 
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
i there's no Plan F left there is no
 
01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
plan left in standard Medicare left that
 
01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
describes what the conditions were they
 
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
were talking about I got Plan F but if
 
01:28:39.790 --> 01:28:39.800 align:start position:0%
you leave it it's you cannot ever get
 
01:28:42.510 --> 01:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
back that's my because the plan is gone
 
01:28:44.229 --> 01:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
that's my whole point but the plan is
 
01:28:45.629 --> 01:28:45.639 align:start position:0%
gone it's not like it's an option
 
01:28:48.189 --> 01:28:48.199 align:start position:0%
anymore it's gone well it's the plan are
 
01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
Grand we have couple of grandfathers
 
01:28:53.669 --> 01:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
here and grandmothers no I am a
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
means okay so let's change it
 
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
grandparent yes I I just want to I had
 
01:29:07.870 --> 01:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
my hand up I just wanted to say that you
 
01:29:09.390 --> 01:29:09.400 align:start position:0%
know I think some of the contracts that
 
01:29:12.109 --> 01:29:12.119 align:start position:0%
these people had were really complicated
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
and they you know a lot of small print
 
01:29:16.830 --> 01:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
and they didn't read it and then you
 
01:29:18.669 --> 01:29:18.679 align:start position:0%
know I I I don't want to blame people
 
01:29:20.070 --> 01:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
but I mean you know I don't read
 
01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
contracts either a lot of them but you
 
01:29:24.149 --> 01:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
know you don't read it they're
 
01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
complicated and you find out that you're
 
01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.149 align:start position:0%
complicated and you find out that you're
in

01:29:28.149 --> 01:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
trouble Reon
 
01:29:33.669 --> 01:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
charesa so I know we had uh discussion
 
01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
during the hearing a lot of discussions
 
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
on this and uh what I just heard that uh
 
01:29:40.270 --> 01:29:40.280 align:start position:0%
seems like we don't have enough
 
01:29:43.510 --> 01:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
information to make a determination on
 
01:29:46.590 --> 01:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:29:50.510 --> 01:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
so you know uh there could be options
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
where you can I
 
01:29:56.910 --> 01:29:56.920 align:start position:0%
just you can put certain back billing or
 
01:29:59.070 --> 01:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
you know I mean certain penalty or
 
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
whatever to but at least allow them to
 
01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
get into what I'm trying to say is that
 
01:30:05.709 --> 01:30:05.719 align:start position:0%
there there could be options there lack
 
01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:08.280 align:start position:0%
of information right now so why don't we
 
01:30:10.229 --> 01:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
retain this bill to discuss it further
 
01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
why do you want to itl and completely
 
01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:12.390 align:start position:0%
why do you want to itl and completely
kill

01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:12.400 align:start position:0%
kill
 
01:30:16.470 --> 01:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
it um well I guess for the simple reason
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
is is that
 
01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
um I think we spent a lot of time in
 
01:30:25.149 --> 01:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
this bill and I know myself personally I
 
01:30:28.669 --> 01:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
I learned a lot um however as someone
 
01:30:33.109 --> 01:30:33.119 align:start position:0%
who just got you know just turned 65 a
 
01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
couple years ago and having gone through
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
this process um that I and and and I'll
 
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
say also for someone who's been around
 
01:30:45.470 --> 01:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
long before you know in Obamacare I mean
 
01:30:48.030 --> 01:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
I was around with the original in the
 
01:30:49.550 --> 01:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire past 7-Eleven
 
01:30:51.669 --> 01:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
with the guaranteed issue which is that
 
01:30:53.109 --> 01:30:53.119 align:start position:0%
the expression a guaranteed issue that
 
01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:00.109 --> 01:31:00.119 align:start position:0%
and it was very simple when you sign
 
01:31:04.510 --> 01:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
up that Advantage Plans is manage
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
care okay and most of us had have
 
01:31:10.350 --> 01:31:10.360 align:start position:0%
managed care in this small business
 
01:31:13.270 --> 01:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
Group market all right so it's not like
 
01:31:15.910 --> 01:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
or even your your RIS probably even your
 
01:31:17.189 --> 01:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
large employer they probably had the
 
01:31:19.149 --> 01:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
same so it's not like we're learning
 
01:31:21.669 --> 01:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
anything new like oh my God I didn't
 
01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
understand okay it you it's not really
 
01:31:28.189 --> 01:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
even even begin it's starter to know to
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
understand because in an advantage plan
 
01:31:33.310 --> 01:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
the one that everybody signs up for in
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which I did you know it's
 
01:31:37.470 --> 01:31:37.480 align:start position:0%
uh United Healthcare with
 
01:31:40.990 --> 01:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
o4 okay and they did try to sneak that
 
01:31:43.510 --> 01:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
AARP name on top of it but I don't you
 
01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:44.719 align:start position:0%
know I told him I want the one that
 
01:31:48.149 --> 01:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't say AARP on it okay but that the
 
01:31:52.149 --> 01:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
whole point of that was that no I have
 
01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
no monthly
 
01:31:57.990 --> 01:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
payments now this is not rocket science
 
01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
I have no monthly payments now if I take
 
01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:02.470 align:start position:0%
I have no monthly payments now if I take
the

01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:32:04.910 --> 01:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
traditional manage care
 
01:32:09.430 --> 01:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
I Medicare Plan it's not manag care it
 
01:32:12.750 --> 01:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
said we you're free to choose whatever
 
01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
doctor you want you're you're free to
 
01:32:16.590 --> 01:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
any Hospital you are
 
01:32:22.510 --> 01:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
free now but we're charging you 60 70 80
 
01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
bucks a month and that doesn't even
 
01:32:28.510 --> 01:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
count the dental I mean the U
 
01:32:30.669 --> 01:32:30.679 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical okay so if you actually
 
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
start adding the two of them together
 
01:32:33.629 --> 01:32:33.639 align:start position:0%
you're easily up to $100 a
 
01:32:38.910 --> 01:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
month so this is not rocket science one
 
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
I can go anywhere I want to go and about
 
01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:46.280 align:start position:0%
I have to pay $1,200 a year yellow one's
 
01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
free but you're going to have to stay in
 
01:32:52.990 --> 01:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
network I don't understand people say I
 
01:32:54.669 --> 01:32:54.679 align:start position:0%
don't understand it I didn't get it or
 
01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
you're you're smarter than the average
 
01:32:58.270 --> 01:32:58.280 align:start position:0%
person that you you figured that
 
01:33:01.950 --> 01:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
out okay now we find that there are some
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
people who are in those Advantage Plans
 
01:33:06.149 --> 01:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
and for whatever reasons they were
 
01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
talked into it or they misunderstood
 
01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
under or were confused or they whatever
 
01:33:15.229 --> 01:33:15.239 align:start position:0%
reasons and now they want to go back to
 
01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
plan well it turns out it's not that
 
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
simple it turns out if you want to go
 
01:33:25.149 --> 01:33:25.159 align:start position:0%
back to the the
 
01:33:28.229 --> 01:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
plan they're going to ask you do you
 
01:33:30.510 --> 01:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
have underlying medical conditions and
 
01:33:33.870 --> 01:33:33.880 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why you want to switch
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
back and that is what we tried to ban
 
01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
where we ban Obamacare band was that
 
01:33:45.709 --> 01:33:45.719 align:start position:0%
medical records know the your your your
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
health uh health study so again this is
 
01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
not rocket science why you have to do it
 
01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
and if you do that then then there's
 
01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
going to be a catch Well turns out
 
01:33:58.189 --> 01:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of other plans plenty of
 
01:34:00.669 --> 01:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
plans out there and there can be a plan
 
01:34:02.510 --> 01:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
that might says okay we'll let you back
 
01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
in we'll let you you really want you
 
01:34:06.910 --> 01:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
really want to pay us $1,200 a year uh
 
01:34:08.669 --> 01:34:08.679 align:start position:0%
we'll let you in and we won't worry
 
01:34:11.709 --> 01:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
about your some won't for us the state
 
01:34:14.109 --> 01:34:14.119 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire to start mandating this
 
01:34:15.189 --> 01:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
is totally
 
01:34:18.030 --> 01:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
inappropriate okay so that's the point
 
01:34:20.149 --> 01:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make any sense to this bill
 
01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
this bill was is is yes they're
 
01:34:25.550 --> 01:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
articulated in a problem that I never
 
01:34:27.189 --> 01:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
really thought that this about that
 
01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
because it seemed very straightforward
 
01:34:30.669 --> 01:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
to me but they're saying that this is
 
01:34:32.430 --> 01:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
important that people want us to address
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
this and I'm saying No this is if you if
 
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
you if this is if you don't like this
 
01:34:39.109 --> 01:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
you need to call your Congressman you
 
01:34:41.189 --> 01:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
need this has to be done in Washington
 
01:34:44.229 --> 01:34:44.239 align:start position:0%
because this is Medicare this is not New
 
01:34:45.990 --> 01:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire health
 
01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
insurance and that's the reason why I
 
01:34:49.830 --> 01:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
want to kill the
 
01:34:53.109 --> 01:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
bill okay so I I understand that uh you
 
01:34:56.109 --> 01:34:56.119 align:start position:0%
are you are concerned about people will
 
01:34:58.669 --> 01:34:58.679 align:start position:0%
people will be misusing it most of the
 
01:35:00.990 --> 01:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
time there's a potential that that they
 
01:35:03.709 --> 01:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
would be switching back and forth and
 
01:35:06.229 --> 01:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
and no but no the actual the actual real
 
01:35:09.629 --> 01:35:09.639 align:start position:0%
reason is if if we were to allow
 
01:35:13.070 --> 01:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
that then we are going to bring back you
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
know the the uh uh with the medical
 
01:35:16.990 --> 01:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
underwriting if you're going to bring
 
01:35:18.830 --> 01:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
back we you say well we're going to have
 
01:35:20.470 --> 01:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
Community rating so now we're going to
 
01:35:22.510 --> 01:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
get into trying to change we're going to
 
01:35:23.950 --> 01:35:23.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to change the
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
rates for those people who are in the
 
01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:28.679 align:start position:0%
Medicare we switching back we were going
 
01:35:30.310 --> 01:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
to mandate that that they have to take
 
01:35:32.109 --> 01:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
you then they're going to come back and
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
say okay well now the rates are not
 
01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
$1,200 it's now going to be 14 15 who
 
01:35:38.750 --> 01:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
knows how much more they're going to add
 
01:35:40.629 --> 01:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
but they'll add more and they say we
 
01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
need to do that to cover these PE sikis
 
01:35:45.149 --> 01:35:45.159 align:start position:0%
who are coming over who were in the
 
01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
advantage plan who decided they didn't
 
01:35:48.310 --> 01:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
like the doctor they were going to or
 
01:35:50.030 --> 01:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
the hospital was taking care of they
 
01:35:51.709 --> 01:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
want to go to see somebody else that was
 
01:35:54.790 --> 01:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
out of network oh well we we if we're
 
01:35:57.310 --> 01:35:57.320 align:start position:0%
going to have to pay more we want to
 
01:36:00.350 --> 01:36:00.360 align:start position:0%
charge more and no it it that's a
 
01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
non-starter we're not about to raise all
 
01:36:06.109 --> 01:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
the people who made that decision okay
 
01:36:08.350 --> 01:36:08.360 align:start position:0%
we are not going to raise their rates
 
01:36:09.950 --> 01:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
simply because there are some people who
 
01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
say they were they made a
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
mistake can I make one comment am iow to
 
01:36:18.390 --> 01:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
make of course and and I made it
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
before as of 2020 the plan that they
 
01:36:24.430 --> 01:36:24.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to go back to was the equivalent
 
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
of like Plan F and it no longer exists
 
01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
there's no plan to go back to yeah and
 
01:36:36.030 --> 01:36:36.040 align:start position:0%
according to CMS only 40% of people in
 
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
this country even want Medicare without
 
01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
Advantage 60% of people want Medicare
 
01:36:45.550 --> 01:36:45.560 align:start position:0%
Advantage when I was talking before is
 
01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
that we didn't have enough information
 
01:36:49.390 --> 01:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
there could very I suspect there is a
 
01:36:51.310 --> 01:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage plan and if they
 
01:36:53.790 --> 01:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
don't know how to find it
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
I don't even want to say I would help
 
01:36:57.109 --> 01:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
them but there are people that could
 
01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
help them figure out what plan what they
 
01:37:02.430 --> 01:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
need exactly there's plenty of choices
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
when it comes to Advantage plan I know I
 
01:37:06.270 --> 01:37:06.280 align:start position:0%
can tell you 13 different companies that
 
01:37:08.669 --> 01:37:08.679 align:start position:0%
mail me in that that month and a half
 
01:37:11.109 --> 01:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
you know you know starting November and
 
01:37:13.950 --> 01:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
in December that you know it overwhelms
 
01:37:17.070 --> 01:37:17.080 align:start position:0%
my mailbox you know like I I don't have
 
01:37:18.669 --> 01:37:18.679 align:start position:0%
to worry about having starters for my
 
01:37:18.679 --> 01:37:20.910 align:start position:0%
to worry about having starters for my
wood

01:37:20.910 --> 01:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
wood
 
01:37:24.189 --> 01:37:24.199 align:start position:0%
stove so so chairman so basically even
 
01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
if uh you're basically not giving any
 
01:37:29.310 --> 01:37:29.320 align:start position:0%
provision even if they are they might be
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
willing to pay some penalty or some kind
 
01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
of exactly they they could the penalty
 
01:37:34.950 --> 01:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
would be that when they do that medical
 
01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
underwriting there is a there is a
 
01:37:38.709 --> 01:37:38.719 align:start position:0%
potential of being a penalty but we
 
01:37:41.950 --> 01:37:41.960 align:start position:0%
can't regulate that okay but but there
 
01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
but there could be option to choose by
 
01:37:47.189 --> 01:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
paying penalty exactly okay and that's
 
01:37:50.229 --> 01:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:55.950 --> 01:37:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:56.669 align:start position:0%
 
all

01:37:56.669 --> 01:37:56.679 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:37:59.030 --> 01:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
right the motion is inexpedient to
 
01:38:01.870 --> 01:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
legislate is the question clear the
 
01:38:05.149 --> 01:38:05.159 align:start position:0%

say I I those opposed so moved
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
unanimously okay last but not least um
 
01:38:55.390 --> 01:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
House Bill 296 s um we had a
 
01:38:58.950 --> 01:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee yesterday and uh it got
 
01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
changed again um and uh o overnight um I
 
01:39:12.229 --> 01:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:15.390 --> 01:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
and the right now the way the P
 
01:39:19.310 --> 01:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
prospective uh amendment that we we're
 
01:39:20.589 --> 01:39:20.599 align:start position:0%
theoretically could have worked on the
 
01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
committee didn't have it so the
 
01:39:23.470 --> 01:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee didn't actually vote on it
 
01:39:27.390 --> 01:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment but was that uh there is a
 
01:39:29.470 --> 01:39:29.480 align:start position:0%
potential that there would be some kind
 
01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
of Federal
 
01:39:33.870 --> 01:39:33.880 align:start position:0%
grant uh that would make this paint uh
 
01:39:36.669 --> 01:39:36.679 align:start position:0%
not paint excuse me make this uh tree
 
01:39:39.910 --> 01:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
tree cutting or uh actually the one that
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
the former insurance commissioner
 
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
pointed out he says the number one
 
01:39:45.390 --> 01:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
complaints the number one problem is and
 
01:39:46.669 --> 01:39:46.679 align:start position:0%
this is you learn something new every
 
01:39:50.149 --> 01:39:50.159 align:start position:0%
day that that um is your roof getting
 
01:39:50.159 --> 01:39:51.310 align:start position:0%
day that that um is your roof getting
blown

01:39:51.310 --> 01:39:51.320 align:start position:0%
blown
 
01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
off okay and thatt and you say well how
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
do they how do you so what do you do
 
01:39:57.790 --> 01:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
when you're roof and I was trying to
 
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
explain this to my wife and I said so
 
01:40:04.030 --> 01:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
evidently there's a Code out there a
 
01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
code book and I want I want to get a
 
01:40:07.629 --> 01:40:07.639 align:start position:0%
copy of this code this is some an
 
01:40:11.470 --> 01:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
insurance Regulation Code book that um
 
01:40:14.350 --> 01:40:14.360 align:start position:0%
in which insurance company would say
 
01:40:17.550 --> 01:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
that okay that roof that you have did
 
01:40:20.910 --> 01:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
not have the proper joist nail the
 
01:40:23.709 --> 01:40:23.719 align:start position:0%
things that nail that joist down on onto
 
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
the roof and that's the reason why your
 
01:40:30.430 --> 01:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
roof blew off and so now whether they
 
01:40:32.030 --> 01:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
you know how they handle the claim I
 
01:40:34.709 --> 01:40:34.719 align:start position:0%
don't know but that they had this excuse
 
01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
that that's the reason why they weren't
 
01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
going to cover it and my wife
 
01:40:42.350 --> 01:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
said well well did shouldn't they tell
 
01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
you that ahead of time and I said well
 
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
nobody knows what's inside that roof no
 
01:40:48.510 --> 01:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
one knows what those grof choices are
 
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
and so that because it it you have to
 
01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
plan out from the contractor or what how
 
01:40:54.430 --> 01:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
they built or whatever you don't know
 
01:40:56.229 --> 01:40:56.239 align:start position:0%
this until it's over after the
 
01:40:59.589 --> 01:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
incident's happen so this legislation um
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
that we were going to work was on on
 
01:41:03.950 --> 01:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
potential that if you happen to know
 
01:41:06.070 --> 01:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
that your roof is not done properly or
 
01:41:08.310 --> 01:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
that you feel the roof is done properly
 
01:41:10.109 --> 01:41:10.119 align:start position:0%
or you really want to cut down that tree
 
01:41:11.470 --> 01:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
because you know it's going to fall down
 
01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
on top of your house that this was going
 
01:41:16.109 --> 01:41:16.119 align:start position:0%
to be help give you funding to to have
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
it removed but it was a federal Grant it
 
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
was the latest uh uh rendition of it
 
01:41:23.390 --> 01:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
because the insurance companies is as
 
01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
much as they want it they think it's a
 
01:41:26.990 --> 01:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
great idea they certainly don't want to
 
01:41:28.990 --> 01:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
pay for it they don't want to fund this
 
01:41:32.589 --> 01:41:32.599 align:start position:0%
thing and that um so at this point I
 
01:41:36.109 --> 01:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
think we should just retain it and um to
 
01:41:38.310 --> 01:41:38.320 align:start position:0%
see see what's going on in terms of the
 
01:41:40.109 --> 01:41:40.119 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism see there's some way
 
01:41:42.750 --> 01:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
to resolve this but um the idea of
 
01:41:44.669 --> 01:41:44.679 align:start position:0%
creating a program and saying we can
 
01:41:47.589 --> 01:41:47.599 align:start position:0%
accept it we'll let that happen um
 
01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
without understanding what the what the
 
01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
strings attached and that I think it's
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's premature for us to pass this
 
01:41:58.470 --> 01:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
representative spear I used to live in
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
Florida and uh not too far from where
 
01:42:02.589 --> 01:42:02.599 align:start position:0%
Hurricane Andrew
 
01:42:07.070 --> 01:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
hit and those houses that did not have
 
01:42:09.390 --> 01:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
the proper roof attachments all lost
 
01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
their roofs and what you do is they take
 
01:42:14.149 --> 01:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
a joist and they take a cable actually
 
01:42:16.830 --> 01:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
from the roof and and and pin it down to
 
01:42:18.430 --> 01:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
the basement well they don't have
 
01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
basements there down to the slab and
 
01:42:22.149 --> 01:42:22.159 align:start position:0%
every house that did that did not lose
 
01:42:23.790 --> 01:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
their roof and every house that didn't
 
01:42:25.709 --> 01:42:25.719 align:start position:0%
do that lost their roofs and the house
 
01:42:28.629 --> 01:42:28.639 align:start position:0%
would houses would destroyed it never
 
01:42:30.229 --> 01:42:30.239 align:start position:0%
would have occurred to me that New
 
01:42:33.030 --> 01:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has wins the likes of
 
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
Hurricane Andrew but I guess it's
 
01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
possible now Washington has the biggest
 
01:42:38.189 --> 01:42:38.199 align:start position:0%
wind in do they have a lot of people
 
01:42:40.070 --> 01:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
living up
 
01:42:42.589 --> 01:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
there we actually house it we have
 
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
people are up there all way along then
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
they better attach their roofs to their
 
01:42:49.070 --> 01:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
basements change on the RO do you think
 
01:42:52.109 --> 01:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
change on the roof to chain it down
 
01:42:54.510 --> 01:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
yes no it's funny you say that because
 
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
when I had a shed put in in our summer
 
01:42:59.149 --> 01:42:59.159 align:start position:0%
house in Rhode Island and which is close
 
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
to the ocean they that was one of the
 
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
things they did is they they had to
 
01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
strap and strap the thing down and I
 
01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
thought they were just trying to strap
 
01:43:09.390 --> 01:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
down the shed but it is true that that
 
01:43:12.030 --> 01:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
that cable was holding the roof down now
 
01:43:14.229 --> 01:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
that I think about it see you learn
 
01:43:17.870 --> 01:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:20.589 --> 01:43:20.599 align:start position:0%
day and they have a cat
 
01:43:23.910 --> 01:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah represent the Gibs
 
01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I seem to have
 
01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
missed something are we on 297 yes this
 
01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
was a non-gain amendment that was on the
 
01:43:34.430 --> 01:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
bill that and we had a hearing on the
 
01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
non- gerain amendment and had a work
 
01:43:38.910 --> 01:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
group and we tried our best to find a
 
01:43:43.589 --> 01:43:43.599 align:start position:0%
way to do this uh mitigation plan but it
 
01:43:45.430 --> 01:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
just at this point we're not ready to do
 
01:43:47.070 --> 01:43:47.080 align:start position:0%
it not withstanding the representative
 
01:43:48.669 --> 01:43:48.679 align:start position:0%
miles has has questions about the
 
01:43:48.679 --> 01:43:50.910 align:start position:0%
miles has has questions about the
underlying

01:43:50.910 --> 01:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
underlying
 
01:43:53.589 --> 01:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
bill so and that's still that is still
 
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
out there also
 
01:43:57.870 --> 01:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
so yeah I mean I know you already
 
01:43:59.189 --> 01:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
explained last time that why you have
 
01:44:02.310 --> 01:44:02.320 align:start position:0%
combined two two bills because this bill
 
01:44:04.030 --> 01:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
the name of this bill itself is very
 
01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that is true that was that
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
was the original explain that and uh so
 
01:44:10.589 --> 01:44:10.599 align:start position:0%
are we going to vote on retaining it
 
01:44:12.149 --> 01:44:12.159 align:start position:0%
because yes we're about to vote on
 
01:44:16.030 --> 01:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
retaining yes okay okay yeah because
 
01:44:17.629 --> 01:44:17.639 align:start position:0%
there I think yesterday when we talked
 
01:44:19.790 --> 01:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
about it there there a lot of cavard
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
that needs to be fixed one was like it's
 
01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
a grand first first Ser basis people
 
01:44:27.430 --> 01:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
might not even know about this uh and
 
01:44:29.189 --> 01:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
people only who knows they'll just take
 
01:44:31.189 --> 01:44:31.199 align:start position:0%
advantage others will not know and they
 
01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
won't take advantage so there lot of so
 
01:44:34.229 --> 01:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
you weren't too crazy about the idea in
 
01:44:37.350 --> 01:44:37.360 align:start position:0%

529 might look a little bit familiar um

so the primary function of this bill is
 
03:29:43.510 --> 03:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
um similar to a bill I filed last year
 
03:29:46.429 --> 03:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
um it extends the last call for on
 
03:29:48.269 --> 03:29:48.279 align:start position:0%
on-site alcohol service from 1 to 2:
 
03:29:50.870 --> 03:29:50.880 align:start position:0%

03:30:36.910 --> 03:30:36.920 align:start position:0%
closing times in the country most States
 
03:30:39.070 --> 03:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
set a 2 a. last call including many of
 
03:30:41.630 --> 03:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
our neighbors in the Northeast um laws
 
03:30:43.550 --> 03:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
related to off-site or in store liquor
 
03:30:45.950 --> 03:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
sales are a bit more of a patchwork how
 
03:30:47.710 --> 03:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
ever New Hampshire leans on the earliest
 
03:30:49.910 --> 03:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
side there too um for example Maine
 
03:30:51.590 --> 03:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
allows alcohol to be sold until 1:00
 
03:30:53.950 --> 03:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
a.m. um and New York allows beer to be
 
03:30:56.030 --> 03:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
sold 24 hours and liquor and wine to be
 
03:30:58.189 --> 03:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
sold until midnight and then lastly
 
03:31:00.349 --> 03:31:00.359 align:start position:0%
regarding the concept of to-go cocktails
 
03:31:02.469 --> 03:31:02.479 align:start position:0%
um this has evolved from a CO era safety
 
03:31:04.710 --> 03:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
precaution to a longer term business
 
03:31:07.630 --> 03:31:07.640 align:start position:0%
model and 27 States at this time have
 
03:31:09.429 --> 03:31:09.439 align:start position:0%
permanently legalized to go cocktails
 
03:31:11.990 --> 03:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
including Massachusetts Rhode Island
 
03:31:14.710 --> 03:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and Maine um so
 
03:31:16.070 --> 03:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
understanding that the topic can be a
 
03:31:18.590 --> 03:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
bit controversial um you might wonder
 
03:31:20.870 --> 03:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
why I am reintroducing this bill and
 
03:31:22.870 --> 03:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
adding some additional language um
 
03:31:24.590 --> 03:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
personally I think that as the Live Free
 
03:31:26.269 --> 03:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
or Die state New Hampshire should be a
 
03:31:28.670 --> 03:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
leader in personal freedom and this is
 
03:31:30.710 --> 03:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
an area where we can easily offer
 
03:31:34.229 --> 03:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
consumers more Choice um HB 529 uh will
 
03:31:36.349 --> 03:31:36.359 align:start position:0%
align our liquor laws more closely with
 
03:31:38.030 --> 03:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
our neighbors uh while making our state
 
03:31:39.910 --> 03:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
more competitive particularly when it
 
03:31:41.389 --> 03:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
comes to attracting young people to the
 
03:31:43.469 --> 03:31:43.479 align:start position:0%
state although last call time is
 
03:31:45.349 --> 03:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
unlikely to make or break someone's
 
03:31:46.630 --> 03:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
decision to build their life in New
 
03:31:48.269 --> 03:31:48.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it might make someone more
 
03:31:49.670 --> 03:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
likely to choose New Hampshire as their
 
03:31:51.590 --> 03:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
destination for a wedding or a corporate
 
03:31:53.830 --> 03:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
retreat rather than Massachusetts or
 
03:31:56.110 --> 03:31:56.120 align:start position:0%
Vermont um so I'm sure we all know the
 
03:31:57.830 --> 03:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
adage that nothing good happens after
 
03:32:00.110 --> 03:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
midnight um but personally I I also
 
03:32:01.630 --> 03:32:01.640 align:start position:0%
believe that night life and social
 
03:32:03.550 --> 03:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
experiences overall play an important
 
03:32:06.150 --> 03:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
cultural and psychological role as Ellen
 
03:32:07.750 --> 03:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
Cushing wrote in her article for the
 
03:32:10.830 --> 03:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
Atlantic we need to party more only 4.1%
 
03:32:12.670 --> 03:32:12.680 align:start position:0%
of Americans attended or hosted a social
 
03:32:14.269 --> 03:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
event on an average weekend or holiday
 
03:32:18.229 --> 03:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
in 2023 which is a 35% decrease since 20
 
03:32:20.429 --> 03:32:20.439 align:start position:0%
2004 at the same time we've seen that
 
03:32:22.309 --> 03:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
loneliness anxiety and depression have
 
03:32:24.030 --> 03:32:24.040 align:start position:0%
increased especially among younger
 
03:32:26.550 --> 03:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
adults and I am not suggesting that HB
 
03:32:28.469 --> 03:32:28.479 align:start position:0%
529 is the answer to our loneliness
 
03:32:30.590 --> 03:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
crisis and definitely going out to the
 
03:32:31.630 --> 03:32:31.640 align:start position:0%
bar with your friends is not a
 
03:32:33.189 --> 03:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
replacement for a good therapist or
 
03:32:35.870 --> 03:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
medical attention um however creating
 
03:32:37.269 --> 03:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
environment where people can come
 
03:32:38.510 --> 03:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
together enjoy a night out and
 
03:32:40.389 --> 03:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
contribute to the local economy can
 
03:32:42.469 --> 03:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
definitely have a positive impact the
 
03:32:44.910 --> 03:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
consumer Choice centers 20 thou uh 2023
 
03:32:46.830 --> 03:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
nightlife index reported that cities
 
03:32:48.110 --> 03:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
that were ranked as more welcoming
 
03:32:50.030 --> 03:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
tended to have later closing times
 
03:32:51.590 --> 03:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
suggesting that being open to Night Life
 
03:32:53.510 --> 03:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
is a net positive for
 
03:32:56.030 --> 03:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities and understandably um
 
03:32:57.269 --> 03:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
you're probably concerned about the
 
03:32:58.830 --> 03:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
public safety impact of more permissive
 
03:33:00.950 --> 03:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
liquor laws however the data available
 
03:33:02.389 --> 03:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily point to a clear
 
03:33:04.510 --> 03:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
correlation between bar closing times
 
03:33:07.189 --> 03:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
and unsafe behavior um in Minnesota they
 
03:33:10.189 --> 03:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
found that um after extending last call
 
03:33:11.870 --> 03:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
um there were a higher number of uh
 
03:33:13.830 --> 03:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
people charged with DUIs however they
 
03:33:15.349 --> 03:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
had also increased the police presence
 
03:33:17.150 --> 03:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
leading up to this change and they did
 
03:33:18.790 --> 03:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
not find a significant difference in the
 
03:33:20.670 --> 03:33:20.680 align:start position:0%
blood alcohol content in those charged
 
03:33:22.550 --> 03:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
before or after the policy change
 
03:33:25.030 --> 03:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
suggesting that it was the um the
 
03:33:26.990 --> 03:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
benefit of the the proactive policing
 
03:33:29.550 --> 03:33:29.560 align:start position:0%
more so than a change in behavior um a
 
03:33:31.910 --> 03:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
2002 study also found that drunk driving
 
03:33:33.309 --> 03:33:33.319 align:start position:0%
rates were more closely correlated with
 
03:33:34.950 --> 03:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
the number of restaurants in an area but
 
03:33:37.590 --> 03:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
not bars um and most significantly um we
 
03:33:39.150 --> 03:33:39.160 align:start position:0%
saw that drunk driving increase during
 
03:33:40.469 --> 03:33:40.479 align:start position:0%
covid when bars and restaurants were
 
03:33:43.150 --> 03:33:43.160 align:start position:0%
closed all together um and anecdotally
 
03:33:44.630 --> 03:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
I've heard from friends in the bar and
 
03:33:46.630 --> 03:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
restaurant industry that when last call
 
03:33:49.189 --> 03:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
time is earlier um patrons can sometimes
 
03:33:51.309 --> 03:33:51.319 align:start position:0%
feel the pressure to drink more alcohol
 
03:33:52.950 --> 03:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
more quickly in order to beat the clock
 
03:33:55.910 --> 03:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
where when um they expect the bar to be
 
03:33:57.469 --> 03:33:57.479 align:start position:0%
open later they might Pace themselves
 
03:34:01.950 --> 03:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
more so um not a scientific stat but um
 
03:34:03.550 --> 03:34:03.560 align:start position:0%
it kind of indicates that looking at the
 
03:34:05.790 --> 03:34:05.800 align:start position:0%
research together um unsafe drinking
 
03:34:07.389 --> 03:34:07.399 align:start position:0%
behaviors are more closely related to
 
03:34:09.910 --> 03:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
more complex social and personal factors
 
03:34:12.830 --> 03:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
um versus just last call time in itself
 
03:34:14.429 --> 03:34:14.439 align:start position:0%
um to-go drinks also don't seem to be
 
03:34:16.429 --> 03:34:16.439 align:start position:0%
associated with clear public saf risks
 
03:34:18.150 --> 03:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
um I've included some research on your
 
03:34:21.910 --> 03:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
desk for your um your review but um in
 
03:34:24.189 --> 03:34:24.199 align:start position:0%
2023 the Virginia Alcohol Beverage
 
03:34:25.510 --> 03:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
Control Authority reported that
 
03:34:27.389 --> 03:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
compliance with underage drinking laws
 
03:34:29.030 --> 03:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
was similar for venue selling tog go
 
03:34:30.389 --> 03:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
cocktails and traditional brick-and
 
03:34:33.070 --> 03:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
morar restaurants um the problematic
 
03:34:34.830 --> 03:34:34.840 align:start position:0%
factor in terms of compliance was
 
03:34:37.030 --> 03:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
third-party delivery services but even
 
03:34:38.429 --> 03:34:38.439 align:start position:0%
then they improved their compliance in
 
03:34:40.150 --> 03:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
2024 to over
 
03:34:42.429 --> 03:34:42.439 align:start position:0%
90% um states that allowed alcohol
 
03:34:43.870 --> 03:34:43.880 align:start position:0%
delivery during the pandemic also
 
03:34:46.070 --> 03:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
reported decreases in underage drinking
 
03:34:47.910 --> 03:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
as well as a lower rise in pandemic era
 
03:34:49.950 --> 03:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
drinking rates compared to those that
 
03:34:51.830 --> 03:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
did not again suggesting that there's
 
03:34:54.389 --> 03:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
more deeper factors at play than um the
 
03:34:56.790 --> 03:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
availability of these Services um so
 
03:34:58.830 --> 03:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
taking uh together this data does not
 
03:35:00.309 --> 03:35:00.319 align:start position:0%
show a clear relationship between
 
03:35:02.510 --> 03:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
policies such as later last call times
 
03:35:04.710 --> 03:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
or tog go cocktails and rates of drunk
 
03:35:07.710 --> 03:35:07.720 align:start position:0%
driving um under HB 529 venues will
 
03:35:09.229 --> 03:35:09.239 align:start position:0%
still be responsible for ensuring their
 
03:35:11.389 --> 03:35:11.399 align:start position:0%
customer sa safety including not over
 
03:35:13.309 --> 03:35:13.319 align:start position:0%
serving not letting people drive home
 
03:35:16.269 --> 03:35:16.279 align:start position:0%
who are drinking um and not serving min
 
03:35:18.469 --> 03:35:18.479 align:start position:0%
um so police are still empowered to
 
03:35:20.870 --> 03:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
enforce laws to protect their community
 
03:35:22.389 --> 03:35:22.399 align:start position:0%
and with so many options available for
 
03:35:24.510 --> 03:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
ride sharing as well as the growth and
 
03:35:26.349 --> 03:35:26.359 align:start position:0%
educational campaigns um spreading
 
03:35:27.670 --> 03:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
awareness of the risks of problem
 
03:35:29.670 --> 03:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
drinking there's simply no reason or
 
03:35:32.429 --> 03:35:32.439 align:start position:0%
excuse to engage in unsafe ilal Behavior
 
03:35:34.510 --> 03:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's 1:00 a. 2 am. 3: a.m. it
 
03:35:36.670 --> 03:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
just shouldn't be happening at any time
 
03:35:38.550 --> 03:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
um however with that in mind um again I
 
03:35:40.269 --> 03:35:40.279 align:start position:0%
did intend for this bill to be more
 
03:35:42.389 --> 03:35:42.399 align:start position:0%
flexible I'm definitely open to amending
 
03:35:45.150 --> 03:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
this bill to um remove Parts add Parts
 
03:35:46.349 --> 03:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
addressing issues such as law
 
03:35:49.309 --> 03:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement funding and I am 100% open
 
03:35:50.790 --> 03:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
to any suggestions from committee
 
03:35:53.710 --> 03:35:53.720 align:start position:0%
members or the community to um make any
 
03:35:56.309 --> 03:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
changes to um potentially address some
 
03:35:58.870 --> 03:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
of those concerns um so essentially this
 
03:36:01.070 --> 03:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
bill is about Choice um it will expand
 
03:36:03.150 --> 03:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
Commerce options for businesses while
 
03:36:04.790 --> 03:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
get giving cities more options to meet
 
03:36:07.030 --> 03:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
the needs of their residents um and if a
 
03:36:08.429 --> 03:36:08.439 align:start position:0%
business owner doesn't want to stay open
 
03:36:09.990 --> 03:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
that late or participate in serving to
 
03:36:12.269 --> 03:36:12.279 align:start position:0%
go cocktails they won't be required to
 
03:36:14.910 --> 03:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
HB 529 simply offers more options to
 
03:36:16.550 --> 03:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
help expand the economy and let
 
03:36:17.910 --> 03:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
consumers enjoy their time in New
 
03:36:22.269 --> 03:36:22.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:24.990 --> 03:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
questions uh Jo my memory what did we do
 
03:36:26.950 --> 03:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
with this bill before or some of these
 
03:36:29.229 --> 03:36:29.239 align:start position:0%
items here they do look familiar I just
 
03:36:30.870 --> 03:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
don't remember what we did with them
 
03:36:33.030 --> 03:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so my my original bill was um just
 
03:36:35.710 --> 03:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
the extension of hours of sale um that
 
03:36:38.750 --> 03:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
passed the house last session but um our
 
03:36:41.269 --> 03:36:41.279 align:start position:0%
friends on the other side of the wall um
 
03:36:42.870 --> 03:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
disagreed with the house position so
 
03:36:45.630 --> 03:36:45.640 align:start position:0%
what did we end up passing last year um
 
03:36:47.550 --> 03:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
I believe it was extension of last call
 
03:36:49.550 --> 03:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
I think possibly store sales might have
 
03:36:52.429 --> 03:36:52.439 align:start position:0%
been included on or off premise I think
 
03:36:55.030 --> 03:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
on premise on Prem at least so you
 
03:36:57.229 --> 03:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
didn't have on off premise okay just on
 
03:37:00.469 --> 03:37:00.479 align:start position:0%
premise yes and we went from the current
 
03:37:04.150 --> 03:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
laws one to two yes and that's all we
 
03:37:05.990 --> 03:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
did and and they still the Senate killed
 
03:37:08.510 --> 03:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
it um well it also added municipalities
 
03:37:11.389 --> 03:37:11.399 align:start position:0%
could vote till extens we the municipal
 
03:37:14.670 --> 03:37:14.680 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so that that's the one that's
 
03:37:16.790 --> 03:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
what we did before and we we did pass
 
03:37:18.830 --> 03:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
that yes so I figured for this year you
 
03:37:22.150 --> 03:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
know if the other body is more open to
 
03:37:24.110 --> 03:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
in store sales only extending that to 1:
 
03:37:26.469 --> 03:37:26.479 align:start position:0%
a.m. but not off premises we can amend
 
03:37:29.070 --> 03:37:29.080 align:start position:0%
as needed I figured I'd start a little
 
03:37:30.510 --> 03:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
bigger and then we can Whittle things
 
03:37:33.389 --> 03:37:33.399 align:start position:0%
down as um you know as we work through
 
03:37:35.870 --> 03:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
that process but the on premise last
 
03:37:39.349 --> 03:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
call sale um did pass this
 
03:37:41.830 --> 03:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
body perfect do we have any questions on
 
03:37:46.950 --> 03:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:48.309 --> 03:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
what what's the date of that so we make
 
03:37:50.590 --> 03:37:50.600 align:start position:0%
sure we we hit that date again uh that
 
03:37:53.070 --> 03:37:53.080 align:start position:0%
was March 28th last year okay
 
03:37:55.229 --> 03:37:55.239 align:start position:0%
representative bar yes thanks for taking
 
03:37:57.550 --> 03:37:57.560 align:start position:0%
my question I'm reading here about um
 
03:37:59.790 --> 03:37:59.800 align:start position:0%
that they can't deliver to uh College
 
03:38:01.830 --> 03:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
University or school what if the
 
03:38:05.150 --> 03:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
individual um placing the orders over
 
03:38:07.990 --> 03:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
21 yeah that's a great question um so
 
03:38:09.550 --> 03:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
again I definitely believe in you know
 
03:38:11.790 --> 03:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
the freedom of students who are over 21
 
03:38:14.229 --> 03:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
um my my thinking there was you know
 
03:38:15.630 --> 03:38:15.640 align:start position:0%
just thinking about risks and ways we
 
03:38:17.229 --> 03:38:17.239 align:start position:0%
can mitigate that risk knowing that
 
03:38:18.630 --> 03:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
there are additional safety concerns
 
03:38:21.389 --> 03:38:21.399 align:start position:0%
with to- Go cocktails I figure you know
 
03:38:23.790 --> 03:38:23.800 align:start position:0%
creating an environment where providing
 
03:38:25.269 --> 03:38:25.279 align:start position:0%
a drink to someone underage is less
 
03:38:28.389 --> 03:38:28.399 align:start position:0%
likely to happen is probably a safer bet
 
03:38:30.469 --> 03:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
um and obviously if a student is living
 
03:38:32.750 --> 03:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
off campus there um they're more than
 
03:38:34.229 --> 03:38:34.239 align:start position:0%
welcome to participate but it's more
 
03:38:37.389 --> 03:38:37.399 align:start position:0%
about risk mitigation versus um trying
 
03:38:39.590 --> 03:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
to limit options followup and obviously
 
03:38:41.349 --> 03:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
if somebody's living in their own house
 
03:38:44.510 --> 03:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
or off campus that's fine but I mean I
 
03:38:46.070 --> 03:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
don't know what they legality it is of
 
03:38:47.950 --> 03:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
saying that you're not going to deliver
 
03:38:50.710 --> 03:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
I I know some college campuses say no no
 
03:38:53.990 --> 03:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
liquor but if somebody's L over 21 and
 
03:38:58.189 --> 03:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
on campus can we can we is it legal to
 
03:39:00.990 --> 03:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
do that I guess is the question I don't
 
03:39:02.269 --> 03:39:02.279 align:start position:0%
have that answer for you off the top of
 
03:39:04.550 --> 03:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
my head I'm I'm happy to look into it um
 
03:39:06.469 --> 03:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
and personally I'm on I'm on the same
 
03:39:08.269 --> 03:39:08.279 align:start position:0%
page as you know people should have that
 
03:39:10.630 --> 03:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
option I just um in the interest of kind
 
03:39:12.830 --> 03:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
of mitigating some of that risk of
 
03:39:15.590 --> 03:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
enabling that behavior sure thank you
 
03:39:17.309 --> 03:39:17.319 align:start position:0%
well saying on that
 
03:39:20.070 --> 03:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
subject because I see the word liquor
 
03:39:21.590 --> 03:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
all dropped in
 
03:39:25.910 --> 03:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
here um my memory and I'm reading the
 
03:39:29.349 --> 03:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
statue so is that whatever got
 
03:39:33.550 --> 03:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
delivered was in a prepackaged
 
03:39:36.670 --> 03:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
bottle are you when you say liquor here
 
03:39:40.510 --> 03:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
were you thinking that
 
03:39:43.910 --> 03:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
a on premise lensey is now going to sell
 
03:39:46.229 --> 03:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
a full bottle of liquor
 
03:39:48.790 --> 03:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
or were you thinking a pre-made
 
03:39:51.550 --> 03:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
drink um so I my intention was a
 
03:39:53.950 --> 03:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
pre-made drink um in the language I
 
03:39:55.870 --> 03:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
believe I included um some sort of
 
03:39:59.790 --> 03:39:59.800 align:start position:0%
branded cup or sealed cup um making that
 
03:40:02.550 --> 03:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
change um if that's not in there I'm
 
03:40:04.389 --> 03:40:04.399 align:start position:0%
happy to take another look at that but
 
03:40:05.870 --> 03:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
the intention was for it to be a tog go
 
03:40:09.110 --> 03:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
cocktail versus a uh delivery bottle of
 
03:40:12.070 --> 03:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
inally did not want to make that legal
 
03:40:14.790 --> 03:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
when we allow delivery of alcohol that
 
03:40:17.110 --> 03:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
was intent itional that yeah the
 
03:40:19.469 --> 03:40:19.479 align:start position:0%
intention was a mixed cocktail we don't
 
03:40:21.550 --> 03:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
know what's in that mixed cocktail we
 
03:40:23.030 --> 03:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
don't you know that where if it's a
 
03:40:25.870 --> 03:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
preix m you know when there are you know
 
03:40:27.750 --> 03:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
you can buy premixed liquor from the
 
03:40:27.760 --> 03:40:29.550 align:start position:0%
you can buy premixed liquor from the
liquor

03:40:29.550 --> 03:40:29.560 align:start position:0%
liquor
 
03:40:33.710 --> 03:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
store but it at the alcohol level is
 
03:40:35.590 --> 03:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
going to be a higher level than what
 
03:40:38.349 --> 03:40:38.359 align:start position:0%
it's available on the off- premise
 
03:40:41.670 --> 03:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
license C so we don't have liquor stores
 
03:40:42.830 --> 03:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
that are
 
03:40:45.710 --> 03:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
open very late
 
03:40:48.150 --> 03:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
so that that ain't happening in New
 
03:40:51.229 --> 03:40:51.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because they're not open to
 
03:40:53.790 --> 03:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
sell a premix drink so your your
 
03:40:56.349 --> 03:40:56.359 align:start position:0%
intention was that you were thinking
 
03:40:58.309 --> 03:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
that and I know that some states did
 
03:41:01.670 --> 03:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
pass this that you they make a drink in
 
03:41:04.309 --> 03:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
a and and put it in a container and you
 
03:41:07.630 --> 03:41:07.640 align:start position:0%
know you can have that Margarita to go
 
03:41:09.790 --> 03:41:09.800 align:start position:0%
and but that
 
03:41:13.189 --> 03:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's a in a container but it's not
 
03:41:15.750 --> 03:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
a sealed container nor put together
 
03:41:18.910 --> 03:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
other than put together by the on
 
03:41:21.710 --> 03:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
premise license heat yeah the intention
 
03:41:23.670 --> 03:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
and again I'm happy to help clean up the
 
03:41:26.429 --> 03:41:26.439 align:start position:0%
language if that's a little fuzzy um but
 
03:41:29.110 --> 03:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
my my intent was similar to the co model
 
03:41:30.950 --> 03:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
um you know you're for example let's say
 
03:41:34.070 --> 03:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
you're getting um you know taco night to
 
03:41:35.110 --> 03:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
go and you want to get a couple of
 
03:41:37.309 --> 03:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
margaritas and you're going to drink and
 
03:41:38.910 --> 03:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
eat your Mar your tacos and your
 
03:41:41.510 --> 03:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
margaritas at home watching a movie to
 
03:41:44.710 --> 03:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
you get no we didn't let you do that you
 
03:41:48.269 --> 03:41:48.279 align:start position:0%
had to buy the premix one that was
 
03:41:52.229 --> 03:41:52.239 align:start position:0%
made that you can buy in the off-
 
03:41:55.309 --> 03:41:55.319 align:start position:0%
premise licy had a premix now some on
 
03:41:58.149 --> 03:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
premise lenes could have it could have
 
03:42:00.510 --> 03:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
the you know the premix margarita mix I
 
03:42:02.710 --> 03:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
don't know how many did that probably
 
03:42:05.149 --> 03:42:05.159 align:start position:0%
not too many but that because the end of
 
03:42:07.950 --> 03:42:07.960 align:start position:0%
the day that you know they had to buy
 
03:42:09.630 --> 03:42:09.640 align:start position:0%
the one that was the lower alcohol
 
03:42:12.950 --> 03:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
content in an op in here in Co in New
 
03:42:15.790 --> 03:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire unlike maybe other states
 
03:42:17.710 --> 03:42:17.720 align:start position:0%
the intention was more for like you
 
03:42:19.630 --> 03:42:19.640 align:start position:0%
could order the drink that you would eat
 
03:42:22.670 --> 03:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
or drink in the in the restaurant to go
 
03:42:25.870 --> 03:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
um with your takeout food um and I I
 
03:42:27.469 --> 03:42:27.479 align:start position:0%
know that has been done in other states
 
03:42:29.429 --> 03:42:29.439 align:start position:0%
um again if the language for for this is
 
03:42:30.910 --> 03:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
unclear I'm happy to work on that to
 
03:42:34.149 --> 03:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
clarify fair enough thank you oh we do
 
03:42:35.269 --> 03:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
have another question representative
 
03:42:37.670 --> 03:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
pusk yes thank you for taking my
 
03:42:40.469 --> 03:42:40.479 align:start position:0%
question representative uh relative to
 
03:42:45.229 --> 03:42:45.239 align:start position:0%
section one hours of sales has anybody
 
03:42:47.389 --> 03:42:47.399 align:start position:0%
done a cost benefit
 
03:42:50.710 --> 03:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
analysis that would justify an
 
03:42:53.550 --> 03:42:53.560 align:start position:0%
establishment being open and what would
 
03:42:55.750 --> 03:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
the cost be and how much profit they
 
03:42:59.670 --> 03:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
would assume
 
03:43:01.910 --> 03:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh I just that's just a business
 
03:43:03.950 --> 03:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
question that's what I'm asking no I
 
03:43:05.309 --> 03:43:05.319 align:start position:0%
think that's a great question um so
 
03:43:06.750 --> 03:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been any formal studies
 
03:43:09.510 --> 03:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
that I could find um in New Hampshire
 
03:43:13.189 --> 03:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
specifically um it's tough Countrywide
 
03:43:14.670 --> 03:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
because there is such a patchwork of
 
03:43:16.630 --> 03:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
different laws you know for example in
 
03:43:18.309 --> 03:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
in New York or Massachusetts the last
 
03:43:21.229 --> 03:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
call is later but it's been later for
 
03:43:23.110 --> 03:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
quite some time so it would be hard to
 
03:43:24.429 --> 03:43:24.439 align:start position:0%
kind of make that comparison looking
 
03:43:26.309 --> 03:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
back I think that would definitely be
 
03:43:28.550 --> 03:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
helpful research to to undertake and I
 
03:43:32.189 --> 03:43:32.199 align:start position:0%
think um again I I've heard anecdotally
 
03:43:34.030 --> 03:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
you know mix things from businesses some
 
03:43:35.590 --> 03:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
some people say like yeah we'd love to
 
03:43:37.550 --> 03:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
work later get get more tips get more
 
03:43:39.630 --> 03:43:39.640 align:start position:0%
more profit others say this wouldn't
 
03:43:40.710 --> 03:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
apply to my business I wouldn't be
 
03:43:42.189 --> 03:43:42.199 align:start position:0%
interested in staying open that later so
 
03:43:44.269 --> 03:43:44.279 align:start position:0%
it is again intended to have the
 
03:43:46.309 --> 03:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
flexibility not the requirement but I
 
03:43:48.990 --> 03:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
think it would be interesting to see um
 
03:43:51.590 --> 03:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
maybe a pilot test I mean I'd certainly
 
03:43:53.110 --> 03:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
love to
 
03:43:55.429 --> 03:43:55.439 align:start position:0%
see oh he's got his face in his hands
 
03:43:57.030 --> 03:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
already um but I I think it would be
 
03:43:58.830 --> 03:43:58.840 align:start position:0%
interesting to see some uh some Topline
 
03:44:02.429 --> 03:44:02.439 align:start position:0%
data digging into those numbers um and
 
03:44:05.349 --> 03:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
um and doing that sort of formal market
 
03:44:08.030 --> 03:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
analysis further question you me thank
 
03:44:11.309 --> 03:44:11.319 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh do you know of any
 
03:44:13.229 --> 03:44:13.239 align:start position:0%
states which have done this have
 
03:44:16.510 --> 03:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
extended their hours really recently
 
03:44:18.229 --> 03:44:18.239 align:start position:0%
that might give us some kind of an
 
03:44:21.429 --> 03:44:21.439 align:start position:0%
indication as to a cost benefit analysis
 
03:44:23.389 --> 03:44:23.399 align:start position:0%
that a state maybe it's done within the
 
03:44:27.149 --> 03:44:27.159 align:start position:0%
past two or three years to see what they
 
03:44:29.950 --> 03:44:29.960 align:start position:0%
have and it would help justify uh the
 
03:44:33.189 --> 03:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
restaurant associations to look at this
 
03:44:35.710 --> 03:44:35.720 align:start position:0%
in a maybe more favorable
 
03:44:38.710 --> 03:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
manner um that is a great question um
 
03:44:40.389 --> 03:44:40.399 align:start position:0%
I'll take that as a follow-up and I'll
 
03:44:43.070 --> 03:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
um do some digging there and get back to
 
03:44:46.429 --> 03:44:46.439 align:start position:0%
you great repres sen
 
03:44:48.910 --> 03:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
wals thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:44:52.750 --> 03:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um in your
 
03:44:55.269 --> 03:44:55.279 align:start position:0%
section about allows on premises
 
03:44:57.830 --> 03:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
licenses to deliver liquor to customers
 
03:45:01.269 --> 03:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
who order a meal I does that include
 
03:45:03.189 --> 03:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
like a door
 
03:45:06.110 --> 03:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
Dash um Service as well and would they
 
03:45:09.910 --> 03:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
have to verify that the person getting
 
03:45:12.349 --> 03:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
the drink is over
 
03:45:15.110 --> 03:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
21 um so my intention was to only
 
03:45:17.870 --> 03:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
allowed the vendor the restaurants or or
 
03:45:20.030 --> 03:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
owners themselves to be in charge of
 
03:45:22.070 --> 03:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
that delivery um I think once you get
 
03:45:23.710 --> 03:45:23.720 align:start position:0%
into the third party delivery there's a
 
03:45:25.550 --> 03:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
lot more problematic data in terms of
 
03:45:28.030 --> 03:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
compliance um generally speaking from
 
03:45:29.469 --> 03:45:29.479 align:start position:0%
what I saw from the research from
 
03:45:31.189 --> 03:45:31.199 align:start position:0%
Virginia unfortunately my printer ran
 
03:45:32.429 --> 03:45:32.439 align:start position:0%
out of ink but there's a couple of
 
03:45:35.830 --> 03:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
copies up with representative post um
 
03:45:38.990 --> 03:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
the the compliance rates in terms of
 
03:45:42.590 --> 03:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
verifying age was um equivalent to on
 
03:45:44.149 --> 03:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
premises sales from brick and morar
 
03:45:46.950 --> 03:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
restaurants for um delivery managed by
 
03:45:49.110 --> 03:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
the restaurants themselves but the
 
03:45:50.349 --> 03:45:50.359 align:start position:0%
compliance was lower for those
 
03:45:53.189 --> 03:45:53.199 align:start position:0%
thirdparty vendors so my intention um
 
03:45:55.870 --> 03:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
with this language was to limit those
 
03:45:58.349 --> 03:45:58.359 align:start position:0%
delivery services to the um the
 
03:46:00.110 --> 03:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
restaurant owners and Proprietors
 
03:46:01.990 --> 03:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
themselves rather than getting into that
 
03:46:03.469 --> 03:46:03.479 align:start position:0%
kind of murky territory I feel like
 
03:46:06.510 --> 03:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
again it it opens it up to more risk and
 
03:46:09.590 --> 03:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
yeah it they are supposed to check IDs
 
03:46:12.229 --> 03:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
um that that's the law they're required
 
03:46:15.110 --> 03:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
to but I think there's so much great
 
03:46:20.070 --> 03:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
area and kind of less sort of so you
 
03:46:22.590 --> 03:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
just a you know this statue which is
 
03:46:24.429 --> 03:46:24.439 align:start position:0%
everything is current law other than the
 
03:46:26.990 --> 03:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
word liquor is you can see that it it
 
03:46:29.630 --> 03:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
has to be the restaurant licy and
 
03:46:31.750 --> 03:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to get another extra for
 
03:46:33.189 --> 03:46:33.199 align:start position:0%
an extra
 
03:46:36.149 --> 03:46:36.159 align:start position:0%
$250 they get a delivery
 
03:46:39.870 --> 03:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
license and yes that that licy that
 
03:46:43.790 --> 03:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
restaurant is responsible for the
 
03:46:46.189 --> 03:46:46.199 align:start position:0%
getting the ID and making sure the
 
03:46:48.910 --> 03:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
delivery but under our current statute
 
03:46:52.630 --> 03:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
no door Dash is not permitted right okay
 
03:46:55.550 --> 03:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
and followup for the question thank you
 
03:46:58.149 --> 03:46:58.159 align:start position:0%
so is it limited one per person I was
 
03:47:00.590 --> 03:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
trying to see where it said that here um
 
03:47:02.750 --> 03:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
I didn't include any specific language
 
03:47:04.149 --> 03:47:04.159 align:start position:0%
um but that could be a good potential
 
03:47:05.710 --> 03:47:05.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment again to help mitigate that
 
03:47:08.550 --> 03:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
risk further um again I try I tried to
 
03:47:10.670 --> 03:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
strike the balance between okay the the
 
03:47:12.229 --> 03:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
risk management and harm reduction and
 
03:47:13.830 --> 03:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh just
 
03:47:18.149 --> 03:47:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:21.189 --> 03:47:21.199 align:start position:0%
Margaritas I don't know maybe a limit a
 
03:47:24.030 --> 03:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
limit of some sort
 
03:47:26.070 --> 03:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
maybe no I think I think that's a good
 
03:47:27.750 --> 03:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
question and we intentionally did not
 
03:47:29.550 --> 03:47:29.560 align:start position:0%
put a number in the
 
03:47:33.790 --> 03:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:36.670 --> 03:47:36.680 align:start position:0%
spear okay representa this kind of a
 
03:47:39.389 --> 03:47:39.399 align:start position:0%
comment and I I guess it's a question of
 
03:47:40.790 --> 03:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
how it would fit
 
03:47:43.870 --> 03:47:43.880 align:start position:0%
in I've been approached by a a number of
 
03:47:46.910 --> 03:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
restaurants in in Nashua downtown Nashua
 
03:47:49.110 --> 03:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
that have asked for the ability because
 
03:47:51.910 --> 03:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
people come and they take food out MH
 
03:47:55.790 --> 03:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
the ability to also provide however many
 
03:47:57.750 --> 03:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
meals they're sending out at that time
 
03:47:59.630 --> 03:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
you know people come in and pick it up
 
03:48:01.950 --> 03:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
to have various drinks go with those
 
03:48:05.950 --> 03:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
meals in some kind of a little renewable
 
03:48:08.229 --> 03:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
kind of thing this seems to be something
 
03:48:11.750 --> 03:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
that the restaurants seem to want and
 
03:48:15.030 --> 03:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
believe it or not I usually
 
03:48:16.830 --> 03:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
but it would be if you if you're going
 
03:48:18.710 --> 03:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
to start considering any limits it would
 
03:48:20.790 --> 03:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
seem to me it depends on how many meals
 
03:48:23.389 --> 03:48:23.399 align:start position:0%
are being delivered I mean I don't
 
03:48:25.590 --> 03:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
see you know somebody's ordering five
 
03:48:27.149 --> 03:48:27.159 align:start position:0%
meals to take out you don't want to
 
03:48:29.830 --> 03:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
limit it to one
 
03:48:32.149 --> 03:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
drink just a
 
03:48:35.349 --> 03:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
thought we did not the legislation the
 
03:48:37.309 --> 03:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
current statute right now we have no
 
03:48:39.910 --> 03:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
limits on how much can be delivered yeah
 
03:48:41.070 --> 03:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
and and it seems to be something
 
03:48:43.030 --> 03:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
restaurants Chinese meals you have lots
 
03:48:45.110 --> 03:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
of Entre and doesn't tell you how many
 
03:48:48.870 --> 03:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
people are actually sharing it it
 
03:48:51.309 --> 03:48:51.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't and and I'm fine with no limit I
 
03:48:52.670 --> 03:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
have no problem with that it's just that
 
03:48:54.189 --> 03:48:54.199 align:start position:0%
it's interesting that the bill came up
 
03:48:56.910 --> 03:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
at a time when restaurants have actually
 
03:48:58.790 --> 03:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
approached me to ask if we could do
 
03:49:01.110 --> 03:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
something like this right so apparently
 
03:49:02.830 --> 03:49:02.840 align:start position:0%
it's something that so there there is a
 
03:49:05.910 --> 03:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
demand for us to pass
 
03:49:08.550 --> 03:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
something just trying to help the people
 
03:49:10.469 --> 03:49:10.479 align:start position:0%
out represent
 
03:49:13.110 --> 03:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair just to follow
 
03:49:14.830 --> 03:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
up on the earlier question the the
 
03:49:17.950 --> 03:49:17.960 align:start position:0%
intent is that the the delivery would
 
03:49:20.269 --> 03:49:20.279 align:start position:0%
have to be made by somebody who works at
 
03:49:22.550 --> 03:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
the restaurant not by a third party
 
03:49:24.070 --> 03:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
that's correct so you wouldn't have an
 
03:49:26.630 --> 03:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
unknown person working for one of these
 
03:49:28.670 --> 03:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
companies come in and deliver it to
 
03:49:30.910 --> 03:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
someone else it would need to be someone
 
03:49:33.030 --> 03:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
from the restaurant taking the food to
 
03:49:36.189 --> 03:49:36.199 align:start position:0%
the um customer's home checking their ID
 
03:49:38.910 --> 03:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
making sure that they're of age um not
 
03:49:42.070 --> 03:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
the third party Services now thank
 
03:49:45.630 --> 03:49:45.640 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much thank you uh
 
03:49:49.389 --> 03:49:49.399 align:start position:0%
Cher will call on uh Karen Benfield from

03:50:15.950 --> 03:50:15.960 align:start position:0%

record again my name is Karen Benfield
 
03:50:22.830 --> 03:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
I'm the executive director at State work
 
03:50:25.389 --> 03:50:25.399 align:start position:0%
play New Hampshire a nonprofit dedicated
 
03:50:27.229 --> 03:50:27.239 align:start position:0%
to attracting and retaining young people
 
03:50:29.750 --> 03:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
here in our state um I am here in
 
03:50:32.750 --> 03:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
support of HB 529 because we need to be
 
03:50:34.830 --> 03:50:34.840 align:start position:0%
thinking not just about what brings
 
03:50:36.309 --> 03:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
young people to New Hampshire but what
 
03:50:38.830 --> 03:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
keeps them here as well New Hampshire is
 
03:50:41.309 --> 03:50:41.319 align:start position:0%
facing a demographic crisis as um many
 
03:50:44.189 --> 03:50:44.199 align:start position:0%
of us here understand um our Workforce
 
03:50:46.830 --> 03:50:46.840 align:start position:0%
is a in our population of young workers
 
03:50:49.110 --> 03:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
is shrinking um and we're competing with
 
03:50:50.750 --> 03:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
neighboring states that offer more
 
03:50:53.309 --> 03:50:53.319 align:start position:0%
Dynamic accessible and engaging social
 
03:50:55.710 --> 03:50:55.720 align:start position:0%
environments the re the reality is is
 
03:50:57.149 --> 03:50:57.159 align:start position:0%
that a thriving night life and
 
03:50:59.309 --> 03:50:59.319 align:start position:0%
Hospitality scene matters to young
 
03:51:01.469 --> 03:51:01.479 align:start position:0%
people when deciding where to live work
 
03:51:04.670 --> 03:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
and build their future our 2023 quality
 
03:51:07.870 --> 03:51:07.880 align:start position:0%
of life survey uh shows that no uh the
 
03:51:10.510 --> 03:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
night life and lack of social scene here
 
03:51:12.389 --> 03:51:12.399 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is actually the second
 
03:51:14.550 --> 03:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
biggest reason why young people choose
 
03:51:16.630 --> 03:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
to leave New Hampshire uh right behind
 
03:51:18.910 --> 03:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
cost of living which uh can come as a
 
03:51:20.790 --> 03:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
shock it was actually shocking to me to
 
03:51:23.630 --> 03:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
to learn that um that actually shares a
 
03:51:25.750 --> 03:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
very clear message um we're not just
 
03:51:28.030 --> 03:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
competing on jobs and housing with our
 
03:51:29.630 --> 03:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
neighboring states we're also competing
 
03:51:33.349 --> 03:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
on quality of life as well HB 529 is a
 
03:51:35.469 --> 03:51:35.479 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction it expands
 
03:51:37.389 --> 03:51:37.399 align:start position:0%
sales uh sales hours allowing alcohol
 
03:51:39.590 --> 03:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
delivery with meals and support small
 
03:51:43.229 --> 03:51:43.239 align:start position:0%
businesses with refillable beer sales um
 
03:51:45.710 --> 03:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
that uh and these aren't uh just policy
 
03:51:47.830 --> 03:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
tweaks um they're ways to also meet
 
03:51:50.189 --> 03:51:50.199 align:start position:0%
young people where they are whether it's
 
03:51:53.269 --> 03:51:53.279 align:start position:0%
after hours at home or on the go uh
 
03:51:54.590 --> 03:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
young people just want the same
 
03:51:56.389 --> 03:51:56.399 align:start position:0%
conveniences and experiences that they
 
03:51:59.030 --> 03:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
can find in other states this bill
 
03:52:00.870 --> 03:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't Force businesses to change but
 
03:52:03.189 --> 03:52:03.199 align:start position:0%
it creates the space for them to adapt
 
03:52:05.630 --> 03:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
and evolve on their terms in ways that
 
03:52:07.750 --> 03:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
make sense for their communities and
 
03:52:10.469 --> 03:52:10.479 align:start position:0%
that flexibility matters young young
 
03:52:11.750 --> 03:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
people aren't just looking for a
 
03:52:13.269 --> 03:52:13.279 align:start position:0%
paycheck when deciding where to set
 
03:52:15.110 --> 03:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
Roots they're looking for places to
 
03:52:17.429 --> 03:52:17.439 align:start position:0%
gather to connect and feel like they're
 
03:52:20.030 --> 03:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
amongst peers in the second oldest state
 
03:52:21.950 --> 03:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
in the country every opportunity to
 
03:52:24.110 --> 03:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
create spaces for young people matters
 
03:52:27.510 --> 03:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
when we look to retain uh our Workforce
 
03:52:29.070 --> 03:52:29.080 align:start position:0%
this isn't just about staying
 
03:52:30.710 --> 03:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
competitive it's also about keeping the
 
03:52:32.550 --> 03:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
Next Generation right here in the
 
03:52:35.030 --> 03:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
granite state so uh I urge you to
 
03:52:37.750 --> 03:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
support HB 529 and take a step forward
 
03:52:39.830 --> 03:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
um for a more vibrant and attractive
 
03:52:45.110 --> 03:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:47.189 --> 03:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions evidently there
 
03:52:50.189 --> 03:52:50.199 align:start position:0%
aren't any
 
03:52:53.550 --> 03:52:53.560 align:start position:0%
sorry okay uh this I've never seen a
 
03:52:55.229 --> 03:52:55.239 align:start position:0%
card like this
 
03:52:58.590 --> 03:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
before some's a little schizophrenic
 
03:53:03.030 --> 03:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
today he opposes it and supports it so
 
03:53:11.429 --> 03:53:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:13.429 --> 03:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
minutes good afternoon Mr chairman
 
03:53:14.750 --> 03:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
03:53:16.229 --> 03:53:16.239 align:start position:0%
Mike Summers president CEO of the New
 
03:53:17.389 --> 03:53:17.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lodging and Restaurant
 
03:53:19.030 --> 03:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
Association and I'm glad you got a kick
 
03:53:20.950 --> 03:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
out of that I did it entirely for your
 
03:53:23.790 --> 03:53:23.800 align:start position:0%
purpose so um so we're a little bit
 
03:53:25.189 --> 03:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
conflicted on this bill obviously
 
03:53:26.710 --> 03:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
there's three components to the bill as
 
03:53:30.149 --> 03:53:30.159 align:start position:0%
were was outlined by the sponsor uh one
 
03:53:33.229 --> 03:53:33.239 align:start position:0%
we don't like one we are kind of meh on
 
03:53:34.870 --> 03:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
and the third one we really like so
 
03:53:37.229 --> 03:53:37.239 align:start position:0%
that's hence the reason for the kind of
 
03:53:40.950 --> 03:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
oppose and support So in in order of uh
 
03:53:42.309 --> 03:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
sections in the bill obviously the
 
03:53:44.870 --> 03:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
extension of hours we have la had a
 
03:53:47.469 --> 03:53:47.479 align:start position:0%
problem with that um frankly we think
 
03:53:49.590 --> 03:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
that right now with the local option to
 
03:53:51.710 --> 03:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
be able to go to 2: a.m. is probably
 
03:53:54.550 --> 03:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
sufficient um and if you will note uh
 
03:53:56.870 --> 03:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
there's only one or two uh jurisdictions
 
03:53:57.990 --> 03:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire that have
 
03:54:00.030 --> 03:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
actually taken that on which means that
 
03:54:01.510 --> 03:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
there are is almost nobody in the
 
03:54:03.070 --> 03:54:03.080 align:start position:0%
industry that's actually asking for this
 
03:54:05.510 --> 03:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
and I don't see a crowd behind us here
 
03:54:08.630 --> 03:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
in support of uh changing the hours so
 
03:54:11.269 --> 03:54:11.279 align:start position:0%
um I'll just start with that um but the
 
03:54:12.750 --> 03:54:12.760 align:start position:0%
biggest issue frankly in the extension
 
03:54:14.630 --> 03:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
of hours for our industry currently is
 
03:54:16.070 --> 03:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
we we don't have enough staff we don't
 
03:54:17.590 --> 03:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
have enough staff to man the hours if
 
03:54:18.870 --> 03:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
you notice there's a lot of restaurants
 
03:54:21.030 --> 03:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
that no longer do lunches they close at
 
03:54:23.630 --> 03:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
9:30 or 10:00 it's not because it you
 
03:54:24.910 --> 03:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
know the owners are tired want to go
 
03:54:26.070 --> 03:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
home we don't have staff we don't have
 
03:54:27.429 --> 03:54:27.439 align:start position:0%
bartenders that will work those kinds of
 
03:54:29.710 --> 03:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
hours um and more and more restaurants
 
03:54:31.309 --> 03:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
are literally Clos two days a week
 
03:54:32.710 --> 03:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
because then they have like one set
 
03:54:35.229 --> 03:54:35.239 align:start position:0%
staff and they all work the same chefs
 
03:54:37.550 --> 03:54:37.560 align:start position:0%
um moving on to this section two of the
 
03:54:40.149 --> 03:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
bill the on- premise delivery on premise
 
03:54:42.389 --> 03:54:42.399 align:start position:0%
lies for mixed drinks we do like this
 
03:54:44.550 --> 03:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
provision um as was mentioned in
 
03:54:46.750 --> 03:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
testimony this has been enacted in 27
 
03:54:49.110 --> 03:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
States uh it is a kind of a remnant of
 
03:54:51.910 --> 03:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
the covid era um we were successful in
 
03:54:53.550 --> 03:54:53.560 align:start position:0%
working with the legislature a few years
 
03:54:55.910 --> 03:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
ago or a couple years ago after the uh
 
03:54:59.469 --> 03:54:59.479 align:start position:0%
pandemic to um uh codify and statute
 
03:55:02.110 --> 03:55:02.120 align:start position:0%
that you know um uh beer and wine to go
 
03:55:05.070 --> 03:55:05.080 align:start position:0%
um was was allowed um the structure of
 
03:55:06.990 --> 03:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
that has worked out very nicely for some
 
03:55:08.950 --> 03:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
folks but there are uh businesses that
 
03:55:11.229 --> 03:55:11.239 align:start position:0%
have certainly solicited me uh looking
 
03:55:13.229 --> 03:55:13.239 align:start position:0%
for us to extend it to mixed drinks as
 
03:55:15.510 --> 03:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
well couple couple of concerns though
 
03:55:16.830 --> 03:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
where I hope to work with the
 
03:55:19.149 --> 03:55:19.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on the language we would be
 
03:55:21.189 --> 03:55:21.199 align:start position:0%
interested to see that there's some
 
03:55:23.070 --> 03:55:23.080 align:start position:0%
language around how the container must
 
03:55:25.070 --> 03:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
be sealed for transportation right
 
03:55:25.990 --> 03:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
because you don't necessarily want
 
03:55:28.309 --> 03:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
somebody who's getting a tog go cocktail
 
03:55:30.670 --> 03:55:30.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily stepping out uh and taking a
 
03:55:32.070 --> 03:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
good swill off it whilst they're on the
 
03:55:34.389 --> 03:55:34.399 align:start position:0%
driving home so I think we have to have
 
03:55:36.510 --> 03:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
some sort of control in place there and
 
03:55:38.030 --> 03:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
I would suspect you're going to hear
 
03:55:40.349 --> 03:55:40.359 align:start position:0%
that from the looking commission as well
 
03:55:42.870 --> 03:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
um the second piece is um some
 
03:55:44.990 --> 03:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
limitation on the ABV
 
03:55:46.830 --> 03:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
because the currently the way is drafted
 
03:55:48.469 --> 03:55:48.479 align:start position:0%
you could really just fill up a you know
 
03:55:50.830 --> 03:55:50.840 align:start position:0%
a yeti with you know a bottle of vodka
 
03:55:52.950 --> 03:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
right awesome that's a mixed drink for
 
03:55:55.030 --> 03:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
sure but I I I don't know that that's
 
03:55:56.590 --> 03:55:56.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily responsible service so I
 
03:55:58.269 --> 03:55:58.279 align:start position:0%
think we would probably wouldn't that be
 
03:55:58.279 --> 03:55:58.950 align:start position:0%
think we would probably wouldn't that be
a

03:55:58.950 --> 03:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:56:02.269 --> 03:56:02.279 align:start position:0%
martini be a very large Martini uh and I
 
03:56:04.389 --> 03:56:04.399 align:start position:0%
think most of our our members anyway
 
03:56:06.790 --> 03:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
have a two Martini limit because um gets
 
03:56:09.510 --> 03:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
a little ugly after that so we would uh
 
03:56:10.630 --> 03:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
we we would want to work with the
 
03:56:12.309 --> 03:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
subcommittee around some some additional
 
03:56:14.510 --> 03:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
controls in that space But ultimately in
 
03:56:16.990 --> 03:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
concept we love it um we appreciate the
 
03:56:18.510 --> 03:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
fact that this drafting of the Lang
 
03:56:20.469 --> 03:56:20.479 align:start position:0%
legislation does keep that it has to be
 
03:56:22.870 --> 03:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
a W2 employee of the business that does
 
03:56:25.389 --> 03:56:25.399 align:start position:0%
the delivery it maintains that the
 
03:56:26.910 --> 03:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
person receiving the alcohol has
 
03:56:29.070 --> 03:56:29.080 align:start position:0%
obviously has to be 21 and has to sign a
 
03:56:31.630 --> 03:56:31.640 align:start position:0%
receipt to the states that fact so all
 
03:56:33.590 --> 03:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
of those controls there I think are
 
03:56:35.429 --> 03:56:35.439 align:start position:0%
great um and and we're supportive of
 
03:56:37.269 --> 03:56:37.279 align:start position:0%
that and then the third part of this
 
03:56:39.750 --> 03:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
bill um the on premise licenses to uh
 
03:56:42.590 --> 03:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
fill refill refillable refillable
 
03:56:44.710 --> 03:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
containers not really spefic specific on
 
03:56:46.550 --> 03:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
what sorts of containers are we talking
 
03:56:47.990 --> 03:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
like a 5 gallon bucket what are we
 
03:56:50.870 --> 03:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
talking about here assume it's a growler
 
03:56:53.229 --> 03:56:53.239 align:start position:0%
well but I I okay so assuming it's a
 
03:56:54.990 --> 03:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
growa but that doesn't necessarily say
 
03:56:56.750 --> 03:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
that in here so this could be anything
 
03:56:59.870 --> 03:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
this could be a Yeti uh it could be a
 
03:57:02.630 --> 03:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
old milk jug I mean there's no real
 
03:57:05.269 --> 03:57:05.279 align:start position:0%
control on what that might be um frankly
 
03:57:07.030 --> 03:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think our industry really cares
 
03:57:09.229 --> 03:57:09.239 align:start position:0%
about this again um I'm not sure too
 
03:57:10.550 --> 03:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
many people are going to necessarily
 
03:57:13.189 --> 03:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
sell beer this way um because if we're
 
03:57:15.110 --> 03:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
selling it at our what we would normally
 
03:57:16.710 --> 03:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
sell a beer over the bar it would be
 
03:57:18.630 --> 03:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
exorbitantly expensive versus just
 
03:57:20.110 --> 03:57:20.120 align:start position:0%
purchasing you know a case of beer or
 
03:57:22.349 --> 03:57:22.359 align:start position:0%
something at the store so um again we're
 
03:57:25.309 --> 03:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
a little ambivalent on section three so
 
03:57:28.030 --> 03:57:28.040 align:start position:0%
with that I will end and I happy to try
 
03:57:29.189 --> 03:57:29.199 align:start position:0%
to answer any
 
03:57:29.199 --> 03:57:32.309 align:start position:0%
to answer any
questions

03:57:32.309 --> 03:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:34.590 --> 03:57:34.600 align:start position:0%
perfect representa
 
03:57:37.389 --> 03:57:37.399 align:start position:0%
Kips thank you Mr chair just out of
 
03:57:39.710 --> 03:57:39.720 align:start position:0%
curiosity in reference to Containers
 
03:57:41.030 --> 03:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
what is a
 
03:57:44.189 --> 03:57:44.199 align:start position:0%
yeti uh so it's anything from a small
 
03:57:45.990 --> 03:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
tumbler to a very large tumbler they're
 
03:57:47.349 --> 03:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
very well insulated so it keeps you
 
03:57:48.990 --> 03:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
drink cold for a very long time no
 
03:57:51.790 --> 03:57:51.800 align:start position:0%
that's Stanley that's not a Yeti that's
 
03:57:53.469 --> 03:57:53.479 align:start position:0%
a Stan and I can tell that all the way
 
03:57:55.429 --> 03:57:55.439 align:start position:0%
back here I have a Yeti that's it's this
 
03:57:57.229 --> 03:57:57.239 align:start position:0%
big it literally holds two cocktails and
 
03:57:59.349 --> 03:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
it keeps it cold for
 
03:58:03.550 --> 03:58:03.560 align:start position:0%
hours yes it many sizes yes and they
 
03:58:05.110 --> 03:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
have really nice coolers too but I can't
 
03:58:07.710 --> 03:58:07.720 align:start position:0%
afford and they do
 
03:58:10.110 --> 03:58:10.120 align:start position:0%
coolers represented
 
03:58:12.469 --> 03:58:12.479 align:start position:0%
Sullivan thank you so you mentioned one
 
03:58:14.149 --> 03:58:14.159 align:start position:0%
of the when you were opposed to the
 
03:58:16.070 --> 03:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
extended hours part you mentioned that
 
03:58:19.670 --> 03:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
one of the problems is is Staffing but
 
03:58:21.710 --> 03:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
nobody would be required to stay open
 
03:58:24.830 --> 03:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
until two F another staff correct again
 
03:58:26.469 --> 03:58:26.479 align:start position:0%
the way the way our organization works
 
03:58:27.590 --> 03:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
we work with the government Affairs
 
03:58:29.469 --> 03:58:29.479 align:start position:0%
committee and then we that they make a
 
03:58:31.110 --> 03:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the board of directors
 
03:58:32.830 --> 03:58:32.840 align:start position:0%
we solicit information from a lot of
 
03:58:35.269 --> 03:58:35.279 align:start position:0%
members this is what they are telling us
 
03:58:36.550 --> 03:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
please don't do this we don't want to
 
03:58:38.710 --> 03:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
have to deal with it um and then I you
 
03:58:40.349 --> 03:58:40.359 align:start position:0%
know we do hear from some though it's
 
03:58:41.750 --> 03:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's a handful but they're like you
 
03:58:43.349 --> 03:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
know what's it going to do to policing
 
03:58:45.189 --> 03:58:45.199 align:start position:0%
in our in our town right because now
 
03:58:47.429 --> 03:58:47.439 align:start position:0%
You' essentially taken what would be the
 
03:58:49.590 --> 03:58:49.600 align:start position:0%
problem hours of you know midnight to
 
03:58:51.830 --> 03:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
one now now becomes midnight to
 
03:58:53.469 --> 03:58:53.479 align:start position:0%
potentially 3:00 a.m. and what does that
 
03:58:56.149 --> 03:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
do for policing at the local level so um
 
03:58:58.830 --> 03:58:58.840 align:start position:0%
you again I just I'm sharing with you
 
03:59:00.309 --> 03:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
what what I'm been asked to share with
 
03:59:01.830 --> 03:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
you which is that they don't like it
 
03:59:06.590 --> 03:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:09.630 --> 03:59:09.640 align:start position:0%
happen thank you very much thank
 
03:59:13.229 --> 03:59:13.239 align:start position:0%
you okay uh oh we got one more before
 
03:59:14.389 --> 03:59:14.399 align:start position:0%
Mark are you going to you're going to
 
03:59:17.469 --> 03:59:17.479 align:start position:0%
wrap it up okay CJ Haynes from the New
 
03:59:23.030 --> 03:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:26.910 --> 03:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
Association welcome back to the Congress
 
03:59:29.110 --> 03:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for having me Mr
 
03:59:32.110 --> 03:59:32.120 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the committee I am
 
03:59:34.349 --> 03:59:34.359 align:start position:0%
C.J Haynes I am the executive director
 
03:59:36.189 --> 03:59:36.199 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Brewers Association
 
03:59:37.670 --> 03:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
I currently represent nearly 80
 
03:59:39.149 --> 03:59:39.159 align:start position:0%
breweries across the state of New
 
03:59:42.229 --> 03:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and as of now we are currently
 
03:59:43.750 --> 03:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
in opposition of this bill as it is
 
03:59:46.189 --> 03:59:46.199 align:start position:0%
written specifically regarding the
 
03:59:49.750 --> 03:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
refillable container section um part of
 
03:59:52.030 --> 03:59:52.040 align:start position:0%
this has to do with a growing concern
 
03:59:53.830 --> 03:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
that our members have had throughout the
 
03:59:57.229 --> 03:59:57.239 align:start position:0%
years is that they if an on premise
 
04:00:00.149 --> 04:00:00.159 align:start position:0%
account were to fill their product in a
 
04:00:02.070 --> 04:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
container then it becomes
 
04:00:04.189 --> 04:00:04.199 align:start position:0%
retail that would directly compete with
 
04:00:06.790 --> 04:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
their retail sales additionally it would
 
04:00:08.990 --> 04:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
also concern them about the sanitation
 
04:00:11.990 --> 04:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
of what is being filled so if a growler
 
04:00:13.710 --> 04:00:13.720 align:start position:0%
comes in there's nothing to say that
 
04:00:15.990 --> 04:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
that Growler is clean
 
04:00:18.590 --> 04:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
sanitized you could bring in anybody's
 
04:00:19.870 --> 04:00:19.880 align:start position:0%
you could bring in the
 
04:00:22.389 --> 04:00:22.399 align:start position:0%
yeti um and have that filled and so the
 
04:00:24.469 --> 04:00:24.479 align:start position:0%
breweries are concerned about the
 
04:00:25.910 --> 04:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
quality of the product that would go
 
04:00:28.309 --> 04:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
into that refillable container and once
 
04:00:30.229 --> 04:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
it goes into that refillable container
 
04:00:32.950 --> 04:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
it becomes packaged Goods therefore it's
 
04:00:35.710 --> 04:00:35.720 align:start position:0%
retail so therefore they have no control
 
04:00:38.429 --> 04:00:38.439 align:start position:0%
over what is being sold as retail and
 
04:00:40.269 --> 04:00:40.279 align:start position:0%
they feel as manufacturers that they
 
04:00:41.990 --> 04:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
should be the sole responsible entity
 
04:00:44.950 --> 04:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
for packaging their goods
 
04:00:47.229 --> 04:00:47.239 align:start position:0%
uh additionally there's concerns that
 
04:00:49.070 --> 04:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
there's no additional licensing fees
 
04:00:51.510 --> 04:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
required for this where breweries do
 
04:00:53.590 --> 04:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
have additional licenses they have their
 
04:00:54.990 --> 04:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturing license they have a
 
04:00:56.429 --> 04:00:56.439 align:start position:0%
restaurant on premise license they have
 
04:00:58.309 --> 04:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
a retail outlet location license that
 
04:01:00.550 --> 04:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
they need to acquire for this so we
 
04:01:02.389 --> 04:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
would be asking for parody there there's
 
04:01:04.550 --> 04:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
also a delivery license fee
 
04:01:04.560 --> 04:01:06.349 align:start position:0%
also a delivery license fee
that's

04:01:06.349 --> 04:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:01:09.149 --> 04:01:09.159 align:start position:0%
$250 the other stipulation is that
 
04:01:10.790 --> 04:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
currently as this is written it says
 
04:01:12.510 --> 04:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
that there is no food requirement so
 
04:01:15.269 --> 04:01:15.279 align:start position:0%
what is to stop somebody from coming in
 
04:01:17.349 --> 04:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
Billing a Growler and leaving without
 
04:01:20.510 --> 04:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
food in essence that is to go purchasing
 
04:01:24.469 --> 04:01:24.479 align:start position:0%
at retail not at a restaurant therefore
 
04:01:27.870 --> 04:01:27.880 align:start position:0%
the retail Service delivery says that
 
04:01:31.070 --> 04:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
food must be purchased with the alcohol
 
04:01:32.510 --> 04:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
this would allow for them to just
 
04:01:36.070 --> 04:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
purchase alcohol and take it to go uh
 
04:01:38.550 --> 04:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
additionally we aside from that there's
 
04:01:41.630 --> 04:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
no way for a brewery to opt out of that
 
04:01:43.229 --> 04:01:43.239 align:start position:0%
there's no Clause that says that the
 
04:01:45.030 --> 04:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
brewery can decide that they do not want
 
04:01:47.790 --> 04:01:47.800 align:start position:0%
their product to be repackaged so
 
04:01:49.950 --> 04:01:49.960 align:start position:0%
there's concerns for there and other
 
04:01:52.269 --> 04:01:52.279 align:start position:0%
than that there's also no specifications
 
04:01:55.469 --> 04:01:55.479 align:start position:0%
for any off- premise consumption only in
 
04:01:57.550 --> 04:01:57.560 align:start position:0%
the language so that means somebody
 
04:01:59.630 --> 04:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
could essentially fill a growler on site
 
04:02:01.830 --> 04:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
and then go sit at a picnic table at the
 
04:02:03.750 --> 04:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
restaurant and drink that entire
 
04:02:06.349 --> 04:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
Growler and those are our concerns how
 
04:02:07.710 --> 04:02:07.720 align:start position:0%
what's hell that different than just
 
04:02:10.590 --> 04:02:10.600 align:start position:0%
getting a picture of
 
04:02:14.830 --> 04:02:14.840 align:start position:0%
beer it's not but it's considered retail
 
04:02:16.229 --> 04:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
so therefore there would be no rooms and
 
04:02:21.469 --> 04:02:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:21.479 --> 04:02:24.630 align:start position:0%
 
retail

04:02:24.630 --> 04:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:27.550 --> 04:02:27.560 align:start position:0%
really once it becomes r i c this whole
 
04:02:29.429 --> 04:02:29.439 align:start position:0%
statute that everything that was done
 
04:02:32.950 --> 04:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
under the statue was was uh rooms and
 
04:02:35.590 --> 04:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
meals no because if it's packaged Goods
 
04:02:37.670 --> 04:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
it becomes retail product and therefore
 
04:02:39.710 --> 04:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
retail would not be taxed well you're
 
04:02:41.550 --> 04:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
just throwing a curve I have never
 
04:02:44.750 --> 04:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
thought about m
 
04:02:48.389 --> 04:02:48.399 align:start position:0%
okay CU I'm pretty sure if we look at
 
04:02:50.269 --> 04:02:50.279 align:start position:0%
the current statue now everything that
 
04:02:53.389 --> 04:02:53.399 align:start position:0%
goes out is treated as rooms and
 
04:02:56.469 --> 04:02:56.479 align:start position:0%
meals even though it's in a bottle you
 
04:02:59.870 --> 04:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
know seal bottle wi wine you buy a wine
 
04:03:02.389 --> 04:03:02.399 align:start position:0%
bottle of wine at at a restaurant and
 
04:03:05.790 --> 04:03:05.800 align:start position:0%
and use this delivery system you're
 
04:03:07.830 --> 04:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
right Mike aren't you guys charging
 
04:03:10.990 --> 04:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
rooms and you don't know maybe
 
04:03:18.429 --> 04:03:18.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:19.990 --> 04:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
we don't know okay but technically
 
04:03:20.000 --> 04:03:21.950 align:start position:0%
we don't know okay but technically
they're

04:03:21.950 --> 04:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
they're
 
04:03:24.510 --> 04:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
not but right now this would stipulate
 
04:03:26.149 --> 04:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
that no food is required for the
 
04:03:28.830 --> 04:03:28.840 align:start position:0%
purchase of this because it is
 
04:03:32.630 --> 04:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:32.640 --> 04:03:34.630 align:start position:0%
 
written

04:03:34.630 --> 04:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
written
 
04:03:37.630 --> 04:03:37.640 align:start position:0%
uh I've never thought of it that way but
 
04:03:40.110 --> 04:03:40.120 align:start position:0%
that's interesting that's interesting
 
04:03:42.229 --> 04:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
okay and I'm happy to answer any
 
04:03:45.070 --> 04:03:45.080 align:start position:0%
questions and on the other factors we
 
04:03:47.309 --> 04:03:47.319 align:start position:0%
have no opposition to the others as they
 
04:03:52.950 --> 04:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
are currently written um it was just the
 
04:03:55.710 --> 04:03:55.720 align:start position:0%
third okay thank
 
04:03:59.550 --> 04:03:59.560 align:start position:0%
you yes representative thank you I just
 
04:04:01.349 --> 04:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
have a clarification question to
 
04:04:03.389 --> 04:04:03.399 align:start position:0%
whomever can answer it when you go to
 
04:04:05.030 --> 04:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
the grocery store and you buy one of
 
04:04:07.429 --> 04:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
their packaged meals you get you get
 
04:04:10.910 --> 04:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
charged a rooms of meals tax so why
 
04:04:12.750 --> 04:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't if a restaurant is providing
 
04:04:14.670 --> 04:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
the same thing
 
04:04:19.469 --> 04:04:19.479 align:start position:0%
and a it's a drink too with it why would
 
04:04:22.590 --> 04:04:22.600 align:start position:0%
that not get charged rooms and meals I I
 
04:04:25.030 --> 04:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
I mean we made I know that in terms of
 
04:04:28.269 --> 04:04:28.279 align:start position:0%
we had the big issue with the the
 
04:04:32.110 --> 04:04:32.120 align:start position:0%
Brewers that when they were pouring beer
 
04:04:34.790 --> 04:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
and selling it inside the beer
 
04:04:36.990 --> 04:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
establishment there was some question
 
04:04:39.070 --> 04:04:39.080 align:start position:0%
whether that was room's meals but in
 
04:04:41.070 --> 04:04:41.080 align:start position:0%
that case that they're pouring it and
 
04:04:43.349 --> 04:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
there's it's an open container so yes
 
04:04:45.469 --> 04:04:45.479 align:start position:0%
room and meals you you guys collect
 
04:04:48.790 --> 04:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals tax not on Growlers
 
04:04:50.389 --> 04:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
because they're consider on Growlers
 
04:04:51.910 --> 04:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
because the assumption is they're
 
04:04:53.990 --> 04:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
capping it and walking out correct but
 
04:04:57.229 --> 04:04:57.239 align:start position:0%
if it's a glass correct or if I don't
 
04:04:59.670 --> 04:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
know if you sell pictures yep and so
 
04:05:02.030 --> 04:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
those are rooms and meals because it's
 
04:05:06.469 --> 04:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:10.429 --> 04:05:10.439 align:start position:0%
container chair because the beer and
 
04:05:20.990 --> 04:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:25.070 --> 04:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
right right no I see that grocery St
 
04:05:33.110 --> 04:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:36.030 --> 04:05:36.040 align:start position:0%
be if if it's a well so that's I'm
 
04:05:38.349 --> 04:05:38.359 align:start position:0%
saying it's it if you take the the rest
 
04:05:41.349 --> 04:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
of the statute the question is if the
 
04:05:45.070 --> 04:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
margarita was made at a
 
04:05:47.429 --> 04:05:47.439 align:start position:0%
restaurant therefore it should be rooms
 
04:05:50.710 --> 04:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
and meals and whereas again we're
 
04:05:54.750 --> 04:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
talking about uh um in this case this
 
04:05:56.950 --> 04:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
was clearly I thought it was a growler I
 
04:05:58.229 --> 04:05:58.239 align:start position:0%
that was the other concern we had is
 
04:06:00.670 --> 04:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
there was no stipulation to me when I
 
04:06:03.710 --> 04:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
read that it was a red Growler to me but
 
04:06:06.469 --> 04:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
but but um but you know in terms of a
 
04:06:09.030 --> 04:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
refillable container that could be a
 
04:06:11.469 --> 04:06:11.479 align:start position:0%
pitcher so somebody can walk in with a
 
04:06:13.670 --> 04:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
pitcher and say I'm I'm going to take it
 
04:06:16.910 --> 04:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
away and and it's not it doesn't say it
 
04:06:18.269 --> 04:06:18.279 align:start position:0%
had to be
 
04:06:20.630 --> 04:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
resalable refillable
 
04:06:23.349 --> 04:06:23.359 align:start position:0%
container regardless yeah so it doesn't
 
04:06:25.630 --> 04:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't say it had to be sealed under
 
04:06:27.429 --> 04:06:27.439 align:start position:0%
that under that particular paragraph
 
04:06:29.189 --> 04:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
correct I will also add the majority of
 
04:06:32.389 --> 04:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
breweries no longer fill Growlers based
 
04:06:34.550 --> 04:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
on Growlers are really on their way out
 
04:06:45.550 --> 04:06:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:48.429 --> 04:06:48.439 align:start position:0%
that's the original grower bille yes we
 
04:06:49.870 --> 04:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
we used to have we used to have another
 
04:06:51.910 --> 04:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
member of this committee who would who
 
04:06:54.070 --> 04:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
went through the whole thing about how
 
04:06:55.950 --> 04:06:55.960 align:start position:0%
how the why it was called a growler is
 
04:06:59.830 --> 04:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:04.389 --> 04:07:04.399 align:start position:0%
burp yeah okay thank you thank you all
 
04:07:20.670 --> 04:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:23.269 --> 04:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman committee
 
04:07:26.309 --> 04:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
members for the record uh Chief Mark
 
04:07:28.790 --> 04:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
armaganian uh director of liquor
 
04:07:30.710 --> 04:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement and Licensing with me here
 
04:07:34.149 --> 04:07:34.159 align:start position:0%
today is Deputy Chief Danielle Elston uh
 
04:07:37.469 --> 04:07:37.479 align:start position:0%
deputy director of the same entity um I
 
04:07:40.030 --> 04:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
think the better way for me to take uh
 
04:07:42.269 --> 04:07:42.279 align:start position:0%
representative Grill's uh bill and we
 
04:07:46.750 --> 04:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
have spoken at at quite extent on some
 
04:07:49.830 --> 04:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
of the uh different things that are in
 
04:07:52.550 --> 04:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
this bill um there are three items in
 
04:07:55.870 --> 04:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
this bill as you already know um and if
 
04:07:59.229 --> 04:07:59.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not mistaken Growers was your bill
 
04:08:02.269 --> 04:08:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:06.950 --> 04:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
it represent tur that's already
 
04:08:09.550 --> 04:08:09.560 align:start position:0%
passed we passed the grower bill yeah
 
04:08:12.189 --> 04:08:12.199 align:start position:0%
last year last year I thought we
 
04:08:15.030 --> 04:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
did okay for manufacturers only not for
 
04:08:17.149 --> 04:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
retail yeah no it was only for the
 
04:08:19.469 --> 04:08:19.479 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturers um so I think
 
04:08:21.070 --> 04:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
it's better for me to go through this
 
04:08:23.950 --> 04:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
that way and then kind of the extra
 
04:08:25.710 --> 04:08:25.720 align:start position:0%
stuff that's on it and I'll do it
 
04:08:30.149 --> 04:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
quickly for you um hours of service um
 
04:08:31.950 --> 04:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
like last year we look at that as an
 
04:08:35.950 --> 04:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate I totally re realize
 
04:08:35.960 --> 04:08:37.389 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate I totally re realize
that

04:08:37.389 --> 04:08:37.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:08:41.030 --> 04:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
we're there is a movement to start
 
04:08:43.149 --> 04:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
deregulating some of the restrictions
 
04:08:45.990 --> 04:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
that are on um I'm not going to give you
 
04:08:48.510 --> 04:08:48.520 align:start position:0%
my opinion on how that is right now I
 
04:08:50.429 --> 04:08:50.439 align:start position:0%
think I'll be given opportunities later
 
04:08:53.269 --> 04:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
on in the session to talk about that uh
 
04:08:56.670 --> 04:08:56.680 align:start position:0%
but right now um we're looking at this
 
04:08:59.389 --> 04:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
and the other law enforcement groups at
 
04:09:03.630 --> 04:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
like the Chiefs um uh the Police
 
04:09:05.710 --> 04:09:05.720 align:start position:0%
Association I'm sure the Troopers
 
04:09:07.469 --> 04:09:07.479 align:start position:0%
Association will all look at this as an
 
04:09:11.070 --> 04:09:11.080 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate right now uh we did
 
04:09:14.269 --> 04:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
some quick math this morning just taking
 
04:09:17.269 --> 04:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
the middle of the road of one of our
 
04:09:19.389 --> 04:09:19.399 align:start position:0%
investigators and right now our
 
04:09:22.950 --> 04:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
investigators are at the max of what
 
04:09:25.830 --> 04:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
statistically and nationally uh they
 
04:09:28.389 --> 04:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
could handle as far as establishments
 
04:09:31.750 --> 04:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
that they cover out the 6400 uh lenses
 
04:09:34.030 --> 04:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
that we have so with the group that we
 
04:09:36.710 --> 04:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
have right now we're looking at almost a
 
04:09:39.950 --> 04:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
quarter of a million dollar over what we
 
04:09:42.790 --> 04:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
spend right now in regulating the
 
04:09:42.800 --> 04:09:43.830 align:start position:0%
spend right now in regulating the
industry

04:09:43.830 --> 04:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
industry
 
04:09:46.429 --> 04:09:46.439 align:start position:0%
it's about uh
 
04:09:50.429 --> 04:09:50.439 align:start position:0%
221 uh 29,000 two
 
04:09:53.910 --> 04:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
$230,000 a year just for three extra
 
04:09:56.870 --> 04:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
days uh the days of the weekend Friday
 
04:09:59.149 --> 04:09:59.159 align:start position:0%
Saturday Sunday or Thursday Friday
 
04:10:02.590 --> 04:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
Saturday um so right there uh as you
 
04:10:04.790 --> 04:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
know we've always been fiscally
 
04:10:08.870 --> 04:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
responsible um we see uh our next the
 
04:10:12.710 --> 04:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
next phase of this which is uh extension
 
04:10:13.990 --> 04:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
of our
 
04:10:15.710 --> 04:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
that is something that can be done right
 
04:10:18.389 --> 04:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
now uh we talked about that last year
 
04:10:21.469 --> 04:10:21.479 align:start position:0%
also right now we have three
 
04:10:23.790 --> 04:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
establishments out of
 
04:10:27.389 --> 04:10:27.399 align:start position:0%
our three yeah three jurisdictions but
 
04:10:29.950 --> 04:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
uh how many on premise
 
04:10:29.960 --> 04:10:31.469 align:start position:0%
uh how many on premise
3200

04:10:31.469 --> 04:10:31.479 align:start position:0%
3200
 
04:10:36.070 --> 04:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
lenses uh we have a total of of that
 
04:10:37.870 --> 04:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
that are actually asking for an
 
04:10:42.269 --> 04:10:42.279 align:start position:0%
extension of service hours uh one being
 
04:10:45.389 --> 04:10:45.399 align:start position:0%
uh nashwa the the other being lonia and
 
04:10:49.710 --> 04:10:49.720 align:start position:0%
what's our third one Berlin so so um we
 
04:10:53.429 --> 04:10:53.439 align:start position:0%
don't see that as an issue that the
 
04:10:56.870 --> 04:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
industry is asking for readily right now
 
04:11:01.109 --> 04:11:01.119 align:start position:0%
nobody has come to us requesting this uh
 
04:11:03.309 --> 04:11:03.319 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly if they did request it
 
04:11:05.550 --> 04:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
if we saw an overabundance of requests
 
04:11:07.710 --> 04:11:07.720 align:start position:0%
on this it would be something we were we
 
04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
would message to your group about to
 
04:11:14.349 --> 04:11:14.359 align:start position:0%
possibly come up with legisl of our own
 
04:11:17.630 --> 04:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
to accommodate but we're not seeing that
 
04:11:23.070 --> 04:11:23.080 align:start position:0%
um liquor to go um as you know uh during
 
04:11:26.469 --> 04:11:26.479 align:start position:0%
uh the the nucleus or the the heart of
 
04:11:31.590 --> 04:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
the covid year um we were uh contacted
 
04:11:34.510 --> 04:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
by Governor sununu's office during that
 
04:11:37.309 --> 04:11:37.319 align:start position:0%
time uh we were asked how we could jump
 
04:11:41.309 --> 04:11:41.319 align:start position:0%
start the industry uh we uh pushed
 
04:11:44.750 --> 04:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
forward to go uh um that was quite
 
04:11:48.870 --> 04:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
successful but it was to go in original
 
04:11:51.469 --> 04:11:51.479 align:start position:0%
manufactured containers so we knew what
 
04:11:54.990 --> 04:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
the ABV was on that they were the
 
04:11:58.469 --> 04:11:58.479 align:start position:0%
Integrity of the uh the sealed product
 
04:12:02.790 --> 04:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
was there so we knew that we would not
 
04:12:07.269 --> 04:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
um uh we would not Infiltrate The the
 
04:12:10.790 --> 04:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
nucleus of the car operating cars and
 
04:12:13.269 --> 04:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
and open containers and all that stuff
 
04:12:17.389 --> 04:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
that you've just brought up so so the
 
04:12:20.149 --> 04:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
biggest thing when it comes to liquor to
 
04:12:23.950 --> 04:12:23.960 align:start position:0%
go and and specifically spirits to go uh
 
04:12:26.429 --> 04:12:26.439 align:start position:0%
mixed drinks is that we don't know what
 
04:12:28.990 --> 04:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
the ABV is in that container there's no
 
04:12:33.149 --> 04:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
way for us to check it um so now let's
 
04:12:35.229 --> 04:12:35.239 align:start position:0%
you know we talked about Margaritas Jin
 
04:12:37.229 --> 04:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
and tonics whatever you want to let's
 
04:12:39.229 --> 04:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
talk scorpion bowls let's talk Long
 
04:12:42.790 --> 04:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
Island Iced Tea let's talk my ties let's
 
04:12:42.800 --> 04:12:43.710 align:start position:0%
Island Iced Tea let's talk my ties let's
talk

04:12:43.710 --> 04:12:43.720 align:start position:0%
talk
 
04:12:47.189 --> 04:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
the St the the God forbid a negative
 
04:12:49.670 --> 04:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
incident happens in the already high
 
04:12:52.710 --> 04:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
number of negative incident on our
 
04:12:55.229 --> 04:12:55.239 align:start position:0%
highways goes even higher and we end up
 
04:12:57.630 --> 04:12:57.640 align:start position:0%
being the joke of the whole nation
 
04:13:01.149 --> 04:13:01.159 align:start position:0%
because our numbers are that high so I
 
04:13:04.309 --> 04:13:04.319 align:start position:0%
get and I'm one of those guys I've I've
 
04:13:08.309 --> 04:13:08.319 align:start position:0%
leaned a lot to relaxing regulation as
 
04:13:11.630 --> 04:13:11.640 align:start position:0%
you know over the eight years these
 
04:13:14.870 --> 04:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
hitting these three point points is only
 
04:13:18.469 --> 04:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
going to create a a problem for all of
 
04:13:20.830 --> 04:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
us and a problem with our with our
 
04:13:23.030 --> 04:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
safety in our communities we only
 
04:13:25.750 --> 04:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
regulate to the level of community and
 
04:13:28.670 --> 04:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
Industry Safety we do not over regulate
 
04:13:31.030 --> 04:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
we have promised that to you guys uh
 
04:13:32.910 --> 04:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
from day one eight years ago when this
 
04:13:35.950 --> 04:13:35.960 align:start position:0%
new Administration came in and we have
 
04:13:39.269 --> 04:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
guard rails up to make sure that we we
 
04:13:43.830 --> 04:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
stay within that um we see this as as a
 
04:13:46.070 --> 04:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
very negative I get the fun factor of
 
04:13:50.710 --> 04:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
all that I have kids in this age group
 
04:13:52.590 --> 04:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
um I know what they're doing what
 
04:13:54.710 --> 04:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
they're not the age group that has
 
04:13:57.790 --> 04:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
become of drinking age recently is not
 
04:14:01.550 --> 04:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
drinking they're going and using other
 
04:14:04.630 --> 04:14:04.640 align:start position:0%
elements um that this state has chosen
 
04:14:07.870 --> 04:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
not to go in that direction right now
 
04:14:10.229 --> 04:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
you're going out of
 
04:14:13.990 --> 04:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
state so thank God that my kids
 
04:14:17.830 --> 04:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
personally have NCAA uh sport uh
 
04:14:20.710 --> 04:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
regulations and and other things that
 
04:14:23.790 --> 04:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
keep them preclude them from uh from
 
04:14:28.670 --> 04:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
doing nefarious things so um but but
 
04:14:30.990 --> 04:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
that that is in a nutshell what we're
 
04:14:33.550 --> 04:14:33.560 align:start position:0%
looking at right now uh Danielle has
 
04:14:35.229 --> 04:14:35.239 align:start position:0%
some technical features that she'd like
 
04:14:38.590 --> 04:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
to talk about um but we see this as
 
04:14:41.109 --> 04:14:41.119 align:start position:0%
stuff that we've already touched upon
 
04:14:45.710 --> 04:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
and do um and other things that we uh
 
04:14:49.710 --> 04:14:49.720 align:start position:0%
have negative uh information on that we
 
04:14:52.309 --> 04:14:52.319 align:start position:0%
would like to not to see in happen in
 
04:14:54.830 --> 04:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
this state so dang
 
04:15:00.269 --> 04:15:00.279 align:start position:0%
it thank you um CDC produces a community
 
04:15:02.550 --> 04:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
guide they publish it regularly um this
 
04:15:04.189 --> 04:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
is distributed through the national
 
04:15:06.389 --> 04:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
alcohol and Beverage Control Association
 
04:15:08.070 --> 04:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh their Community guide uh concludes
 
04:15:09.269 --> 04:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
that every additional two hours of
 
04:15:10.870 --> 04:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
alcohol sales was associated with an
 
04:15:13.229 --> 04:15:13.239 align:start position:0%
increase of violence uh last there there
 
04:15:16.389 --> 04:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
was a study group who did also did a um
 
04:15:20.269 --> 04:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
study on um the increase in hours of
 
04:15:21.990 --> 04:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
alcohol sale and they also concluded
 
04:15:23.389 --> 04:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
that there is an increase of violence
 
04:15:27.429 --> 04:15:27.439 align:start position:0%
associated with um the increase in hours
 
04:15:30.070 --> 04:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
of sale with alcohol um as the chief
 
04:15:31.349 --> 04:15:31.359 align:start position:0%
said we have three jurisdictions who
 
04:15:33.189 --> 04:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
have taken right now you can by law
 
04:15:35.229 --> 04:15:35.239 align:start position:0%
serve till two if your jurisdiction
 
04:15:36.670 --> 04:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
adopts that there's three that have done
 
04:15:38.830 --> 04:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
it NASA has only allowed it for
 
04:15:42.109 --> 04:15:42.119 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming establishments Bonia
 
04:15:43.990 --> 04:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
only allows it for the where's Beach
 
04:15:47.030 --> 04:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
location and Berlin has uh they were the
 
04:15:49.349 --> 04:15:49.359 align:start position:0%
first ones to pass it um they have a
 
04:15:51.109 --> 04:15:51.119 align:start position:0%
very small amount of on sale licenses
 
04:15:53.510 --> 04:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
and from our um
 
04:15:55.870 --> 04:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh surveillance that we've
 
04:15:57.630 --> 04:15:57.640 align:start position:0%
seen that uh many of them aren't even
 
04:16:01.030 --> 04:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
utilizing the um staying open after
 
04:16:04.590 --> 04:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
after 1:00 a.m. in terms of the delivery
 
04:16:07.109 --> 04:16:07.119 align:start position:0%
um right now we have 2100 uh lies who
 
04:16:09.830 --> 04:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
are eligible for the um delivery and
 
04:16:13.950 --> 04:16:13.960 align:start position:0%
curb side of beer and wine only 37 have
 
04:16:16.550 --> 04:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
um used that license last year we
 
04:16:17.910 --> 04:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
received a grant to do some data
 
04:16:20.269 --> 04:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
collection on the restaurant delivery um
 
04:16:23.109 --> 04:16:23.119 align:start position:0%
of those 37 uh roughly 10 to 12 were not
 
04:16:26.469 --> 04:16:26.479 align:start position:0%
even utilizing curbside delivery um
 
04:16:29.389 --> 04:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
curbside pickup or delivery um and we
 
04:16:32.469 --> 04:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
did have a 22% failure rate of those 37
 
04:16:35.630 --> 04:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
license establishments that were um
 
04:16:37.070 --> 04:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
utilizing the restaurant delivery when
 
04:16:39.229 --> 04:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
it came to uh selling to
 
04:16:43.469 --> 04:16:43.479 align:start position:0%
miners um so again in terms of of those
 
04:16:45.349 --> 04:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
licens to do is a small amount that are
 
04:16:48.269 --> 04:16:48.279 align:start position:0%
actually um even utilizing the the
 
04:16:50.070 --> 04:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
delivery of beer and wine we don't allow
 
04:16:53.349 --> 04:16:53.359 align:start position:0%
third party delivery in the state um I
 
04:16:54.309 --> 04:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
don't think you want to see the
 
04:16:56.030 --> 04:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
statistics on the rest of the states
 
04:16:57.189 --> 04:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
that have allowed the third party
 
04:16:59.309 --> 04:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
delivery so uh we support the W2
 
04:17:02.870 --> 04:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
employee um If This Were to pass and um
 
04:17:04.469 --> 04:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
as many others said in terms of the
 
04:17:06.550 --> 04:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
refillable containers it doesn't specify
 
04:17:09.349 --> 04:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
what that container would be so um and
 
04:17:11.030 --> 04:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
there is no food requirement for that so
 
04:17:12.590 --> 04:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
yes you could walk as written right now
 
04:17:15.109 --> 04:17:15.119 align:start position:0%
you could walk in with any type form of
 
04:17:16.950 --> 04:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
tog go cup or you could bring in your
 
04:17:18.670 --> 04:17:18.680 align:start position:0%
coffee cup and have that filled with
 
04:17:23.710 --> 04:17:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:27.030 --> 04:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
go represent Amon than you Mr chair
 
04:17:28.349 --> 04:17:28.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony you talk
 
04:17:30.269 --> 04:17:30.279 align:start position:0%
about third party delivery I I was in
 
04:17:32.790 --> 04:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
Texas a few months ago and I want a door
 
04:17:35.910 --> 04:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
dash for my my little hotel room and I
 
04:17:37.910 --> 04:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
noticed there was an option for liquor
 
04:17:39.710 --> 04:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
and it had you know all the drinks that
 
04:17:42.510 --> 04:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
you could uh imagine they don't have
 
04:17:44.830 --> 04:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
state stores there they have retail
 
04:17:47.590 --> 04:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
liquor establishments um but I think the
 
04:17:50.229 --> 04:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
procedure was they check your ID before
 
04:17:52.670 --> 04:17:52.680 align:start position:0%
they hand it over to you so you know
 
04:17:54.469 --> 04:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
door Dash is a big company Uber Eats
 
04:17:56.309 --> 04:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
they're big companies it seems like in
 
04:17:58.910 --> 04:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
other states they already have this uh
 
04:18:03.070 --> 04:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
facility for policing the delivery um is
 
04:18:04.590 --> 04:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
that something that we could consider
 
04:18:08.269 --> 04:18:08.279 align:start position:0%
here that that might push us in that
 
04:18:10.670 --> 04:18:10.680 align:start position:0%
direction start thank you for your
 
04:18:13.269 --> 04:18:13.279 align:start position:0%
question representative um
 
04:18:19.269 --> 04:18:19.279 align:start position:0%
so first uh those entities are not
 
04:18:22.229 --> 04:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
lenses so there's no way to hold them
 
04:18:25.950 --> 04:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
accountable uh if they don't there is
 
04:18:28.750 --> 04:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
data out there that these entities are
 
04:18:32.189 --> 04:18:32.199 align:start position:0%
not doing as you have stated they're not
 
04:18:36.469 --> 04:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
checking those IDs and and we're having
 
04:18:39.109 --> 04:18:39.119 align:start position:0%
alcohol being or they having I should
 
04:18:41.429 --> 04:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
say alcohol being shipped to or
 
04:18:45.990 --> 04:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
delivered to schools colleges to that
 
04:18:47.990 --> 04:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
vulnerable age group that isn't of age
 
04:18:53.630 --> 04:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
to drink um uh and and thus far um we
 
04:18:56.389 --> 04:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
haven't seen anything positive we were
 
04:18:58.429 --> 04:18:58.439 align:start position:0%
actually the ones that asked in that
 
04:19:02.229 --> 04:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
bill to have a W2 employee of of the
 
04:19:05.229 --> 04:19:05.239 align:start position:0%
establishment not by
 
04:19:08.710 --> 04:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
Statute so
 
04:19:12.710 --> 04:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
anything so yes um Nationwide we um
 
04:19:13.790 --> 04:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
we're actually part of a group called
 
04:19:17.070 --> 04:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
The National liquor law um enforcement
 
04:19:20.469 --> 04:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
Association and um that since covid when
 
04:19:22.309 --> 04:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of these groups pass it that this
 
04:19:24.830 --> 04:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
has been the Hot Topic at um throughout
 
04:19:28.590 --> 04:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
the group and um the enforcement
 
04:19:31.550 --> 04:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
challenges and uh High failure rates of
 
04:19:34.429 --> 04:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
the third party delivery um entities
 
04:19:38.269 --> 04:19:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:43.510 --> 04:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
alcohol okay oh represent
 
04:19:44.550 --> 04:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
04:19:46.229 --> 04:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
question um at the beginning you
 
04:19:48.349 --> 04:19:48.359 align:start position:0%
referred to an unfunded mandate could
 
04:19:51.990 --> 04:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
you explain what you meant by that so in
 
04:19:54.149 --> 04:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
appropriation if we're talking a quarter
 
04:19:56.349 --> 04:19:56.359 align:start position:0%
of a million dollars and that was just
 
04:19:57.870 --> 04:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
quick math that we did this morning
 
04:19:59.469 --> 04:19:59.479 align:start position:0%
representative and thank you for your
 
04:20:01.389 --> 04:20:01.399 align:start position:0%
good to see you great for your uh thank

04:20:07.950 --> 04:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
um that is a quarter of a million
 
04:20:13.070 --> 04:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
dollars that we haven't budgeted for for
 
04:20:16.070 --> 04:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement action uh to come up into
 
04:20:20.149 --> 04:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
the next half of this uh this coming
 
04:20:24.070 --> 04:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal so right now where we're all
 
04:20:27.990 --> 04:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
being asked to give back more than to
 
04:20:30.630 --> 04:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
move forward and that the money is flat
 
04:20:33.349 --> 04:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
right now as far as alcohol sales are
 
04:20:36.189 --> 04:20:36.199 align:start position:0%
concerned we look at this as being an
 
04:20:38.790 --> 04:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
expenditure that really isn't necessary
 
04:20:42.429 --> 04:20:42.439 align:start position:0%
right now because we don't have the um
 
04:20:42.439 --> 04:20:43.269 align:start position:0%
right now because we don't have the um
the

04:20:43.269 --> 04:20:43.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:20:46.269 --> 04:20:46.279 align:start position:0%
the asking to do this uh our
 
04:20:49.030 --> 04:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
establishments can ask to do this right
 
04:20:51.790 --> 04:20:51.800 align:start position:0%
now and they're not asking us to do this
 
04:20:54.550 --> 04:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
further question me inquire thank you um
 
04:20:56.030 --> 04:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
right so my question is we heard from
 
04:20:57.950 --> 04:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
the Restaurant Association that no one
 
04:21:01.149 --> 04:21:01.159 align:start position:0%
wants to stay open uh you're uh
 
04:21:02.870 --> 04:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
affirming that no one wants to stay open
 
04:21:04.550 --> 04:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
so where does the additional enforcement
 
04:21:07.910 --> 04:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
cost come into play it would be there
 
04:21:10.269 --> 04:21:10.279 align:start position:0%
just because we would have to be out for
 
04:21:13.269 --> 04:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
those purposes we couldn't tell if one
 
04:21:15.269 --> 04:21:15.279 align:start position:0%
establishment stays open in the whole
 
04:21:16.950 --> 04:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
state we're going to have to keep people
 
04:21:20.670 --> 04:21:20.680 align:start position:0%
out for that time we can't just say okay
 
04:21:22.429 --> 04:21:22.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to let that one person stay
 
04:21:24.070 --> 04:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
open and there's no
 
04:21:29.109 --> 04:21:29.119 align:start position:0%
oversight um and whether that it's just
 
04:21:31.870 --> 04:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
regulating or or inspecting that
 
04:21:33.670 --> 04:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
establishment or making sure that
 
04:21:36.830 --> 04:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
establishment is doing right uh by by
 
04:21:39.950 --> 04:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
the laws it it can go even more so if
 
04:21:41.870 --> 04:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
there is a negative incident that comes
 
04:21:44.109 --> 04:21:44.119 align:start position:0%
out of that establishment and let's say
 
04:21:47.510 --> 04:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's a fatal crash State Police right
 
04:21:51.870 --> 04:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
now calls us to do that part of the
 
04:21:54.389 --> 04:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
investigation uh as it relates to our
 
04:21:57.429 --> 04:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
licensed establishment uh just because
 
04:22:00.030 --> 04:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
we can navigate
 
04:22:03.590 --> 04:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
um a lot better A lot more fluid through
 
04:22:07.309 --> 04:22:07.319 align:start position:0%
those establishments than they can um so
 
04:22:10.269 --> 04:22:10.279 align:start position:0%
so we look at this as as I said we look
 
04:22:13.189 --> 04:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
at it as a dollars and cents item
 
04:22:16.269 --> 04:22:16.279 align:start position:0%
um uh that the money isn't there right
 
04:22:20.229 --> 04:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
now to do this um we also look at it as
 
04:22:22.590 --> 04:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
you're you're giving more time for
 
04:22:26.149 --> 04:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
people to drink or consume alcohol so
 
04:22:29.590 --> 04:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
where where it has been testified that
 
04:22:32.670 --> 04:22:32.680 align:start position:0%
the positive is or the negative is
 
04:22:35.229 --> 04:22:35.239 align:start position:0%
you're pushing because the the
 
04:22:38.429 --> 04:22:38.439 align:start position:0%
bookmarker or or the guard rails on the
 
04:22:42.070 --> 04:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
end time and people are drinking quicker
 
04:22:44.070 --> 04:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
I would say you're giving them more time
 
04:22:47.550 --> 04:22:47.560 align:start position:0%
to drink more alcohol so conversely it's
 
04:22:51.510 --> 04:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
just given more time to consume more to
 
04:22:55.149 --> 04:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
push your own personal uh blood alcohol
 
04:22:57.510 --> 04:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
volume up higher which is going to
 
04:23:00.349 --> 04:23:00.359 align:start position:0%
create the possibility of more negative
 
04:23:02.469 --> 04:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
incidents on the on the street on the
 
04:23:05.670 --> 04:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
highways whether they're DWI and nothing
 
04:23:07.550 --> 04:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
happens out of it other than somebody's
 
04:23:11.269 --> 04:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
arrested for DWI or a God forbid a crash
 
04:23:14.510 --> 04:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
happens which none of want to see so I
 
04:23:17.070 --> 04:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
get where this is going and and I get
 
04:23:19.710 --> 04:23:19.720 align:start position:0%
where where you're leaning toward but at
 
04:23:22.630 --> 04:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
the end of the day I in my own view I
 
04:23:24.590 --> 04:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
don't see the positives outweighing the
 
04:23:27.830 --> 04:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
negatives here just for informational
 
04:23:29.790 --> 04:23:29.800 align:start position:0%
purposes further question you may
 
04:23:33.830 --> 04:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
inquire um so do you think that uh
 
04:23:37.910 --> 04:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
license fees should be uh based on hours
 
04:23:42.670 --> 04:23:42.680 align:start position:0%
of operation then if uh if if that's
 
04:23:44.349 --> 04:23:44.359 align:start position:0%
there's a correlation with enforcement
 
04:23:47.510 --> 04:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
costs um so thank you for your question
 
04:23:52.189 --> 04:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
again representative I I first of all
 
04:23:54.990 --> 04:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
that has always been something that is
 
04:23:59.550 --> 04:23:59.560 align:start position:0%
is regulated by your group um you this
 
04:24:03.910 --> 04:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
group sets the the license fees um the
 
04:24:07.189 --> 04:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
last time that was done is in I think if
 
04:24:09.750 --> 04:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
I remember what Aiden and I spoke about
 
04:24:13.670 --> 04:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
a couple weeks ago was probably 199
 
04:24:16.630 --> 04:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
um but I will say that every time that
 
04:24:20.990 --> 04:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
we've had smaller items like one license
 
04:24:24.630 --> 04:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
fee that needed to be increased it was
 
04:24:29.149 --> 04:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
always frowned upon um but um you know
 
04:24:31.429 --> 04:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
that we would support and as far as fees
 
04:24:33.510 --> 04:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
are concerned we would support anything
 
04:24:38.870 --> 04:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:41.389 --> 04:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
forward you all said or another question
 
04:24:43.950 --> 04:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
I got another one keep goingt different
 
04:24:48.030 --> 04:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
topic so on the um on the Togo beverages
 
04:24:50.070 --> 04:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
which I don't think makes sense to call
 
04:24:52.149 --> 04:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
them too beverages more like delivery
 
04:24:54.189 --> 04:24:54.199 align:start position:0%
beverages um you mentioned being
 
04:24:57.349 --> 04:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
concerned about uh Highway incidents yep
 
04:24:59.590 --> 04:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
and yes don't you think though that by
 
04:25:02.630 --> 04:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
delivering the beverages to the home
 
04:25:04.349 --> 04:25:04.359 align:start position:0%
that we would be reducing Highway
 
04:25:07.070 --> 04:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
incidences as opposed to people having
 
04:25:08.990 --> 04:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
to leave their home go to the bar drink
 
04:25:11.830 --> 04:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
and then drive home well it they aren't
 
04:25:14.309 --> 04:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
the same delivery is different than to
 
04:25:18.429 --> 04:25:18.439 align:start position:0%
go and they the to go
 
04:25:22.389 --> 04:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
delivery um I don't I don't
 
04:25:27.309 --> 04:25:27.319 align:start position:0%
see I don't see what I do see is we have
 
04:25:30.630 --> 04:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
liquor going out the door that we don't
 
04:25:33.830 --> 04:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
know what the ABV is that that's my
 
04:25:36.710 --> 04:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
concern with that if it was liquor in a
 
04:25:39.429 --> 04:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
in a what we call an RTD a ready to
 
04:25:41.950 --> 04:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
drink like the canned Jack dangels and
 
04:25:41.960 --> 04:25:42.870 align:start position:0%
drink like the canned Jack dangels and
Coke

04:25:42.870 --> 04:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
Coke
 
04:25:46.189 --> 04:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
uh not to pick on one but but that seems
 
04:25:49.030 --> 04:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
an obvious one um those are okay to go
 
04:25:51.790 --> 04:25:51.800 align:start position:0%
out the door because we the the ABV is
 
04:25:56.870 --> 04:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
on them the amount of uh uh ounces per
 
04:26:00.269 --> 04:26:00.279 align:start position:0%
can are on them um and the Integrity of
 
04:26:04.269 --> 04:26:04.279 align:start position:0%
the top is is sealed um it's when you
 
04:26:06.630 --> 04:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
get into a circumstance that you have a
 
04:26:09.750 --> 04:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
cup as as uh I don't know which one if
 
04:26:11.670 --> 04:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
you have it uh I'm going to say it's
 
04:26:16.510 --> 04:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
represent of was um uh there's no way to
 
04:26:20.030 --> 04:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
seal that at which time if you're if
 
04:26:23.630 --> 04:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
you're to go in the to go portion you
 
04:26:25.510 --> 04:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
can easily sip out of that like you
 
04:26:27.870 --> 04:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
would sip out of whatever iced tea or
 
04:26:30.750 --> 04:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
coffee that's in it um that would cause
 
04:26:34.550 --> 04:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
a negative a negative instance but um at
 
04:26:39.309 --> 04:26:39.319 align:start position:0%
the same time if you're delivering that
 
04:26:42.550 --> 04:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
again if it's in a container that is is
 
04:26:45.109 --> 04:26:45.119 align:start position:0%
sealed I and that means you could
 
04:26:46.870 --> 04:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
actually make it because there are
 
04:26:48.830 --> 04:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
crowlers out there and I call them
 
04:26:51.269 --> 04:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
crowlers not Growlers there are crawlers
 
04:26:55.550 --> 04:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
out there canned larger volume um uh
 
04:26:59.070 --> 04:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
containers that you could put a beverage
 
04:27:02.109 --> 04:27:02.119 align:start position:0%
in two and seal it up but it's it's
 
04:27:04.389 --> 04:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
literally about how you seal that
 
04:27:07.510 --> 04:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
container and and sealing that container
 
04:27:10.349 --> 04:27:10.359 align:start position:0%
would be near to Impossible especially
 
04:27:14.790 --> 04:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
talking to uh our neighbors uh ma uh
 
04:27:16.950 --> 04:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
Vermont did it Vermont's trying to
 
04:27:19.910 --> 04:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
repeal it right now and Maine did it
 
04:27:22.710 --> 04:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
also and both of them had very negative
 
04:27:24.790 --> 04:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
outcomes did you
 
04:27:28.309 --> 04:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
want um the statute I don't mean to I
 
04:27:28.319 --> 04:27:29.670 align:start position:0%
want um the statute I don't mean to I
can

04:27:29.670 --> 04:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:27:32.630 --> 04:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
see um this would allow liquor to go as
 
04:27:34.309 --> 04:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
takeout too the second part of the
 
04:27:36.990 --> 04:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
statute allows uh this to be if this is
 
04:27:39.910 --> 04:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
delivery and curbside pickup oh okay um
 
04:27:41.349 --> 04:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
so this would allow liquor at curbside
 
04:27:46.750 --> 04:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:46.760 --> 04:27:48.389 align:start position:0%
 
if

04:27:48.389 --> 04:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:27:51.309 --> 04:27:51.319 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the way we wrote the
 
04:27:54.309 --> 04:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
statute before which was trans it was
 
04:27:55.870 --> 04:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
the Beverages and
 
04:28:00.109 --> 04:28:00.119 align:start position:0%
wine and I don't see us exactly writing
 
04:28:03.269 --> 04:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
in the ready to go packaging there's
 
04:28:04.870 --> 04:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
part of the there's a significant amount
 
04:28:08.309 --> 04:28:08.319 align:start position:0%
of the law that's missing rules exactly
 
04:28:11.710 --> 04:28:11.720 align:start position:0%
so if we were just to drop this word
 
04:28:15.109 --> 04:28:15.119 align:start position:0%
leave this word liquor in there
 
04:28:19.790 --> 04:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
then um it could still be still the
 
04:28:22.349 --> 04:28:22.359 align:start position:0%
ready to go right because Jose Cuervo
 
04:28:26.429 --> 04:28:26.439 align:start position:0%
makes a margarita in a in a
 
04:28:29.349 --> 04:28:29.359 align:start position:0%
container there are there are some you
 
04:28:32.790 --> 04:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
know alcohol you know liquor drinks you
 
04:28:34.429 --> 04:28:34.439 align:start position:0%
know like you say that you know like the
 
04:28:37.950 --> 04:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
the uh the the Jim Beam and Coke in the
 
04:28:40.750 --> 04:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
six to eight percentage AB in the
 
04:28:42.950 --> 04:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
beverage level but I'm saying saying I
 
04:28:46.149 --> 04:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
in if I go into the state liquor
 
04:28:48.910 --> 04:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
store and anheiser bush has got what's
 
04:28:50.990 --> 04:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
the company
 
04:28:54.750 --> 04:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
cutwater cutwater has uh margar they
 
04:28:57.590 --> 04:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
have a margarita that's
 
04:28:59.830 --> 04:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
12% so
 
04:29:02.550 --> 04:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
theoretically those products if we just
 
04:29:05.030 --> 04:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
add this liquor in here I would assume
 
04:29:07.830 --> 04:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
that all we're doing is allowing those
 
04:29:12.429 --> 04:29:12.439 align:start position:0%
products to then be sold at a off-
 
04:29:13.950 --> 04:29:13.960 align:start position:0%
premise license
 
04:29:17.830 --> 04:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
E I think the ex me on premise license e
 
04:29:19.189 --> 04:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
right and would you would be okay with
 
04:29:20.830 --> 04:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
that right Mike when you want to to sell
 
04:29:23.309 --> 04:29:23.319 align:start position:0%
a cut waterer cut waterer already made
 
04:29:25.389 --> 04:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
drink or do you really is it really
 
04:29:36.750 --> 04:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:39.030 --> 04:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
drink you want to have some nice you
 
04:29:42.149 --> 04:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
know you you don't want cheap Jose quvo
 
04:29:49.590 --> 04:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:52.070 --> 04:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
a right so that that that would that
 
04:29:54.309 --> 04:29:54.319 align:start position:0%
would be where our conf where this this
 
04:30:02.670 --> 04:30:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:05.030 --> 04:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah but again we don't have any
 
04:30:07.309 --> 04:30:07.319 align:start position:0%
control over how how how generous the
 
04:30:09.469 --> 04:30:09.479 align:start position:0%
bartender was when he made
 
04:30:13.109 --> 04:30:13.119 align:start position:0%
it that's giv and and and as far as I'm
 
04:30:15.389 --> 04:30:15.399 align:start position:0%
concerned frankly if if we are leaving
 
04:30:17.630 --> 04:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
to that I I'm not sure I want to exempt
 
04:30:20.149 --> 04:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
them from the rooms and meals cuz you're
 
04:30:24.590 --> 04:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:33.030 --> 04:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:35.510 --> 04:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
yeah okay we got some work on this one
 
04:30:39.109 --> 04:30:39.119 align:start position:0%
okay represent of Sullivan and then Gibs
 
04:30:42.710 --> 04:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
um excuse me so you said that you
 
04:30:44.109 --> 04:30:44.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you haven't been hearing a lot
 
04:30:45.950 --> 04:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
from people or your members whatever not
 
04:30:47.469 --> 04:30:47.479 align:start position:0%
members I guess but you haven't been
 
04:30:50.710 --> 04:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
getting a lot of requests for 2 a.m. but
 
04:30:52.030 --> 04:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
would those requests come to you because
 
04:30:54.429 --> 04:30:54.439 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that it would go to
 
04:30:57.229 --> 04:30:57.239 align:start position:0%
the town body first and maybe they just
 
04:31:00.269 --> 04:31:00.279 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten to you and also how well
 
04:31:02.309 --> 04:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
educated are people and this is like a
 
04:31:04.309 --> 04:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
genuine question because my experience
 
04:31:06.070 --> 04:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
has been that many people don't know
 
04:31:08.109 --> 04:31:08.119 align:start position:0%
that 2 a.m. is even legal in New
 
04:31:10.070 --> 04:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire under the conditions that we
 
04:31:12.510 --> 04:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
currently have just from casual talking
 
04:31:15.149 --> 04:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
with people around the state who run
 
04:31:17.149 --> 04:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
these sorts of establishments and so I'm
 
04:31:19.750 --> 04:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
just curious a if you guys have any idea
 
04:31:21.269 --> 04:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
of how well people are informed of the
 
04:31:23.790 --> 04:31:23.800 align:start position:0%
current law and B why would you guys be
 
04:31:26.070 --> 04:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
the ones hearing about it if it needs to
 
04:31:29.750 --> 04:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
start at the local level first so um so
 
04:31:32.030 --> 04:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
yes they can change for a flat out
 
04:31:34.590 --> 04:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
extension of the service hours it needs
 
04:31:36.349 --> 04:31:36.359 align:start position:0%
to be done to the local level we do
 
04:31:40.790 --> 04:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
allow um extensions of service hours um
 
04:31:42.750 --> 04:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
special requests to come
 
04:31:45.790 --> 04:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
um so we have lenses who request it for
 
04:31:47.790 --> 04:31:47.800 align:start position:0%
example like um New Year's Eve they'll
 
04:31:49.590 --> 04:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
submit requests to extend their hours
 
04:31:50.790 --> 04:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
later if they're hosting a New Year's
 
04:31:53.670 --> 04:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
Eve party things like that um we don't
 
04:31:55.910 --> 04:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
get a significant amount I would say we
 
04:31:58.590 --> 04:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
get less than 20 a year um for
 
04:32:00.510 --> 04:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
individual lenses to extend their hours
 
04:32:03.070 --> 04:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
for particular events in terms of the
 
04:32:06.309 --> 04:32:06.319 align:start position:0%
knowledge that people have of these laws
 
04:32:09.469 --> 04:32:09.479 align:start position:0%
um we we um discussed the hours of sale
 
04:32:11.910 --> 04:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
in our training um in terms of the full
 
04:32:13.149 --> 04:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
we have the full statute and all the
 
04:32:16.349 --> 04:32:16.359 align:start position:0%
training as to um what the hours of sale
 
04:32:18.870 --> 04:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
are and the we again we we show the full
 
04:32:21.189 --> 04:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
statute so they do see it um it's not
 
04:32:22.790 --> 04:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
something we message out regularly so I
 
04:32:25.590 --> 04:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
can't speak to you know collectively as
 
04:32:27.990 --> 04:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
a whole what the industry knows of it
 
04:32:29.750 --> 04:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
but they they are exposed to it in their
 
04:32:31.389 --> 04:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
initial training and
 
04:32:35.189 --> 04:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
followup um okay so you're saying that
 
04:32:37.070 --> 04:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
that you guys it doesn't have to go
 
04:32:38.990 --> 04:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
through a town in order to get like a
 
04:32:40.750 --> 04:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
special like so if I want to have a s if
 
04:32:41.950 --> 04:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
I was a bar owner I want to have a St
 
04:32:43.309 --> 04:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
Patrick's Day party and have it be open
 
04:32:46.030 --> 04:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
till 2 I could actually have you guys
 
04:32:49.189 --> 04:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
approve that for one day yep gotcha y we
 
04:32:52.550 --> 04:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
do we always seek local buyin for that
 
04:32:54.229 --> 04:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
meaning we'll reach out to the local
 
04:32:55.910 --> 04:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
municipality just in case you know we
 
04:32:56.990 --> 04:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
don't know we don't always know what
 
04:32:57.910 --> 04:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
problems they're having with the
 
04:33:00.070 --> 04:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
licensed establishments right away so we
 
04:33:01.710 --> 04:33:01.720 align:start position:0%
do seek local buying from it as long as
 
04:33:03.269 --> 04:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
the local municipality doesn't approve
 
04:33:05.109 --> 04:33:05.119 align:start position:0%
to that extension of service then we'll
 
04:33:08.070 --> 04:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
approve thata
 
04:33:12.070 --> 04:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
thanks pretty good huh
 
04:33:14.429 --> 04:33:14.439 align:start position:0%
friendly service there at the Liquor
 
04:33:17.109 --> 04:33:17.119 align:start position:0%
Commission okay represent
 
04:33:20.029 --> 04:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair um and thank
 
04:33:23.750 --> 04:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
you for coming to testify today um Chief
 
04:33:26.869 --> 04:33:26.879 align:start position:0%
uh over over jiman am I pronouncing that
 
04:33:29.670 --> 04:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
correctly yes okay great um you
 
04:33:31.551 --> 04:33:31.561 align:start position:0%
mentioned that it's impossible to seal
 
04:33:34.949 --> 04:33:34.959 align:start position:0%
the top of a cup um but isn't it isn't
 
04:33:37.349 --> 04:33:37.359 align:start position:0%
it in fact possible to seal a cup and
 
04:33:39.830 --> 04:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
the Reon reason that I mentioned this is
 
04:33:41.750 --> 04:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
that yesterday I went to a counter resta
 
04:33:44.789 --> 04:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
Resturant and ordered a boba tea uh
 
04:33:46.910 --> 04:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
which was made there and then given to
 
04:33:50.750 --> 04:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
me and the top of that cup was sealed so
 
04:33:54.310 --> 04:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
tightly that the um person from behind
 
04:33:56.869 --> 04:33:56.879 align:start position:0%
the counter had to come over and help me
 
04:33:59.949 --> 04:33:59.959 align:start position:0%
struggle to get my my um straw into the
 
04:34:03.390 --> 04:34:03.400 align:start position:0%
cup um so I have personally encountered
 
04:34:05.910 --> 04:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
cups that were
 
04:34:09.029 --> 04:34:09.039 align:start position:0%
sealed I'm not familiar I am familiar
 
04:34:12.551 --> 04:34:12.561 align:start position:0%
with Boba um
 
04:34:15.510 --> 04:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh but I'm not familiar with the cup uh
 
04:34:18.230 --> 04:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
so I I take it on on your
 
04:34:22.070 --> 04:34:22.080 align:start position:0%

04:34:24.949 --> 04:34:24.959 align:start position:0%
