session House bill 1692 and I will move
 
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:25.530 align:start position:0%
amendment 2 0 2 0 1 2 4 6 H and a second
 
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:29.850 align:start position:0%

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:52.630 align:start position:0%
got 3 but 6 is the number ok I think
 
00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:54.190 align:start position:0%
there was a previous amendment that was
 
00:08:59.360 --> 00:08:59.370 align:start position:0%
1 2 4 3 this is a new amendment correct
 
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:04.210 align:start position:0%
and this is similar to the amendment we
 
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:07.060 align:start position:0%
had in the work session the only change
 
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:08.980 align:start position:0%
that was made in this amendment versus
 
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:10.660 align:start position:0%
the amendment we discussed in the work
 
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:13.660 align:start position:0%
session was the effective date taking
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
effect July 1st 2021
 
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
knowing that listening to Health and
 
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:20.170 align:start position:0%
Human Services that they would be able
 
00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:21.750 align:start position:0%
to roll it over into that next budget
 
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:24.490 align:start position:0%
and unsure about whether or not it would
 
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:28.630 align:start position:0%
be feasible to do this year with what's
 
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:33.070 align:start position:0%
going on and I will recognize represents
 
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:36.510 align:start position:0%
MIT if he wants to speak to a second
 
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:41.170 align:start position:0%
well that the change is incidental but
 
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:45.940 align:start position:0%
important and so the the underlying
 
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
amendment which we've already discussed
 
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:52.810 align:start position:0%
quite thoroughly is you know a move as
 
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:55.720 align:start position:0%
step forward in my opinion we need to
 
00:09:59.220 --> 00:09:59.230 align:start position:0%
get this done it's clear that HHS wants
 
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:04.180 align:start position:0%
this the the practitioners want it and
 
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:06.130 align:start position:0%
it's in the best interest of the people
 
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:14.290 align:start position:0%
discussion on the amendment there was a
 
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
Pimentel I see you in a city I see you

well it's not actually about the
 
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:21.100 align:start position:0%
amendment it's about the whole bill but
 
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:25.570 align:start position:0%

represent fellows yes thank you
 
00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:20.350 align:start position:0%
um this bill will allow wild mushrooms
 
00:14:22.769 --> 00:14:22.779 align:start position:0%
to be sold legally in New Hampshire so
 
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:25.240 align:start position:0%
that creates a new source of business
 
00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:29.079 align:start position:0%
revenue somebody will be able to sell
 
00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:32.380 align:start position:0%
mushrooms to restaurants and to grocery
 
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
stores in a farmer's markets to be able
 
00:14:39.059 --> 00:14:39.069 align:start position:0%
to have a license to do this will
 
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
require taking a course and passing a
 
00:14:44.819 --> 00:14:44.829 align:start position:0%
test so that the mushrooms that are sold
 
00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:49.300 align:start position:0%
will be safe for the public and we heard
 
00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
from Health and Human Services that they
 
00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:53.540 align:start position:0%
were supportive
 
00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:56.420 align:start position:0%
this bill into that with the amendment
 
00:14:58.810 --> 00:14:58.820 align:start position:0%
giving them some extra time they could
 
00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:03.590 align:start position:0%
implement this licensing and sort the
 
00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:08.290 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:10.190 align:start position:0%
represents MIT would you like to speak
 
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
to you a second here muted one second
 
00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
presentative now you can speak Thank You
 
00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:19.490 align:start position:0%
representative fellows has already
 
00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:22.310 align:start position:0%
touched on all the important points but
 
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
I'd like to just emphasize the safety
 
00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:29.150 align:start position:0%
aspect mushrooms are a wonderful thing
 
00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
unless they're not so to speak because
 
00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:35.810 align:start position:0%
there are poisonous and unhealthy wild
 
00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:37.690 align:start position:0%
mushrooms out there which should not be
 
00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:42.470 align:start position:0%
you know mixed into the restaurants fair
 
00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:44.840 align:start position:0%
bill affair or anywhere else for that
 
00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:48.500 align:start position:0%
matter because they can lead to gastric
 
00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:51.710 align:start position:0%
distress and even death so this is an
 
00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
important step in terms of allowing our
 
00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:00.110 align:start position:0%
existing industry in this field to to
 
00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:03.890 align:start position:0%
begin to work under safe conditions and
 
00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:07.430 align:start position:0%
into the benefit of our public both in
 
00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:09.080 align:start position:0%
terms of enjoying something that is
 
00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:17.180 align:start position:0%
helpful and tasty and safe if the if
 
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:20.690 align:start position:0%
this amended bill goes forward further
 
00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:26.870 align:start position:0%
discussion represent bulletins Thank You
 
00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:27.620 align:start position:0%
mr. chairman
 
00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:29.780 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote in opposition to this
 
00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:32.150 align:start position:0%
bill for a number of reasons firstly as
 
00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:35.180 align:start position:0%
Representative McGuire pointed out the
 
00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
bill exceeds the requirements that the
 
00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:39.590 align:start position:0%
federal Food and Drug Administration is
 
00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:43.490 align:start position:0%
set forth well that's my first position
 
00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:46.100 align:start position:0%
of opposition secondly I think the
 
00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:48.740 align:start position:0%
penalties for violating the statute
 
00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:51.470 align:start position:0%
should the bill become law are excessive
 
00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:54.830 align:start position:0%
at $1,000 per incident but most
 
00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:57.770 align:start position:0%
importantly I think as someone else
 
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:00.440 align:start position:0%
pointed out previously this is a really
 
00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:02.500 align:start position:0%
a solution and searchable problem
 
00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:05.329 align:start position:0%
exciting the National Institutes of
 
00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:07.400 align:start position:0%
Health National Library
 
00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:11.330 align:start position:0%
of Medicine bill study in 2018 and to
 
00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:13.150 align:start position:0%
put it in a nutshell
 
00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:15.620 align:start position:0%
there's no there's seventy four hundred
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
and twenty eight cases of mushroom
 
00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
poisoning a year eighty-three percent
 
00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:23.390 align:start position:0%
over 83% of those poisoning cases cause
 
00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:27.980 align:start position:0%
no or only minor high boils down to
 
00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:31.550 align:start position:0%
about thirty nine exposures a year that
 
00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:34.340 align:start position:0%
caused major harm in only two point nine
 
00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:38.390 align:start position:0%
deaths per year from ingesting mushrooms
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
most of which were unintentional ingest
 
00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:44.690 align:start position:0%
patients by elderly so this is an
 
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:47.810 align:start position:0%
unnecessary law so I'll be enough thank
 
00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:54.110 align:start position:0%
you presenter McGuire has her hand up
 
00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
represent quiet yes thank you I'm also
 
00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:02.660 align:start position:0%
going to be voting against this it's as
 
00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
represent bowed and said it's
 
00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:04.900 align:start position:0%
represent bowed and said it's
unnecessary

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:04.910 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:08.090 align:start position:0%
I've bought wild mushrooms at farmers
 
00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:12.830 align:start position:0%
markets in the past and the most common
 
00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:15.410 align:start position:0%
and most and tastiest wild mushrooms
 
00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:17.930 align:start position:0%
that you can get around here are really
 
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
hard to to miss to misidentify yes there
 
00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:26.150 align:start position:0%
are poisonous ones but they don't look
 
00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:28.910 align:start position:0%
like the tasty ones and it doesn't take
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of training to find them out what
 
00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:34.940 align:start position:0%
this does is not make it it makes it it
 
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:37.010 align:start position:0%
doesn't make it legal to pick and sell
 
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:39.410 align:start position:0%
mushrooms it makes illegal to do so
 
00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
without a license and I find that
 
00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:47.150 align:start position:0%
excessive and heavy-handed and I also
 
00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:50.060 align:start position:0%
believe that we're letting the federal
 
00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:53.630 align:start position:0%
government by it's excessive regulations
 
00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:57.250 align:start position:0%
cause us to add more to our already
 
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:01.990 align:start position:0%
heavy burden of regulations and so we're
 
00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:04.730 align:start position:0%
making the problem worse by passing this
 
00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:07.070 align:start position:0%
bill and I'm definitely going to be
 
00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:12.490 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:15.470 align:start position:0%
Thank You mr. chairman I just got an
 
00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:18.410 align:start position:0%
email from somebody who was it
 
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:21.410 align:start position:0%
and and I didn't read this because they
 
00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:24.530 align:start position:0%
just got it so individual wants to know
 
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
if the landowners Commission is still in
 
00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:31.790 align:start position:0%
the bill and if the Mike Road all just
 
00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:34.460 align:start position:0%
is off that was the questions that they
 
00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:36.020 align:start position:0%
asked and I didn't know that because I
 
00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:37.580 align:start position:0%
came right there and didn't have time to
 
00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:44.900 align:start position:0%
look it up yes to answer the part about
 
00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
the landowners I would I would assume
 
00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:49.070 align:start position:0%
that they're still in support of this I
 
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
forgot to mention it but the bill
 
00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:55.100 align:start position:0%
contains a provision that somebody
 
00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:00.410 align:start position:0%
cannot harvest mushrooms on somebody
 
00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:03.890 align:start position:0%
else's land without their permission so
 
00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:08.690 align:start position:0%
they're still in favor of that and I
 
00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:11.660 align:start position:0%
have a follow up mr. chairman represent
 
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:14.210 align:start position:0%
fantasy is is that a commission or is it
 
00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
just landowners Association the way that
 
00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:20.180 align:start position:0%
was asked to me was there's a landowners
 
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
Commission that sits on this the that
 
00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:36.230 align:start position:0%
provision was added by the environment
 
00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:40.490 align:start position:0%
and Agriculture Committee and it had the
 
00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
support of the timber owners association
 
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
and the Society for the Protection of
 
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:54.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire forests and I think some
 
00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:58.330 align:start position:0%
other organizations supported it also
 
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:01.460 align:start position:0%
have another follow up then
 
00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
No so does that mean that they are they
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
the landowners Commission is a part of
 
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:08.450 align:start position:0%
this bill there is a there is a
 
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:10.490 align:start position:0%
landowners Commission that's associated
 
00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:13.160 align:start position:0%
with this particular bill or they just
 
00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:17.300 align:start position:0%
agree with it I don't a legislative
 
00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
Commission is that what you're referring
 
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
to that's what I took it as I don't know
 
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:25.610 align:start position:0%
I didn't I don't know what that is I've
 
00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:28.070 align:start position:0%
never heard of that maybe that maybe
 
00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:29.900 align:start position:0%
they just didn't know what it was they
 
00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:30.980 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure that the
 
00:21:31.869 --> 00:21:31.879 align:start position:0%
landowners come
 
00:21:35.529 --> 00:21:35.539 align:start position:0%
is still there I know the landowners and
 
00:21:37.869 --> 00:21:37.879 align:start position:0%
the timber owners associations were
 
00:21:40.449 --> 00:21:40.459 align:start position:0%
testified in support of that one
 
00:21:42.489 --> 00:21:42.499 align:start position:0%
amendment that was one of the biggest
 
00:21:45.129 --> 00:21:45.139 align:start position:0%
issues that that committee dealt with it
 
00:21:47.049 --> 00:21:47.059 align:start position:0%
the agriculture the environment
 
00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
agriculture committee okay thank you
 
00:21:59.199 --> 00:21:59.209 align:start position:0%
Schmidt that on the issue the
 
00:22:01.629 --> 00:22:01.639 align:start position:0%
representative Bowden raised with regard
 
00:22:05.559 --> 00:22:05.569 align:start position:0%
to the fine is it $1000 per instance or
 
00:22:09.969 --> 00:22:09.979 align:start position:0%
is it up to $1,000 per instance the bill
 
00:22:13.329 --> 00:22:13.339 align:start position:0%
states up to okay in other words it
 
00:22:17.199 --> 00:22:17.209 align:start position:0%
could be $50 or $100 and not $1,000
 
00:22:20.139 --> 00:22:20.149 align:start position:0%
correct which is I understand if I
 
00:22:21.219 --> 00:22:21.229 align:start position:0%
understand English
 
00:22:24.039 --> 00:22:24.049 align:start position:0%
I believe that pretty much boilerplate
 
00:22:25.509 --> 00:22:25.519 align:start position:0%
in a lot of the statues we have the up
 
00:22:28.899 --> 00:22:28.909 align:start position:0%
to leaving it up to the rules in the
 
00:22:34.469 --> 00:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:39.369 --> 00:22:39.379 align:start position:0%
we're merging Thank You mr. chair
 
00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:41.690 align:start position:0%
- mr. Hanna City representative
 
00:22:44.339 --> 00:22:44.349 align:start position:0%
Tennessee's comment about the landowner
 
00:22:50.019 --> 00:22:50.029 align:start position:0%
goat I think on page 2 line 17 number 9
 
00:22:51.639 --> 00:22:51.649 align:start position:0%
speaks - it's not so much the
 
00:22:54.249 --> 00:22:54.259 align:start position:0%
Association but they cannot go on to the
 
00:22:55.509 --> 00:22:55.519 align:start position:0%
land without the permission of the
 
00:23:05.559 --> 00:23:05.569 align:start position:0%
landowner thank you representing yes
 
00:23:11.259 --> 00:23:11.269 align:start position:0%
thank you mr. chair I as somebody who
 
00:23:15.699 --> 00:23:15.709 align:start position:0%
come from an island like I know the
 
00:23:19.419 --> 00:23:19.429 align:start position:0%
world mushroom is poisonous I would like
 
00:23:22.389 --> 00:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
to know if there is a special way
 
00:23:25.899 --> 00:23:25.909 align:start position:0%
they're going to prepare that to remove
 
00:23:30.309 --> 00:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
the part of it who who has the the
 
00:23:37.439 --> 00:23:37.449 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:42.609 --> 00:23:42.619 align:start position:0%
represents ellos representative duty the
 
00:23:45.049 --> 00:23:45.059 align:start position:0%
mushrooms that are in the United State
 
00:23:47.259 --> 00:23:47.269 align:start position:0%
there are hundreds of different
 
00:23:50.539 --> 00:23:50.549 align:start position:0%
varieties of mushrooms and some of them
 
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
are perfectly safe
 
00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
and a very few of them are perfectly
 
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:00.570 align:start position:0%
safe and tastes good and those world
 
00:24:03.169 --> 00:24:03.179 align:start position:0%
will be the ones that the people will be
 
00:24:06.409 --> 00:24:06.419 align:start position:0%
selling and they have to take a course
 
00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:09.570 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they can identify the
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
few mushrooms that are on the permitted
 
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:14.490 align:start position:0%
list and so that's how we'll keep people
 
00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:23.090 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:26.940 align:start position:0%
yes I'm supporting this bill initially I
 
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:29.730 align:start position:0%
didn't think I would because I was
 
00:24:33.019 --> 00:24:33.029 align:start position:0%
considering it unnecessary regulation
 
00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
but I am supporting it because the what
 
00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:37.740 align:start position:0%
I understand now is it's more enabling
 
00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:40.230 align:start position:0%
legislation than it is regulating and
 
00:24:44.899 --> 00:24:44.909 align:start position:0%
that we have an issue with a number of
 
00:24:47.239 --> 00:24:47.249 align:start position:0%
the health inspector code enforcement
 
00:24:52.399 --> 00:24:52.409 align:start position:0%
type people disallowing restaurants from
 
00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:56.039 align:start position:0%
using ingredients that are not on and
 
00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:58.350 align:start position:0%
approved list someplace and I know we
 
00:25:00.399 --> 00:25:00.409 align:start position:0%
ran into that in Rochester with another
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
with another product and I think that
 
00:25:06.249 --> 00:25:06.259 align:start position:0%
this falls into the same category that
 
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:07.980 align:start position:0%
technically right now they're not
 
00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:11.190 align:start position:0%
allowed to be using these mushrooms
 
00:25:14.629 --> 00:25:14.639 align:start position:0%
because there's no there's no avenue to
 
00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:16.730 align:start position:0%
allow it and I think that this
 
00:25:20.659 --> 00:25:20.669 align:start position:0%
legislation opens that up and and and
 
00:25:23.659 --> 00:25:23.669 align:start position:0%
creates an Avenue so that we can use the
 
00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:26.220 align:start position:0%
wild mushrooms that are harvested so I
 
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
will support it represent Phillips yes
 
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
I'm just as a follow-up to that I was on
 
00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
the mushroom Commission and one of the
 
00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:43.470 align:start position:0%
stories that we heard from Colleen Smith
 
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
at the HHS Department of Food Services
 
00:25:52.389 --> 00:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
is that when their inspectors go to
 
00:25:56.269 --> 00:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
restaurants if they find that there are
 
00:25:59.150 --> 00:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
wild mushrooms they're in the kit
 
00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:01.830 align:start position:0%
they tell the restaurant that they have
 
00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
to throw them away because the federal
 
00:26:09.919 --> 00:26:09.929 align:start position:0%
guidelines say that they cannot sell
 
00:26:12.919 --> 00:26:12.929 align:start position:0%
wild mushrooms and let they have been
 
00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
approved by a regulating authority so a
 
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
regulating authority can be the state in
 
00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:22.980 align:start position:0%
other states it might be at the county
 
00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:25.370 align:start position:0%
level I think there's some confusion
 
00:26:29.299 --> 00:26:29.309 align:start position:0%
because in the commission's report this
 
00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:31.740 align:start position:0%
citation that's in there is not the one
 
00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
that actually matches what I would I
 
00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:37.530 align:start position:0%
just said it was somewhere else in the
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
in the federal regulations mr. chairman
 
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
just so you're aware representative
 
00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:50.610 align:start position:0%
Turner is in the attendees and he has
 
00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
his hand up he was the prime sponsor of
 
00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:55.350 align:start position:0%
the bill I don't know if you want to
 
00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:56.910 align:start position:0%
recognize him during the executive
 
00:26:59.450 --> 00:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
session they're not but that's just you
 
00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:03.870 align:start position:0%
know okay I'm gonna take questions from
 
00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:05.610 align:start position:0%
the committee first and then we'll go
 
00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:14.030 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:20.750 align:start position:0%
we're working on mute in addition okay
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm learning I just wanted to
 
00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
point out that the bill does require
 
00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:33.690 align:start position:0%
that if you are enabled by this bill to
 
00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:37.110 align:start position:0%
pick wild mushrooms you have to label
 
00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:40.470 align:start position:0%
them as to the source which if there is
 
00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:43.950 align:start position:0%
a problem when a restaurant or say a
 
00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:46.950 align:start position:0%
farmers market sells them this will make
 
00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:49.590 align:start position:0%
it more easily traceable how to go back
 
00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:57.170 align:start position:0%
to the source thank you any other
 
00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:03.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:10.180 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
you should be able to talk about
 
00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:14.710 align:start position:0%
represented I am mooted now okay thank
 
00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:16.750 align:start position:0%
you thank you very thought to answer the
 
00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:20.170 align:start position:0%
earlier question the landowners are not
 
00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:22.450 align:start position:0%
part of the bill there's not any kind of
 
00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
a commission or anything it's just
 
00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:26.590 align:start position:0%
precisely what representative fellows
 
00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:29.620 align:start position:0%
said they testified in favor of the bill
 
00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:31.270 align:start position:0%
and actually credit goes to
 
00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:33.370 align:start position:0%
representative fellows for getting that
 
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:36.340 align:start position:0%
amendment in they got the support of the
 
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:39.010 align:start position:0%
landowners I mean the timber owners and
 
00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
then amp sure society frigate
 
00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:43.780 align:start position:0%
preservation of Horace likewise there is
 
00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:46.270 align:start position:0%
no mycologist who is on any commission
 
00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:48.340 align:start position:0%
what the reason that got in there is
 
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:51.490 align:start position:0%
when it initially was the responsibility
 
00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:54.370 align:start position:0%
of da MF they thought he needed a my
 
00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:57.340 align:start position:0%
question to be Minister the that really
 
00:28:59.640 --> 00:28:59.650 align:start position:0%
necessary since mycologists have helped
 
00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
develop already the list and the program
 
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:04.120 align:start position:0%
they might want to consult with a
 
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:06.310 align:start position:0%
mycologist but they're not part of the
 
00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:08.470 align:start position:0%
bill whatsoever so the person who was
 
00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:10.330 align:start position:0%
saying that really wasn't familiar with
 
00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:12.700 align:start position:0%
the bill at all I think all the other
 
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:14.650 align:start position:0%
questions have been pretty well answered
 
00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:17.500 align:start position:0%
again an issue that when inspections are
 
00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
made any food being used in a restaurant
 
00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:22.930 align:start position:0%
or sold in a grocery store has to be
 
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:25.210 align:start position:0%
properly sourced and it's simply that if
 
00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:27.190 align:start position:0%
there is not an approval of the mushroom
 
00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:29.110 align:start position:0%
then it is not properly sourced and as
 
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:30.790 align:start position:0%
portunity fellow said it would have
 
00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:33.580 align:start position:0%
carted and kanai's so that's what it
 
00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:38.050 align:start position:0%
amounts to thank you thank you for the
 
00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:42.220 align:start position:0%
discussion represent Pina City have we
 
00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:44.590 align:start position:0%
have we ever asked the question what the
 
00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:47.710 align:start position:0%
revenue amount would be through on this
 
00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:50.260 align:start position:0%
how much money would restaurants make on
 
00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
on wild mushrooms or what's the what's
 
00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:00.430 align:start position:0%
the revenue represented fellows I can
 
00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:03.730 align:start position:0%
tell you that and you may remember this
 
00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:08.110 align:start position:0%
from last year from 2019 when we had the
 
00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
bill to create the Commission to study
 
00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:15.910 align:start position:0%
licensing mushrooms harvesters that we
 
00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:18.070 align:start position:0%
heard from one person who told us that
 
00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:19.270 align:start position:0%
he made 40
 
00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:21.940 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in one year selling
 
00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:24.310 align:start position:0%
mushrooms to rest
 
00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:27.130 align:start position:0%
I would think primarily to restaurants
 
00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
so that was probably a good year
 
00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:31.420 align:start position:0%
mushrooms are very finicky you can have
 
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:33.010 align:start position:0%
great years and then you can have
 
00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:35.470 align:start position:0%
droughts essentially so there's a lot of
 
00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:38.020 align:start position:0%
variability but there are some kinds of
 
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
wild mushrooms that cost 35 50 $60 a
 
00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:46.710 align:start position:0%
pound retail so there there could be a
 
00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:49.390 align:start position:0%
significant amount of money for some
 
00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:51.340 align:start position:0%
people I don't think too many people are
 
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
going to get into this market but it's
 
00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:01.330 align:start position:0%
not insignificant ya know
 
00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:03.300 align:start position:0%
the other thing that strikes me about
 
00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
this bill so if you're in the market to
 
00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:08.170 align:start position:0%
harvest these things they're you
 
00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:10.150 align:start position:0%
harvesting just from New Hampshire is
 
00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:11.890 align:start position:0%
this a harvest from anywhere in the
 
00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:16.330 align:start position:0%
country represent Phillips so this would
 
00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:20.250 align:start position:0%
be the license that you need to harvest
 
00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:23.050 align:start position:0%
mushrooms that are on the ground in New
 
00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:30.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and to to sell and you could
 
00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:32.170 align:start position:0%
sell them in New Hampshire or you could
 
00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:34.570 align:start position:0%
sell them somewhere else if the other
 
00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:36.790 align:start position:0%
state if the other state has a law that
 
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:42.010 align:start position:0%
allows that see I'd I'd might not have
 
00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:43.420 align:start position:0%
been listening to this and it might have
 
00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:45.030 align:start position:0%
been said already but does New Hampshire
 
00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:50.430 align:start position:0%
have mushrooms that people want I mean
 
00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:56.620 align:start position:0%
definitely ok I think we heard from a
 
00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:58.210 align:start position:0%
number of folks who are currently
 
00:31:59.970 --> 00:31:59.980 align:start position:0%
harvesting and we also heard from folks
 
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
from the restaurant industry that we're
 
00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:02.830 align:start position:0%
fully behind this because it was
 
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:04.810 align:start position:0%
something they were looking for right ok
 
00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:09.300 align:start position:0%
just refresh my memory thank you
 
00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:14.260 align:start position:0%
any other comments questions before we
 
00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:19.030 align:start position:0%
go forward and we want to welcome
 
00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:22.900 align:start position:0%
represent a Pierson and you could just
 
00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:26.920 align:start position:0%
state where you're at and if there's
 
00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
anyone with you for the roll call
 
00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:35.610 align:start position:0%
I am in a Manchester building right now
 
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:38.010 align:start position:0%
and there is currently nobody in the
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
office with me okay and represent of
 
00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
Judy could you do the same I don't think
 
00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:54.420 align:start position:0%
we got you to do that when you came I am
 
00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:56.900 align:start position:0%
alone in my office
 
00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:08.910 align:start position:0%
thank you we represented merchants Thank
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
You mr. chair a question to maybe two
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
reps and a fellow's in regards to the
 
00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:19.230 align:start position:0%
licensure if somebody is picking up
 
00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:22.140 align:start position:0%
mushrooms from another state and they
 
00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:23.430 align:start position:0%
want to sell them in the state of New
 
00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will they be required to have
 
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
a state license from New Hampshire well
 
00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:28.770 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire recognize that little
 
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
places tell you that definitively I have
 
00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
a guess but I could do that then we get
 
00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:52.290 align:start position:0%
Colleen Smith to answer that question
 
00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:54.420 align:start position:0%
Colleen Smith is here representative
 
00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
canook has his hand up and Colleen has
 
00:33:58.010 --> 00:33:58.020 align:start position:0%
her hand up now so would you like
 
00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:01.380 align:start position:0%
recognize Colin Smith okay that's that
 
00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:05.110 align:start position:0%
recognize Colin Smith okay that's that
question

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:13.530 align:start position:0%
Colleen you should be able to talk there
 
00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:17.149 align:start position:0%
you go I see her
 
00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
yeah okay he's muted right there she is
 
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I allowed her to talk for she
 
00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:25.590 align:start position:0%
I am I
 
00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:27.770 align:start position:0%
hopefully yeah you can hear me now I
 
00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:29.940 align:start position:0%
again from at the record my name is
 
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:31.530 align:start position:0%
Colleen Smith I'm the administrator of
 
00:34:34.129 --> 00:34:34.139 align:start position:0%
the food protection section within the
 
00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:36.149 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Health and
 
00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:39.300 align:start position:0%
Human Services so with regard to the
 
00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:43.230 align:start position:0%
previous question if a harvester
 
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
wild mushrooms in another state they
 
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:47.940 align:start position:0%
would need to be approved to do so by
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
that state's regulatory authority in
 
00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:54.149 align:start position:0%
order to be as recognized as an approved
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
source for sale in a New Hampshire food
 
00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:07.290 align:start position:0%
establishment thank you represent
 
00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:14.970 align:start position:0%
McGuire all right Thank You mr. chair I
 
00:35:17.329 --> 00:35:17.339 align:start position:0%
was just going to say that as I read the
 
00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:20.820 align:start position:0%
bill it says first of all that we will
 
00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
respect other states licenses for
 
00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:27.270 align:start position:0%
Pickers but it also seems to me that if
 
00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:29.700 align:start position:0%
someone were to have the permission of
 
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
the landowner they could easily pick in
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
Maine say and and then sell them in New
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if they were licensed in New
 
00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:41.070 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I mean they need the
 
00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:44.790 align:start position:0%
permission of the landowner but that
 
00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:47.220 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that the pick you need to
 
00:35:57.609 --> 00:35:57.619 align:start position:0%
pick them only in the answer any other
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:16.950 align:start position:0%
thank you I think that pointer
 
00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:19.410 align:start position:0%
represented McGuire has just raised is
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
one that that actually adds to the
 
00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
significance of the regulatory scheme
 
00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:28.530 align:start position:0%
that we are creating here and that is
 
00:36:30.859 --> 00:36:30.869 align:start position:0%
that if you have somebody who was a
 
00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:34.140 align:start position:0%
trained harvester slash picker of
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
mushrooms and they are in another state
 
00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
and then and they know what they're
 
00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
they know what's good they know what's
 
00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:44.700 align:start position:0%
bad if they are harvesting mushrooms and
 
00:36:48.349 --> 00:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
they are a person of training and
 
00:36:53.809 --> 00:36:53.819 align:start position:0%
expertise then this is an asset to a
 
00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:57.210 align:start position:0%
restaurants menu to have something which
 
00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:01.290 align:start position:0%
is delicious and nutritious so I think
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
that that is not an impediment to our
 
00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:16.290 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:21.590 align:start position:0%
represents an attack hi I think I think
 
00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:24.950 align:start position:0%
much has been said I think I would um I
 
00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:28.950 align:start position:0%
would vote for this bill except for the
 
00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
fact that during the work session I
 
00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:34.050 align:start position:0%
raised I noticed what I could consider
 
00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:36.360 align:start position:0%
technical difficulties and if
 
00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
presentative McGuire is correct that
 
00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:42.470 align:start position:0%
this goes beyond federal requirements I
 
00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:45.630 align:start position:0%
that seems to me and to be an overreach
 
00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
I don't know that but at this point I
 
00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
don't have the desire especially to
 
00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:53.310 align:start position:0%
introduce an amendment that probably
 
00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:57.660 align:start position:0%
wouldn't go anywhere anyway so I I see
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
that we're being more or less compelled
 
00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:02.070 align:start position:0%
we are being compelled by the federal
 
00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:03.780 align:start position:0%
government whether I like that or not
 
00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:06.330 align:start position:0%
some material we have to do it but I
 
00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:08.940 align:start position:0%
would like to see a clean I'd like to
 
00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:12.300 align:start position:0%
see these issues resolved I'm not going
 
00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:14.700 align:start position:0%
to be the one to suggest it to or to did
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
to do it the hour is late let's vote
 
00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:31.470 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you yeah took me a
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
minute to get my cursor on a mute I just
 
00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:38.090 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out that part of the
 
00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:42.390 align:start position:0%
labeling part in the bill states that
 
00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:45.810 align:start position:0%
you have to put the county where the
 
00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:50.130 align:start position:0%
mushrooms were harvested so that would
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
again source whether it was in New
 
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or in some other state
 
00:38:58.130 --> 00:38:58.140 align:start position:0%
obviously that County name would not
 
00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:04.790 align:start position:0%
likely jive with any of ours thank you
 
00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:10.410 align:start position:0%
and representative connor briefly and
 
00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:10.700 align:start position:0%
and representative connor briefly and
then

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:10.710 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:22.740 align:start position:0%
if there's no other questions oh just
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
wanted to note that the question of
 
00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:26.730 align:start position:0%
purchasing from auto stayed on page 2 of
 
00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:30.510 align:start position:0%
the bill lines the first where it's a
 
00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:32.790 align:start position:0%
sale of mushrooms and that's what points
 
00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:35.670 align:start position:0%
out that it has to be in accordance with
 
00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:38.130 align:start position:0%
the subdivision unless purchased from an
 
00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
out-of-state source approved by that
 
00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:42.570 align:start position:0%
source or country of origin so in other
 
00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:44.970 align:start position:0%
words if you have a main Harvester who
 
00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:47.220 align:start position:0%
is approved by a program there ain't no
 
00:39:49.339 --> 00:39:49.349 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Restaurant can purchase from
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
them so that's so that allows the fact
 
00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
that other states may do it it's a it's
 
00:39:59.349 --> 00:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
an element of reciprocity thank you
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you any other comments or
 
00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:09.550 align:start position:0%
thank you any other comments or
questions

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
now all right being none I will just
 
00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
state again I think we had numerous
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
folks testify from both restaurant
 
00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:23.720 align:start position:0%
industry as well as looking for this
 
00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:27.990 align:start position:0%
this is part of the National Food Code
 
00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
that was adopted by Health and Human
 
00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:33.290 align:start position:0%
Services and it is language there that
 
00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:37.230 align:start position:0%
requires this to be done if you're going
 
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
to sell and dispense of wild mushrooms
 
00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:48.660 align:start position:0%

00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:51.780 align:start position:0%

00:40:54.109 --> 00:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
