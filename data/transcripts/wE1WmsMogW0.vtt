in front of everybody here on the

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 align:start position:0%
uh there you should have a copy of the
 
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 align:start position:0%
agenda it basically gives our presenters
 
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 align:start position:0%

questions and answers uh we'll have a
 
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
short period following each presenter
 
00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 align:start position:0%
but then we're going to have a 30 minute
 
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
period following at the end so we can
 
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
wrap things up and really steer this
 
00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 align:start position:0%
ship in a direction that we want to move
 
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
in in terms of how we're going to
 
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
address these three bills this is a this
 
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
is a huge topic uh it's a topic in which
 
00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 align:start position:0%
I've been engaged just uh the other day
 
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 align:start position:0%
when we had the teacher shortage
 
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
committee that topic mental health and
 
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
the schools popped up just like that uh
 
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
when we had the trustee meeting for the
 
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
University system New Hampshire that
 
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
topic was right on the table for the 27
 
00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
Trustees of the University system New
 
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when we had our oversight
 
00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 align:start position:0%
committee here back on June 12th which
 
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
you have a copy of the doc which we had
 
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
there mental health was one of those
 
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
issues which we addressed there so it's
 
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
a a topic which I think is apropos that
 
00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
we'd be looking at seriously here and
 
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
trying first to identify what is this
 
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
what are we talking about and how we can
 
00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:10.979 align:start position:0%
handle it and and I know that when the
 
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
bill is introduced that hearing I had a
 
00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:14.699 align:start position:0%
conversation yesterday with Senator
 
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 align:start position:0%
Waters and doe together uh dealing with
 
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
some of the the questions and I think
 
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to mention anything right
 
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
now because this will all come up
 
00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
probably in our discussions today
 
00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:29.819 align:start position:0%
I will uh let everybody know that I do
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
have a conflict here
 
00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:32.629 align:start position:0%
have a conflict here
um

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 align:start position:0%
this meeting was initially supposed to
 
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
been in the afternoon but it got in the
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
calendar at 10 o'clock I have a meeting
 
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
starting up at about 1105 or supposed to
 
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
start 11 with Senator dalessandro and
 
00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:46.139 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson dealing with Civics
 
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
education which uh we know we have
 
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 align:start position:0%
another issue there we have to do we
 
00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:52.259 align:start position:0%
appropriated one million dollars for a
 
00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:54.539 align:start position:0%
program this year and so we're
 
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
addressing that so much so I'm gonna
 
00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
have to get up and leave but I've asked
 
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative Miler uh continue with
 
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.060 align:start position:0%
the meeting when I leave Mel has been
 
00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
the chair here and ranking person he's
 
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:07.620 align:start position:0%
been a chair of this committee I know I
 
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
know which year it was you know but it's
 
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:11.780 align:start position:0%
dating back on our time here together
 
00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:14.699 align:start position:0%
and he is also the ranking rep and I
 
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
think it's very appropriate that he'd be
 
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.060 align:start position:0%
here seeing that the vice chair is not
 
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
here today
 
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
so with that I'd like to look at the doc
 
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
which we have here and for those people
 
00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:28.259 align:start position:0%
which are here
 
00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:28.870 align:start position:0%
which are here
um

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
the can we go around quickly and
 
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:35.220 align:start position:0%

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%

00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
card that says aging well that's just to
 
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
give you an idea of some of the
 
00:11:31.009 --> 00:11:31.019 align:start position:0%
programming that we do in health and
 
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
well-being and extension we have an
 
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
aging population here in New Hampshire
 
00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:37.079 align:start position:0%
we're growing very quickly with our
 
00:11:38.449 --> 00:11:38.459 align:start position:0%
aging population so we have a lot of
 
00:11:41.329 --> 00:11:41.339 align:start position:0%
programs there there you'll also see the
 
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:43.740 align:start position:0%
five healthy habits for mental health
 
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
that's from the Department of Education
 
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
I just feel like that's always a nice
 
00:11:49.009 --> 00:11:49.019 align:start position:0%
little flyer to keep handy of you know
 
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
quick tips to help take care of you and
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
then the last is a handout that's very
 
00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:56.700 align:start position:0%
um quick about you know UNH extension in
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
General on the front but then on the
 
00:11:59.930 --> 00:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
back again it's talking about mental
 
00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
health and well-being really focusing on
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
um on mental health for you so many of
 
00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:08.700 align:start position:0%
you are probably familiar with the youth
 
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
risk behavior survey data right and
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
sadly we've seen the rates increase in
 
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
that we don't want to so approximately
 
00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
25 percent of Youth have seriously
 
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
committed uh attempting suicide 36 or
 
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
more have reported that their mental
 
00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
health has not been good most of the
 
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:28.740 align:start position:0%
time or always and that's compared to a
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
national average of 29 and at least 10
 
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
percent of our New Hampshire youth have
 
00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
attempted suicide at least once
 
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
um and all of these rates have gone up a
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
lot especially during covid so this was
 
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
data that was collected in 2021 and so
 
00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
it's quite a big increase that we saw
 
00:12:45.889 --> 00:12:45.899 align:start position:0%
from the data that was collected in
 
00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:47.389 align:start position:0%
from the data that was collected in
2019.

00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
2019.
 
00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to talk about one of the
 
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
programs we offer that's on the Aging
 
00:12:53.329 --> 00:12:53.339 align:start position:0%
well but it's also for to focus on youth
 
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
mental health how many of you have taken
 
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
the youth Mental Health First Aid course
 
00:12:59.150 --> 00:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
no at least one of you anybody back here
 
00:13:00.889 --> 00:13:00.899 align:start position:0%
okay we've got a couple people great
 
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so um Mental Health First Aid we've
 
00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
um we have an extension have been
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
delivering this course since 2016. in
 
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
2021 we kind of became a hub for the
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
state through funding from the
 
00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:15.660 align:start position:0%
Department of Education we've been
 
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
working closely with the Bureau for
 
00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:20.220 align:start position:0%
Student Wellness on that they were sort
 
00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
of the Hub that kind of came to us and
 
00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
so as a hub what that means is that when
 
00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
an organization wants to take this
 
00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
course they can come to us and we'll
 
00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:30.779 align:start position:0%
help them get connected with trainers in
 
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
the state so Mental Health First Aid is
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
an eight-hour course it helps us learn
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
how to recognize signs and symptoms of
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
mental health challenges or maybe a
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
substance use uh challenge and help
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
somebody get the care that they need in
 
00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:47.220 align:start position:0%
that moment if you think about it like
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
CPR for uh for mental health that's an
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
easy way to think about it so CPR right
 
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
we see somebody having some sort of
 
00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
physical health challenge we give them
 
00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
CPR and then the medical help comes and
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
arrives and our job is done Mental
 
00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
Health First Aid is similar in that we
 
00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
see somebody having a crisis we help
 
00:14:08.449 --> 00:14:08.459 align:start position:0%
them in through those moments we get
 
00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:09.959 align:start position:0%
them you know whatever help that they
 
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
might need and then the appropriate
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
medical professionals take over
 
00:14:17.449 --> 00:14:17.459 align:start position:0%
so there's a couple different versions
 
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
there's an adult version which is what's
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
on that card so that would be adults
 
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
like myself and I take the course so
 
00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:25.740 align:start position:0%
that I can support my adult peers
 
00:14:27.889 --> 00:14:27.899 align:start position:0%
there's a youth version and so this
 
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
would be again for adults that want to
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
support the youth that either maybe it's
 
00:14:34.009 --> 00:14:34.019 align:start position:0%
the youth that they work with it could
 
00:14:36.769 --> 00:14:36.779 align:start position:0%
be the youth that they live with care
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
for it could be you know a youth that
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
they see in a grocery store maybe having
 
00:14:44.329 --> 00:14:44.339 align:start position:0%
um a crisis there's also a teen version
 
00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
where teens learn these skills so that
 
00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
they could be helped for their peers and
 
00:14:50.569 --> 00:14:50.579 align:start position:0%
then help that team find
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
um uh find an appropriate adult who can
 
00:14:54.889 --> 00:14:54.899 align:start position:0%
help them then get the uh the services
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
that they need
 
00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
so again we serve as that Hub in the
 
00:14:59.810 --> 00:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
state getting people
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
um you know connected to instructors so
 
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
schools can come contact us say hey we
 
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
want to have a training we try to find
 
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
them some local trainers that can come
 
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
do that for them or if you're just an
 
00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
individual who's interested in taking
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
the course we offer them monthly so that
 
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
anybody can sign up and take the course
 
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
as an individual so you don't have to be
 
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:21.180 align:start position:0%
tied to a specific organization to take
 
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
it this course is literally for anybody
 
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
um we've trained lots of schools
 
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
different school districts we have one
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%

00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
represents Groveton here is anybody here
 
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
close yeah they trained all their bus
 
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
drivers they you know said the bus
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
drivers are you know somebody who
 
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
obviously they see you so they wanted to
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that their bus drivers were
 
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:43.740 align:start position:0%
able to see because they also see
 
00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
different parts of students lives than
 
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
teachers and other school
 
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
um staff would
 
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
um Public Safety officers especially in
 
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:54.180 align:start position:0%

00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:02.339 align:start position:0%
trained and we're working with the
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers as well
 
00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:06.420 align:start position:0%

people in the in the community who want
 
00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.590 align:start position:0%
people in the in the community who want
to

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
um so we are going to do
 
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
um an activity in just a moment again
 
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
this this course is eight hours so it
 
00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:18.839 align:start position:0%
starts by teaching us what are those
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
early signs and symptoms if somebody's
 
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
just starting to have a mental health
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
challenge what are maybe some signs and
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
symptoms of people who are getting a
 
00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
little bit worse and then people who
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
might be actually experiencing
 
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
um a crisis what do you think some of
 
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
those signs and symptoms might be from
 
00:16:37.249 --> 00:16:37.259 align:start position:0%
anywhere along the continuum
 
00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:38.759 align:start position:0%
symptoms someone might be having a
 
00:16:38.759 --> 00:16:39.470 align:start position:0%
symptoms someone might be having a
challenge

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.730 align:start position:0%
challenge
yeah

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:40.740 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:43.380 align:start position:0%
change in Behavior changing Behavior yes
 
00:16:44.749 --> 00:16:44.759 align:start position:0%
what else
 
00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
being withdrawn being withdrawn yeah
 
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
substance abuse substance abuse yep
 
00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:52.610 align:start position:0%
substance abuse substance abuse yep
yeah

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
yes go for it
 
00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
over or under eating yes yeah changes in
 
00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:05.579 align:start position:0%
eating yes changes in eating is a is a
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
big one yeah so there's there's all
 
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:09.660 align:start position:0%
these signs that we could be seeing and
 
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
so again the the course goes through
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
what are the ones that we might see kind
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
of early on what are those ones that are
 
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
oh this is getting a little bit worse
 
00:17:17.929 --> 00:17:17.939 align:start position:0%
than what are ones that we see
 
00:17:21.049 --> 00:17:21.059 align:start position:0%
um when somebody is in crisis so this
 
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
program is really good as an early
 
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
intervention when those signs and
 
00:17:26.689 --> 00:17:26.699 align:start position:0%
symptoms start showing up and trying to
 
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
stop it from getting to that crisis mode
 
00:17:30.289 --> 00:17:30.299 align:start position:0%
you know let's catch what are those
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
early symptoms so we can try and get
 
00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:33.780 align:start position:0%
somebody the appropriate help so that
 
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
they don't go into crisis but it still
 
00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:37.860 align:start position:0%
prepares us to know what does it look
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
like if somebody is
 
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
um in a crisis situation uh people learn
 
00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:44.220 align:start position:0%
an action plan it's got a cute little
 
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
acronym called algae so they can learn
 
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
you know how do we assess
 
00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
um the situation how can we listen
 
00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:52.919 align:start position:0%
non-judgmentally and really validate
 
00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:54.780 align:start position:0%
what somebody is experiencing and give
 
00:17:57.049 --> 00:17:57.059 align:start position:0%
them the assurance that they need in
 
00:17:59.090 --> 00:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
that moment encourage the appropriate
 
00:18:00.409 --> 00:18:00.419 align:start position:0%
professional help and then encourage
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
urge them to also take care of
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
themselves because this is really
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
emotionally taxing for us to be
 
00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:07.140 align:start position:0%
providing that mental health care to
 
00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
other people so how do we make sure to
 
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
check in with ourselves and take care of
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
ourselves there
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
so we're going to do an activity that
 
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
we're jumping towards the end of the uh
 
00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:17.220 align:start position:0%
course and we're going into crisis mode
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
we're going to do an activity that is an
 
00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
auditory hallucination so we're going to
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
kind of get an experience of what it
 
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:25.980 align:start position:0%
might be like for somebody who is
 
00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
experiencing auditory hallucination so
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
we can kind of build a little empathy
 
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:31.669 align:start position:0%
we can kind of build a little empathy
there

00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
um and have that so I've got two people
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
who've been voluntold by representative
 
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
Ladd so representative is it caskadin
 
00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
but you've been volunteled
 
00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:52.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
ahead of you okay that's all you're
 
00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
going to do is be reading this to you
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
become here it'll be great 529 short
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so you're gonna maybe if you two
 
00:19:06.169 --> 00:19:06.179 align:start position:0%
stand right there in the middle would be
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
great so
 
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.750 align:start position:0%
great so
you're

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
your job representative
 
00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
she's going to be reading to you how to
 
00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
get to the new library in town and your
 
00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:21.059 align:start position:0%
goal is to get to the new library in
 
00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:22.860 align:start position:0%
town I am not going to make this easy
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
for you but your job is to try and get
 
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
can I have some distance uh no you'll be
 
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
okay you'll be okay so you're just gonna
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
read this part and you're gonna do your
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
best to get to the new library in town

go for it ready
 
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
the new library is amazing you're almost
 
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:41.940 align:start position:0%
why are you talking to her just a little
 
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:43.980 align:start position:0%
bit to go don't trust her start out
 
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:46.980 align:start position:0%
going West on Owen Avenue
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
and after half a mile turn right why
 
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
if you don't know
 
00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:21.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
how was that experience for you terrific
 
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:29.830 align:start position:0%
how was that experience for you terrific
yeah

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:32.220 align:start position:0%
can you get to the library
 
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
no can anybody in this room get to the
 
00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:35.270 align:start position:0%
no can anybody in this room get to the
library

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
library
 
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
no no can you get to the library
 
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
probably right Fish Hatchery it's a big
 
00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:43.039 align:start position:0%
Green Building
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
when you looked at him did you see
 
00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
anything that indicated during the
 
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
headlights right so probably struggling
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
to focus a little bit right oh yeah yeah
 
00:20:53.039 --> 00:20:54.770 align:start position:0%
to focus a little bit right oh yeah yeah
yeah

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
right anybody anybody else notice
 
00:20:58.490 --> 00:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
anything or did you have any feelings of
 
00:21:00.289 --> 00:21:00.299 align:start position:0%
like what like what did that bring up
 
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
for you going through that
 
00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.950 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
um somebody did cry on Friday
 
00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
um yeah I mean it is it's hard to think
 
00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
yeah no and so this is um thank you very
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
much I appreciate can you get a round of
 
00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:25.150 align:start position:0%
much I appreciate can you get a round of
applause

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:27.780 align:start position:0%
so this is one of the favorite
 
00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:29.700 align:start position:0%
activities that people go through in
 
00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
Mental Health First Aid this is in both
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
the youth and the adult version
 
00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
um I think this activity is a great
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
example of what's at the core of this
 
00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
program is really building that
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
understanding and empathy of what people
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
are going through
 
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
um because when we see a physical
 
00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:44.700 align:start position:0%
um challenge we can see it right if I'm
 
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
physically injured you'd be able to see
 
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
it you'd be able to have a little
 
00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
empathy and understanding because you
 
00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:50.820 align:start position:0%
can see what I am going through but we
 
00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
can't see those with mental health
 
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
challenges and so activities like this
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
can give us that opportunity to learn
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
what people might be struggling with and
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
then we can you know be there and be
 
00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:03.780 align:start position:0%
their support and help really validate
 
00:22:06.649 --> 00:22:06.659 align:start position:0%
what their experience is so thank you
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
for your time thank you again so much
 
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
um for letting me know can you try to
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
then relate what we just did here to
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the classroom when we
 
00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
have a child coming into the room that's
 
00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:21.780 align:start position:0%
dealing with an environment a behavior
 
00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
environment they're coming from or
 
00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
there's other issues going on Within
 
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
family or with their lives or with
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
another student
 
00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:30.780 align:start position:0%
one of their chances of really achieving
 
00:22:33.289 --> 00:22:33.299 align:start position:0%
in that class academically yeah they're
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
going to struggle a lot right because we
 
00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
feel safe at home if we don't feel safe
 
00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
in general it's very hard for us to
 
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
learn and if we're bringing in
 
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
um you know experiences from home or
 
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
again if we're struggling with another
 
00:22:51.169 --> 00:22:51.179 align:start position:0%
student that's in our classroom it's
 
00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
going to be very hard to concentrate our
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
mind is going to be focused on that
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
situation and trying to stay safe versus
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
actually trying to learn what's
 
00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
happening so um again it can we might be
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
seeing these as children acting out a
 
00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
lot of times right that we we and we
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
label them maybe as problem children or
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
somebody that's just misbehaving and
 
00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:14.220 align:start position:0%
that might not be the case it could be
 
00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
that they are struggling with um their
 
00:23:18.409 --> 00:23:18.419 align:start position:0%
situation and they need again a little
 
00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:20.940 align:start position:0%
bit of us to understand what they are
 
00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
experiencing so that we can then help
 
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
them okay how can I create this safe
 
00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:26.700 align:start position:0%
environment in my classroom so that they
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
can be in a situation where they can
 
00:23:28.559 --> 00:23:29.990 align:start position:0%
can be in a situation where they can
learn

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
learn
 
00:23:33.409 --> 00:23:33.419 align:start position:0%
yes oh yes representative
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
questions yeah one is you had mentioned
 
00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:38.700 align:start position:0%
algae yes uh was an acronym for an
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
action plan what do those what does that
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
stand for yes so algae the A is for
 
00:23:48.529 --> 00:23:48.539 align:start position:0%
assess the risk for suicide or harm
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
L is listening non-judgmentally
 
00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:55.980 align:start position:0%
G is giving assurance and information we
 
00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes call this hope with facts um
 
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
so usually people need a little bit of
 
00:24:00.649 --> 00:24:00.659 align:start position:0%
Hope but we don't want to give them
 
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
false information right right so Mental
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
Health First Aid really goes over
 
00:24:06.289 --> 00:24:06.299 align:start position:0%
um a lot of statistics and facts so
 
00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
people can be prepared with those
 
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
the first e is for encouraging
 
00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:11.940 align:start position:0%
appropriate professional help
 
00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
um and so again we work to make sure
 
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
that we have local resources available
 
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
so people know okay this this is your
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
local Community Mental Health Center or
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
these are some other places you want to
 
00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
go in your portion of the state or we
 
00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:25.559 align:start position:0%
have other um you know National hotlines
 
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
and and things at the ready to share and
 
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
then the last e is encouraging self-help
 
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:32.940 align:start position:0%
and other support strategies great thank
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
you and one other last question is
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
do you differentiate between behavioral
 
00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
health and mental health
 
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
and what what kind of signs might be the
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
difference no so in the course no
 
00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:46.740 align:start position:0%
they'll be showing they'll talk about
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
both of those together yeah together
 
00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:50.340 align:start position:0%
yeah so then you'll see you know maybe
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
what are some of the physical
 
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
um signs so that could be you know
 
00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:55.260 align:start position:0%
somebody's looking more disheveled than
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
they usually do right
 
00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
um or then Behavioral Health would be
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
some of the things like not eat you know
 
00:25:02.029 --> 00:25:02.039 align:start position:0%
your changes in your eating habits
 
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
um mental health would be
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
there's signs which are things that we
 
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
can observe like that and then there's
 
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
symptoms which are the things we can
 
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
observe which would be like what are the
 
00:25:12.169 --> 00:25:12.179 align:start position:0%
cognitive thoughts that people might be
 
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
telling themselves so then we know what
 
00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:16.740 align:start position:0%
some of those are again when they're
 
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
early on in the crisis than their
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
worsening or you know when they're in
 
00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
crisis mode what are some of the common
 
00:25:24.169 --> 00:25:24.179 align:start position:0%
thoughts people are having so then we
 
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
know okay this is what people might be
 
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
thinking at this time right if they're
 
00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
in crisis mode they might be thinking
 
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:31.740 align:start position:0%
about suicide so we need to be asking
 
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
them specifically about that so that it
 
00:25:36.769 --> 00:25:36.779 align:start position:0%
does go over both both of those yeah
 
00:25:36.779 --> 00:25:38.049 align:start position:0%
does go over both both of those yeah
representative

00:25:38.049 --> 00:25:38.059 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:41.700 align:start position:0%
yes thank you how do you teach people to
 
00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:42.890 align:start position:0%
yes thank you how do you teach people to
listen

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
listen
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
to listen non-judgmentally or listen in
 
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
general just listen in general without I
 
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
guess it would be a non-judgmental thing
 
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
because one of the problems we have is
 
00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:52.919 align:start position:0%
that everybody is supposed to have an
 
00:25:52.919 --> 00:25:53.870 align:start position:0%
that everybody is supposed to have an
opinion

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:55.740 align:start position:0%
so I think it's very difficult for
 
00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
people to just listen to what somebody's
 
00:26:00.289 --> 00:26:00.299 align:start position:0%
saying what kinds of programs do you
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
have to to teach listening skills yeah I
 
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
would say we don't have a program that
 
00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:06.900 align:start position:0%
teaches just listening skills but this
 
00:26:09.769 --> 00:26:09.779 align:start position:0%
one had like does spend time practicing
 
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
listening and going through like time to
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
to have somebody talk about maybe a
 
00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:16.740 align:start position:0%
situation they're going through not
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily a crisis or a mental health
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
challenge but they practice that active
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
listening where you have to repeat back
 
00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:25.380 align:start position:0%
what the person just said I would think
 
00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:26.940 align:start position:0%
that's actually embedded in some of our
 
00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
youth programming too that we know it's
 
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
an important skill so whenever we can in
 
00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
workshops we're like we're going to
 
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
practice active listening because it's a
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
good skill to have and it can be
 
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
challenging for people
 
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:38.940 align:start position:0%
um with the list of non-judgmentally
 
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
peace that is the part of it as well
 
00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
that there's an opportunity to look at
 
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
what are some statements we might say
 
00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
that are not helpful and what are
 
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
statements that we could say that are
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
helpful and so that goes through that
 
00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:53.220 align:start position:0%
practicing again of I'm trying to just
 
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
listen to somebody and have them tell me
 
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
what's going on with them and how can I
 
00:26:59.870 --> 00:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
be a part of that conversation and not
 
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
give my opinion because my opinion might
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
be saying something that's not helpful
 
00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:06.900 align:start position:0%
to them so what can I say that instead
 
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
validates what they're saying to me yeah
 
00:27:13.149 --> 00:27:13.159 align:start position:0%
yes our guinea pig over there yeah
 
00:27:13.159 --> 00:27:15.010 align:start position:0%
yes our guinea pig over there yeah
yeah

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:15.020 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:27:18.529 --> 00:27:18.539 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you for your
 
00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:20.039 align:start position:0%
presentation a couple quick questions on
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
the youth mental health yeah you said
 
00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:24.419 align:start position:0%
that's an eight-hour course yes okay is
 
00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:26.820 align:start position:0%
it available online yes okay and then
 
00:27:30.049 --> 00:27:30.059 align:start position:0%
the third one about if any how many
 
00:27:33.529 --> 00:27:33.539 align:start position:0%
school districts in the state have
 
00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:35.220 align:start position:0%
participated in this or are
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
participating in this the terms of
 
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
trying to faculty yeah so that's a
 
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
question I unfortunately don't have the
 
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
answer to part of it is because we are
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
not the only ones who offer the course
 
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
so there could be we have several
 
00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.750 align:start position:0%
so there could be we have several
community

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Centers who also offer the
 
00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
course and they have different funding
 
00:27:54.049 --> 00:27:54.059 align:start position:0%
than us so we might be talking together
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
but we're not necessarily sharing that
 
00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
information so for example Manchester
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
has a very active Mental Health Center
 
00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
and they also have another organization
 
00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
that does youth Mental Health First Aid
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
we pretty much passed off our Manchester
 
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
requests to them because they can meet
 
00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
those so
 
00:28:12.049 --> 00:28:12.059 align:start position:0%
um I'm not not sure on that
 
00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
unfortunately okay yeah thank you thank
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
you Carolyn you're welcome further
 
00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:18.380 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Damon
 
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Woodcock for
 
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
asking two of my three questions that's
 
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
does the online version of the First Aid
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
course have an interactive component for
 
00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:33.900 align:start position:0%
example with practicing the active
 
00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:36.900 align:start position:0%
listening yeah so what um what the
 
00:28:39.289 --> 00:28:39.299 align:start position:0%
online course means is that there's also
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
a blended option so
 
00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
um participants do two hours of it by
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
themselves first where they're watching
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
some videos they do a little um kind of
 
00:28:51.289 --> 00:28:51.299 align:start position:0%
knowledge check quiz and they learn the
 
00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:53.820 align:start position:0%
basics of the algae plan so they can do
 
00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:55.860 align:start position:0%
that on their own for two hours then the
 
00:28:58.010 --> 00:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
other six hours is led by a trained
 
00:29:00.649 --> 00:29:00.659 align:start position:0%
instructor that portion can either be in
 
00:29:03.649 --> 00:29:03.659 align:start position:0%
person or still online and so that's
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
when they get the opportunity to
 
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
practice some of these skills so again
 
00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:08.220 align:start position:0%
it'll go through some different
 
00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:09.830 align:start position:0%
it'll go through some different
scenarios

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
scenarios
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
um and then they can start saying okay
 
00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:13.140 align:start position:0%
here I've watched this video we've read
 
00:29:15.409 --> 00:29:15.419 align:start position:0%
the scenario let's look at what are some
 
00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
of those signs and symptoms that
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
somebody might be experiencing and they
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
actually get to then practice the algae
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
plan together so there's only two hours
 
00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
of it that's really solo and then the
 
00:29:27.529 --> 00:29:27.539 align:start position:0%
other six is with the instructors and
 
00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
other people in the course but it can
 
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
still be done over Zoom we do most of
 
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
our classes over Zoom right now
 
00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.149 align:start position:0%
our classes over Zoom right now
yeah

00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you just going to repeat of this
 
00:29:40.909 --> 00:29:40.919 align:start position:0%
it is free right now so thank you to the
 
00:29:42.649 --> 00:29:42.659 align:start position:0%
Department of Education for funding it
 
00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
for us for the last two years it is
 
00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
currently free
 
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
um and so we're hoping to um be able to
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
continue offering it for free great
 
00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:52.980 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah that was a question I was
 
00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
going to ask too and I Melissa's back
 
00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:56.940 align:start position:0%
there and maybe the department can help
 
00:29:58.610 --> 00:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
us out with that
 
00:29:59.690 --> 00:29:59.700 align:start position:0%
um I don't know whether I should be
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
calling you a doctor with the PHD that
 
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
you have but but uh it's it's really
 
00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
amazing to me that we have the
 
00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:10.919 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension Service out of the
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
University system now I always thought
 
00:30:15.409 --> 00:30:15.419 align:start position:0%
that was dealing with soils and birds
 
00:30:18.169 --> 00:30:18.179 align:start position:0%
and the wildlife and but now it looks
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
like you really dug out and challenging
 
00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:25.140 align:start position:0%
us with these areas of of need yeah and
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
how well are is this program is this
 
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
operating as a silo are you working in
 
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the community mental
 
00:30:34.909 --> 00:30:34.919 align:start position:0%
Health's uh centers and with doe and
 
00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
other is there any way of tying all this
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
together for specifically my mental
 
00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
first aid or yes yes yeah no we are
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
working so we also um just received a
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
samsa grant for the adults Mental Health
 
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
First Aid
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
um and several other organizations in
 
00:30:51.289 --> 00:30:51.299 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire also received the same
 
00:30:51.299 --> 00:30:52.190 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire also received the same
Grant

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
Grant
 
00:30:54.049 --> 00:30:54.059 align:start position:0%
um so we're working together so that
 
00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
00:30:57.409 --> 00:30:57.419 align:start position:0%
um a not competing for each other and
 
00:30:59.330 --> 00:30:59.340 align:start position:0%
that there's not overlap but we're also
 
00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
learning from one another on how we can
 
00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
um you know work together to increase
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
our reach so for example Manchester's
 
00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:08.460 align:start position:0%
Community Health Center is very specific
 
00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
organizations that they have to meet for
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
the grant they might have requests that
 
00:31:15.049 --> 00:31:15.059 align:start position:0%
they can't meet because of capacity so
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
they come to us so that we can try and
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
meet that need that whatever
 
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
organization might be happening same
 
00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Education they
 
00:31:25.549 --> 00:31:25.559 align:start position:0%
know that we are
 
00:31:27.409 --> 00:31:27.419 align:start position:0%
um you know doing doing mental health
 
00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
first aid for for the Youth version so I
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
have my contact there regularly sending
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
people to me
 
00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
um to say Hey you know UNH extension can
 
00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
help you get get trained so we're
 
00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
working with those Partners as much as
 
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
um to help meet the needs of prosperity
 
00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:43.860 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna try to get the questions
 
00:31:45.889 --> 00:31:45.899 align:start position:0%
done by about 10 30 because I think
 
00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
Melissa do you have to be out of here by
 
00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:51.260 align:start position:0%
11 today yes okay
 
00:31:54.169 --> 00:31:54.179 align:start position:0%
uh just question about the book yeah if
 
00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:55.799 align:start position:0%
people are doing that online do they
 
00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
have the option to order the book is
 
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
that free or the book they get an
 
00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:01.799 align:start position:0%
electronic copy
 
00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
um and so they could order the the book
 
00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:07.980 align:start position:0%
I think is 25 if they wanted a hard copy
 
00:32:09.409 --> 00:32:09.419 align:start position:0%
and we can help people get that
 
00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:12.020 align:start position:0%
unfortunately for us because you get um
 
00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:14.940 align:start position:0%
a an electronic copy if we buy the book
 
00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
we're technically paying for you twice
 
00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
for the course
 
00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
um but we you know we try to work with
 
00:32:21.649 --> 00:32:21.659 align:start position:0%
people so that they can get what they
 
00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
need that's the benefit of doing it in
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
person when you do it in person you're
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
able to get a hard copy of the book
 
00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
because we know a lot of people like to
 
00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
have those yeah yeah uh so this is uh
 
00:32:36.169 --> 00:32:36.179 align:start position:0%
primarily focused at adults or or our
 
00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:38.700 align:start position:0%
students also involved I mean I'm
 
00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
concerned about the issue of students
 
00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:44.700 align:start position:0%
who are not engaged in the whole issue
 
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
of active listening or dealing with
 
00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
their peers and problem solving Etc so
 
00:32:51.289 --> 00:32:51.299 align:start position:0%
does this have any relationship up to
 
00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
student engagement so the youth and
 
00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:56.220 align:start position:0%
adult versions are all for adults to
 
00:32:58.250 --> 00:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
take them and for either adults to
 
00:32:59.870 --> 00:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
support other adults or adults to
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
support youth there is a teen version it
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
that's for ages or sorry for grades 10
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
to 12 where they then learn
 
00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
um similar skills so
 
00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
um Dover High School has been a great
 
00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
example of that that they've been
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
implementing it it's about the course is
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
shorter I think it's six 45-minute
 
00:33:21.529 --> 00:33:21.539 align:start position:0%
lessons and so they do those about once
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
a week or they might spread it out a
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
little bit more so that they can have
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
time to really learn and reflect on what
 
00:33:28.509 --> 00:33:28.519 align:start position:0%
they've done in there so then it gives
 
00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:31.860 align:start position:0%
teens that opportunity to uh to practice
 
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
things like listening and then how their
 
00:33:36.169 --> 00:33:36.179 align:start position:0%
goal is not to they they can't provide
 
00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:37.740 align:start position:0%
support for their peer right they're not
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
trained for that it's just to help them
 
00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
in that moment and say I know this adult
 
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
at our school is trained in youth Mental
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
Health First Aid or can be a help for
 
00:33:48.769 --> 00:33:48.779 align:start position:0%
you let's go talk to the school nurse or
 
00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:50.940 align:start position:0%
let's go talk to this librarian so it's
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
helping them just quickly in that moment
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
and then getting them to an adult who
 
00:33:56.269 --> 00:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
can help support them representative
 
00:33:56.279 --> 00:34:00.009 align:start position:0%
can help support them representative
Luna

00:34:00.009 --> 00:34:00.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
I think touched on what I wanted to find
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
out about maybe as um as this work
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
session proceeds into the fall if we
 
00:34:11.089 --> 00:34:11.099 align:start position:0%
could get some um you know expertise
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
from Dover yeah or any other students
 
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
that are that are implementing the 6x45
 
00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sorry 6x45 team yeah
 
00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
um a curriculum that could be
 
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:26.220 align:start position:0%
yeah I think there's a lot going on I
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
didn't even know you had something going
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
on in Haverhill uh oh yeah that yeah and
 
00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.389 align:start position:0%
on in Haverhill uh oh yeah that yeah and
so

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
um I think this is a good idea that we
 
00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:36.899 align:start position:0%
do pull people in from the schools and
 
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
just incorporate this into our a book of
 
00:34:41.089 --> 00:34:41.099 align:start position:0%
knowledge here so when we do make some
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
decisions how and we're going to handle
 
00:34:44.089 --> 00:34:44.099 align:start position:0%
all this
 
00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
it's important Patty did you have
 
00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
something I just wanted to say to throw
 
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
off the um in Manchester I know the
 
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
mental health center also trains the
 
00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:53.300 align:start position:0%
fire department and police department
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
which helps in the way that they respond
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
to calls yeah so it's not just School
 
00:34:58.970 --> 00:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
related it's it's good for all
 
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
responders it is yes thank you and and
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
Mental Health First Aid has actually
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
made modules specific for
 
00:35:08.329 --> 00:35:08.339 align:start position:0%
um Fire EMS Public Safety officers and
 
00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:10.619 align:start position:0%
so um a lot of we are seeing a lot of
 
00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
communities gaining more interest in
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
doing that because as you said it
 
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
changes how they can respond to
 
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
um to Christ this moment and they're
 
00:35:19.069 --> 00:35:19.079 align:start position:0%
just getting the knowledge that we need
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
so we're really excited to see so many
 
00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
of our Public Safety officers interested
 
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
in wanting to do the training again
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
Dover Stratford county has had they have
 
00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:30.300 align:start position:0%
multiple sheriffs that are trained to
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
deliver the program their whole police
 
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
department has been trained so they
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
they're another just really good example
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
of That So yeah thank you thank you very
 
00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
much Kendra one last question throw it
 
00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:42.540 align:start position:0%
up there either also make sure everybody
 
00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:44.540 align:start position:0%
gets my card we'll come back
 
00:35:47.329 --> 00:35:47.339 align:start position:0%
I was just wondering if you've targeted
 
00:35:48.589 --> 00:35:48.599 align:start position:0%
the audience
 
00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
um are there is there any research on
 
00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:53.460 align:start position:0%
someone for self-help let's say you end
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
up being the the person that takes it
 
00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
but you're suffering from mental health
 
00:36:00.589 --> 00:36:00.599 align:start position:0%
issues itself is there a have you gotten
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
any feedback I haven't gotten any I
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
would say anecdotally yes
 
00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
um from people who I know who have taken
 
00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
it but I don't have any hard research
 
00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:10.740 align:start position:0%
and I don't think I've seen seen any
 
00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:11.870 align:start position:0%
and I don't think I've seen seen any
from

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
um the actual program that or National
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
Council for mental well-being who
 
00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:18.780 align:start position:0%
designed this program but that's a great
 
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
question I don't think that they've
 
00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:21.660 align:start position:0%
looked at that yet but I would say
 
00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
anecdotally yes for sure it's a benefit
 
00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
because then you get to know your own
 
00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
signs and symptoms right I was thinking
 
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you great thank you very much
 
00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:31.740 align:start position:0%

Rebecca congratulations you might have
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
to scoot out but okay great so we have
 
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
uh some folks here from the Department
 
00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
have a wealth of knowledge and you know
 
00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:29.660 align:start position:0%
I was briefly on the phone with um
 
00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
Melissa yesterday and I know that when
 
00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
we had the bill first presented to us
 
00:37:37.609 --> 00:37:37.619 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of questions regarding
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
you know where we Place Mental Health in
 
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
our statute language uh how does mtssb
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
relate to this uh and the questions went
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
on and on and on so let's just try to
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
listen to what they may be imparting to
 
00:37:55.069 --> 00:37:55.079 align:start position:0%
us right now and then we'll go with the
 
00:37:57.050 --> 00:37:57.060 align:start position:0%
questions and answers following that
 
00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:00.020 align:start position:0%
that good sounds good so uh currently uh
 
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
rsa193 e2a substantive educational
 
00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:06.060 align:start position:0%
content of an adequate education has
 
00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:08.220 align:start position:0%
health and wellness education and then
 
00:38:12.589 --> 00:38:12.599 align:start position:0%
when we get into the uh Ed 306.40 b2g
 
00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
health education then is a little bit
 
00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:18.300 align:start position:0%
more explicit about what is included
 
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
within that health and wellness
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
education and mental health is um
 
00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
specifically identified as a component
 
00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
of K-12 curriculum in health education
 
00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:32.220 align:start position:0%
so it is currently already a requirement
 
00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:35.220 align:start position:0%
to include that curriculum in your
 
00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
health and wellness education program
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
our current standards for health
 
00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:42.780 align:start position:0%
education right now are a tad bit
 
00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
outdated 2003 was the last time that was
 
00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:47.700 align:start position:0%
done currently at the national level
 
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
they are in the process of
 
00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
updating the national standards once
 
00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
those have been rolled out then the
 
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
department is going to go through the
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
process of gathering our constituents to
 
00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
go through our own internal updating
 
00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
process but we want to make sure we
 
00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:06.300 align:start position:0%
include those national standards because
 
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
we've gone through in the past where
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
we've gone through and updated our
 
00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
standards and then nationally standards
 
00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
get rolled out and then we have to kind
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
of go back and and do a lot of matching
 
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
up so that is why
 
00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:20.940 align:start position:0%
um you might look at our current health
 
00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:23.780 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks and they have
 
00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:26.820 align:start position:0%
specified mental health education and
 
00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
what that looks like at the elementary
 
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
middle and high school level
 
00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
but there is some outdated language
 
00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
there is some things that need to be
 
00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
included but uh I noticed when we look
 
00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
specifically at the language that was
 
00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
put into the proposed legislation when
 
00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
we're looking at anxiety disorders and
 
00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:49.380 align:start position:0%
and going into a kind of a uh that level
 
00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
of specificity that's actually included
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
in the existing Frameworks at this time
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
so I think that
 
00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:57.300 align:start position:0%
um the Department's plan was just to
 
00:39:58.730 --> 00:39:58.740 align:start position:0%
move forward with updating those
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
Frameworks so that the school districts
 
00:40:02.569 --> 00:40:02.579 align:start position:0%
can then have that information
 
00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:05.579 align:start position:0%
use that as they're looking at their
 
00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:07.380 align:start position:0%
curriculum that they want to adopt in
 
00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
order to meet the standards but right
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
now school districts
 
00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:11.630 align:start position:0%
now school districts
um

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:13.380 align:start position:0%
should have
 
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
mental health curriculum that they have
 
00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
implemented and are teaching in our
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:29.329 --> 00:40:29.339 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead represent Balboni thank
 
00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for taking my question
 
00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:31.910 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for taking my question
um

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that schools should have
 
00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:39.140 align:start position:0%
them um how do you are there
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
specific curriculums that are
 
00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:43.380 align:start position:0%
recommended at the doe and they can
 
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
choose from or are they just coming up
 
00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
with their own so this is where it gets
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
a little bit tricky because it there is
 
00:40:52.849 --> 00:40:52.859 align:start position:0%
a statute that says the Department of
 
00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
Education and the State Board of
 
00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
Education are not allowed to
 
00:40:58.609 --> 00:40:58.619 align:start position:0%
um dictate a curriculum so we cannot
 
00:40:59.930 --> 00:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
choose a curriculum and say you have to
 
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
teach this however
 
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
um we have the Frameworks we have the
 
00:41:05.089 --> 00:41:05.099 align:start position:0%
standards and then at the local level
 
00:41:06.829 --> 00:41:06.839 align:start position:0%
it's in statute that they are
 
00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:08.700 align:start position:0%
responsible for determining which
 
00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
curriculum they would like to use in
 
00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
order to meet the standards
 
00:41:14.089 --> 00:41:14.099 align:start position:0%
um currently we do not have anything
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
specific for health education that we
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
put out as a recommendation it can get a
 
00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:23.240 align:start position:0%
bit challenging to put out
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations for a curriculum because
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
then you have a a number of vendors and
 
00:41:29.329 --> 00:41:29.339 align:start position:0%
this is across all of our content areas
 
00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
like we'll put our curriculum out you
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
put this curriculum out ours should be
 
00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:33.900 align:start position:0%
on there too and then it gets to be a
 
00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:36.839 align:start position:0%
pretty exhaustive list and since that is
 
00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
determined at the local level we usually
 
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
um leave it to the local level to
 
00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:42.900 align:start position:0%
determine what they want to use in order
 
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
to meet the standards
 
00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:47.820 align:start position:0%
yes representative would it be helpful
 
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
knowing the national standards of being
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
revised and a Frameworks and I was 20
 
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
years old
 
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
would it be helpful to put a survey out
 
00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
to schools to find out what they are
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
doing or is it better to just wait to
 
00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:02.460 align:start position:0%
see what the Nationals are and send it
 
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
out and and we could do that um we've
 
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:05.940 align:start position:0%
done that in the past when we're
 
00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
surveying some of our other content
 
00:42:09.609 --> 00:42:09.619 align:start position:0%
areas yeah
 
00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
what's what's most widely used and we've
 
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
done that in the past too if we're
 
00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:16.140 align:start position:0%
um particularly during covet if we're
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
looking at purchasing or like Discovery
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
Education you know how many school
 
00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
districts are out there using Discovery
 
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:23.220 align:start position:0%
Education there's a lot there's a lot
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
that want access it's worth it to buy a
 
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:28.140 align:start position:0%
state level license for all schools to
 
00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
be engaged with so we could definitely
 
00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
do A needs assessment on that piece
 
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
survey that failed as to what they are
 
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
utilizing but if you do that can you
 
00:42:38.349 --> 00:42:38.359 align:start position:0%
also be
 
00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:41.820 align:start position:0%
determining if they're training people
 
00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
to import you know we have the
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
curriculum but the instruction is a part
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
that I'm really concerned about who is
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
the one is providing this instruction is
 
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
a classroom teacher who just came out of
 
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:56.220 align:start position:0%
unh prepared to deliver this uh program
 
00:42:58.670 --> 00:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh is it a nurse within the building
 
00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:00.900 align:start position:0%
that's been there and and familiar with
 
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
it uh I'd like to know in the districts
 
00:43:06.589 --> 00:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
how this is being conveyed
 
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
sure imparted to students and I think
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's something we could include in our
 
00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:13.140 align:start position:0%
query as to how you know who is
 
00:43:14.809 --> 00:43:14.819 align:start position:0%
responsible for for teaching that
 
00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
curriculum I know in some school
 
00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
districts education teacher some it may
 
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:20.700 align:start position:0%
be that's actually in the law 189 10
 
00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
Roman one right the Department of
 
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
Education shall survey school districts
 
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
biannually and receive reports on
 
00:43:29.569 --> 00:43:29.579 align:start position:0%
compliance with this section and we have
 
00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:31.740 align:start position:0%
gotten that report back and I was amazed
 
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
when I looked at that report that there
 
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
are some schools even high schools are
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
putting no we didn't touch that topic
 
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
even though it's required in statute
 
00:43:46.609 --> 00:43:46.619 align:start position:0%
um and so yeah I think that was going to
 
00:43:49.069 --> 00:43:49.079 align:start position:0%
be an a September deal that I was going
 
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
to bring up because there's a lot of it
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's that information that you
 
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
provided us
 
00:43:58.130 --> 00:43:58.140 align:start position:0%
is really showing there's some holes
 
00:44:00.349 --> 00:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
right and I think that's similar to
 
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
something we've we discovered a couple
 
00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
weeks ago with another compliance report
 
00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:07.079 align:start position:0%
that hadn't been uh put together so
 
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe getting uh getting the last
 
00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
several of these so that and maybe a
 
00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:15.290 align:start position:0%
several of these so that and maybe a
trend

00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:15.300 align:start position:0%
trend
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
is it getting better is it are we
 
00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
I I think that's all all good stuff we
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
should be familiar with uh I those those
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
surveys have been done annually is that
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
correct I will double check it's either
 
00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
annually or uh or buy anything yeah yeah
 
00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:36.839 align:start position:0%
buy annually yeah so we should have some
 
00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
information but it's only as good as
 
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
what the what's being entered by the
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
school district correct so and and uh
 
00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:46.140 align:start position:0%
there are those districts which it's
 
00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:47.460 align:start position:0%
very amazing I mean there's some large
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
schools saying we aren't doing it
 
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.119 --> 00:44:56.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.670 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:44:58.670 --> 00:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:00.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
the national standards that you said are
 
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
currently being revised and if I got
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
this right they go back to 2003 or our
 
00:45:10.609 --> 00:45:10.619 align:start position:0%
standards go back to 2000 their
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
standards as well
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
so they haven't revised the mental
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
health education standards for 20 years
 
00:45:15.119 --> 00:45:16.870 align:start position:0%
health education standards for 20 years
exactly

00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:19.980 align:start position:0%
and it's my understanding that they were
 
00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
in the process of of doing that and then
 
00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
of course I don't know if the excuse is
 
00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:26.940 align:start position:0%
just being used as kova but then it's
 
00:45:29.569 --> 00:45:29.579 align:start position:0%
like oh okay covid that set us back but
 
00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:31.140 align:start position:0%
they're anticipating within the next
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
year at least according to their website
 
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
they're anticipating to roll those out
 
00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
within the next year
 
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
yes represent Tanner and then
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell Thank you thank
 
00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:42.900 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I'm wondering
 
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
when the state school board or local
 
00:45:48.849 --> 00:45:48.859 align:start position:0%
school boards give approval to schools
 
00:45:53.089 --> 00:45:53.099 align:start position:0%
uh if they consider any that whether
 
00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
they're meeting the requirement for
 
00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
health Ed or any other uh part of the
 
00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:00.300 align:start position:0%
adequate education standards
 
00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:02.460 align:start position:0%
but I may need to check in with Caitlin
 
00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:04.020 align:start position:0%
Davis's division the division of
 
00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:05.940 align:start position:0%
analytics because they are the the team
 
00:46:07.309 --> 00:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
that collects the data they are the team
 
00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
that does the school approval component
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
I do the standards and the content and
 
00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
they handle that piece but I could
 
00:46:14.569 --> 00:46:14.579 align:start position:0%
definitely check in with them on on that
 
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
piece of it it's my understanding that
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
the schools when they go through the
 
00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:21.300 align:start position:0%
approval process they do have to provide
 
00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
um their curriculum but I could be
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if we actually collect
 
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
the actual curriculum or just the name
 
00:46:29.809 --> 00:46:29.819 align:start position:0%
of the curriculum oh we're using you
 
00:46:32.809 --> 00:46:32.819 align:start position:0%
know so and so for our math curriculum
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
or if it's if it's down to that level of
 
00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:37.980 align:start position:0%
specificity I don't know if we actually
 
00:46:40.849 --> 00:46:40.859 align:start position:0%
look at and then match up
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh to the um actual standards whether
 
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
all of that's addressed
 
00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell
 
00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
the new 306 standards change all of the
 
00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
shell requires to May requires so if
 
00:46:56.089 --> 00:46:56.099 align:start position:0%
those passed
 
00:46:59.210 --> 00:46:59.220 align:start position:0%
no one will have to do anything correct
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
the new Ed 306 take those elements out
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
it will say they have the topic the
 
00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
subject if you want to call it that but
 
00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:12.180 align:start position:0%
then all the
 
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
areas of Health for example if you look
 
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
at what was in the oversight committee
 
00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
there enlisted under the ed306 that
 
00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
mental health I think it's item G on
 
00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:23.720 align:start position:0%
there correct
 
00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
is to be taught in schools the as from
 
00:47:29.329 --> 00:47:29.339 align:start position:0%
my understanding of course those new
 
00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:31.740 align:start position:0%
rules are not complete at this point in
 
00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
time they're still going through the
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
hearing process with the public
 
00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
so that has to come back and I guess the
 
00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:42.300 align:start position:0%
depart the state board has to take a
 
00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
look at that but uh I'm concerned that
 
00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
if you take mental health out of G there
 
00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:54.180 align:start position:0%
on 306 where else is it mentioned in
 
00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
statute now as a previous member of gel
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
car we always had the rule that the rule
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
has to reference a statute
 
00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't reference a statute where
 
00:48:10.609 --> 00:48:10.619 align:start position:0%
is the state board coming up with this
 
00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
requirement it's it basically becomes
 
00:48:13.319 --> 00:48:14.630 align:start position:0%
requirement it's it basically becomes
really

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:17.940 align:start position:0%
an unfunded issue so we're we are
 
00:48:20.089 --> 00:48:20.099 align:start position:0%
concerned that you know by taking it out
 
00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:21.660 align:start position:0%
then it's in this and I think that's
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
where her Senator Waters it was when he
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
put this together saying that it's an
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
issue in the schools how do we ensure
 
00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:31.380 align:start position:0%
that it's taught in schools now or at
 
00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
least referenced because we don't
 
00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's taught or not that's a
 
00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:36.890 align:start position:0%
whether it's taught or not that's a
local

00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:36.900 align:start position:0%
local
 
00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:40.740 align:start position:0%
local thing and unfortunately that I
 
00:48:42.589 --> 00:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
think is very characteristic of a lot of
 
00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:45.900 align:start position:0%
different subjects in this state on
 
00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
terms of the department really either
 
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
one not having the staff to dig down
 
00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
into the schools and that's what we're
 
00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
looking for uh Dr Green Nate to try to
 
00:48:59.150 --> 00:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
get more analytics support unfortunately
 
00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
that didn't make it into the budget
 
00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
um and I think too if we look at um
 
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh Edwards for 3101 there's this
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
component in there under the daily
 
00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:14.220 align:start position:0%
physical activity program being required
 
00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:15.540 align:start position:0%
in schools and then there's this
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
component of mental health that's in
 
00:49:20.089 --> 00:49:20.099 align:start position:0%
there I I think that
 
00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
it does give schools leeway but by
 
00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:24.900 align:start position:0%
having it in that physical education
 
00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:27.980 align:start position:0%
piece I think then that kind of cues
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
administrators to think oh I've got to
 
00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
stick it into physical education does it
 
00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:34.260 align:start position:0%
belong with physical education maybe
 
00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:36.660 align:start position:0%
maybe not but uh
 
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
it's kind of um inconsistent as far as
 
00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
where it's placed throughout some of our
 
00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
some of our guidance for for the schools
 
00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
as far as the rules Come Around and then
 
00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:48.900 align:start position:0%
the statute as well so I think
 
00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
clarification representative and then
 
00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
representative if that's what we want if
 
00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:55.500 align:start position:0%
we want to specify what it is that
 
00:49:57.890 --> 00:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
should be taught in the schools then
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
we have to be clear about where we put
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
it and I think that's an issue for this
 
00:50:02.829 --> 00:50:02.839 align:start position:0%
committee yeah
 
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
yeah I understand the and thank you for
 
00:50:07.309 --> 00:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question I understand the
 
00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:11.940 align:start position:0%
issue of curriculum and mandates Etc the
 
00:50:13.609 --> 00:50:13.619 align:start position:0%
question that I have is is the
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
department concerned about the mental
 
00:50:17.569 --> 00:50:17.579 align:start position:0%
health of our students absolutely and
 
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
and how what are the thank you and what
 
00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
are the mechanisms that the department
 
00:50:24.359 --> 00:50:25.670 align:start position:0%
are the mechanisms that the department
uses

00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
uses
 
00:50:28.450 --> 00:50:28.460 align:start position:0%
to gear the mental health
 
00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:31.380 align:start position:0%
of our students and what is the mental
 
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:34.140 align:start position:0%
health right now as we end this school
 
00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
year of our students thank you for that
 
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
question because it gives me in the
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity to kind of tout some of the
 
00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
programs that we are doing and I think
 
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
this is a part of the discussion we also
 
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
had yesterday as far as there's you know
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
a difference between
 
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
mental health education as far as we're
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
educating all of the students on Mental
 
00:50:56.329 --> 00:50:56.339 align:start position:0%
Health how to take care of your mental
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
health how to be aware of that then
 
00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
there's this component of serving those
 
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
acute needs or the needs of students
 
00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
that are presenting with mental health
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
needs and so two different areas
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
um and a lot of our programming right
 
00:51:13.609 --> 00:51:13.619 align:start position:0%
now to do with you know mtssb
 
00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
um youth Mental Health First Aid a lot
 
00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:18.300 align:start position:0%
of our programs so want the office of
 
00:51:20.329 --> 00:51:20.339 align:start position:0%
student wellness as well as the Bureau
 
00:51:22.609 --> 00:51:22.619 align:start position:0%
of special education and instructional
 
00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:24.780 align:start position:0%
support are looking at how do we do
 
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
programming holistically to meet the
 
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
needs of students we want to look at
 
00:51:33.349 --> 00:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
those acute needs mtssb so that the
 
00:51:35.329 --> 00:51:35.339 align:start position:0%
students are getting that tier two and
 
00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
tier three intervention supports getting
 
00:51:40.609 --> 00:51:40.619 align:start position:0%
access to some of those higher level
 
00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
Professional Services that need to be
 
00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:44.700 align:start position:0%
provided by those experts that have that
 
00:51:47.089 --> 00:51:47.099 align:start position:0%
experience in that field in addition to
 
00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:48.900 align:start position:0%
building those resiliency factors
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
because we talk a lot about
 
00:51:51.359 --> 00:51:52.010 align:start position:0%
because we talk a lot about
um

00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:54.300 align:start position:0%
serving acute needs but we have to work
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
on building those resiliency factors and
 
00:51:59.210 --> 00:51:59.220 align:start position:0%
the biggest part when we look at
 
00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
prevention and supporting students
 
00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:03.380 align:start position:0%
mental health is having that connection
 
00:52:06.349 --> 00:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
to community having that connection to
 
00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:08.460 align:start position:0%
being a part of something and so when we
 
00:52:11.089 --> 00:52:11.099 align:start position:0%
look at building programming we just had
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
the fortunate uh experience this morning
 
00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:16.740 align:start position:0%
to have our junior junior ROTC
 
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
from uh down in Hudson talk about how
 
00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
ROTC has impacted the lives of students
 
00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
and how they were able to feel a part of
 
00:52:26.809 --> 00:52:26.819 align:start position:0%
something and now they have leadership
 
00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:29.220 align:start position:0%
skills they have responsibility they
 
00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
want to step up and give back to their
 
00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
community so having those various
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
opportunities holistically for students
 
00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:38.220 align:start position:0%
to be able to choose whether they want
 
00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:41.220 align:start position:0%
to be a part of Equine Therapy or they
 
00:52:44.089 --> 00:52:44.099 align:start position:0%
want to be a part of a sports team or
 
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
they want to be a part of Robotics
 
00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:48.900 align:start position:0%
making those available so that it's not
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
just dependent upon you know being in a
 
00:52:52.849 --> 00:52:52.859 align:start position:0%
larger school district and having access
 
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
to those opportunities so I think we're
 
00:52:57.170 --> 00:52:57.180 align:start position:0%
looking at those resiliency factors the
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
mental health education for tier one or
 
00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
all students and then that MTS is being
 
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
kind of offering that all together
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
because if I look at our covered relief
 
00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:08.940 align:start position:0%
funds it's not just about the academic
 
00:53:11.569 --> 00:53:11.579 align:start position:0%
piece what can we offer for schools to
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
utilize funds for after school before
 
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
school summer programming that are
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
engaging for to students they're active
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
they're they're communicating they're
 
00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
connecting so that those are some
 
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
examples of the multiple programs that
 
00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:27.300 align:start position:0%
we are offering but in our Bureau
 
00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
bureaus we usually as our leadership
 
00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:31.380 align:start position:0%
team get together and look at when we're
 
00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
offering Services when we're doing a
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
contract when we're taking in a grant
 
00:53:38.089 --> 00:53:38.099 align:start position:0%
let's think about holistically how we're
 
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
going to serve all of our student groups
 
00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
because we are seeing and you can weigh
 
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
in on this a little bit more Becky
 
00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:47.220 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of needs for for
 
00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:49.140 align:start position:0%
students and addressing mental health
 
00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:53.049 align:start position:0%
students and addressing mental health
needs

00:53:53.049 --> 00:53:53.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
you know I know that there are there are
 
00:53:57.410 --> 00:53:57.420 align:start position:0%
some who feel
 
00:53:59.690 --> 00:53:59.700 align:start position:0%
that schools should not deal with the
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
social emotional issues of students
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
and how do you respond to those who
 
00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.130 align:start position:0%
and how do you respond to those who
object

00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:07.140 align:start position:0%
object
 
00:54:09.770 --> 00:54:09.780 align:start position:0%
to the issue of schools dealing with the
 
00:54:12.049 --> 00:54:12.059 align:start position:0%
social and emotional issues that some
 
00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
say it that's the parents responsibility
 
00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
that's a family responsibility not the
 
00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:18.660 align:start position:0%
school's responsibility how do you
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
respond to that
 
00:54:23.089 --> 00:54:23.099 align:start position:0%
that that is a tricky one because there
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
are definitely
 
00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:25.190 align:start position:0%
are definitely
um

00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:26.450 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:26.460 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh perspectives on what what should be
 
00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
included and should social emotional
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
health and wellness be offered I think
 
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
that it's the piece about education so
 
00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:37.069 align:start position:0%
that it's the piece about education so
that

00:54:37.069 --> 00:54:37.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:38.809 --> 00:54:38.819 align:start position:0%
um families feel connected to
 
00:54:40.849 --> 00:54:40.859 align:start position:0%
understanding what all those components
 
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
are what is included within that within
 
00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:46.260 align:start position:0%
that social and emotional Wellness piece
 
00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:47.150 align:start position:0%
that social and emotional Wellness piece
um

00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
I I think that it's also important to
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
have constituents involved through the
 
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
process so that when we're looking
 
00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
specifically at
 
00:54:58.010 --> 00:54:58.020 align:start position:0%
um implementing this type of legislation
 
00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:00.900 align:start position:0%
having those voices having the schools
 
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
come in having families and parents come
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
in and talking a little bit about their
 
00:55:07.849 --> 00:55:07.859 align:start position:0%
concerns perhaps if they
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
um have that feeling towards this that
 
00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:14.460 align:start position:0%
they can have that dialogue and and be a
 
00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:16.980 align:start position:0%
part of the process I think that that
 
00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
has been our response because we
 
00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
definitely hear from people that are
 
00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
very supportive people that are very
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
um very concerned and we try to balance
 
00:55:29.809 --> 00:55:29.819 align:start position:0%
both but it really takes all of us to to
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
address the the concerns and provide the
 
00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
education as far as what is included
 
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
when we talk about mental health
 
00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:38.569 align:start position:0%
when we talk about mental health
education

00:55:38.569 --> 00:55:38.579 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:55:40.609 --> 00:55:40.619 align:start position:0%
represent Luna
 
00:55:42.770 --> 00:55:42.780 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and thanks
 
00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:46.140 align:start position:0%
for for taking my question Ms White
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
um when um when when Ms Lewis was was
 
00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
here speaking earlier she um she handed
 
00:55:54.890 --> 00:55:54.900 align:start position:0%
out this
 
00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:57.180 align:start position:0%
um from the UNH Cooperative Extension
 
00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:01.160 align:start position:0%
and on the back of it it says that 36
 
00:56:05.450 --> 00:56:05.460 align:start position:0%
actually says 36 plus reported that
 
00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:07.380 align:start position:0%
their mental health talk about students
 
00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
reported that their mental health was
 
00:56:12.049 --> 00:56:12.059 align:start position:0%
not good quote most of the time or
 
00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
always compared to a national average of
 
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
29 and so it's sort of a two-part part
 
00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:19.010 align:start position:0%
29 and so it's sort of a two-part part
question

00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:19.020 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:22.140 align:start position:0%
um does does that reporting is that
 
00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
reporting consistent with with any data
 
00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
that has been collected by the
 
00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
department and then number two does the
 
00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
fact that that a student reports that
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
their mental health is not good does
 
00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
that um how does that impact their
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
ability to to learn
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
so I think for the first part of the
 
00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
question really the only data that the
 
00:56:50.809 --> 00:56:50.819 align:start position:0%
department has to look at is the youth
 
00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
uh Behavior youth risk behavior survey
 
00:56:55.730 --> 00:56:55.740 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and we've been very vocal
 
00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
about our concerns is that the data from
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
that comes out almost two years after
 
00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:01.980 align:start position:0%
it's administered so we're always
 
00:57:03.650 --> 00:57:03.660 align:start position:0%
looking in our rears when it comes to
 
00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:04.609 align:start position:0%
looking in our rears when it comes to
that

00:57:04.609 --> 00:57:04.619 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:06.770 --> 00:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
um so it's hard to look at you know the
 
00:57:09.309 --> 00:57:09.319 align:start position:0%
2021 results to see how that relates to
 
00:57:12.109 --> 00:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
2023 especially with the past two years
 
00:57:14.450 --> 00:57:14.460 align:start position:0%
of there's been a lot of a lot of change
 
00:57:16.609 --> 00:57:16.619 align:start position:0%
in that short period of time
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
um so that's the the challenge that we
 
00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:21.540 align:start position:0%
do have we don't have access to
 
00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:24.780 align:start position:0%
um serving students directly about that
 
00:57:27.829 --> 00:57:27.839 align:start position:0%
piece but the programs that we sponsor
 
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
the programs that we contract with
 
00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:31.740 align:start position:0%
through vendors through Partnerships
 
00:57:33.170 --> 00:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
through memorandums of understanding
 
00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
with UNH or with the behavioral health
 
00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
institutes they are able to gather some
 
00:57:42.049 --> 00:57:42.059 align:start position:0%
of that that data because they are on
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
the ground working locally in the
 
00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
schools and providing that information
 
00:57:48.049 --> 00:57:48.059 align:start position:0%
um so unfortunately I can't answer
 
00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:50.220 align:start position:0%
specifically it's just like with numbers
 
00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
and data that we've we are seeing
 
00:57:55.849 --> 00:57:55.859 align:start position:0%
increases a lot of it is anecdotal
 
00:57:57.950 --> 00:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
um and that we're hearing
 
00:57:57.960 --> 00:57:59.569 align:start position:0%
um and that we're hearing
um

00:57:59.569 --> 00:57:59.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:03.770 --> 00:58:03.780 align:start position:0%
the second part is
 
00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
when we look at applying for a lot of
 
00:58:09.290 --> 00:58:09.300 align:start position:0%
these federal grants to meet a lot of
 
00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:10.790 align:start position:0%
these federal grants to meet a lot of
the

00:58:10.790 --> 00:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:11.510 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
the programming needs at the local level
 
00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
implementing at the school level it gets
 
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit tricky because we've had
 
00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:19.380 align:start position:0%
this influx of money and now it's
 
00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
starting to dry up a little bit when we
 
00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
look at the funding sources for the
 
00:58:28.010 --> 00:58:28.020 align:start position:0%
Youth Mental Health First Aid we had a a
 
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
robust grant that was able to provide
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
that support and we have that for
 
00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
another year and then it's it's going
 
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
away so we look at okay we are able to
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
provide that Statewide please take
 
00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:39.660 align:start position:0%
advantage of it
 
00:58:42.109 --> 00:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
um but then in a year from now we have
 
00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:43.740 align:start position:0%
to reevaluate and then we have to
 
00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:45.540 align:start position:0%
prioritize so I think that's always in
 
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
the back of our minds is how can we
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
braid multiple sources of funding in
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
order to meet the needs we were lucky
 
00:58:54.650 --> 00:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
enough to get an allocation into hb2
 
00:58:58.730 --> 00:58:58.740 align:start position:0%
specifically for mtssb but again it's
 
00:59:00.589 --> 00:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
that balancing of
 
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
what needs are out there in the schools
 
00:59:04.970 --> 00:59:04.980 align:start position:0%
how can we utilize different ways in
 
00:59:07.970 --> 00:59:07.980 align:start position:0%
order to meet those needs I know that
 
00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:10.260 align:start position:0%
um some of the schools when they offer a
 
00:59:12.049 --> 00:59:12.059 align:start position:0%
youth mental health for State training a
 
00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:13.980 align:start position:0%
district might actually pay for that and
 
00:59:15.589 --> 00:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
then they'll open it up to multiple
 
00:59:18.049 --> 00:59:18.059 align:start position:0%
community members multiple uh Partners
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
in other schools so I think some of the
 
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
data they were talking about you know
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
they could look at specifically what
 
00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
they were offering but what you're
 
00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
seeing in other school districts or
 
00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:28.740 align:start position:0%
other offerings across the state
 
00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:31.140 align:start position:0%
um we may not have those actual numbers
 
00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
but it is widespread as far as how
 
00:59:34.970 --> 00:59:34.980 align:start position:0%
they're reaching out
 
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
Mr Shea I just want to follow up on that
 
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
so I I didn't quite get get an answer on
 
00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
um on on the second uh part so I just
 
00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:46.740 align:start position:0%
want to reframe it a little bit thank
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
you um and and I know you Tim thanks for
 
00:59:52.609 --> 00:59:52.619 align:start position:0%
your your input with regards to Grants
 
00:59:54.289 --> 00:59:54.299 align:start position:0%
and things like that to help improve
 
00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:55.980 align:start position:0%
this but I just want to put this in a
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
little context
 
00:59:59.150 --> 00:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
um currently the state is spending close
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
to 3.5 bit the state all in towns local
 
01:00:06.049 --> 01:00:06.059 align:start position:0%
taxpayers state funding federal grants
 
01:00:08.809 --> 01:00:08.819 align:start position:0%
uh three and a half billion dollars a
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
year to educate 165 000 students across
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
the state and if 36 percent of them are
 
01:00:15.119 --> 01:00:18.309 align:start position:0%
the state and if 36 percent of them are
experiencing

01:00:18.309 --> 01:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.569 --> 01:00:20.579 align:start position:0%
reported that their mental health was
 
01:00:23.809 --> 01:00:23.819 align:start position:0%
not good most of the time or always so
 
01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:27.780 align:start position:0%
one-third of um uh a little over a third
 
01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
so so you know a little over a third of
 
01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:33.049 align:start position:0%
so so you know a little over a third of
167

01:00:33.049 --> 01:00:33.059 align:start position:0%
167
 
01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
000 would be uh somewhere about sixty
 
01:00:38.829 --> 01:00:38.839 align:start position:0%
thousand students across the state
 
01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:42.660 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure that that our our
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
ability to to adequately educate these
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
these students is uh is is you know
 
01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
proceeding forward in a way that's
 
01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
beneficial for the students and
 
01:00:57.049 --> 01:00:57.059 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the investment the 3.5
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
billion dollars a year we spend so if
 
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
we're missing out on a hundred thousand
 
01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
dollar Grant
 
01:01:05.569 --> 01:01:05.579 align:start position:0%
um it would seem to me that we're
 
01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:08.460 align:start position:0%
jeopardizing a significant portion more
 
01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
than a third more than a billion dollars
 
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
of of our own uh investment in in
 
01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
educating kids so so with that as the
 
01:01:19.079 --> 01:01:20.569 align:start position:0%
educating kids so so with that as the
backdrop

01:01:20.569 --> 01:01:20.579 align:start position:0%
backdrop
 
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
um do you see a connection or does the
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
department recognize a connection
 
01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:29.220 align:start position:0%
between the ability of students to learn
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
and what their current mental health
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
um uh condition is
 
01:01:38.890 --> 01:01:38.900 align:start position:0%
I would say absolutely okay thanks
 
01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:43.380 align:start position:0%
and I think it's not just my opinion I
 
01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:46.020 align:start position:0%
think that that most research is shown
 
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
um I have a master's in educational
 
01:01:50.089 --> 01:01:50.099 align:start position:0%
psychology and I think all if I can
 
01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
think back to the many years ago where I
 
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
went through that program that was very
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
much a part of it that's that's good I
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for that because
 
01:01:59.690 --> 01:01:59.700 align:start position:0%
because I think you know I'm not trained
 
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
in this area anecdote I would absolutely
 
01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
agree with what you said because I think
 
01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
it makes it makes um a lot of sense
 
01:02:11.089 --> 01:02:11.099 align:start position:0%
um uh but uh but I think it's important
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
for the committee to hear that based on
 
01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
your professional experience and
 
01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:17.569 align:start position:0%
your professional experience and
training

01:02:17.569 --> 01:02:17.579 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:02:19.730 --> 01:02:19.740 align:start position:0%
um that that there is an indelible
 
01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
linkage between uh between the two and
 
01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:27.180 align:start position:0%
um and and uh and you know if there are
 
01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:29.210 align:start position:0%
um and and uh and you know if there are
roadblocks

01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:29.220 align:start position:0%
roadblocks
 
01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:29.870 align:start position:0%
roadblocks
um

01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:32.940 align:start position:0%
in place that make it difficult for the
 
01:02:34.849 --> 01:02:34.859 align:start position:0%
Department to
 
01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
um to to to to to help
 
01:02:40.849 --> 01:02:40.859 align:start position:0%
um these students learn better whether
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
that's whether that's availability of
 
01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:45.410 align:start position:0%
that's whether that's availability of
non-academic

01:02:45.410 --> 01:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
non-academic
 
01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:48.180 align:start position:0%
um surveys or whether that's funding
 
01:02:50.569 --> 01:02:50.579 align:start position:0%
from the state or federal programs I
 
01:02:53.569 --> 01:02:53.579 align:start position:0%
think it's it's important uh for us to
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
be able to to take a look at how to how
 
01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:57.370 align:start position:0%
be able to to take a look at how to how
to

01:02:57.370 --> 01:02:57.380 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:03:00.829 --> 01:03:00.839 align:start position:0%
eliminate these roadblocks so that we
 
01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
can do a better job for um uh for all of
 
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
our our students and for all of our
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that are spending three and a
 
01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
half billion dollars a year to educate
 
01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:11.450 align:start position:0%
half billion dollars a year to educate
them

01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:11.460 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:03:13.309 --> 01:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna have to leave here in a few
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
moments but uh one of the things we
 
01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:17.220 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten to and maybe perhaps when
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
Jane comes up uh you can be asking these
 
01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
questions I'm concerned about the
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
intervention process that's within the
 
01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:27.780 align:start position:0%
schools uh you may have Rebecca you may
 
01:03:31.630 --> 01:03:31.640 align:start position:0%
have a student that might be having a
 
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
an IEP need and you don't know exactly
 
01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
what realm it is in but obviously
 
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
something's going on in the classroom
 
01:03:42.049 --> 01:03:42.059 align:start position:0%
the child doesn't look like they're
 
01:03:44.210 --> 01:03:44.220 align:start position:0%
achieving so the process the classroom
 
01:03:46.849 --> 01:03:46.859 align:start position:0%
teacher has is do you refer to an
 
01:03:48.289 --> 01:03:48.299 align:start position:0%
intervention team that makes the
 
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
decision not well we're we're going to
 
01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
talk to other teachers had the kid last
 
01:03:53.569 --> 01:03:53.579 align:start position:0%
year or we're going to be talking to
 
01:03:54.770 --> 01:03:54.780 align:start position:0%
some of the Specialists within the
 
01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
building or we're going to go to our
 
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
school counselor our psychologist and
 
01:04:00.530 --> 01:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
and try to discern where do we go do we
 
01:04:02.569 --> 01:04:02.579 align:start position:0%
go special ed do we go to some other
 
01:04:02.579 --> 01:04:03.849 align:start position:0%
go special ed do we go to some other
strategy

01:04:03.849 --> 01:04:03.859 align:start position:0%
strategy
 
01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:07.380 align:start position:0%
do schools out there today have that
 
01:04:10.130 --> 01:04:10.140 align:start position:0%
intervention process in place
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
or is the teacher sort of left stranded
 
01:04:17.089 --> 01:04:17.099 align:start position:0%
in terms of how to deal with this child
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
so for some schools um they would have
 
01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
the multi-tiered systems of support for
 
01:04:24.589 --> 01:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
behavior that um our office of social
 
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
emotional Wellness supports so that
 
01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
would be where they're supporting all
 
01:04:29.690 --> 01:04:29.700 align:start position:0%
students but then they're also looking
 
01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:31.140 align:start position:0%
at those tier two and tier three
 
01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
students but but within that you're also
 
01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
going to have a group of students who
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
would also qualify for special education
 
01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
because mental health is not just a
 
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
special education issue it's it's all
 
01:04:43.309 --> 01:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
students and so you you are going to
 
01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
have a population of students that that
 
01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
have special needs but you're also going
 
01:04:48.049 --> 01:04:48.059 align:start position:0%
to have many more students who do not
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
have special needs I think you have two
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
systems that are trying to work together
 
01:04:54.589 --> 01:04:54.599 align:start position:0%
to determine is it just a mental health
 
01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
issue or does it does it rise to the
 
01:05:00.829 --> 01:05:00.839 align:start position:0%
level of it's also a special education
 
01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
um need that they have to address so you
 
01:05:07.130 --> 01:05:07.140 align:start position:0%
you most schools have teams that they go
 
01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:08.940 align:start position:0%
to that they would refer the student to
 
01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
that would refer that would review all
 
01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
of those that information they review
 
01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
what they did last year what it was like
 
01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
last year they would talk with parents
 
01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:18.780 align:start position:0%
to find out what the student what's
 
01:05:20.089 --> 01:05:20.099 align:start position:0%
going on at home
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
um you would hope that all of those
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
Services would wrap around to support
 
01:05:24.829 --> 01:05:24.839 align:start position:0%
that student and then the team would be
 
01:05:26.569 --> 01:05:26.579 align:start position:0%
able to determine if it's they need some
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
supports through mtssb or no we really
 
01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
need to go to a referral for special
 
01:05:30.119 --> 01:05:31.789 align:start position:0%
need to go to a referral for special
education

01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:34.260 align:start position:0%
um I think what we're finding is that
 
01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
not all schools have the supports they
 
01:05:38.450 --> 01:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
need for the mental health issues and
 
01:05:40.609 --> 01:05:40.619 align:start position:0%
that their only recourse is to go to
 
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
special education so we don't have the
 
01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
supports we need for mental health over
 
01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:47.220 align:start position:0%
here maybe they don't have mtssb or
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
maybe they haven't addressed it in their
 
01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:50.220 align:start position:0%
District so we're going to come to
 
01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:51.839 align:start position:0%
special education because we know they
 
01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
have some of the pieces that will help
 
01:05:55.849 --> 01:05:55.859 align:start position:0%
so I think for us that's where we see an
 
01:05:57.289 --> 01:05:57.299 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of referrals to
 
01:05:58.970 --> 01:05:58.980 align:start position:0%
special education and the number of
 
01:06:01.010 --> 01:06:01.020 align:start position:0%
requests for support for students that
 
01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
we may not have seen before or that may
 
01:06:04.430 --> 01:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
have gone through a different route
 
01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:05.210 align:start position:0%
have gone through a different route
before

01:06:05.210 --> 01:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
how many of the schools have
 
01:06:08.270 --> 01:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
intervention teams which actively
 
01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:10.980 align:start position:0%
involved and have participation from the
 
01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:20.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:06:23.089 --> 01:06:23.099 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna have to leave right now so
 
01:06:25.789 --> 01:06:25.799 align:start position:0%
represent miles going to take over and
 
01:06:30.410 --> 01:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you uh representative Tanner
 
01:06:32.210 --> 01:06:32.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:34.609 --> 01:06:34.619 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to talk a little bit or hear
 
01:06:36.049 --> 01:06:36.059 align:start position:0%
a little bit more about
 
01:06:38.029 --> 01:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
um the teacher preparation part of this
 
01:06:40.849 --> 01:06:40.859 align:start position:0%
uh health education most schools can't
 
01:06:42.770 --> 01:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
afford to hire just a health education
 
01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:44.630 align:start position:0%
afford to hire just a health education
specialist

01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
specialist
 
01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
um that's that's trained in that so
 
01:06:48.829 --> 01:06:48.839 align:start position:0%
oftentimes health education is taught as
 
01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
somebody mentioned before by the school
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
nurse maybe the phys ed teacher
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
um maybe the Science Biology teacher uh
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
sometimes gets roped into teaching
 
01:06:58.799 --> 01:06:59.930 align:start position:0%
sometimes gets roped into teaching
Health

01:06:59.930 --> 01:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
Health
 
01:07:01.549 --> 01:07:01.559 align:start position:0%
um and I'm just wondering what the
 
01:07:01.559 --> 01:07:02.809 align:start position:0%
um and I'm just wondering what the
department

01:07:02.809 --> 01:07:02.819 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
what they see first of all as uh the
 
01:07:08.690 --> 01:07:08.700 align:start position:0%
community colleges are Granite State
 
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
college system uh our University system
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
how how
 
01:07:17.089 --> 01:07:17.099 align:start position:0%
integrated into that is uh with teacher
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
preparation preparation on teaching
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
health or the ability to get a minor in
 
01:07:23.450 --> 01:07:23.460 align:start position:0%
teaching health I know Plymouth
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge Plymouth is the only
 
01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
University that in the state teacher
 
01:07:31.370 --> 01:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
prep that actually gives a certificate
 
01:07:33.410 --> 01:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
of a Bachelor of Science in health
 
01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
education and also professional
 
01:07:38.809 --> 01:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
development whether the department is
 
01:07:41.210 --> 01:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
actually providing
 
01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
um grants or whatever to give money to
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
Local Schools to do professional
 
01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
development in the teaching of health
 
01:07:49.130 --> 01:07:49.140 align:start position:0%
education and Mental Health Service
 
01:07:52.130 --> 01:07:52.140 align:start position:0%
first aid for example even though that's
 
01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
free but the other mental health issues
 
01:07:59.450 --> 01:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
that that need to be addressed in in a
 
01:08:03.049 --> 01:08:03.059 align:start position:0%
health education course outside of just
 
01:08:05.329 --> 01:08:05.339 align:start position:0%
providing their curriculum so teacher
 
01:08:07.010 --> 01:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
prep great thank you for that question
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
so with the teacher preparation programs
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
I can't speak specifically to that
 
01:08:12.770 --> 01:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
because I don't know
 
01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
um actually what uh you know what
 
01:08:17.689 --> 01:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
requirements are as far as different
 
01:08:19.610 --> 01:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
colleges or different programs
 
01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:22.380 align:start position:0%
throughout our state that I think we
 
01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
would have to actually do some sort of
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
analysis or survey in order to to get
 
01:08:29.709 --> 01:08:29.719 align:start position:0%
that specific information
 
01:08:31.729 --> 01:08:31.739 align:start position:0%
with the professional development
 
01:08:34.189 --> 01:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
opportunities at the department level we
 
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
offer those professional development
 
01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
opportunities mostly through the office
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
of Social and emotional Wellness but we
 
01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
do combine those programs with some of
 
01:08:44.329 --> 01:08:44.339 align:start position:0%
the offerings that we do with our covert
 
01:08:46.849 --> 01:08:46.859 align:start position:0%
relief funds title programming
 
01:08:46.859 --> 01:08:47.510 align:start position:0%
relief funds title programming
um

01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
and if a school is specifically looking
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
at doing A needs assessment and wanting
 
01:08:54.169 --> 01:08:54.179 align:start position:0%
to utilize some of their funding in
 
01:08:56.570 --> 01:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
order to support that type of
 
01:08:58.010 --> 01:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
professional development we can help
 
01:09:00.530 --> 01:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
them to kind of figure out how to use
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
their funding in order to do that if
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
they want to bring that specifically
 
01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
into their school I know there was one
 
01:09:08.150 --> 01:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
on just this past week that was one a
 
01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
school that was wanting to bring
 
01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:13.140 align:start position:0%
some sort of leadership training for
 
01:09:16.010 --> 01:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
their students specifically with regards
 
01:09:18.289 --> 01:09:18.299 align:start position:0%
to mental health supports and so we're
 
01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:20.460 align:start position:0%
looking at trying to help them figure
 
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
out how what kind of funding sources
 
01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:23.460 align:start position:0%
they can use in order to do that so I
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
think it's a mixture
 
01:09:27.769 --> 01:09:27.779 align:start position:0%
some components driven by the state
 
01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
level some components driven by the
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
local level as far as they're seeing
 
01:09:32.930 --> 01:09:32.940 align:start position:0%
what their needs are what they want and
 
01:09:35.150 --> 01:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
and getting the buy-in of their teams as
 
01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
far as uh you know how to move forward
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
selecting specific trainings and that
 
01:09:42.890 --> 01:09:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:47.570 --> 01:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
so uh what I'm concerned with is the
 
01:09:49.789 --> 01:09:49.799 align:start position:0%
actual preparation of the person that's
 
01:09:51.789 --> 01:09:51.799 align:start position:0%
going to deliver the health education
 
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
curriculum correct
 
01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:09:57.950 --> 01:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
from my experience which is you know
 
01:09:59.570 --> 01:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
back in the Dark Ages but the
 
01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
professional development uh you know a
 
01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
couple hours on the afternoon or
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
something or a one day thing was more
 
01:10:08.450 --> 01:10:08.460 align:start position:0%
how to incorporate some of the things
 
01:10:11.810 --> 01:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
into whatever you did teach so that or
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
your interaction with students or you
 
01:10:16.729 --> 01:10:16.739 align:start position:0%
know if you were coaching maybe how to
 
01:10:20.330 --> 01:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
handle certain situations but but
 
01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
other than
 
01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
other than that I've seen I've seen and
 
01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
heard in this committee from people
 
01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
testifying some really
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
bad mistakes people have made trying to
 
01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
do their best in teaching health
 
01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:40.140 align:start position:0%
education and with the current
 
01:10:44.110 --> 01:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
climate surrounding teaching right now
 
01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:46.620 align:start position:0%
I think it's really important that we
 
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
support and try to encourage and also
 
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
offer opportunities for people who are
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
teaching health or who have you know the
 
01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
biology teacher that said signs up brand
 
01:10:58.610 --> 01:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
new and they say oh yeah you have to
 
01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
teach nine weeks of Health as well to
 
01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:03.020 align:start position:0%
get this job
 
01:11:06.530 --> 01:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
some some support from the from the
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
Department from our our College systems
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
to offer them uh really ex experience
 
01:11:17.149 --> 01:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
Direction and guidance and instruction
 
01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
on how to instruct health education
 
01:11:22.970 --> 01:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering if if that's
 
01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
something that the department could look
 
01:11:30.770 --> 01:11:30.780 align:start position:0%
into or that might be put on your agenda
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
I think it's something we could you know
 
01:11:34.729 --> 01:11:34.739 align:start position:0%
do A needs assessment do an evaluation
 
01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
it gets tricky and I speak my experience
 
01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
as far as uh just trying to implement
 
01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:46.020 align:start position:0%
the science of reading
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
at the teacher preparation program we
 
01:11:52.610 --> 01:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
have a number of uh you know studies
 
01:11:54.169 --> 01:11:54.179 align:start position:0%
that have been done about signs of
 
01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
reading how you know reading is being
 
01:11:58.010 --> 01:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
taught half of our kids in the state are
 
01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
not reading at grade level even just to
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
Rally around and make change at the
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
higher education level for that
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
component has been significantly
 
01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
challenging so we would really need to
 
01:12:12.169 --> 01:12:12.179 align:start position:0%
have not just the department looking at
 
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
it but it would have to be an effort
 
01:12:17.689 --> 01:12:17.699 align:start position:0%
among multiple constituents our partners
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
in higher education our partners in the
 
01:12:22.490 --> 01:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
community at the community level local
 
01:12:24.169 --> 01:12:24.179 align:start position:0%
education agencies administrators
 
01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
teachers that's something we really need
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
to have buy-in and want and and everyone
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
being on board to working towards
 
01:12:31.970 --> 01:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
improving that it's not something that
 
01:12:34.010 --> 01:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
just the department could could take on
 
01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
and move the needle on it have to be
 
01:12:39.290 --> 01:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
everyone involved
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Milo I'd like
 
01:12:45.649 --> 01:12:45.659 align:start position:0%
if I may go back and follow up on a
 
01:12:47.090 --> 01:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
question about representative lag when
 
01:12:48.169 --> 01:12:48.179 align:start position:0%
he's talking about the intervention
 
01:12:48.179 --> 01:12:49.550 align:start position:0%
he's talking about the intervention
teams

01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
teams
 
01:12:50.930 --> 01:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
um and I think it was referred to you
 
01:12:54.050 --> 01:12:54.060 align:start position:0%
actually uh
 
01:12:55.610 --> 01:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
there is not at the dimension team
 
01:12:55.620 --> 01:12:56.930 align:start position:0%
there is not at the dimension team
present

01:12:56.930 --> 01:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
present
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
um would this come out of the category
 
01:13:00.649 --> 01:13:00.659 align:start position:0%
then of other health issues that's the
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
first and the spare referral and my
 
01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
second question to that would be
 
01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:08.460 align:start position:0%
it was determined that the that the
 
01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:10.980 align:start position:0%
students not succeeding academically
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
because of mental health issues versus
 
01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh skill issue perhaps
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
um what's the next step
 
01:13:21.169 --> 01:13:21.179 align:start position:0%
so yes it could be um under other health
 
01:13:23.090 --> 01:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
impairment if they it is determined that
 
01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
it's impacting them educationally
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
um I think where the
 
01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
where the issue comes in is that um is
 
01:13:33.470 --> 01:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
it is it impacting them to the point
 
01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:34.610 align:start position:0%
it is it impacting them to the point
that

01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
um they need specially designed
 
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
instruction because that's the tenet of
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
special education is you have to have
 
01:13:41.570 --> 01:13:41.580 align:start position:0%
specially designed instruction and what
 
01:13:43.010 --> 01:13:43.020 align:start position:0%
what specially designed instruction
 
01:13:44.990 --> 01:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
would you provide or do they need more
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Services and
 
01:13:49.850 --> 01:13:49.860 align:start position:0%
um how is this is the school even able
 
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
to provide that level of mental health
 
01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
services that they need so that's where
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
you come to
 
01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
um determine is it is it a special
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
education issue or is it a mental health
 
01:14:00.649 --> 01:14:00.659 align:start position:0%
issue that we aren't able to
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
um support this is this has come up a
 
01:14:04.669 --> 01:14:04.679 align:start position:0%
lot when we've talked about the episodes
 
01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
of treatment that was another bill that
 
01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:08.460 align:start position:0%
came to the to this committee this year
 
01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:10.310 align:start position:0%
came to the to this committee this year
was

01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:14:12.110 --> 01:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
um DHHS is trying to support those
 
01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
students with their mental health issues
 
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
but then there's no um then how do we
 
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that they ensure that they
 
01:14:19.610 --> 01:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
access their education and trying to
 
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
support that that way because there's
 
01:14:23.090 --> 01:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
this gap between districts don't have
 
01:14:25.490 --> 01:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
the money to support it but they need
 
01:14:27.050 --> 01:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
this mental health support and the
 
01:14:28.669 --> 01:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
district are trying to support it but
 
01:14:31.490 --> 01:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
just can't so this it's it's a it's
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
convoluted it's hard to explain
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
um but I think districts are trying to
 
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
address it and they address it either
 
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
through special education or they try to
 
01:14:41.209 --> 01:14:41.219 align:start position:0%
address it with um outside agencies but
 
01:14:41.219 --> 01:14:42.110 align:start position:0%
address it with um outside agencies but
not

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
they don't have the resources it hasn't
 
01:14:45.770 --> 01:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
been something that they've been dealing
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
with to this level before
 
01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you sir
 
01:14:52.490 --> 01:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
um to that point then um if we
 
01:14:54.770 --> 01:14:54.780 align:start position:0%
understand that uh even based on a
 
01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
two-year-old data but if we understand
 
01:14:58.250 --> 01:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
that a lot of our youngsters currently
 
01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
in schools have significant uh mental
 
01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
health issues that are impacting their
 
01:15:04.850 --> 01:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
academic performance they may not be
 
01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
special ed particularly until after they
 
01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
go through that identification process
 
01:15:11.689 --> 01:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
is there anything doe is doing
 
01:15:13.729 --> 01:15:13.739 align:start position:0%
um uh or is there anything that their
 
01:15:15.709 --> 01:15:15.719 align:start position:0%
local school I mean school's doing their
 
01:15:17.330 --> 01:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
own little part of things but I thought
 
01:15:20.209 --> 01:15:20.219 align:start position:0%
Theo is doing as a unified approach to
 
01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:23.580 align:start position:0%
we have a mental health crisis amongst a
 
01:15:25.130 --> 01:15:25.140 align:start position:0%
third of our youngsters in high school
 
01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
who may not be need to go in the special
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
ed system and spend a little time and
 
01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:33.900 align:start position:0%
money not being treated well there
 
01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:35.340 align:start position:0%
um no I don't mean this not well you
 
01:15:36.649 --> 01:15:36.659 align:start position:0%
know right that's not the right service
 
01:15:39.470 --> 01:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
there well what what is that next step
 
01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
as a state or as a doe to get this
 
01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
prominent problem addressed because my
 
01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
suspection would be if in fact I don't
 
01:15:51.470 --> 01:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
feel good if I'm not here today as
 
01:15:53.930 --> 01:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
confused I was up earlier this morning
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
um then how the hell can I possibly
 
01:15:59.350 --> 01:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
learn anything in this class yeah
 
01:16:03.189 --> 01:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
so I think that's what um the the
 
01:16:05.630 --> 01:16:05.640 align:start position:0%
legislation in regards to multi-tiered
 
01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
systems of support for behavior that
 
01:16:09.770 --> 01:16:09.780 align:start position:0%
that has where that really kind of arose
 
01:16:11.689 --> 01:16:11.699 align:start position:0%
from and so we are working across the
 
01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
state with implementing mtssb
 
01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:19.140 align:start position:0%
um at the local level so that um schools
 
01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
have our support but then we contract
 
01:16:24.290 --> 01:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
with professionals that can go in and
 
01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
actually implement we have a team
 
01:16:27.470 --> 01:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
in-house that goes into the school
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
specifically and will help them to
 
01:16:31.610 --> 01:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
implement mtssb
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
but the need is so great that they
 
01:16:36.169 --> 01:16:36.179 align:start position:0%
cannot just the small team cannot meet
 
01:16:36.179 --> 01:16:36.950 align:start position:0%
cannot just the small team cannot meet
it

01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:16:38.689 --> 01:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
um so then we contract with other
 
01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
partners to go in and particularly look
 
01:16:44.149 --> 01:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
at some of those more acute some of
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
those more tier three needs and how that
 
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
can then make connections to our
 
01:16:51.050 --> 01:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
community mental health centers and to
 
01:16:53.149 --> 01:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
those type of resources so that the
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
students are getting connected with with
 
01:16:58.630 --> 01:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
those supports so I think mtssb has been
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
the department in the states uh in
 
01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
conjunction also with DHHS on
 
01:17:06.890 --> 01:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
implementing that piece of it DHHS then
 
01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
brings in you know a lot of their
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
wrap-around services and a lot of their
 
01:17:13.010 --> 01:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
supports as well so that we're working
 
01:17:15.410 --> 01:17:15.420 align:start position:0%
in coordination with a lot of it so it
 
01:17:18.229 --> 01:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
is it's a it's a community it's a home
 
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
it's a school all effort for for the
 
01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
students but the mtssb implementation
 
01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
um it takes time it's not something that
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
can be implemented overnight so I mean
 
01:17:32.630 --> 01:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
we continue to work that we continue to
 
01:17:35.330 --> 01:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
leverage resources to offer it and make
 
01:17:38.810 --> 01:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
it more available across the state so
 
01:17:40.689 --> 01:17:40.699 align:start position:0%
thank you both thank you
 
01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:47.270 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
so

01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
a couple things can you speak to how
 
01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
many schools or school systems now have
 
01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
mtssb and then I have another question
 
01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:57.050 align:start position:0%
mtssb and then I have another question
also

01:17:57.050 --> 01:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:17:59.630 --> 01:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
I don't have the specific number but I
 
01:18:01.970 --> 01:18:01.980 align:start position:0%
can get that information to you I don't
 
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
have it on the top of my head excuse me
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
ballpark I mean is it half is it 20
 
01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:07.030 align:start position:0%
ballpark I mean is it half is it 20
percent

01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I'm sorry
 
01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
I would say around 10 to 12 Max percent
 
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
say that again please 10 10 to 12 saus
 
01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
and 12 saus
 
01:18:21.890 --> 01:18:21.900 align:start position:0%
do we have
 
01:18:26.350 --> 01:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
yes how many do we have I guess
 
01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
sausage it fluctuates throughout the
 
01:18:30.169 --> 01:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
year I think we're at 108 last but I
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
think there's a couple switching this so
 
01:18:33.229 --> 01:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
somewhere in there by far the majority
 
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
don't have mtssb they may and that we
 
01:18:37.970 --> 01:18:37.980 align:start position:0%
just haven't I mean collected that
 
01:18:39.410 --> 01:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
information are you implementing it
 
01:18:42.290 --> 01:18:42.300 align:start position:0%
mtssb it may be looking like some sort
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
of other and you know RTI was another
 
01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
one that was similar that's something
 
01:18:48.649 --> 01:18:48.659 align:start position:0%
that I'm familiar with um mtssb is kind
 
01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
of a new iteration of that so they may
 
01:18:51.649 --> 01:18:51.659 align:start position:0%
have an RTI process that they've
 
01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
implemented in theirs what does the
 
01:18:55.850 --> 01:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
acronym stand for or a PBIS process the
 
01:18:58.430 --> 01:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
positive support okay so districts may
 
01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
have mtssb and we're working with that
 
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
10 to 12 through the office of social
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
emotional Wellness but the district
 
01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
could have a PBIS process in place that
 
01:19:09.770 --> 01:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
they developed 10 years ago that deals
 
01:19:11.570 --> 01:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
with behavior or they could have an RTI
 
01:19:13.729 --> 01:19:13.739 align:start position:0%
process that they they began five years
 
01:19:15.169 --> 01:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
ago that helps to deal with that
 
01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
behavior so we're aware of the 10 to 12
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
that work with Kelly's office in this of
 
01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
social emotional Wellness but there are
 
01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
other districts that have different
 
01:19:24.709 --> 01:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
systems in place that we just aren't
 
01:19:26.689 --> 01:19:26.699 align:start position:0%
working with at this point
 
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
do you follow
 
01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:30.229 align:start position:0%
do you follow
well

01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
I don't know it's fault but I have
 
01:19:34.010 --> 01:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
another question so
 
01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:34.970 align:start position:0%
another question so
um

01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
in this way we talked a little bit
 
01:19:39.890 --> 01:19:39.900 align:start position:0%
earlier in this session
 
01:19:41.450 --> 01:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm trying to find my note
 
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
about this here
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
um about the possibility of surveying I
 
01:19:47.630 --> 01:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
think representative cascaden brought
 
01:19:48.890 --> 01:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
this up
 
01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
um what schools are actually doing with
 
01:19:53.630 --> 01:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
mental health education and whether the
 
01:19:57.410 --> 01:19:57.420 align:start position:0%
current rsas are actually being uh
 
01:19:59.930 --> 01:19:59.940 align:start position:0%
accommodated followed
 
01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
and it seems like there's a number of
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
answers to the discussion going along
 
01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:06.910 align:start position:0%
answers to the discussion going along
that

01:20:06.910 --> 01:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:09.770 --> 01:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
suggests need for more survey that we we
 
01:20:12.530 --> 01:20:12.540 align:start position:0%
just plain don't know like a few minutes
 
01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:14.450 align:start position:0%
just plain don't know like a few minutes
ago

01:20:14.450 --> 01:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:15.290 align:start position:0%
ago
um

01:20:15.290 --> 01:20:15.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:17.390 --> 01:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
we don't know how many schools have
 
01:20:19.370 --> 01:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
adequate intervention teams at least
 
01:20:22.010 --> 01:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
that was what I understood I feel like
 
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
we need a pretty thorough look at this
 
01:20:27.410 --> 01:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
is a statement not a question sorry
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:34.630 --> 01:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
representing dry and then representative
 
01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
represent dry and I really apologize
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
um I have to go over to governor and
 
01:20:43.550 --> 01:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
Council for a number of contracts that I
 
01:20:45.770 --> 01:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
have to get approved so I I really don't
 
01:20:48.590 --> 01:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
want to cut anybody off but I'm also
 
01:20:50.689 --> 01:20:50.699 align:start position:0%
very really nervous because I have a
 
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
number of contracts that I want I need
 
01:20:53.209 --> 01:20:53.219 align:start position:0%
to make sure get
 
01:20:56.410 --> 01:20:56.420 align:start position:0%
all right through that approval process
 
01:20:58.130 --> 01:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
can you take one more question
 
01:21:00.169 --> 01:21:00.179 align:start position:0%
representative right sure
 
01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
um one I'll need those acronyms PBIS and
 
01:21:08.209 --> 01:21:08.219 align:start position:0%
rti in a minute and but secondly um
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
just as a mathematician I'm concerned
 
01:21:12.890 --> 01:21:12.900 align:start position:0%
that the only data you have is one
 
01:21:14.810 --> 01:21:14.820 align:start position:0%
survey and I'm wondering if there's more
 
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
real-time things that you're seeing
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
through maybe the empty SSB or things
 
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
that we can you know collate locally or
 
01:21:27.649 --> 01:21:27.659 align:start position:0%
or Statewide that don't necessarily have
 
01:21:29.209 --> 01:21:29.219 align:start position:0%
to depend on one point of information
 
01:21:31.850 --> 01:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
correct so that was a specific survey of
 
01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
the students we were talking about so
 
01:21:34.729 --> 01:21:34.739 align:start position:0%
that question asked about surveying of
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
students and that piece of it I that's
 
01:21:38.810 --> 01:21:38.820 align:start position:0%
where we use the Y RBS because we can't
 
01:21:41.689 --> 01:21:41.699 align:start position:0%
really go in and Survey students we have
 
01:21:43.790 --> 01:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
partners and vendors that we can
 
01:21:45.290 --> 01:21:45.300 align:start position:0%
contract with that can do some of that
 
01:21:47.390 --> 01:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
work at the local level but we at the
 
01:21:49.729 --> 01:21:49.739 align:start position:0%
department can't go in and do that
 
01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
um necessarily with the evaluation of
 
01:21:55.550 --> 01:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
how mtssb has been being implemented
 
01:21:56.810 --> 01:21:56.820 align:start position:0%
across the state we have partnership
 
01:22:00.050 --> 01:22:00.060 align:start position:0%
with Bhai as our evaluator for that so I
 
01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
can send the most recent report which is
 
01:22:05.350 --> 01:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
going to be December of 2022
 
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
on the state of mtssb and implementation
 
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
across the state so I can send that to
 
01:22:15.169 --> 01:22:15.179 align:start position:0%
the committee and then we anticipate
 
01:22:17.630 --> 01:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
having that updated
 
01:22:22.490 --> 01:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
hopefully fall to winter of 2023 to give
 
01:22:25.669 --> 01:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
more even more information on that
 
01:22:28.729 --> 01:22:28.739 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much uh good luck
 
01:22:30.130 --> 01:22:30.140 align:start position:0%
with it
 
01:22:33.290 --> 01:22:33.300 align:start position:0%
the executive Council Jane you want to
 
01:22:34.669 --> 01:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
quickly give you the acronyms that you
 
01:22:36.290 --> 01:22:36.300 align:start position:0%
asked for if you don't mind
 
01:22:38.209 --> 01:22:38.219 align:start position:0%
um so PBIS is part of positive
 
01:22:42.649 --> 01:22:42.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:42.659 --> 01:22:43.790 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
and RTI is response to intervention
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
Jane you want to come forward
 
01:22:57.770 --> 01:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
well Jane's getting upwards mtssb can
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
take years in a district to get into
 
01:23:02.209 --> 01:23:02.219 align:start position:0%
place I know Manchester started with one
 
01:23:05.630 --> 01:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
school in 2020 and seeing how that's
 
01:23:07.729 --> 01:23:07.739 align:start position:0%
going it's going to go into nine schools
 
01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
in this fall and I mean Manchester has
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
23 schools so I think it takes a long
 
01:23:15.530 --> 01:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
time to see how it and it's different in
 
01:23:17.209 --> 01:23:17.219 align:start position:0%
every school the what you have to
 
01:23:19.550 --> 01:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
develop and the resources you provide so
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
you know they may have only 12 that they
 
01:23:26.450 --> 01:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
think are doing it but some places may
 
01:23:28.910 --> 01:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
be doing it one school just to try it
 
01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
first so it's hard to tell
 
01:23:34.270 --> 01:23:34.280 align:start position:0%
uh remember
 
01:23:36.169 --> 01:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
I just wanna
 
01:23:38.330 --> 01:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
close my comment on the front last
 
01:23:40.910 --> 01:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
presentation it's clear to me that we do
 
01:23:44.649 --> 01:23:44.659 align:start position:0%
not have a Statewide Equitable process
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
to help youngsters who have mental
 
01:23:50.689 --> 01:23:50.699 align:start position:0%
health issues in our Public Schools yeah
 
01:23:52.250 --> 01:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
and we're not we're not providing
 
01:23:54.410 --> 01:23:54.420 align:start position:0%
anything it's it's catch and catch can
 
01:23:56.630 --> 01:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
be on each locality
 
01:23:58.970 --> 01:23:58.980 align:start position:0%
um and that that concerns me yeah well I
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
think one of the things that once uh
 
01:24:04.910 --> 01:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
Jane and her group gets through uh is to
 
01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
identify the questions that the
 
01:24:09.649 --> 01:24:09.659 align:start position:0%
committee needs to address and that that
 
01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
clearly is it's one of the questions
 
01:24:13.310 --> 01:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
that needs to be addressed as far as
 
01:24:15.290 --> 01:24:15.300 align:start position:0%
then of what we want to look at when we
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
come back in the fall so as we look at
 
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
these inputs that we're getting this
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
morning I think the goal is once we get
 
01:24:24.110 --> 01:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
through with the final presentation here
 
01:24:25.370 --> 01:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
is to say what are the critical
 
01:24:28.010 --> 01:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
questions that we need to begin to look
 
01:24:30.610 --> 01:24:30.620 align:start position:0%
at so that the resources can be then
 
01:24:33.229 --> 01:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
identified for the for the school so
 
01:24:35.209 --> 01:24:35.219 align:start position:0%
hold that and bring that back okay
 
01:24:37.490 --> 01:24:37.500 align:start position:0%

balcony view of some of the trends that
 
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
we're seeing um from our special ed
 
01:25:30.410 --> 01:25:30.420 align:start position:0%
administrators in regards to mental
 
01:25:32.570 --> 01:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
health in New Hampshire
 
01:25:34.729 --> 01:25:34.739 align:start position:0%
um when it is specifically for the lens
 
01:25:37.850 --> 01:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
of special education and then um have
 
01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for Andra and Jessica to
 
01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:41.750 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for Andra and Jessica to
share

01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
share
 
01:25:43.310 --> 01:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
um some of their experiences but more
 
01:25:45.229 --> 01:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
importantly for you to be able to ask us
 
01:25:48.649 --> 01:25:48.659 align:start position:0%
some questions so just so that you know
 
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
um we've talked a lot about this being a
 
01:25:52.970 --> 01:25:52.980 align:start position:0%
crisis in New Hampshire mental health is
 
01:25:55.370 --> 01:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
certainly a crisis nationally when we
 
01:25:57.709 --> 01:25:57.719 align:start position:0%
talk to our colleagues special ed
 
01:25:59.930 --> 01:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
administrators around the state so it's
 
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
not just a New Hampshire issue it
 
01:26:05.450 --> 01:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
certainly is National and over the past
 
01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:07.980 align:start position:0%
five years we have seen a rapid increase
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
in the number of Children and Youth who
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
are experiencing mental health
 
01:26:14.689 --> 01:26:14.699 align:start position:0%
challenges and some of the challenges
 
01:26:17.810 --> 01:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
are tied to behavior and discipline and
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
yet some are those silent mental health
 
01:26:22.629 --> 01:26:22.639 align:start position:0%
challenges that are more related to
 
01:26:27.290 --> 01:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
anxiety isolation depression and and
 
01:26:29.570 --> 01:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
just removing themselves from wanting to
 
01:26:31.129 --> 01:26:31.139 align:start position:0%
be in the school
 
01:26:34.370 --> 01:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
um environment the numbers of um
 
01:26:36.649 --> 01:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
Children and Youth being referred to
 
01:26:39.050 --> 01:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
special education due to mental health
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
and behavioral challenges has
 
01:26:43.189 --> 01:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
significantly increased in the past
 
01:26:45.229 --> 01:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
three to five years
 
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
and I think um you know our colleagues
 
01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:49.860 align:start position:0%
here can share a little bit more about
 
01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:51.169 align:start position:0%
here can share a little bit more about
that

01:26:51.169 --> 01:26:51.179 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
um and the also the other thing that
 
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
we're seeing is the number
 
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
um and availability of private special
 
01:26:58.910 --> 01:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
education schools
 
01:27:01.490 --> 01:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
um we're having a a big increase in
 
01:27:03.229 --> 01:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
numbers of kids who are being referred
 
01:27:05.570 --> 01:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
to out of district and out of state
 
01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:09.780 align:start position:0%
schools and our in-state programs are
 
01:27:09.780 --> 01:27:10.790 align:start position:0%
schools and our in-state programs are
full

01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
full
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
um and we're seeing more students who
 
01:27:15.169 --> 01:27:15.179 align:start position:0%
are being referred out of state which is
 
01:27:18.290 --> 01:27:18.300 align:start position:0%
is just a shame for us to have to
 
01:27:22.189 --> 01:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
experience that we're also seeing that
 
01:27:24.050 --> 01:27:24.060 align:start position:0%
um you know part of this crisis is the
 
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
the Staffing challenges we've got an
 
01:27:29.090 --> 01:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
increase of kids who are extremely
 
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
complex and we don't have the special
 
01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
education teachers that we need we don't
 
01:27:35.930 --> 01:27:35.940 align:start position:0%
have the school psychologists we don't
 
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
have the social workers
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
um the folks that we need to service
 
01:27:43.010 --> 01:27:43.020 align:start position:0%
these people we just can't get
 
01:27:45.229 --> 01:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
um so that makes the the challenge even
 
01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
even more complex for us here in New
 
01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:49.010 align:start position:0%
even more complex for us here in New
Hampshire

01:27:49.010 --> 01:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:27:51.050 --> 01:27:51.060 align:start position:0%
some of the factors that kind of that
 
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
you know when talking um with the
 
01:27:54.830 --> 01:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
regions around the state
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
um that we see that are connected to
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
this Mental Health crisis is that
 
01:28:01.129 --> 01:28:01.139 align:start position:0%
obviously the impact of covid and the
 
01:28:03.229 --> 01:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
isolation um that that brought to our
 
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
children youth and families the opioid
 
01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:06.950 align:start position:0%
children youth and families the opioid
crisis

01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
um and substance misuse is connected to
 
01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
all of this and it's really having an
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
impact on the Children and Youth um in
 
01:28:16.910 --> 01:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the research is telling
 
01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
us that social media is playing a part
 
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
in this in terms of Mental Health
 
01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a big shift in terms of the
 
01:28:28.850 --> 01:28:28.860 align:start position:0%
family and home situations we're seeing
 
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
more and more students placed in Foster
 
01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:33.410 align:start position:0%
more and more students placed in Foster
placements

01:28:33.410 --> 01:28:33.420 align:start position:0%
placements
 
01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
um very complex kids ending up living
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
with their grandparents who are not
 
01:28:40.669 --> 01:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
always equipped to be able to handle
 
01:28:43.010 --> 01:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
these children who have gone through a
 
01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
lot of trauma we are seeing kids who are
 
01:28:48.970 --> 01:28:48.980 align:start position:0%
very complex with mental health needs
 
01:28:52.129 --> 01:28:52.139 align:start position:0%
moving back and forth between varied
 
01:28:52.139 --> 01:28:53.209 align:start position:0%
moving back and forth between varied
families

01:28:53.209 --> 01:28:53.219 align:start position:0%
families
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
um they're they're pretty mobile so
 
01:28:56.410 --> 01:28:56.420 align:start position:0%
that's another Factor that's really
 
01:29:00.110 --> 01:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
impacting some of this crisis we also
 
01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:01.010 align:start position:0%
impacting some of this crisis we also
see

01:29:01.010 --> 01:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:29:03.709 --> 01:29:03.719 align:start position:0%
um you know a lot of inequities in terms
 
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
of our school systems in terms of
 
01:29:08.330 --> 01:29:08.340 align:start position:0%
resources and supports and interventions
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
to be dealing with this
 
01:29:13.010 --> 01:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
the other piece of this um that I think
 
01:29:15.470 --> 01:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
we've heard over and over is the the
 
01:29:17.330 --> 01:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
silos and the lack of intersection
 
01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
between our education system our Mental
 
01:29:22.209 --> 01:29:22.219 align:start position:0%
Health Systems
 
01:29:26.090 --> 01:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
DHHS our department of Ed we're all kind
 
01:29:28.490 --> 01:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
of working in silos we all have our own
 
01:29:31.370 --> 01:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
resources and it's very difficult
 
01:29:33.709 --> 01:29:33.719 align:start position:0%
um for the integration which is really
 
01:29:36.649 --> 01:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
critical when we think about this crisis
 
01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of solutions there is no Silver
 
01:29:42.590 --> 01:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
Bullet for sure we need to have you know
 
01:29:45.770 --> 01:29:45.780 align:start position:0%
more systemic interventions we need more
 
01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
support and training for our staff we
 
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
need staff and the resources as we just
 
01:29:54.169 --> 01:29:54.179 align:start position:0%
heard uh Patty talking a few minutes ago
 
01:29:56.930 --> 01:29:56.940 align:start position:0%
multi-tiered systems of support is a
 
01:29:56.940 --> 01:29:58.189 align:start position:0%
multi-tiered systems of support is a
systemic

01:29:58.189 --> 01:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
systemic
 
01:30:00.350 --> 01:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
um initiative it takes three to five
 
01:30:02.810 --> 01:30:02.820 align:start position:0%
years you need the staff you need the
 
01:30:04.850 --> 01:30:04.860 align:start position:0%
resources and you need the interventions
 
01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to really wrap around kids to
 
01:30:10.610 --> 01:30:10.620 align:start position:0%
be able to pull that off
 
01:30:13.390 --> 01:30:13.400 align:start position:0%
so today in our schools we're seeing
 
01:30:17.169 --> 01:30:17.179 align:start position:0%
really really complex kids with really
 
01:30:19.129 --> 01:30:19.139 align:start position:0%
significant challenges that we have
 
01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
never seen before our teachers need to
 
01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
be able to have the support and training
 
01:30:27.050 --> 01:30:27.060 align:start position:0%
to be able to deal with that
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
um you know it's actually starting to
 
01:30:31.850 --> 01:30:31.860 align:start position:0%
create a wedge between General and
 
01:30:34.010 --> 01:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
special ed our general Ed folks just
 
01:30:35.810 --> 01:30:35.820 align:start position:0%
feel as though they're not equipped
 
01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
they're not ready and and many of the
 
01:30:40.010 --> 01:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
students you know are referred to
 
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
special education because that's where
 
01:30:44.689 --> 01:30:44.699 align:start position:0%
they can get the help and the support
 
01:30:46.970 --> 01:30:46.980 align:start position:0%
um so we it really needs to be addressed
 
01:30:50.570 --> 01:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
as an as a state as a entire uh
 
01:30:53.090 --> 01:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
community of all of us if we're going to
 
01:30:55.490 --> 01:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
move forward so from the balcony those
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
are some of the trends and patterns that
 
01:31:00.350 --> 01:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
we're seeing across the state
 
01:31:03.050 --> 01:31:03.060 align:start position:0%
um and before I turn it over to my
 
01:31:05.209 --> 01:31:05.219 align:start position:0%
colleagues would it open up any
 
01:31:07.129 --> 01:31:07.139 align:start position:0%
questions if you would have them
 
01:31:07.139 --> 01:31:08.209 align:start position:0%
questions if you would have them
hmm

01:31:08.209 --> 01:31:08.219 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
01:31:10.090 --> 01:31:10.100 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:31:12.890 --> 01:31:12.900 align:start position:0%
thank you I just have a question um you
 
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
asked about or you mentioned the um
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
mental health being not just a New
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire issue but a national issue are
 
01:31:21.050 --> 01:31:21.060 align:start position:0%
the Staffing challenges also a national
 
01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:22.189 align:start position:0%
the Staffing challenges also a national
issue

01:31:22.189 --> 01:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:24.719 align:start position:0%
especially in special education yes when
 
01:31:27.950 --> 01:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
we talk nationally to our colleagues um
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a huge Challenge and because
 
01:31:32.930 --> 01:31:32.940 align:start position:0%
our student populations are becoming so
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
complex and the resources aren't always
 
01:31:36.239 --> 01:31:37.370 align:start position:0%
complex and the resources aren't always
there

01:31:37.370 --> 01:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:31:39.410 --> 01:31:39.420 align:start position:0%
a lot of people aren't going into the
 
01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
field of special education we talk to
 
01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
our Institutes of higher ed
 
01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
and I'll just use Keen for example you
 
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
know historically they would have
 
01:31:49.970 --> 01:31:49.980 align:start position:0%
graduated over a hundred special
 
01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
education teachers this year was around
 
01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:54.290 align:start position:0%
education teachers this year was around
15.

01:31:54.290 --> 01:31:54.300 align:start position:0%
15.
 
01:31:57.169 --> 01:31:57.179 align:start position:0%
um so we're not we're just not getting
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
people to go into the field because it
 
01:32:03.189 --> 01:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Drive
 
01:32:08.110 --> 01:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:32:11.209 --> 01:32:11.219 align:start position:0%
how would we measure success if we you
 
01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
know as we attack these different
 
01:32:16.370 --> 01:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
problems I mean we give money for sport
 
01:32:17.810 --> 01:32:17.820 align:start position:0%
and training how would we measure that
 
01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
that's the place where we know our
 
01:32:21.290 --> 01:32:21.300 align:start position:0%
money's making making good progress or
 
01:32:23.390 --> 01:32:23.400 align:start position:0%
systemic intervention or any of those
 
01:32:25.729 --> 01:32:25.739 align:start position:0%
categories you just listed and I'm going
 
01:32:27.890 --> 01:32:27.900 align:start position:0%
to turn it to my colleagues you know I
 
01:32:30.590 --> 01:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
would just say generally if there is a
 
01:32:32.510 --> 01:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
solid multi-tiered system of support
 
01:32:34.610 --> 01:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
there is a data collection system
 
01:32:37.370 --> 01:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
attached to it and it would tell you all
 
01:32:40.129 --> 01:32:40.139 align:start position:0%
kinds of decreases or increases in
 
01:32:40.139 --> 01:32:41.950 align:start position:0%
kinds of decreases or increases in
behaviors

01:32:41.950 --> 01:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
behaviors
 
01:32:44.209 --> 01:32:44.219 align:start position:0%
decreases in referrals to special
 
01:32:46.610 --> 01:32:46.620 align:start position:0%
education but I'll let you guys speak
 
01:32:48.110 --> 01:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
more to that because you live it every
 
01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:50.890 align:start position:0%
more to that because you live it every
day

01:32:50.890 --> 01:32:50.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:54.590 --> 01:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
okay I would say one of my first
 
01:32:56.990 --> 01:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
um pieces that I would look for is for
 
01:32:59.510 --> 01:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
our special education numbers to fit
 
01:33:02.750 --> 01:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
into what the standards said should be
 
01:33:04.550 --> 01:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
right so I would refer to the tier one
 
01:33:07.669 --> 01:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
two two tier three system and
 
01:33:09.410 --> 01:33:09.420 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure some of you have seen the
 
01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
triangle of supports that the majority
 
01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
of your kiddos should fall into that
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
tier one system right and then your tier
 
01:33:17.090 --> 01:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
two you have a little bit bigger or
 
01:33:19.550 --> 01:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
smaller of a chunk and then only one to
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
three percent of your population should
 
01:33:24.169 --> 01:33:24.179 align:start position:0%
fall into that tier three intervention
 
01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
system and support So a measure of
 
01:33:30.169 --> 01:33:30.179 align:start position:0%
success for I would use for myself in my
 
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
districts is if we aligned more so where
 
01:33:37.550 --> 01:33:37.560 align:start position:0%
that tier three data says we should
 
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
align that to me would mean our systems
 
01:33:41.330 --> 01:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
are working and our supports are working
 
01:33:43.010 --> 01:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
for our kids
 
01:33:44.930 --> 01:33:44.940 align:start position:0%
um and I think to mirror what Jane had
 
01:33:46.430 --> 01:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
just said was that if our special
 
01:33:49.729 --> 01:33:49.739 align:start position:0%
education referrals were to be at what I
 
01:33:52.669 --> 01:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
would consider more typical
 
01:33:55.189 --> 01:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
um just for one example one of our
 
01:33:57.410 --> 01:33:57.420 align:start position:0%
programs in our district had over 50
 
01:33:59.209 --> 01:33:59.219 align:start position:0%
special education referrals this year
 
01:34:02.629 --> 01:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
which is astronomical
 
01:34:02.639 --> 01:34:06.950 align:start position:0%
which is astronomical
foreign

01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:10.729 --> 01:34:10.739 align:start position:0%
yeah I I had um heard a stat recently
 
01:34:13.790 --> 01:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
that um our tier three is about 10 right
 
01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
now so that's kind of where you would
 
01:34:18.290 --> 01:34:18.300 align:start position:0%
Benchmark it off of that and move
 
01:34:21.530 --> 01:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
towards that one to three percent
 
01:34:24.110 --> 01:34:24.120 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
01:34:26.450 --> 01:34:26.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:28.669 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

01:34:28.669 --> 01:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
could you comment further on
 
01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
students being referred into special
 
01:34:38.450 --> 01:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
education for mental health services
 
01:34:38.460 --> 01:34:40.669 align:start position:0%
education for mental health services
that

01:34:40.669 --> 01:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:44.090 --> 01:34:44.100 align:start position:0%
and correct me if I'm wrong here
 
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
yeah it sounded to me like these are
 
01:34:47.570 --> 01:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
referrals that would not conventionally
 
01:34:49.610 --> 01:34:49.620 align:start position:0%
have been special education referrals
 
01:34:51.169 --> 01:34:51.179 align:start position:0%
but because of the lack of services
 
01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
being otherwise available
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
a student who would not generally have
 
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
been considered needing special ed
 
01:35:00.649 --> 01:35:00.659 align:start position:0%
services is getting
 
01:35:02.209 --> 01:35:02.219 align:start position:0%
inferred in that way
 
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
is that correct and could you comment
 
01:35:05.570 --> 01:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
further on that do you want to speak
 
01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:07.010 align:start position:0%
further on that do you want to speak
today

01:35:07.010 --> 01:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:35:09.709 --> 01:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
that that's true it's that we it's
 
01:35:11.570 --> 01:35:11.580 align:start position:0%
because of the lack of services I mean
 
01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
we have kids that are on wait list for
 
01:35:16.250 --> 01:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
two three years for counseling services
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
and that those counseling services in
 
01:35:22.010 --> 01:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
order for them to get bumped up in the
 
01:35:24.050 --> 01:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
system they have to
 
01:35:27.229 --> 01:35:27.239 align:start position:0%
um you know I had a kid who had to go
 
01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
sit in Concord Hospital for 10 days to
 
01:35:33.110 --> 01:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
get bumped up on that list to get the
 
01:35:35.689 --> 01:35:35.699 align:start position:0%
support that he's needed for two years
 
01:35:40.370 --> 01:35:40.380 align:start position:0%
so and and still ended up discharging
 
01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
because he was okay right
 
01:35:45.050 --> 01:35:45.060 align:start position:0%
and didn't get those further supports
 
01:35:46.669 --> 01:35:46.679 align:start position:0%
but is bumped up on the wait list at
 
01:35:48.410 --> 01:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
least so I guess something was
 
01:35:50.570 --> 01:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
accomplished within those 10 days
 
01:35:52.729 --> 01:35:52.739 align:start position:0%
you know I'd say to add on to that
 
01:35:52.739 --> 01:35:53.930 align:start position:0%
you know I'd say to add on to that
um

01:35:53.930 --> 01:35:53.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know we've got a significant amount
 
01:36:01.010 --> 01:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
of kids who need therapeutic supports
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
that schools don't necessarily have
 
01:36:05.629 --> 01:36:05.639 align:start position:0%
those types of counselors on board right
 
01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
that would be like your Riverbend Mental
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
Health Center that has those kind of
 
01:36:10.729 --> 01:36:10.739 align:start position:0%
counselors involved and I think families
 
01:36:14.090 --> 01:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
feel hopeless sometimes and want their
 
01:36:16.189 --> 01:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
kids needs met because they see what
 
01:36:18.830 --> 01:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
goes on at home sometimes we have extra
 
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
supports at school that we may not
 
01:36:22.669 --> 01:36:22.679 align:start position:0%
always see the same things that parents
 
01:36:24.050 --> 01:36:24.060 align:start position:0%
are seeing at home the kid may fall
 
01:36:26.149 --> 01:36:26.159 align:start position:0%
apart at home but is able to maintain
 
01:36:27.410 --> 01:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
during the school day because they've
 
01:36:30.110 --> 01:36:30.120 align:start position:0%
got dozens dozens of adult supports or
 
01:36:31.490 --> 01:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
other services they might be getting
 
01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
through a 504 instead of an IEP so I
 
01:36:37.669 --> 01:36:37.679 align:start position:0%
think sometimes families feel helpless
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
and maybe teachers do as well and so
 
01:36:41.689 --> 01:36:41.699 align:start position:0%
that adds into those referrals because
 
01:36:43.850 --> 01:36:43.860 align:start position:0%
they know they need something and they
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
figure maybe we can try special
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
education and maybe that will give us
 
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
something I will say I tallied up our
 
01:36:52.850 --> 01:36:52.860 align:start position:0%
number of emotional disturbance
 
01:36:57.229 --> 01:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
identifications which have gone higher
 
01:36:59.770 --> 01:36:59.780 align:start position:0%
in the last sample Years and we're at 46
 
01:37:03.310 --> 01:37:03.320 align:start position:0%
which is a very high number for kids
 
01:37:06.169 --> 01:37:06.179 align:start position:0%
identified as having an emotional
 
01:37:09.050 --> 01:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
disturbance or disability
 
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:14.870 align:start position:0%
 
if

01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:37:18.050 --> 01:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
Statewide we were to
 
01:37:20.030 --> 01:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
have more comprehensive mental health
 
01:37:22.910 --> 01:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
education built into the curriculum
 
01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
vigorously and
 
01:37:27.770 --> 01:37:27.780 align:start position:0%
you know starting from a young grade
 
01:37:27.780 --> 01:37:28.729 align:start position:0%
you know starting from a young grade
level

01:37:28.729 --> 01:37:28.739 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
would you see that changing some of this
 
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
over time in other words would there
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
potentially be less students who have
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:41.570 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:37:41.570 --> 01:37:41.580 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:37:41.580 --> 01:37:42.729 align:start position:0%
okay
yeah

01:37:42.729 --> 01:37:42.739 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:37:46.010 --> 01:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
I'll hit a knee-jerk reaction answer I
 
01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:46.729 align:start position:0%
I'll hit a knee-jerk reaction answer I
guess

01:37:46.729 --> 01:37:46.739 align:start position:0%
guess
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
um and then maybe Jane you can fill in
 
01:37:50.450 --> 01:37:50.460 align:start position:0%
where I need but
 
01:37:52.010 --> 01:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
I think that's only one piece of the
 
01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:53.510 align:start position:0%
I think that's only one piece of the
puzzle

01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
puzzle
 
01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
um yes that would be helpful but I think
 
01:37:58.610 --> 01:37:58.620 align:start position:0%
there's a bigger picture of better
 
01:38:00.430 --> 01:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
communication and collaboration between
 
01:38:03.890 --> 01:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
mental health providers doctor's office
 
01:38:06.890 --> 01:38:06.900 align:start position:0%
or primary care physicians and schools
 
01:38:09.709 --> 01:38:09.719 align:start position:0%
that is currently missing or lacking
 
01:38:12.770 --> 01:38:12.780 align:start position:0%
that needs better alignment
 
01:38:16.570 --> 01:38:16.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:18.790 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:38:18.790 --> 01:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:38:21.169 --> 01:38:21.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
um I like the sound of that so
 
01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:25.450 align:start position:0%
um I like the sound of that so
um

01:38:25.450 --> 01:38:25.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:29.450 --> 01:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
so what what I'm hearing is that is that
 
01:38:31.850 --> 01:38:31.860 align:start position:0%
special ed referrals
 
01:38:33.770 --> 01:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
from from
 
01:38:35.410 --> 01:38:35.420 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
mtssb or or other programs that may be
 
01:38:40.250 --> 01:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
in the school are happening because
 
01:38:43.850 --> 01:38:43.860 align:start position:0%
other resources are not available is it
 
01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
I would say so I mean I think that there
 
01:38:52.729 --> 01:38:52.739 align:start position:0%
that everyone's grasping for straws at
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
once they reach that level they're
 
01:38:55.970 --> 01:38:55.980 align:start position:0%
grasping for straws they're just trying
 
01:38:57.770 --> 01:38:57.780 align:start position:0%
to get something
 
01:39:00.410 --> 01:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
and special ed has a system that's in
 
01:39:02.570 --> 01:39:02.580 align:start position:0%
place so that's something that they can
 
01:39:04.729 --> 01:39:04.739 align:start position:0%
land on okay and then and that's my
 
01:39:07.250 --> 01:39:07.260 align:start position:0%
follow-up on this so what does special
 
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
Edge I mean I think of special education
 
01:39:14.510 --> 01:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
as IEPs and meetings with families and
 
01:39:17.629 --> 01:39:17.639 align:start position:0%
and with principal and and
 
01:39:17.639 --> 01:39:18.590 align:start position:0%
and with principal and and
um

01:39:18.590 --> 01:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:21.649 --> 01:39:21.659 align:start position:0%
um how does special education get
 
01:39:26.270 --> 01:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
involved as a surrogate for for um for
 
01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
other you know uh uh you know
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
therapeutic or or services and and how
 
01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
does special education effectively help
 
01:39:39.770 --> 01:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
the the student
 
01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:41.030 align:start position:0%
the the student
um

01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:43.090 --> 01:39:43.100 align:start position:0%
effectively help the student
 
01:39:43.100 --> 01:39:45.310 align:start position:0%
effectively help the student
commits

01:39:45.310 --> 01:39:45.320 align:start position:0%
commits
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
we know in in special education in order
 
01:39:50.270 --> 01:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
for a child to have an IEP there's a
 
01:39:52.610 --> 01:39:52.620 align:start position:0%
specific process and legal timelines and
 
01:39:55.070 --> 01:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
we have to go through all of this and
 
01:39:57.950 --> 01:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
and the students that we're seeing being
 
01:40:02.090 --> 01:40:02.100 align:start position:0%
referred do have significant mental
 
01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
health and behavioral challenges and we
 
01:40:06.770 --> 01:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
really rely a lot on our school
 
01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:08.450 align:start position:0%
really rely a lot on our school
psychologists

01:40:08.450 --> 01:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
psychologists
 
01:40:10.129 --> 01:40:10.139 align:start position:0%
um they're you know take the lead in
 
01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
doing these evaluations and it's the
 
01:40:15.709 --> 01:40:15.719 align:start position:0%
team that decides whether or not
 
01:40:17.450 --> 01:40:17.460 align:start position:0%
um the child's disability is really
 
01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:19.070 align:start position:0%
um the child's disability is really
impacting

01:40:19.070 --> 01:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
impacting
 
01:40:21.890 --> 01:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
um their ability to learn and in most of
 
01:40:24.250 --> 01:40:24.260 align:start position:0%
these cases the disability is
 
01:40:26.990 --> 01:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
drastically impacting the child's
 
01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
ability to learn if there were more
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
resources maybe they wouldn't have
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
gotten to that point
 
01:40:36.110 --> 01:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
um and so you know that
 
01:40:38.330 --> 01:40:38.340 align:start position:0%
logistically and legally they meet all
 
01:40:40.850 --> 01:40:40.860 align:start position:0%
the requirements and they get an IEP
 
01:40:43.610 --> 01:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
um so that's basically how it how it
 
01:40:46.669 --> 01:40:46.679 align:start position:0%
happens does that help it well it'll
 
01:40:48.649 --> 01:40:48.659 align:start position:0%
follow up on let me follow up on you on
 
01:40:52.610 --> 01:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
your questions yeah so so the the query
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
I would have the following uh David's
 
01:40:56.590 --> 01:40:56.600 align:start position:0%
question was
 
01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
how do you ensure that special education
 
01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
services don't become a Dumping Ground
 
01:41:08.030 --> 01:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
for other emotional issues that may have
 
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
I mean that's I think it's kind of
 
01:41:11.870 --> 01:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
related I think that's absolutely
 
01:41:14.270 --> 01:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
related and I think the other related uh
 
01:41:17.149 --> 01:41:17.159 align:start position:0%
thing is is is special education
 
01:41:17.159 --> 01:41:19.010 align:start position:0%
thing is is is special education
services

01:41:19.010 --> 01:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
um uh directed towards treating the
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
mental health condition or modifying the
 
01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
education program to line up with the I
 
01:41:32.149 --> 01:41:32.159 align:start position:0%
mean the disa yeah to line up with the
 
01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
disability because to me that doesn't
 
01:41:38.030 --> 01:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
sound like the optimal solution here I
 
01:41:39.649 --> 01:41:39.659 align:start position:0%
mean it's mental health is different
 
01:41:41.649 --> 01:41:41.659 align:start position:0%
right than physical and and
 
01:41:44.090 --> 01:41:44.100 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
is that it can be until it manifests
 
01:41:49.370 --> 01:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
itself to a point of that right right
 
01:41:52.430 --> 01:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
that point is that you know if we had
 
01:41:55.370 --> 01:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
had the availability or collaboration of
 
01:41:57.590 --> 01:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
services from outside providers or
 
01:42:00.229 --> 01:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
additional Services in-house that could
 
01:42:01.970 --> 01:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
have treated that student through the
 
01:42:04.490 --> 01:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
mtss system or the tiered intervention
 
01:42:06.590 --> 01:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
system that schools have in place prior
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
to that it wouldn't have manifested
 
01:42:10.729 --> 01:42:10.739 align:start position:0%
itself to the point of a significant
 
01:42:13.490 --> 01:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
disability in the classroom setting and
 
01:42:16.189 --> 01:42:16.199 align:start position:0%
I think that goes right to Mills yeah
 
01:42:18.890 --> 01:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that another thing to it
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
goes back to the Staffing issue is that
 
01:42:23.629 --> 01:42:23.639 align:start position:0%
all of our school psychologists are
 
01:42:25.609 --> 01:42:25.619 align:start position:0%
testing all day long and they're not
 
01:42:27.890 --> 01:42:27.900 align:start position:0%
able to provide that tr2 or tier 3
 
01:42:29.930 --> 01:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
support that they're also in schools for
 
01:42:32.090 --> 01:42:32.100 align:start position:0%
because they're only one person and
 
01:42:34.370 --> 01:42:34.380 align:start position:0%
they're doing all this testing because
 
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
of all the referrals and so that they
 
01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
don't have the time to spend it with the
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
kids providing those intervention
 
01:42:43.250 --> 01:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
providing those preventative Services
 
01:42:46.189 --> 01:42:46.199 align:start position:0%
so that goes back to that staff
 
01:42:48.410 --> 01:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
I think one thing I wanted to add on
 
01:42:50.450 --> 01:42:50.460 align:start position:0%
from I think your
 
01:42:52.609 --> 01:42:52.619 align:start position:0%
um question earlier is like what's
 
01:42:56.750 --> 01:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
special about special ed it really
 
01:42:59.149 --> 01:42:59.159 align:start position:0%
it's a wrap around that's when you get
 
01:43:01.010 --> 01:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
the outside providers involved that's
 
01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:02.719 align:start position:0%
when you get that more collaborative
 
01:43:05.990 --> 01:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
small group individualized attention for
 
01:43:08.689 --> 01:43:08.699 align:start position:0%
these kids who need these things
 
01:43:08.699 --> 01:43:09.890 align:start position:0%
these kids who need these things
um

01:43:09.890 --> 01:43:09.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:12.350 --> 01:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
including Mental Health primary care
 
01:43:16.430 --> 01:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
physicians dcyf other agencies that
 
01:43:18.370 --> 01:43:18.380 align:start position:0%
maybe could help or are involved already
 
01:43:21.530 --> 01:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
special ed is kind of that piece where
 
01:43:23.090 --> 01:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
you're forced to get all those people
 
01:43:25.370 --> 01:43:25.380 align:start position:0%
together which really makes a difference
 
01:43:27.530 --> 01:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
for a lot of these kids
 
01:43:29.450 --> 01:43:29.460 align:start position:0%
represent Woodcock and representative
 
01:43:30.770 --> 01:43:30.780 align:start position:0%
blakis next
 
01:43:33.530 --> 01:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman hey two questions one
 
01:43:36.290 --> 01:43:36.300 align:start position:0%
written notices showing uh
 
01:43:38.330 --> 01:43:38.340 align:start position:0%
um the school psychologist
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
um to me it's sort of like a misnomer
 
01:43:41.330 --> 01:43:41.340 align:start position:0%
everyone here you have a school
 
01:43:44.510 --> 01:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
psychologist yet I'm here you're saying
 
01:43:47.390 --> 01:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
what I have seen for the end of the
 
01:43:48.770 --> 01:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
visit a while
 
01:43:51.010 --> 01:43:51.020 align:start position:0%
um that they're testing evaluation
 
01:43:53.149 --> 01:43:53.159 align:start position:0%
mechanism they're not a service
 
01:43:54.830 --> 01:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
mechanism they're not a therapeutic
 
01:43:56.810 --> 01:43:56.820 align:start position:0%
medicine for the most part particularly
 
01:43:57.950 --> 01:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
now with the number of folks you have
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
come into the system is that would that
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
be accurate well they're there to
 
01:44:03.649 --> 01:44:03.659 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to provide all those
 
01:44:07.189 --> 01:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
services but but the priority of need is
 
01:44:09.169 --> 01:44:09.179 align:start position:0%
becoming the testing yes testing
 
01:44:10.970 --> 01:44:10.980 align:start position:0%
evaluations take a term that okay father
 
01:44:12.530 --> 01:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
I think this is true
 
01:44:15.290 --> 01:44:15.300 align:start position:0%
um the second part was
 
01:44:18.050 --> 01:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
and and I'm not selling to use the word
 
01:44:19.609 --> 01:44:19.619 align:start position:0%
dumping and I don't think dumping is the
 
01:44:23.209 --> 01:44:23.219 align:start position:0%
correctly session word but my concern is
 
01:44:26.689 --> 01:44:26.699 align:start position:0%
that uh as Jane said that the general
 
01:44:29.450 --> 01:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
education population of faculty
 
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
don't have the capacity or skills
 
01:44:33.709 --> 01:44:33.719 align:start position:0%
uh and then you take the behavior
 
01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
disorders and throw them in the regular
 
01:44:39.169 --> 01:44:39.179 align:start position:0%
classroom uh it makes it more difficult
 
01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm thinking and if I'm wrong
 
01:44:43.669 --> 01:44:43.679 align:start position:0%
please sorry so I'll go down the wrong
 
01:44:46.490 --> 01:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
track here but the numbers of uh mental
 
01:44:48.290 --> 01:44:48.300 align:start position:0%
health issues that we're seeing migrate
 
01:44:50.930 --> 01:44:50.940 align:start position:0%
to the top now a significantly higher in
 
01:44:52.129 --> 01:44:52.139 align:start position:0%
the last say two or three or four years
 
01:44:53.450 --> 01:44:53.460 align:start position:0%
the last two or three years particularly
 
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh than over the last five or ten years
 
01:44:57.470 --> 01:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
would that would that be a fair
 
01:44:57.480 --> 01:44:59.570 align:start position:0%
would that would that be a fair
assessment

01:44:59.570 --> 01:44:59.580 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
01:45:01.669 --> 01:45:01.679 align:start position:0%
if that's accurate then should we stop
 
01:45:05.689 --> 01:45:05.699 align:start position:0%
thinking on a wider scope of maybe the
 
01:45:08.689 --> 01:45:08.699 align:start position:0%
schools schools as a as a as a teaching
 
01:45:11.450 --> 01:45:11.460 align:start position:0%
learning student body program have to
 
01:45:13.729 --> 01:45:13.739 align:start position:0%
start looking at providing Mental Health
 
01:45:17.450 --> 01:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
Services for students uh I mean our
 
01:45:18.709 --> 01:45:18.719 align:start position:0%
guidance counselor for the most part
 
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
aren't from my perspective and those
 
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:21.719 align:start position:0%
respect to guidance also on the
 
01:45:21.719 --> 01:45:22.790 align:start position:0%
respect to guidance also on the
committee

01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:45:24.890 --> 01:45:24.900 align:start position:0%
um I trained in significant mental
 
01:45:27.229 --> 01:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
health issues uh the depth of the
 
01:45:28.850 --> 01:45:28.860 align:start position:0%
problems in order to have the sufficient
 
01:45:30.410 --> 01:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
numbers in the schools to deal with that
 
01:45:33.410 --> 01:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
so Martin if if maybe we need to start
 
01:45:35.149 --> 01:45:35.159 align:start position:0%
looking at a different model of bringing
 
01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh Community Mental Health types of
 
01:45:41.450 --> 01:45:41.460 align:start position:0%
services into the schools not abandoning
 
01:45:42.649 --> 01:45:42.659 align:start position:0%
them because they surely have full of
 
01:45:44.090 --> 01:45:44.100 align:start position:0%
what they're doing right now but I mean
 
01:45:45.770 --> 01:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
as a part of the school system and maybe
 
01:45:47.930 --> 01:45:47.940 align:start position:0%
relooking how he staffs kids
 
01:45:49.970 --> 01:45:49.980 align:start position:0%
particularly during this crisis period
 
01:45:52.010 --> 01:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
is that is that something that's been
 
01:45:54.410 --> 01:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
dialogued amongst the professional folks
 
01:45:57.169 --> 01:45:57.179 align:start position:0%
in that area or my way off base no
 
01:45:58.910 --> 01:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
you're right on Target and I will say
 
01:46:01.729 --> 01:46:01.739 align:start position:0%
that Riverbend and currently does have a
 
01:46:03.790 --> 01:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
program where they go into some schools
 
01:46:06.350 --> 01:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
and there will be a counselor who will
 
01:46:09.169 --> 01:46:09.179 align:start position:0%
provide services in the school district
 
01:46:11.930 --> 01:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
setting however there's a limit to what
 
01:46:13.370 --> 01:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
kind of service they can provide in a
 
01:46:15.470 --> 01:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
school setting because kids with severe
 
01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
trauma or things like that they will not
 
01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
treat in a school setting because of the
 
01:46:22.729 --> 01:46:22.739 align:start position:0%
type of Counseling Services needed and
 
01:46:25.609 --> 01:46:25.619 align:start position:0%
the recovery time after that session so
 
01:46:27.770 --> 01:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
they typically when a kid has an intense
 
01:46:30.229 --> 01:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
session with a therapist they they need
 
01:46:33.470 --> 01:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
some time to kind of debrief soak it in
 
01:46:35.570 --> 01:46:35.580 align:start position:0%
and not go be thrown back into a
 
01:46:36.830 --> 01:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
classroom full of peers that might
 
01:46:39.950 --> 01:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
trigger them all over again so that is
 
01:46:50.090 --> 01:46:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:52.490 --> 01:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
let me support that kind of concept and
 
01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
actually having mental health centers in
 
01:46:56.930 --> 01:46:56.940 align:start position:0%
our schools so it's not just you know if
 
01:46:58.729 --> 01:46:58.739 align:start position:0%
the if the family is dropping off a
 
01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
child and they need to have that support
 
01:47:04.370 --> 01:47:04.380 align:start position:0%
or look for resources
 
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
um to have those kinds of things Under
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
One Roof
 
01:47:09.590 --> 01:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
um and and more connections with our
 
01:47:11.930 --> 01:47:11.940 align:start position:0%
medical world also I think we would
 
01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:17.570 --> 01:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
um I I am lucky enough to have a tier
 
01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
three mental health support system in my
 
01:47:21.709 --> 01:47:21.719 align:start position:0%
school effective School Solutions
 
01:47:23.689 --> 01:47:23.699 align:start position:0%
they're a contracted service that come
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
in and they provide services up to for
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
up to 20 students Mental Health Services
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
that include um individual therapy group
 
01:47:33.890 --> 01:47:33.900 align:start position:0%
therapy and family component which I
 
01:47:35.770 --> 01:47:35.780 align:start position:0%
think is probably the most
 
01:47:38.510 --> 01:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
important piece of that is because of
 
01:47:41.330 --> 01:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
that real true wraparound for students
 
01:47:43.609 --> 01:47:43.619 align:start position:0%
but because it's a contracted service
 
01:47:45.649 --> 01:47:45.659 align:start position:0%
and they have their own program there's
 
01:47:48.890 --> 01:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
a lot of red tape for any
 
01:47:51.709 --> 01:47:51.719 align:start position:0%
once we once we cross into the medical
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
world there's a lot of red tapes and so
 
01:47:56.090 --> 01:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
that's the other barrier barrier
 
01:47:58.070 --> 01:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes can just ask her one fall to
 
01:48:00.770 --> 01:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
the comment get this in that comment
 
01:48:02.930 --> 01:48:02.940 align:start position:0%
um so the youngsters that are being
 
01:48:04.729 --> 01:48:04.739 align:start position:0%
serviced by these professional
 
01:48:06.890 --> 01:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
contractors are coming and helping
 
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
um although youngsters typically on IEPs
 
01:48:12.350 --> 01:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
or these youngsters who just have mental
 
01:48:14.450 --> 01:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
health especially behavioral issues that
 
01:48:20.109 --> 01:48:20.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:22.910 --> 01:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you it does come
 
01:48:26.689 --> 01:48:26.699 align:start position:0%
through our mtss process referral thank
 
01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
you representative Lakers and
 
01:48:30.530 --> 01:48:30.540 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell okay I have now
 
01:48:33.890 --> 01:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
three questions that keep growing
 
01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:34.629 align:start position:0%
three questions that keep growing
um

01:48:34.629 --> 01:48:34.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:36.649 --> 01:48:36.659 align:start position:0%
I'm curious
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
my understanding of mtssb is that
 
01:48:42.239 --> 01:48:43.310 align:start position:0%
my understanding of mtssb is that
um

01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:47.810 --> 01:48:47.820 align:start position:0%
once you get to tier three
 
01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
you're not doing that in the school
 
01:48:50.689 --> 01:48:50.699 align:start position:0%
you're doing that out of the school
 
01:48:52.729 --> 01:48:52.739 align:start position:0%
right you
 
01:48:55.729 --> 01:48:55.739 align:start position:0%
sending the kids
 
01:48:59.209 --> 01:48:59.219 align:start position:0%
to one of those Services that's not in
 
01:49:01.370 --> 01:49:01.380 align:start position:0%
the school and maybe I'm wrong about
 
01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
that but what I'm wondering is why we're
 
01:49:10.010 --> 01:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:10.020 --> 01:49:11.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:49:11.870 --> 01:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:14.270 --> 01:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
Services I guess
 
01:49:17.270 --> 01:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
in the school as opposed to outside of
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:23.149 --> 01:49:23.159 align:start position:0%
working with the kids and the families
 
01:49:24.890 --> 01:49:24.900 align:start position:0%
and setting them up with something in
 
01:49:26.570 --> 01:49:26.580 align:start position:0%
the community
 
01:49:29.570 --> 01:49:29.580 align:start position:0%
where if it does I mean it can take a
 
01:49:32.510 --> 01:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
long time right sometimes it can take
 
01:49:35.390 --> 01:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
hours you know counseling sessions that
 
01:49:38.450 --> 01:49:38.460 align:start position:0%
are fairly long multiple times and why
 
01:49:40.010 --> 01:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
are we trying to do that in the school
 
01:49:42.649 --> 01:49:42.659 align:start position:0%
setting instead of in addition to the
 
01:49:44.689 --> 01:49:44.699 align:start position:0%
school setting so that's my first
 
01:49:44.699 --> 01:49:45.890 align:start position:0%
school setting so that's my first
question

01:49:45.890 --> 01:49:45.900 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:49:49.810 --> 01:49:49.820 align:start position:0%
commit to it oops sorry
 
01:49:53.450 --> 01:49:53.460 align:start position:0%
I I think that that's exactly what what
 
01:49:56.149 --> 01:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
it needs to be both in the school and in
 
01:49:58.430 --> 01:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
the community because the kids spend a
 
01:50:00.530 --> 01:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
significant amount of time in school so
 
01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some support when
 
01:50:04.430 --> 01:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
they're in the school system when
 
01:50:05.870 --> 01:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
they're in the school setting but
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
they're also many of these students
 
01:50:11.330 --> 01:50:11.340 align:start position:0%
needed a full wraparound
 
01:50:13.070 --> 01:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
and I'll just add on to that to answer
 
01:50:15.290 --> 01:50:15.300 align:start position:0%
the first part of your question when
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
students get to that top tier of
 
01:50:19.310 --> 01:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
intervention support the majority of
 
01:50:21.290 --> 01:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
that Sports actually in-house it's not
 
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily us sending kids out
 
01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
there are very minimal students that we
 
01:50:31.070 --> 01:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
choose to move to a more restrictive
 
01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
setting and that ends up you 99 of the
 
01:50:35.689 --> 01:50:35.699 align:start position:0%
time going through the special education
 
01:50:38.629 --> 01:50:38.639 align:start position:0%
process and the team determining that we
 
01:50:40.669 --> 01:50:40.679 align:start position:0%
cannot meet the educational needs of
 
01:50:42.350 --> 01:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
that child and they need to go to a
 
01:50:45.470 --> 01:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
specialized school but that's few and
 
01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
far between the majority of our kids get
 
01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:48.590 align:start position:0%
far between the majority of our kids get
those

01:50:48.590 --> 01:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:49.250 align:start position:0%
those
um

01:50:49.250 --> 01:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:51.649 --> 01:50:51.659 align:start position:0%
really in-depth intervention supports in
 
01:50:52.910 --> 01:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
the school setting it just might be that
 
01:50:54.590 --> 01:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
they're being removed from the classroom
 
01:50:57.169 --> 01:50:57.179 align:start position:0%
to access those kind of supports or they
 
01:51:00.890 --> 01:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
have an intensive wraparound team
 
01:51:02.450 --> 01:51:02.460 align:start position:0%
um and maybe there's a facilitator
 
01:51:04.850 --> 01:51:04.860 align:start position:0%
that's coming from UNH
 
01:51:07.850 --> 01:51:07.860 align:start position:0%
um to do a wraparound type approach with
 
01:51:11.629 --> 01:51:11.639 align:start position:0%
that team of teachers and family members
 
01:51:14.330 --> 01:51:14.340 align:start position:0%
and the students okay yeah I wasn't
 
01:51:16.490 --> 01:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
thinking of sending them to another
 
01:51:19.010 --> 01:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
school I was just thinking of in
 
01:51:21.050 --> 01:51:21.060 align:start position:0%
addition to the school time outside of
 
01:51:23.090 --> 01:51:23.100 align:start position:0%
the school time
 
01:51:24.830 --> 01:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
um just to add on to the outside of
 
01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
school time piece too is a lot of times
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
we do help the families get connected to
 
01:51:32.149 --> 01:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
a mental health provider but we can only
 
01:51:34.370 --> 01:51:34.380 align:start position:0%
get as far as making that connection we
 
01:51:37.129 --> 01:51:37.139 align:start position:0%
can't actually get the parent to follow
 
01:51:38.510 --> 01:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
through on the mental health services
 
01:51:40.430 --> 01:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
piece and a lot of the mental health
 
01:51:42.169 --> 01:51:42.179 align:start position:0%
service providers are in the same
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
position Schools are they don't have
 
01:51:46.490 --> 01:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
staff and so therefore that kid gets put
 
01:51:49.010 --> 01:51:49.020 align:start position:0%
on a waiting list for two years because
 
01:51:50.570 --> 01:51:50.580 align:start position:0%
they don't have counselors who can take
 
01:51:53.390 --> 01:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
that kid off the case which goes to my
 
01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
next questions which is where I started
 
01:51:56.639 --> 01:51:58.070 align:start position:0%
next questions which is where I started
um

01:51:58.070 --> 01:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:00.649 --> 01:52:00.659 align:start position:0%
you talk about school psychologists and
 
01:52:02.510 --> 01:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
whatever and I'm thinking well yeah it's
 
01:52:04.490 --> 01:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
big school districts have school
 
01:52:06.229 --> 01:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
psychologists but we have an awful lot
 
01:52:09.050 --> 01:52:09.060 align:start position:0%
of school districts that are small
 
01:52:13.310 --> 01:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
that don't have school psychologists and
 
01:52:15.470 --> 01:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
who deals with these things in those
 
01:52:18.169 --> 01:52:18.179 align:start position:0%
small districts
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
so even our sorry
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
I think the vast majority of our school
 
01:52:25.310 --> 01:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
districts have access to school
 
01:52:27.109 --> 01:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
psychologists even if they're part-time
 
01:52:29.330 --> 01:52:29.340 align:start position:0%
and when they don't
 
01:52:31.609 --> 01:52:31.619 align:start position:0%
um they contract to have um
 
01:52:34.189 --> 01:52:34.199 align:start position:0%
psychologists come in and provide those
 
01:52:36.050 --> 01:52:36.060 align:start position:0%
Services whether they be counseling or
 
01:52:39.410 --> 01:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
evaluations for students
 
01:52:42.709 --> 01:52:42.719 align:start position:0%
and then and I and I do believe as the
 
01:52:44.390 --> 01:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
numbers of special ed teachers have gone
 
01:52:46.189 --> 01:52:46.199 align:start position:0%
down the numbers of school psychologists
 
01:52:49.750 --> 01:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
have gone down to significantly okay so
 
01:52:52.570 --> 01:52:52.580 align:start position:0%
what started out as my first question
 
01:52:57.229 --> 01:52:57.239 align:start position:0%
which is now my third is do you see any
 
01:53:00.350 --> 01:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
kind of solution or perceive of anything
 
01:53:04.729 --> 01:53:04.739 align:start position:0%
that's going to grow our
 
01:53:07.250 --> 01:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
um number of
 
01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
providers you know because that keeps
 
01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
shrinking and so and this is everywhere
 
01:53:12.770 --> 01:53:12.780 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:53:14.629 --> 01:53:14.639 align:start position:0%
do you see any kind of solution anything
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
that can be done
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:22.430 --> 01:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
I mean I think that we're competing
 
01:53:25.129 --> 01:53:25.139 align:start position:0%
against you know big hospitals that can
 
01:53:28.189 --> 01:53:28.199 align:start position:0%
pay you know these enormous sign-on
 
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
bonuses that's that's what we're
 
01:53:32.149 --> 01:53:32.159 align:start position:0%
competing with in the fields is is that
 
01:53:34.070 --> 01:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
like and School nurses are the same
 
01:53:37.370 --> 01:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
thing you know nurses are getting five
 
01:53:39.890 --> 01:53:39.900 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars sign-on bonuses come
 
01:53:43.609 --> 01:53:43.619 align:start position:0%
work for our school that's not it's okay
 
01:53:45.229 --> 01:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
and I think there's less than about 20
 
01:53:47.209 --> 01:53:47.219 align:start position:0%
things we could do to get to that point
 
01:53:49.570 --> 01:53:49.580 align:start position:0%
but I think it's going to take reform
 
01:53:49.580 --> 01:53:51.550 align:start position:0%
but I think it's going to take reform
and

01:53:51.550 --> 01:53:51.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:55.070 --> 01:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
multi-systems working together so the
 
01:53:57.189 --> 01:53:57.199 align:start position:0%
like you guys talked about higher ed
 
01:54:00.050 --> 01:54:00.060 align:start position:0%
revamping the way that those people are
 
01:54:02.330 --> 01:54:02.340 align:start position:0%
getting trained and equipped to deal
 
01:54:04.250 --> 01:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
with what has happening in the schools
 
01:54:06.109 --> 01:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
and not necessarily what was going on
 
01:54:07.790 --> 01:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
over 30 years ago in school settings
 
01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's revamping the way that uh
 
01:54:13.010 --> 01:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
doctors offices Mental Health Providers
 
01:54:14.930 --> 01:54:14.940 align:start position:0%
are working together with the schools
 
01:54:18.649 --> 01:54:18.659 align:start position:0%
and you know the way that this the state
 
01:54:20.570 --> 01:54:20.580 align:start position:0%
is working and the department is working
 
01:54:22.270 --> 01:54:22.280 align:start position:0%
I think all those things kind of need
 
01:54:24.410 --> 01:54:24.420 align:start position:0%
reforms to better work together and then
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
we could see those kind of results but I
 
01:54:28.430 --> 01:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
think that's a long tedious process that
 
01:54:31.370 --> 01:54:31.380 align:start position:0%
includes multiple life checklists well
 
01:54:33.109 --> 01:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the checklist is it
 
01:54:35.390 --> 01:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
possible for you to write something up
 
01:54:39.129 --> 01:54:39.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:42.169 --> 01:54:42.179 align:start position:0%
well but it's a starting point right but
 
01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
apparently it was the idea that only 15
 
01:54:47.270 --> 01:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
instead of this large number
 
01:54:50.270 --> 01:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
I mean how do we deal with that because
 
01:54:51.890 --> 01:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
if we're not we're only having a small
 
01:54:54.050 --> 01:54:54.060 align:start position:0%
number coming in and I'm sure we're
 
01:54:57.109 --> 01:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:59.450 --> 01:54:59.460 align:start position:0%
well I think other things aren't going
 
01:55:01.609 --> 01:55:01.619 align:start position:0%
to help related to what representing
 
01:55:05.390 --> 01:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
like is are there models in other states
 
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
I don't have that information but we can
 
01:55:14.930 --> 01:55:14.940 align:start position:0%
I can check with our national colleagues
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
but nationally it is a real challenge
 
01:55:19.729 --> 01:55:19.739 align:start position:0%
getting people to go into the field in
 
01:55:21.890 --> 01:55:21.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is is not at all
 
01:55:25.010 --> 01:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
competitive in terms of salary
 
01:55:26.870 --> 01:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
um and with our growing numbers of kids
 
01:55:28.850 --> 01:55:28.860 align:start position:0%
with disabilities and becoming more
 
01:55:31.669 --> 01:55:31.679 align:start position:0%
complex it's it's a truly a really
 
01:55:34.070 --> 01:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
challenging job and same with our school
 
01:55:36.410 --> 01:55:36.420 align:start position:0%
psychologists competitive wise in terms
 
01:55:36.420 --> 01:55:37.310 align:start position:0%
psychologists competitive wise in terms
of

01:55:37.310 --> 01:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:38.689 align:start position:0%
of
um salaries

01:55:38.689 --> 01:55:38.699 align:start position:0%
um salaries
 
01:55:40.729 --> 01:55:40.739 align:start position:0%
um you know the the from what I
 
01:55:42.410 --> 01:55:42.420 align:start position:0%
understand those who graduated from
 
01:55:45.290 --> 01:55:45.300 align:start position:0%
Plymouth all left the state just because
 
01:55:47.470 --> 01:55:47.480 align:start position:0%
you know they they could make much more
 
01:55:49.609 --> 01:55:49.619 align:start position:0%
across the border when they do their
 
01:55:51.790 --> 01:55:51.800 align:start position:0%
practicums they get paid practicums
 
01:55:53.930 --> 01:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
wherein in New Hampshire that's not
 
01:55:56.750 --> 01:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
typical it does happen in some cases but
 
01:55:58.250 --> 01:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
even for their practicums they will
 
01:56:00.109 --> 01:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
leave the state
 
01:56:02.629 --> 01:56:02.639 align:start position:0%
um we're just not competitive resources
 
01:56:03.590 --> 01:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
are tough
 
01:56:06.350 --> 01:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
representative Lakers she also thank you
 
01:56:10.010 --> 01:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
very much I've got uh Cornell cascad and
 
01:56:14.149 --> 01:56:14.159 align:start position:0%
Damon you're all set okay uh cafskin I I
 
01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
am also concerned about the time
 
01:56:19.310 --> 01:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
uh because what I want to do is to take
 
01:56:21.590 --> 01:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
the final questions then I want to take
 
01:56:24.590 --> 01:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
a break and then come back and then kind
 
01:56:26.149 --> 01:56:26.159 align:start position:0%
of focus on some of the questions we
 
01:56:28.370 --> 01:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
need to deal with okay so representative
 
01:56:30.950 --> 01:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
Kat scadden thank you
 
01:56:32.510 --> 01:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
um just a couple of questions first I
 
01:56:34.430 --> 01:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
agree with a representative like I said
 
01:56:37.129 --> 01:56:37.139 align:start position:0%
mental health therapy
 
01:56:39.530 --> 01:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
really should be done by the specialized
 
01:56:41.930 --> 01:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
Fields but schools need to have the
 
01:56:43.970 --> 01:56:43.980 align:start position:0%
multi-tiered systems of support to be
 
01:56:47.209 --> 01:56:47.219 align:start position:0%
able to manage the student not cure them
 
01:56:50.570 --> 01:56:50.580 align:start position:0%
just manage that behavior but are you
 
01:56:54.590 --> 01:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
finding that the teens or parents are
 
01:56:58.430 --> 01:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
requesting one-on-one Ed assistance for
 
01:57:01.430 --> 01:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
those kids that are finding are having
 
01:57:04.070 --> 01:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
difficult functioning I mean I used to
 
01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
see that and we're getting we're getting
 
01:57:08.149 --> 01:57:08.159 align:start position:0%
doctors prescriptions for them yeah so
 
01:57:10.129 --> 01:57:10.139 align:start position:0%
okay this is so that's out of control
 
01:57:10.139 --> 01:57:11.570 align:start position:0%
okay this is so that's out of control
too

01:57:11.570 --> 01:57:11.580 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
because everybody wants a private
 
01:57:16.010 --> 01:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
one-on-one educational assistant who
 
01:57:18.890 --> 01:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
doesn't come with the training by all
 
01:57:22.729 --> 01:57:22.739 align:start position:0%
means and it's a Band-Aid
 
01:57:26.089 --> 01:57:26.099 align:start position:0%
and it pacifies people because it keeps
 
01:57:28.729 --> 01:57:28.739 align:start position:0%
the student out of the classroom
 
01:57:31.729 --> 01:57:31.739 align:start position:0%
and it just barely you know keeps it
 
01:57:33.649 --> 01:57:33.659 align:start position:0%
under control but I was curious about
 
01:57:35.570 --> 01:57:35.580 align:start position:0%
that because I experienced that as well
 
01:57:37.070 --> 01:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
I mean people want we'll give them a
 
01:57:38.330 --> 01:57:38.340 align:start position:0%
one-on-one Aid
 
01:57:41.089 --> 01:57:41.099 align:start position:0%
well you know what you're talking well
 
01:57:44.330 --> 01:57:44.340 align:start position:0%
only 35 000 salary probably but
 
01:57:46.010 --> 01:57:46.020 align:start position:0%
you know what you said it's a Band-Aid
 
01:57:48.790 --> 01:57:48.800 align:start position:0%
really because personally not
 
01:57:52.129 --> 01:57:52.139 align:start position:0%
a certified professional right I mean it
 
01:57:53.450 --> 01:57:53.460 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that they're not great they
 
01:57:55.729 --> 01:57:55.739 align:start position:0%
could be great but they're not a trained
 
01:57:55.739 --> 01:57:57.470 align:start position:0%
could be great but they're not a trained
educator

01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
educator
 
01:57:59.330 --> 01:57:59.340 align:start position:0%
um and when you have multiple
 
01:58:01.609 --> 01:58:01.619 align:start position:0%
one-to-ones you add multiple adults and
 
01:58:04.669 --> 01:58:04.679 align:start position:0%
rightful areas for and you need spaces
 
01:58:06.530 --> 01:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
patience spaces things like that and
 
01:58:10.250 --> 01:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
ultimately you know could there be a
 
01:58:13.250 --> 01:58:13.260 align:start position:0%
redesign in the system or more Universal
 
01:58:14.570 --> 01:58:14.580 align:start position:0%
Design for Learning in the classroom
 
01:58:16.729 --> 01:58:16.739 align:start position:0%
more co-teaching opportunities that
 
01:58:18.830 --> 01:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
could change the need for the one to one
 
01:58:21.250 --> 01:58:21.260 align:start position:0%
and not need that but
 
01:58:23.810 --> 01:58:23.820 align:start position:0%
redevelop the system of Education in the
 
01:58:26.450 --> 01:58:26.460 align:start position:0%
classroom and additional supports from
 
01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Providers counselors
 
01:58:29.450 --> 01:58:29.460 align:start position:0%
things like that that could help support
 
01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
those needs but you are seeing that oh
 
01:58:33.229 --> 01:58:33.239 align:start position:0%
yeah because on a rock yeah I mean
 
01:58:34.990 --> 01:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
that's the cost of the local getting
 
01:58:38.629 --> 01:58:38.639 align:start position:0%
orders from doctors for IEPs yeah like
 
01:58:40.669 --> 01:58:40.679 align:start position:0%
ones things like that they may not have
 
01:58:42.470 --> 01:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
and they're going from the word from the
 
01:58:44.570 --> 01:58:44.580 align:start position:0%
parent which is okay and that parent is
 
01:58:46.070 --> 01:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
advocating for their child which is
 
01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:47.149 align:start position:0%
advocating for their child which is
great

01:58:47.149 --> 01:58:47.159 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:58:48.470 --> 01:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
um but they may not have the kind
 
01:58:50.030 --> 01:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
context and the data from the school
 
01:58:52.310 --> 01:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
correct I've been through that yep thank
 
01:58:53.870 --> 01:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
you just curious about the one-on-one
 
01:58:57.229 --> 01:58:57.239 align:start position:0%
increase representative Damon
 
01:58:59.089 --> 01:58:59.099 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:59:01.370 --> 01:59:01.380 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
the testing always needs to be done by a
 
01:59:08.089 --> 01:59:08.099 align:start position:0%
psychologist or is there any model where
 
01:59:12.169 --> 01:59:12.179 align:start position:0%
a lower tier provider like an MSW well
 
01:59:15.169 --> 01:59:15.179 align:start position:0%
icsw are they qualified to do that
 
01:59:17.330 --> 01:59:17.340 align:start position:0%
testing and respecting that there's a
 
01:59:20.330 --> 01:59:20.340 align:start position:0%
profound shortage of those folks as well
 
01:59:22.990 --> 01:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
but just would that be a way to free up
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
psychologists to provide more of the
 
01:59:30.109 --> 01:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
supports not just the testing
 
01:59:32.510 --> 01:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
I think I'm just going to refer to our
 
01:59:35.689 --> 01:59:35.699 align:start position:0%
special ed rules there are certain types
 
01:59:37.490 --> 01:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
of disabilities that require certain
 
01:59:39.229 --> 01:59:39.239 align:start position:0%
evaluators and that's kind of what we
 
01:59:41.570 --> 01:59:41.580 align:start position:0%
have to go by that's my question yeah
 
01:59:44.089 --> 01:59:44.099 align:start position:0%
for each category there's certain
 
01:59:45.950 --> 01:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
evaluations that need to be accomplished
 
01:59:48.169 --> 01:59:48.179 align:start position:0%
and then it tells the law is very clear
 
01:59:51.290 --> 01:59:51.300 align:start position:0%
on who can administer those so is it
 
01:59:53.209 --> 01:59:53.219 align:start position:0%
always a psychologist
 
01:59:53.219 --> 01:59:54.410 align:start position:0%
always a psychologist
um

01:59:54.410 --> 01:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:54.420 --> 01:59:56.209 align:start position:0%
um
for

01:59:56.209 --> 01:59:56.219 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:59:56.219 --> 01:59:56.810 align:start position:0%
for
um

01:59:56.810 --> 01:59:56.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:01.189 --> 02:00:01.199 align:start position:0%
like intelligence testing yes
 
02:00:01.199 --> 02:00:02.149 align:start position:0%
like intelligence testing yes
um

02:00:02.149 --> 02:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:02.159 --> 02:00:05.149 align:start position:0%
um
for

02:00:05.149 --> 02:00:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:05.159 --> 02:00:07.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:00:07.370 --> 02:00:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:09.169 --> 02:00:09.179 align:start position:0%
social emotional
 
02:00:12.050 --> 02:00:12.060 align:start position:0%
it requires absolutely yes
 
02:00:12.060 --> 02:00:12.770 align:start position:0%
it requires absolutely yes
um

02:00:12.770 --> 02:00:12.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:15.890 --> 02:00:15.900 align:start position:0%
a psychologist or a psychiatrist
 
02:00:18.109 --> 02:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
thank you all right I'm going to take
 
02:00:19.850 --> 02:00:19.860 align:start position:0%
one more question I just I don't think
 
02:00:21.709 --> 02:00:21.719 align:start position:0%
those other people are any more
 
02:00:23.629 --> 02:00:23.639 align:start position:0%
available than the school psychologists
 
02:00:24.970 --> 02:00:24.980 align:start position:0%
are to me
 
02:00:29.089 --> 02:00:29.099 align:start position:0%
one more question just another
 
02:00:31.490 --> 02:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
um piece to answer hopes question is
 
02:00:33.290 --> 02:00:33.300 align:start position:0%
that a special ed teacher can become
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
safe certified
 
02:00:37.550 --> 02:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
right and they have the capability to do
 
02:00:39.470 --> 02:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
the in-house testing for some
 
02:00:39.480 --> 02:00:40.669 align:start position:0%
the in-house testing for some
intellectual

02:00:40.669 --> 02:00:40.679 align:start position:0%
intellectual
 
02:00:44.450 --> 02:00:44.460 align:start position:0%
yes disabilities right so it may save on
 
02:00:46.270 --> 02:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
a school psychologist
 
02:00:48.830 --> 02:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
it's back to the special ed teacher
 
02:00:51.530 --> 02:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
piece you know right right then it goes
 
02:00:53.089 --> 02:00:53.099 align:start position:0%
back to a special ed teacher it wants to
 
02:00:57.830 --> 02:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:59.629 --> 02:00:59.639 align:start position:0%
okay one last question representative
 
02:01:01.550 --> 02:01:01.560 align:start position:0%
drive thank you could you just clarify
