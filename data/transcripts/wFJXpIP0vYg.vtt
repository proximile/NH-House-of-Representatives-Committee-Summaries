um most
 
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
recently Governor sonunu formed a task
 
00:09:11.829 --> 00:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
force for the two actually were probably
 
00:09:15.069 --> 00:09:15.079 align:start position:0%
20 plus people on the task force to look
 
00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959 align:start position:0%
at ways that the two systems of public
 
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
higher education in our state could
 
00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:20.269 align:start position:0%
higher education in our state could
better

00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
collaborate and the task force issued
 
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:26.680 align:start position:0%
its report in March of
 
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320 align:start position:0%

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
amendment to statute an amendment to RSA
 
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
187a um requiring that the the two
 
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%

various recom
 
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations that were in that task
 
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
force report so the chancellor and I
 
00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
provided to Aaron
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
Jones middle of last week
 
00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:02.600 align:start position:0%

issued by the task force in March of 24
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
as well as the annual report that we
 
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
issued in November and um apologies for
 
00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:16.839 align:start position:0%
delayed delivery we provided to Aaron
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
Friday evening a more recent status
 
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
report that's dated February 28th and
 
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
and that is um in front of you we're
 
00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:27.399 align:start position:0%
happy to to talk through that um I don't
 
00:10:30.509 --> 00:10:30.519 align:start position:0%
know if the chancellor has any
 
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:33.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Chancellor preventure I would
 
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
like to draw attention from the
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
committee to the director applebe
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Education who chaired the
 
00:10:43.629 --> 00:10:43.639 align:start position:0%
task force uh created by governor cunu
 
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
and would also add that the report
 
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:49.720 align:start position:0%
included about 40 recommendations some
 
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
short-term some long-term some that were
 
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
operational in nature some that are more
 
00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
student facing and then some that are
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
much larger policy issues and what we've
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
been able to uh pursue in the short time
 
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
since that report was completed are the
 
00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
things that are more accessible to the
 
00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
two institutions to work on
 
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
operationally we think that there's
 
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
still a lot of opportunity from that
 
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
report on some of the recommendations
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
that are more substantial in terms of
 
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
what might be done with alignment of the
 
00:11:20.949 --> 00:11:20.959 align:start position:0%
state's Economic Development activities
 
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:24.870 align:start position:0%
with public higher education
 
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:30.150 align:start position:0%
with public higher education
[Music]

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
as a point of clarification here um my
 
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
understanding is as we wrote the
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
amending language of
 
00:11:41.949 --> 00:11:41.959 align:start position:0%
1450 that the chancellors of both
 
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
systems would present to us a quarterly
 
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
report on the status of where we are
 
00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:50.120 align:start position:0%
with those recommendations so it's just
 
00:11:54.269 --> 00:11:54.279 align:start position:0%
not as needed but it read addressing
 
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
higher education alignment outcomes uh
 
00:11:59.790 --> 00:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
to the public educ high higher education
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
study committee beginning with the
 
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
calendar quarter ending June 30th
 
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
2024 and it goes on and it or prior to
 
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
that it said um shall submit joint
 
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
quarterly reports so it's my
 
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
understanding that you know this we
 
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
would also receive the quarterly report
 
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
that we you know at the end of the year
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
or wher we are we coming up on another
 
00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:29.959 align:start position:0%
quarterly report
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
yes um thank you
 
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative I believe
 
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
that turn on your mic please sorry I'm
 
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
sorry um correct me if I'm wrong I
 
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:43.720 align:start position:0%
believe the law states the quarterly
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
reports are as requested by the
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
committee yeah
 
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
and I believe in
 
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
December could be getting this wrong
 
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
maybe it was early
 
00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
January you were the chair at the time
 
00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:00.839 align:start position:0%
of this committee and we communicated
 
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
about we had just done the annual report
 
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:08.519 align:start position:0%
and so was another quarterly report
 
00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
necessary and we said the qu the annual
 
00:13:15.189 --> 00:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
report would suffice I I'm just not
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
complaining or anything about the
 
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
reports I'm just saying that it's four
 
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
quarters per year and or if we request
 
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
to skip one we could do that but it it's
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
up to this committee to decide how to
 
00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:30.509 align:start position:0%
up to this committee to decide how to
handle

00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:30.519 align:start position:0%
handle
 
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
it is that your understanding yes yeah
 
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
we we um the chancellor and I worked on
 
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
this status report because we knew this
 
00:13:42.189 --> 00:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
committee was having its organizational
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
meeting and wanted to provide you with
 
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
an update of the work that we've done
 
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:51.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
appreciated I just received these things
 
00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
when I came in this morning so I have
 
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:05.320 align:start position:0%
not had a chance to look through
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
everything else but did the 40 points
 
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
that you said that you have recognized
 
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:13.240 align:start position:0%
is was that be in the in that report in
 
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
this report here okay yes and broken
 
00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:18.839 align:start position:0%
into short-term recommendations and
 
00:14:18.839 --> 00:14:20.470 align:start position:0%
into short-term recommendations and
long-term

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
long-term
 
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:25.240 align:start position:0%
recommendations and in this uh update
 
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
you telling about what you have done to
 
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
date what you have been able to
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
accomplish out of those 40 today yes the
 
00:14:38.189 --> 00:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
um again the annual report that's dat
 
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
late October early late
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
October October 20th provides more
 
00:14:46.749 --> 00:14:46.759 align:start position:0%
detail but the chancellor and I are
 
00:14:48.509 --> 00:14:48.519 align:start position:0%
happy to walk through some um recent
 
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:50.680 align:start position:0%
updates for the report that's dated
 
00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:55.829 align:start position:0%
updates for the report that's dated
February

00:14:55.829 --> 00:14:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
28th so can you just walk through the
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
seven instances you have on this
 
00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:01.480 align:start position:0%
February 28th report so it's for the
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
record so people can see it and
 
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
understand what we're talking about
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
while I have this paper not everybody
 
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
listening to us
 
00:15:11.069 --> 00:15:11.079 align:start position:0%
absolutely now I'll start with the first
 
00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
recommendation and these were not in
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
order these are just the order in which
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
we prioritize to pursue them enhance and
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
expand ccsnh H's Early College dual
 
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
enrollment initiatives to give students
 
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
a compelling Pathway to postsecondary
 
00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
education by reducing cost and debt
 
00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:31.720 align:start position:0%
burden early college is an opportunity
 
00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:34.279 align:start position:0%
for high school students grades 10 11
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
and 12 to enroll in college level
 
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
courses either in their high schools on
 
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
our campuses or online the opportunity
 
00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
is to challenge themselves academically
 
00:15:48.269 --> 00:15:48.279 align:start position:0%
and to earn both credit towards
 
00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:49.959 align:start position:0%
satisfying High School graduation
 
00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
requirements and also college credit
 
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:54.839 align:start position:0%
requirements toward uh completing a
 
00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
college degree the benefit to students
 
00:16:01.389 --> 00:16:01.399 align:start position:0%
and Families on a purely Financial basis
 
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
is significant the state in the last
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
bium uh provided $2.5 million for
 
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
scholarships to underwrite the cost of
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
these courses and in Early College these
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
courses are offered at $150 a course
 
00:16:18.189 --> 00:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
which for three or four credit course on
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
our campuses would be somewhere between
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
645 and
 
00:16:26.189 --> 00:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
$860 so significant savings to students
 
00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
and families made more so by the
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
investment of the
 
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
state last year New Hampshire High
 
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
School students enrolled in 54,000
 
00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:37.639 align:start position:0%
credits which if they had done that on
 
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
our campuses would have cost at least
 
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
$13 million that's largely covered by
 
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
the $2.5 million from the state so in
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
essence a 5 to one return on that
 
00:16:51.309 --> 00:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
investment most of these students are
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
just taking one or two courses and over
 
00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
time you know again if they subsequently
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
enroll at a college for year institution
 
00:17:01.269 --> 00:17:01.279 align:start position:0%
where you pay by the semester this may
 
00:17:03.949 --> 00:17:03.959 align:start position:0%
not amount to much but our objective is
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
to actually build these into Pathways so
 
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
that the sets of courses students take
 
00:17:12.909 --> 00:17:12.919 align:start position:0%
whether it's 4 or 8 or 12 or 16 over
 
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
time actually represent a semester or a
 
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
year or even the complete Associate
 
00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:19.799 align:start position:0%
Degree for students who are ambitious
 
00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
and motivated so that students and
 
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
families can see significant savings
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
significant avoidance of
 
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
debt we've been trying to build build
 
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
these with House Bill 1530 in mind which
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
was a legislative mandate for the
 
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
University system community college
 
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
system to work better together to ensure
 
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
that students had clear Pathways how
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
coursework at our institution fit into
 
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
degree programs in the University system
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
so that students would have a pathway
 
00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
that was well defined and contribute to
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
that both incentive to continue and
 
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
affordability for doing that over time
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
with growth in this program we think
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
that we can help more students and
 
00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:03.039 align:start position:0%
families complete degrees that are
 
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
meaningful to them aligned with New
 
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:07.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Workforce need and because
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has always been or long
 
00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
been one of the leading exporters of
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
College Bound students students leaving
 
00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
this state to pursue College in other
 
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
states we think that given enough
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
opportunity to strengthen these Pathways
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
we can give students reason and
 
00:18:24.909 --> 00:18:24.919 align:start position:0%
incentive to stay in New Hampshire both
 
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
for the 2-year degree that we offer and
 
00:18:28.029 --> 00:18:28.039 align:start position:0%
the four-year degrees that the
 
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
University system offers so we think
 
00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of benefit to this last
 
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
year with the state support enrollment
 
00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:39.039 align:start position:0%
in Early College grew by
 
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
16% 30% on campus about 14% in the high
 
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
schools so significant growth
 
00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
year-over-year this year funding is
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
continuing same level as last year we've
 
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
seen an additional 8% growth this fall
 
00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:57.640 align:start position:0%
and we expect that we'll see continued
 
00:18:59.630 --> 00:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
growth into the future with continued
 
00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
support from the state I should mention
 
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
also that about 30% of this enrollment
 
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
activity in high schools is happening
 
00:19:09.549 --> 00:19:09.559 align:start position:0%
with CTE Career Technical Education
 
00:19:12.669 --> 00:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
Centers so high schools that are closely
 
00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
aligned in delivering programs that
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
match many of our skilled technical
 
00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
programs this the second item on um the
 
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
bottom of page two there was was a
 
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation made by the task for task
 
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
force relative to simplifying the
 
00:19:36.549 --> 00:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
admissions processes between the two
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
systems and again as the chancellor um
 
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:43.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned there have been a 100 Pathways
 
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
100 transfer Pathways um put into place
 
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
between the two systems but we're also U
 
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
looking into directed well we are we're
 
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:56.039 align:start position:0%
doing a direct admit program between the
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
community college system and the
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
university system so if you are
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
graduating with an associates degree
 
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
from the the community college system
 
00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:05.960 align:start position:0%
you will automatically be admitted if
 
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:09.400 align:start position:0%
you meet that um GPA Etc automatically
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
admitted to the university system and I
 
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
believe this month um community college
 
00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
system will provide information to the
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
university system so that we can reach
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
out to those those students and say
 
00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
congratulations on completing your
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
degree at the community college system
 
00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
please know you're automatically
 
00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:28.919 align:start position:0%
enrolled and that will that's part of
 
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
the U directed mitt process we're also
 
00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
working on it's in this we're also
 
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
um working on Direct admit with high
 
00:20:44.549 --> 00:20:44.559 align:start position:0%
schools that hasn't been rolled out just
 
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
yet there are some um statatory issues
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
relative to sharing data um but the the
 
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
two systems are also working on a direct
 
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
admit program with the high schools so
 
00:20:59.390 --> 00:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
if you meet eligibility criteria you'd
 
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
get a communication from the community
 
00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:03.400 align:start position:0%
college system Andor the university
 
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:05.720 align:start position:0%
system congratulations on finishing your
 
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
high school degree you're automatically
 
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
enrolled in in um a public HD
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
institution here in New Hampshire so a
 
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
area I I'd like to stay on this one just
 
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
for a second or two and we three months
 
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
ago we were talking about the
 
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
communication directly to the juniors in
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
high school hey you graduate and you
 
00:21:36.269 --> 00:21:36.279 align:start position:0%
have this point average or whatever
 
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
you're come on on board you come to Kean
 
00:21:40.029 --> 00:21:40.039 align:start position:0%
Plymouth or
 
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
UNH um and but we also recognize there
 
00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
was a hangup on acquisition of the
 
00:21:50.669 --> 00:21:50.679 align:start position:0%
addresses and that of
 
00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
students have we not yet gone is there
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
is that not resolved with the doe at
 
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
this point in time or the schools
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
themselves why are we now you know you
 
00:22:04.909 --> 00:22:04.919 align:start position:0%
know putting this thing off longer and
 
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
longer it it's not 100% resolved
 
00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.269 align:start position:0%
longer it it's not 100% resolved
representative

00:22:11.269 --> 00:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
lad I I was able I believe with
 
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
assistance from director applebe to
 
00:22:18.029 --> 00:22:18.039 align:start position:0%
connect with a colleague in the
 
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:19.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to at least
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
begin to explore this as noted in the
 
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
report between our early college
 
00:22:27.149 --> 00:22:27.159 align:start position:0%
programs and names that can be acquired
 
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
through the College Board student
 
00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:31.400 align:start position:0%
students who take the SAT we have a
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
significant portion of the secondary
 
00:22:36.029 --> 00:22:36.039 align:start position:0%
school population that we could reach
 
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
out to but it's not a complete outline
 
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
it's not a compete census of that
 
00:22:45.269 --> 00:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
population it's it's more uh students
 
00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:47.320 align:start position:0%
who have self- selected in in one way or
 
00:22:50.269 --> 00:22:50.279 align:start position:0%
another so our interest would be able to
 
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
more even-handedly and consistently and
 
00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
systematically reach the additional 20
 
00:22:58.590 --> 00:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
or 25% who are on the sidelines not
 
00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:00.559 align:start position:0%
because everybody necessarily needs or
 
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:02.440 align:start position:0%
is going to pursue a 4-year degree or
 
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
even a 2-year degree but we think that
 
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
there's probably a range of
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
opportunities whether it's skills-based
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
Workforce training some of our
 
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
microelectronics boot camps other kinds
 
00:23:14.909 --> 00:23:14.919 align:start position:0%
of very targeted programs that provide
 
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:17.240 align:start position:0%
Pathways to good opportunities that we
 
00:23:19.269 --> 00:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
could introduce people to so we are
 
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
hoping that there's a more uh systematic
 
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:24.440 align:start position:0%
Universal opportunity out there can I
 
00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up uh thank you um
 
00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
Chancellor Rubenstein
 
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things we were discussing is
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
that we know that we have X number of
 
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
kids that are graduating from high
 
00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
school we have an X number of students
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
in junior high or juniors in in high
 
00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039 align:start position:0%
school why is it that we can't at least
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
get some part of this program going by
 
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
communicating with the counselors in
 
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
these schools or the principls in these
 
00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
schools and saying hey here the cards
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
hand them out at least to your students
 
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh so they are aware that they have this
 
00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go right on to
 
00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.350 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go right on to
postsecondary

00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
postsecondary
 
00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
education I I I think it's fair to say
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
that both of our systems we have
 
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
colleagues who are in high schools
 
00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
throughout the state speaking with
 
00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
counselors speaking with students that
 
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:10.919 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
reach where we have a gap as being able
 
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
to communicate with families with
 
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
parents who may have interest in
 
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
understanding what those opportunities
 
00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
are who may be influential in in helping
 
00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
to shape the opportunities their
 
00:24:23.159 --> 00:24:24.909 align:start position:0%
to shape the opportunities their
students

00:24:24.909 --> 00:24:24.919 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
investigate I also add representative
 
00:24:30.029 --> 00:24:30.039 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative glad that of
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
course the name of it is going to escape
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
me but there is um an app or a tool that
 
00:24:38.909 --> 00:24:38.919 align:start position:0%
many if not
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
most high school juniors and seniors use
 
00:24:46.269 --> 00:24:46.279 align:start position:0%
um for for college admissions and Keen
 
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
Plymouth and UNH are all on that
 
00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
platform for direct admit for New
 
00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students so if you meet the
 
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria you click through
 
00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
in the app and you are directly admitted
 
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
and I can absolutely get more
 
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
information on that I think that would
 
00:25:05.389 --> 00:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
be helpful to to understand but that
 
00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
that was rolled out I think six or nine
 
00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.389 align:start position:0%
that was rolled out I think six or nine
months

00:25:10.389 --> 00:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
ago go ahead uh thank you madam chair I
 
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
I've had extensive experience with us as
 
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
president in Massachusetts um my
 
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
question is do the students taking the
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
courses get a transcript from your
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
school and students receive an official
 
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
transcript from the institution happens
 
00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
to be a student at conquered High School
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
the transcript would be issued by nhti
 
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
if it happens to be Oyster River would
 
00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:41.080 align:start position:0%
be issued by Great
 
00:25:45.549 --> 00:25:45.559 align:start position:0%
Bay follow follow um have you done any
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
research on how the students are doing
 
00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:49.240 align:start position:0%
now that you have some experience with
 
00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:51.640 align:start position:0%
them um I had some experience with the
 
00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:53.320 align:start position:0%
high school sending the students they
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
didn't want and I caught a couple doing
 
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
that because you
 
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully they literally you can admit
 
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:03.640 align:start position:0%
them on the spot because all they have
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
to do is produce the high school
 
00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:08.200 align:start position:0%
transfit when they graduate right so
 
00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
have you done any research on how these
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
students are doing now yeah we we we've
 
00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:14.559 align:start position:0%
actually done fairly extensive research
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
looking at about 35,000 students who
 
00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
participated in Early College from 2016
 
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
through 2022 so that we'd have the
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
additional two years to see what happens
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
afterwards we know that about 83% of
 
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
these students go on to postsecondary
 
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
education we know
 
00:26:36.909 --> 00:26:36.919 align:start position:0%
that about 6,000 of them enroll in the
 
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
community college system about 6,600
 
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
enrolled in the University system 11,000
 
00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
all told enrolled at um in New Hampshire
 
00:26:48.389 --> 00:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
about 14,000 left the state for
 
00:26:50.789 --> 00:26:50.799 align:start position:0%
postsecondary opportunities now there's
 
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
some overlap in those groups because
 
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
students enroll at one place then
 
00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
transfer to another but we know that
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
these students have tended to be success
 
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
in completing degrees our goal is to
 
00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
have more of these students succeed in
 
00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:05.240 align:start position:0%
completing degrees here in New Hampshire
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
and doing it in less costly ways that
 
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
don't put the financial pressure on them
 
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
that many college graduates
 
00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
welcome set line Thank you so mle I'm
 
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
GNA drag you into this conversation now
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
um so is the issue is a statutory
 
00:27:27.549 --> 00:27:27.559 align:start position:0%
problem that says that you don't have
 
00:27:29.149 --> 00:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
access to the student data that's
 
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%
necessary in order to provide the
 
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
letters and saying hey you're on target
 
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
to graduate you have the right GPA
 
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:37.240 align:start position:0%
you're automatically admitted into nhti
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
or the university college system please
 
00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:41.919 align:start position:0%
contact us to pursue this is there a
 
00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:43.640 align:start position:0%
problem with getting that data and needs
 
00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:45.799 align:start position:0%
a statutory fix or is that something
 
00:27:47.789 --> 00:27:47.799 align:start position:0%
that they can do by sending a letter for
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
you so we don't have to deal with them
 
00:27:51.509 --> 00:27:51.519 align:start position:0%
giving personal data to the to the
 
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
university system or the college system
 
00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
I I I think that would be ideal for
 
00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Education do I defer
 
00:28:01.509 --> 00:28:01.519 align:start position:0%
director applebe I believe in fact there
 
00:28:03.149 --> 00:28:03.159 align:start position:0%
are some limitations on what the
 
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is able to
 
00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
families thank you uh Steve Alby
 
00:28:19.389 --> 00:28:19.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Education um my
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
understanding this is not my area in the
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
department we actually have a meeting uh
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
the vice Chancellor and director myself
 
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
uh and one of my other uh fellow
 
00:28:31.149 --> 00:28:31.159 align:start position:0%
directors as well this week next week
 
00:28:33.549 --> 00:28:33.559 align:start position:0%
it's coming right up to look at this
 
00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:35.240 align:start position:0%
issue but my understanding is some of
 
00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
the issues are contract with college
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
board or whoever the test provider is
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
that we get this info from that we can't
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
take that info that we have access to
 
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
and give it out I believe that's that's
 
00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:51.039 align:start position:0%
the issue so we're meeting it's either
 
00:28:53.509 --> 00:28:53.519 align:start position:0%
this week or next to see what we need to
 
00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:55.640 align:start position:0%
do to go back to the vendor to modify
 
00:28:57.789 --> 00:28:57.799 align:start position:0%
the contract so we can then use that
 
00:28:59.509 --> 00:28:59.519 align:start position:0%
data whether it's us sending something
 
00:29:03.149 --> 00:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
out or sharing that information with the
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
systems and this is the app that someone
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
was just talking about that you're
 
00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
talking about what what is the kind no
 
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
that's a different so that's probably
 
00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
Naviance is that it the app yeah so a
 
00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
lot of our our high schools use a use a
 
00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
post-secondary planning tool um and for
 
00:29:21.789 --> 00:29:21.799 align:start position:0%
my kids it was Naviance was the name of
 
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
the company and colleges put in you know
 
00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
information into this other
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
post-secondary opportunity information
 
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
goes into this and um students then
 
00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
access that to try and figure out what
 
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
do they want to do next in life so it it
 
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:42.909 --> 00:29:42.919 align:start position:0%
counselors so again maybe this is a
 
00:29:44.909 --> 00:29:44.919 align:start position:0%
question to Rick and and and and Ruth
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
but um but it's the whole point of what
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is to make sure
 
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
instate students stay in state right so
 
00:29:52.909 --> 00:29:52.919 align:start position:0%
we have to get directly and let them
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
know early and early on that you have
 
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
direct admission already to the
 
00:29:58.590 --> 00:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
community college system or
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
how do we what is needed to make that
 
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
work again that may not every student is
 
00:30:04.509 --> 00:30:04.519 align:start position:0%
already thinking about college they may
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
not be using the application thinking
 
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
about their postc where they're going to
 
00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:09.919 align:start position:0%
go to college right but getting a letter
 
00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:12.200 align:start position:0%
will spur that convers spur that thought
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
especially like I'm already admitted I
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
could just go find out and go right and
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
so what is the limitation to making that
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
happen yeah I I think the limitation on
 
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
our end is who can we share data with
 
00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
and is it contractual that's holding us
 
00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
back is a state statute that's holding
 
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
us back who can we share contact
 
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
information with which but again I guess
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
that's the information I want to know
 
00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:38.039 align:start position:0%
right again if it's a statutory problem
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
I want to fix it right and get the data
 
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
the goal is again to encourage as many
 
00:30:43.509 --> 00:30:43.519 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students to stay in New
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and 10 to Hampshire colleges
 
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
right and so if that's the purpose then
 
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
let's get the law out of the way if the
 
00:30:51.389 --> 00:30:51.399 align:start position:0%
law is the problem and solve it so that
 
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
we can get these letters out to our
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
Juniors and seniors and get them know
 
00:30:56.909 --> 00:30:56.919 align:start position:0%
that UNH is is an option PSU is an
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
option keen st's and option the
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
community college system is an option
 
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
let them know like you're already
 
00:31:03.269 --> 00:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
admitted just click the link and fill
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
out whatever you know where you want
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
what you want to do um kind of thing so
 
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
I guess I want just want to know where
 
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
that problem is so I guess that's going
 
00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
to be my first ask is let's get that
 
00:31:13.389 --> 00:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
data back to us so we know where the
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
problem is and in facilitating that I'll
 
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
get that answer back to you absolutely
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
you want to say something yeah yes I do
 
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
Madam chair um yes we had this problem
 
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
when we were dealing with the College
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
Board in the past of accessing the
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
parents information so they could tend
 
00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:31.480 align:start position:0%
send the SAT scores directly to the
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
parent rather than having come back to
 
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:35.480 align:start position:0%
the school school to the parent that
 
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:37.240 align:start position:0%
delayed the whole process that took
 
00:31:40.269 --> 00:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
statutory change to allow that to
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
occur Senator Lang is correct it
 
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't take much of a legislative fix
 
00:31:46.629 --> 00:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
to fix that portion but I don't think
 
00:31:48.789 --> 00:31:48.799 align:start position:0%
this is the problem with what we're
 
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
talking about I think the problem is
 
00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:53.919 align:start position:0%
that here we are now in the month of
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
March and we have students right now
 
00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
that are starting to
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
College as Juniors and looking to put
 
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
families together as far as family trips
 
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:06.200 align:start position:0%
what once we going to go visit what are
 
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
we going to see what are you thinking
 
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
about doing with your life therea high
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
school and so I I just can't understand
 
00:32:17.629 --> 00:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
why we can't get information out
 
00:32:19.389 --> 00:32:19.399 align:start position:0%
directly to the
 
00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
schools regarding hey we have this
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
direct admission program come visit us
 
00:32:27.389 --> 00:32:27.399 align:start position:0%
or you know look at our campus down in
 
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
Kean or Plymouth or UNH uh think about
 
00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
us as instate we can help you out and
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
and you know have those counselors or
 
00:32:40.509 --> 00:32:40.519 align:start position:0%
the schools get at least a a postcard to
 
00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:42.679 align:start position:0%
the kids right now if in fact we can't
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
direct mail to the address of the
 
00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
student and that needs to be worked out
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
so we can do
 
00:32:52.509 --> 00:32:52.519 align:start position:0%
that I just want to be here next march
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
to have a same conversation so that's
 
00:32:56.269 --> 00:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
all so let's get a fix let's find out
 
00:32:59.310 --> 00:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
what find out what's necessary um again
 
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
if it's statutory we'll work through
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
that um but I think again to Rick's
 
00:33:05.549 --> 00:33:05.559 align:start position:0%
Point kids should have you know students
 
00:33:06.909 --> 00:33:06.919 align:start position:0%
should have a letter in the mailbox
 
00:33:08.669 --> 00:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
right now saying hey you've already been
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
admitted to un and you've already been
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
aditt in HTI assuming you keep your your
 
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
course going your your academic progress
 
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
going so reach out let's go let's move
 
00:33:21.789 --> 00:33:21.799 align:start position:0%
this right and and let them know um
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
right up the bat I still want to be back
 
00:33:29.549 --> 00:33:29.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
switch go ahead just a quick comment um
 
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
maybe the public schools aren't as
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic about losing students uh as
 
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
we think they might be but um the other
 
00:33:41.669 --> 00:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
thing I wanted to mention when we had
 
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
this I was President North Shore of
 
00:33:47.389 --> 00:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
community college for 13 years um we
 
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
picked up students under this program
 
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
who are having trouble adapting to the
 
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
public school environment including
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
students on IEPs because I had a massive
 
00:33:59.549 --> 00:33:59.559 align:start position:0%
student and IEPs hit a ball when they
 
00:34:01.629 --> 00:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
graduate from high
 
00:34:04.149 --> 00:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
school and so they would show up in this
 
00:34:07.389 --> 00:34:07.399 align:start position:0%
crowd and and and flourish because they
 
00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
were in a different environment in a
 
00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
class with adults not other teenagers
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
that might make fun of them and and that
 
00:34:16.829 --> 00:34:16.839 align:start position:0%
was a big advantage of the program as
 
00:34:20.829 --> 00:34:20.839 align:start position:0%
well um I I can't answer uh chairman
 
00:34:22.589 --> 00:34:22.599 align:start position:0%
last's question
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
about that but um I'm wondering if
 
00:34:28.069 --> 00:34:28.079 align:start position:0%
there's something else going on why
 
00:34:30.669 --> 00:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they want their students to go
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
in this program you were a
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
superintendent one didn't you I can't
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
imagine any kind of a high school
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
principal or administrator in a district
 
00:34:43.869 --> 00:34:43.879 align:start position:0%
saying uh we don't want to do this I
 
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
think it's just basically have those
 
00:34:49.069 --> 00:34:49.079 align:start position:0%
cards been sent out have are they aware
 
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
that there this program is available
 
00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:53.720 align:start position:0%
they should know it as Juniors right now
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
I have a junior and outside the state in
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
another school and we're already
 
00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
thinking about you know we got the Fisk
 
00:35:02.349 --> 00:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
book out you know the one with all the
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
different colleges Best Buy this and
 
00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at that and saying
 
00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
well where are we going to go this this
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
spring or this summer and start looking
 
00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:14.440 align:start position:0%
at these schools and I and uh for the
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
students we we talked one of the other
 
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
areas which we addressed within this
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
task force report was affordability and
 
00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:23.240 align:start position:0%
accessibility well the schools here in
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
our state are accessible and they are if
 
00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
we if we can let them know that there's
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
some affordability issues like gr
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
Granite guarantee uh which might be also
 
00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
informative information for these
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
Juniors that yeah you can stay right
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
here and go down to Keane and have a
 
00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:47.630 align:start position:0%
here and go down to Keane and have a
wonderful

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:51.069 --> 00:35:51.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
three I just want to say we're on it
 
00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
we'll we we'll Circle back the one thing
 
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
I I will point out though is um in my
 
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
opinion we don't just want to focus on
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
the College Board because those are
 
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
students who are taking the sat there
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
are lots of other students who and and
 
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
we talk a little bit about this in the
 
00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:16.280 align:start position:0%
report um right now because there is
 
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:18.280 align:start position:0%
this disconnect we can get the data
 
00:36:20.109 --> 00:36:20.119 align:start position:0%
about the college board but we're going
 
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
to be a little inconsistent until we can
 
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
have a process in place to make sure we
 
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
can get to all students regardless of
 
00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not take the SAT so this is
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
the gap and I think director applebe was
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
touching upon it with the contractual
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
relationship with the College Board
 
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
student can sign up to take the SAT and
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
some students do but the state also has
 
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
contracted with the College Board to do
 
00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
assessment and so every virtually every
 
00:36:49.309 --> 00:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
11th grader and it's that gap between
 
00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
the students who independently sign up
 
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:53.560 align:start position:0%
where we can reach out to the College
 
00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
Board in essence pay for information
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
about those students to reach them and
 
00:36:59.390 --> 00:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
that group of students who have not
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
independently signed up for the SAT
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
whose only information would be through
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
the college board but again we're
 
00:37:08.829 --> 00:37:08.839 align:start position:0%
present in every High School in the
 
00:37:10.829 --> 00:37:10.839 align:start position:0%
state we can reach the students who will
 
00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
come to the table and sit down with us
 
00:37:14.589 --> 00:37:14.599 align:start position:0%
but to be able to reach every student
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
every family and as I said before not
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
everybody needs or is interested in
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
going to college but the kind of college
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
level learning that a student can have
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
through our programs gives them a found
 
00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:29.240 align:start position:0%
Foundation if they want to go into the
 
00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
military some foundational training that
 
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
may be helpful for a specialty that they
 
00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
want to pursue just has a range of
 
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
benefits that encourage students who may
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
not be confident that they have the
 
00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
potential to be successful as
 
00:37:44.109 --> 00:37:44.119 align:start position:0%
representative Burton said some students
 
00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:45.800 align:start position:0%
find themselves thriving in a different
 
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
set of circumstances we want to give
 
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
options to to number three I I think
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
both cancer prevention and I have both
 
00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
referenced in the first two uh House
 
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
Bill 1530 we ought to note the key
 
00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor and that was representative lad
 
00:38:06.589 --> 00:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
that became the foundation for a
 
00:38:08.589 --> 00:38:08.599 align:start position:0%
significant amount of work that
 
00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:11.560 align:start position:0%
continues building well articulated
 
00:38:14.109 --> 00:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
Pathways between uh the Community
 
00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
College systems programs and the
 
00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
University Systems programs giving
 
00:38:20.349 --> 00:38:20.359 align:start position:0%
students road maps now across a hundred
 
00:38:22.309 --> 00:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
different programs that map from
 
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
virtually any of our our seven colleges
 
00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
to any of the three us and H
 
00:38:28.589 --> 00:38:28.599 align:start position:0%
institutions that that ensure that
 
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
students have a way of of mapping their
 
00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
future not squandering time and
 
00:38:36.309 --> 00:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity and
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
cost and on in that VIN um academic
 
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
advisers have been trained um we have a
 
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
we call it an Outreach Enrollment Center
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
it's half a dozen people at the
 
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
University system works on a whole
 
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
variety of projects but um phone calls
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
texts emails to stay connected to
 
00:38:59.950 --> 00:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
students and and so that group um is
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
being leveraged to stay in contact with
 
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
these students who may have questions
 
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
Point them in the right direction um
 
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
make folks aware of of what those
 
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.190 align:start position:0%
make folks aware of of what those
opportunities

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
are there there was one question we had
 
00:39:16.589 --> 00:39:16.599 align:start position:0%
on that would the application of
 
00:39:20.109 --> 00:39:20.119 align:start position:0%
software test transfer something
 
00:39:20.119 --> 00:39:21.750 align:start position:0%
software test transfer something
something

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
system E I don't know transfer
 
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
equivalency system okay um so have we
 
00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:30.440 align:start position:0%
made any progress with that in terms of
 
00:39:32.589 --> 00:39:32.599 align:start position:0%
these 100 plus different Pathways now
 
00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
that we've really aligned up we have
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
made some progress um UNH is standing up
 
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
tests I think and I'm correct me if I
 
00:39:44.109 --> 00:39:44.119 align:start position:0%
get these wrong because there's another
 
00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
one called transferology that we're
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
still evaluating but test is the
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
transfer equivalency and and we are
 
00:39:54.309 --> 00:39:54.319 align:start position:0%
making progress on that and ccsnh began
 
00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:57.640 align:start position:0%
to Pilot tests at National community
 
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
College we're in the process of of uh
 
00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:02.079 align:start position:0%
filling a position for somebody who will
 
00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:03.880 align:start position:0%
have responsibility for doing that
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.589 --> 00:40:10.599 align:start position:0%
systemwide is that a delay thank you so
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
again to tie this back to our last
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
conversation right we were talking about
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
the matriculation of students rolling in
 
00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:17.480 align:start position:0%
whether it's a high school student
 
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
rolling in the community college system
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
or the university system or the
 
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
community college system rolling into
 
00:40:26.109 --> 00:40:26.119 align:start position:0%
the four-year University system um again
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
have we we made alignment
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
and and our students like hey you just
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
you just graduated a two-year RN degree
 
00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
if you want to go on to you to the
 
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
university system here's all the
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
fouryear you uh RN degrees you could get
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
in the schools that provideed that kind
 
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:43.480 align:start position:0%
of mapping the show that here here's
 
00:40:45.309 --> 00:40:45.319 align:start position:0%
what I got in Community College by my
 
00:40:47.309 --> 00:40:47.319 align:start position:0%
associates was in this and that'll all
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
transfer to the college system here's
 
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
the programs and schools that offer
 
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
those programs we have that kind of
 
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
mapping so that's it's Unique to the
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
student again I if I'm a nursing student
 
00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
I don't really want anything about
 
00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:57.950 align:start position:0%
I don't really want anything about
engineering

00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
engineering
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
right and so uh so telling me that you
 
00:41:01.309 --> 00:41:01.319 align:start position:0%
know University system has an
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
engineering program is not going to be
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
useful to me but you tell me they've got
 
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
more Healthcare programs that my
 
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
community college degree will transfer
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
into are we doing any of that we're
 
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
we're we're part way there if you go to
 
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
the UNH website for transfer what you
 
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
will find is a map for any program that
 
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
you're interested in will take you to
 
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
the institution's degree program show
 
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
you how your CC SNH associate degree
 
00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
aligns with the course requirements to
 
00:41:33.309 --> 00:41:33.319 align:start position:0%
complete the bachelor's degrees it shows
 
00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:35.839 align:start position:0%
up as a PDF which is a little bit less
 
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
Dynamic than you would ideally want so
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
the next phase of this is to have
 
00:41:42.589 --> 00:41:42.599 align:start position:0%
something that's more interactive where
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
a student can do almost um what if
 
00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
scenarios what if I take these courses
 
00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
what choices will I have as opposed to
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
having to sort of map from from a
 
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
particular degree at a particular
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
institution the long-term goal is that a
 
00:42:00.589 --> 00:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
student would be able to put together a
 
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
series of scenarios to know that this
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
set of courses could take me this way or
 
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
could take me this way keep in mind
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
general education course is going to be
 
00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:13.480 align:start position:0%
widely fluid um but if you're are
 
00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:15.160 align:start position:0%
interested in a science technology
 
00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:18.079 align:start position:0%
engineering math uh field you know which
 
00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:19.720 align:start position:0%
math courses are going to be relevant
 
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
which ones are going to become electives
 
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
that may or may not be useful so to give
 
00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
students more tools more interactive
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
tools to map is the next phase of this
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
that we've got to get to thank you
 
00:42:32.589 --> 00:42:32.599 align:start position:0%
welcome have
 
00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:35.839 align:start position:0%
question as we discussed this you just
 
00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
becomes more interesting to me that we
 
00:42:40.549 --> 00:42:40.559 align:start position:0%
we have the concurrent dual enrollment
 
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
program where the kid can take so many
 
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
courses at in the 10th 11th and 12th
 
00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
grade when a a student ends up having
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
taken well you know you take let's say
 
00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
six credit hours during one year so
 
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
multiply that by three there's so 18
 
00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
credits when you're notifying them that
 
00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
hey you have the option to come have
 
00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
direct enrollment and admission to this
 
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
school but you also are carrying 18
 
00:43:10.349 --> 00:43:10.359 align:start position:0%
credits you might be almost a second
 
00:43:13.309 --> 00:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
year you know semester freshman um
 
00:43:15.069 --> 00:43:15.079 align:start position:0%
that's also encouraging to somebody to
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
stay in a state and the final the
 
00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
question I have how many of these kids
 
00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
are using these courses they get through
 
00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
running start to come to New Hampshire
 
00:43:25.549 --> 00:43:25.559 align:start position:0%
or they just carrying that load
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
somewhere else to go to school like you
 
00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
Mass um as I shared earlier we know that
 
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
over an extended period of time we've
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
had 6,000 of the 35,000 come to ccsnh
 
00:43:40.589 --> 00:43:40.599 align:start position:0%
and about 6600 enroll at usnh in any
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
given year about 10% of the recent high
 
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
school graduates come directly to CCS
 
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
andh over the next four years we
 
00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:49.839 align:start position:0%
actually see almost one in five of those
 
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
students whether they started somewhere
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
else or they simply took longer before
 
00:43:53.599 --> 00:43:55.030 align:start position:0%
else or they simply took longer before
they

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:43:57.069 --> 00:43:57.079 align:start position:0%
matriculated but but we know that
 
00:43:58.950 --> 00:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
students are making use and that all
 
00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:01.480 align:start position:0%
predates having these solid Pathways the
 
00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
assumption is that and and it needs to
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
be tested but the assumption is that if
 
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
we do a better job of building Pathways
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
and not just the courses but building
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
experience for students the opportunity
 
00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
to come and visit our campuses to meet
 
00:44:16.829 --> 00:44:16.839 align:start position:0%
with our faculty to see the facilities
 
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.079 align:start position:0%
that we have the university system has
 
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
that over the course of those two or
 
00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
three years where they're taking these
 
00:44:24.589 --> 00:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
early college courses we can cultivate
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
relationships that encourage the
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
likelihood that they will follow through
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity may I follow follow love
 
00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:33.790 align:start position:0%
opportunity may I follow follow love
this

00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
conversation so the the students which
 
00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:37.640 align:start position:0%
are taking advantage of the concurrent
 
00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
dual enrollment program I was probably
 
00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:42.680 align:start position:0%
surmised that many of them are doing it
 
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
because M or dad pushing or that there's
 
00:44:49.309 --> 00:44:49.319 align:start position:0%
a a support for higher education within
 
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
that family we need to really be
 
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
targeting as you've mentioned before
 
00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
Mark Tumi that these kids which maybe
 
00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
didn't have any intention of going to
 
00:44:59.230 --> 00:44:59.240 align:start position:0%
school or maybe not coming out of a
 
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
family like that uh are you seeing a
 
00:45:05.069 --> 00:45:05.079 align:start position:0%
higher proportion of an improving
 
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
proportion of students which are now
 
00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
taking advantage that which are going to
 
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:13.720 align:start position:0%
higher ed which before hadn't it it's
 
00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
going to take time to fully realize what
 
00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
the potential is we assume that the
 
00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
majority of students who had been doing
 
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
this in the past were the students who
 
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
would either take an AP or an honors
 
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
course or in this case an early college
 
00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:28.280 align:start position:0%
course they already had intended to go
 
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
to college their families already have a
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
plan as this begins to grow and
 
00:45:35.309 --> 00:45:35.319 align:start position:0%
particularly the place where it's grown
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
most notably over the last few years as
 
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
I mentioned earli about 30% of the
 
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
students participating are enrolled in
 
00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
CTE centers three years ago that was
 
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
less than 15% we're starting to see
 
00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
growth in participation among students
 
00:45:52.109 --> 00:45:52.119 align:start position:0%
who are in programs that better align
 
00:45:54.069 --> 00:45:54.079 align:start position:0%
with some of our technical programs who
 
00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
might not have fully appreciated that
 
00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
there's a post-sec
 
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
postsecondary degree aligned with their
 
00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
career interest that will actually
 
00:46:04.109 --> 00:46:04.119 align:start position:0%
strengthen their position in New
 
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:06.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Workforce so we are starting
 
00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
to see students who probably in the past
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
would not have been looking at this as
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
school I have a question on the uh
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
possibility of a three-year bachelor
 
00:46:24.309 --> 00:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
degree sure I see that you're not
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
requiring 96 uh credits how how many
 
00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:30.440 align:start position:0%
credits for a fouryear degree 120 how
 
00:46:36.549 --> 00:46:36.559 align:start position:0%
many 120 120 so there significantly less
 
00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
what is eliminated from a three from a
 
00:46:41.309 --> 00:46:41.319 align:start position:0%
three-year program from a four-year
 
00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:43.400 align:start position:0%
program to manage a three-year program
 
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
this so this um will be considered a
 
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
professional bachelor's degree I think
 
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
that's the the terminology um some
 
00:46:54.309 --> 00:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
electives uh may be eliminated actually
 
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
Plymouth um will have all five of these
 
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
stood up this fall and um oh maybe it's
 
00:47:04.589 --> 00:47:04.599 align:start position:0%
applied applied bachelor's degree not
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
professional and so some electives will
 
00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
be um not part of the degree um Senator
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know exactly for each of those
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
five programs which courses will not be
 
00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
part of the the degree um but again I
 
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
will surmise it's it's a and I can get
 
00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
that for you if it would be helpful and
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
this is these were just approved by our
 
00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:32.440 align:start position:0%
regional crediting board Nei in the
 
00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
fall it's
 
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
um there are other institutions around
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
the country that have um adopted the
 
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
same type of Applied bachelor's degree
 
00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
you know it's really part of meeting
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
students where they are and as chancell
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
Rubenstein talked about you know the
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities for high school student to
 
00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:55.160 align:start position:0%
almost complete an associates degree
 
00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
some may Embrace that some may not not
 
00:47:59.430 --> 00:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's Again part of meeting our
 
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
students where they are so Plymouth is
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
the only one so far the only one so far
 
00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
is Plymouth that's right they they um
 
00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:08.200 align:start position:0%
and actually when I touched face with
 
00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
them late last week they've accept we
 
00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:13.640 align:start position:0%
don't the deposits aren't due yet so we
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
have some deposits in but I probably
 
00:48:18.349 --> 00:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't pay my deposit in
 
00:48:22.109 --> 00:48:22.119 align:start position:0%
advance um they've accepted 149
 
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
applicants into those five programs so
 
00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
far and 95 of those are um the business
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
administration applied bachelor's degree
 
00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
I'm just thinking right now there's a
 
00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
big need for teachers for example would
 
00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
that fit in eventually into a three-year
 
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
program um I I am going to surmise we
 
00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:44.200 align:start position:0%
would need to work with the Department
 
00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:46.040 align:start position:0%
of Education right because there's
 
00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
certifications and and so I don't know
 
00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
all of the requirements necessary to be
 
00:48:52.789 --> 00:48:52.799 align:start position:0%
a certified teacher in the
 
00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
state I I can add a little bit to that
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
seeing I've gone through that those
 
00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
there's certain internship program
 
00:49:02.789 --> 00:49:02.799 align:start position:0%
student teaching that's required um it's
 
00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
a very comprehensive process and and so
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
at this point in time I would suggest
 
00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
that we we don't look we look at these
 
00:49:14.349 --> 00:49:14.359 align:start position:0%
trade areas like the cyber security like
 
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
the police training program the robotics
 
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
the outdoor recreation those are the
 
00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
type of programs which I know president
 
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
Burks looked into in with his community
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
and with his staff it's important
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
important to know that these programs
 
00:49:28.829 --> 00:49:28.839 align:start position:0%
are not just coming out of
 
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
administration they've been approved by
 
00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
their staff and professors and assistant
 
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
professors and adjuncts that are
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
teaching these courses they're all on
 
00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
board and that makes the program
 
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
successful well there must have been a
 
00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:45.640 align:start position:0%
survey which programs have the
 
00:49:48.349 --> 00:49:48.359 align:start position:0%
highest uh
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
need yes and they work with their their
 
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
provos Mr bich up there who has done
 
00:49:57.950 --> 00:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
survey work with his staff with the
 
00:49:59.870 --> 00:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
community and I think that's how they
 
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
arrived at where they're going to go
 
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
with these five courses and I think it's
 
00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
a fantastic idea could it also hits the
 
00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:07.240 align:start position:0%
idea of
 
00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
affordability and and gets the students
 
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
out into the real world to learn that a
 
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
dollar is a dollar and perhaps the
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
student who representative last
 
00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
suggested had accumulated 18 credits in
 
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
high school that might most of them may
 
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
be able to transfer to the three your
 
00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
college unless they're taken a lot of
 
00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
electives agreed and again it would be
 
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
part of the pathway right these these
 
00:50:36.829 --> 00:50:36.839 align:start position:0%
Stu these courses in the early college
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
will map to these programs and these
 
00:50:45.309 --> 00:50:45.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
institutions again I'm encouraged by
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
this right I understand you got to walk
 
00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
you know you got to crawl before you
 
00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
walk right and I think we're still in
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
the crawling stage we got our first five
 
00:50:56.109 --> 00:50:56.119 align:start position:0%
degree programs at one University I'm
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
sure Keen as it looks at its
 
00:50:58.829 --> 00:50:58.839 align:start position:0%
opportunities we'll be looking at
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
opportunities UNH same thing and each
 
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
have their own little Specialties and
 
00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
might have different three-year programs
 
00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
so I this is great work and a great
 
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
start to it I might go think about take
 
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
my threeyear police studies program up
 
00:51:14.349 --> 00:51:14.359 align:start position:0%
at PSU so I'll go have a chat with that
 
00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:18.200 align:start position:0%
H your back and angry Madam chair mam
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
chair please thank you um thank you m
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
chair thank you there is a huge audience
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
out there of partially completed college
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
students and you can get the data from
 
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
the loan there's a loan file and if they
 
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
get a letter saying you you've earned 20
 
00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
credits so far did you know if you come
 
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
to the Community College or a four-year
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
School in New Hampshire you can complete
 
00:51:44.549 --> 00:51:44.559 align:start position:0%
that degree and get your degree and get
 
00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
the ticket that that you
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
need some states are doing that
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
know yes I'm going I'm going to back up
 
00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
to number four because I'm I'm really
 
00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:01.640 align:start position:0%
excited about
 
00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
it um the university system office is
 
00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:07.720 align:start position:0%
relocating to the New Hampshire
 
00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:11.720 align:start position:0%
Technical Institute campus um we'll be
 
00:52:14.309 --> 00:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
occupying the bill building right behind
 
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
Chancellor Rubenstein on the campus I
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
I'm confident that we'll we already
 
00:52:21.549 --> 00:52:21.559 align:start position:0%
spend quite a bit of quality time
 
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
together but I'm sure this will improve
 
00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
collaboration um we are scheduled to
 
00:52:29.549 --> 00:52:29.559 align:start position:0%
move it constructions underway right now
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
um to get the building ready and uh we
 
00:52:36.829 --> 00:52:36.839 align:start position:0%
will be in there by July so it will um
 
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
save the university system about
 
00:52:42.549 --> 00:52:42.559 align:start position:0%
$250,000 a year in rent and provide a
 
00:52:45.069 --> 00:52:45.079 align:start position:0%
revenue stream to the community college
 
00:52:47.589 --> 00:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
system at the same time so in my opinion
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
it's a win-win all around to to occupy a
 
00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
a building on the Community College on
 
00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:55.720 align:start position:0%
the nhti campus that was underutilized
 
00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:58.589 align:start position:0%
the nhti campus that was underutilized
so

00:52:58.589 --> 00:52:58.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
I I think it's also worth noting that's
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
a clear physical symbol but the
 
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
conversations Chancellor preventure and
 
00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
I and our respective colleagues have
 
00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
been happing about other opportunities
 
00:53:11.069 --> 00:53:11.079 align:start position:0%
for administrative uh collaboration are
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
are continuing to grow and I think we'll
 
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
both recognize savings from those
 
00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
efforts but also more seamless uh
 
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
interaction between the two systems that
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
will benefit our students over time and
 
00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
um just following up on the Chancellor's
 
00:53:29.789 --> 00:53:29.799 align:start position:0%
comments there there have been a number
 
00:53:29.799 --> 00:53:31.069 align:start position:0%
comments there there have been a number
of

00:53:31.069 --> 00:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:53:34.789 --> 00:53:34.799 align:start position:0%
administrative um collaborations so the
 
00:53:39.309 --> 00:53:39.319 align:start position:0%
university system has an e-procurement
 
00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
tool it application that that it uses um
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
we were able to secure I think three
 
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
seats in that tool for the community
 
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
college system pre of charge so now the
 
00:53:55.109 --> 00:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
community college system we can leverage
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
scale um give ccsnh access to our
 
00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
contracts vice versa um the next wave of
 
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
that might be some um better
 
00:54:05.309 --> 00:54:05.319 align:start position:0%
collaboration into the contracts
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
management tool that's part of it so
 
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
that's one example we're having
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
conversations around can we share risk
 
00:54:16.829 --> 00:54:16.839 align:start position:0%
management um resources can we share
 
00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
facilities and capital anything again
 
00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:21.030 align:start position:0%
facilities and capital anything again
both

00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:24.200 align:start position:0%
systems um we have some headwinds and so
 
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
we need to be looking for efficiency at
 
00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
every turn and so it's
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
um this this work has just provided the
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
platform for the two systems to work
 
00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:38.270 align:start position:0%
platform for the two systems to work
closely

00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
closely
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
together so the two systems are
 
00:54:43.789 --> 00:54:43.799 align:start position:0%
sufficiently similar so that the staff
 
00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
won't be
 
00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
confused can you actually share the same
 
00:54:53.789 --> 00:54:53.799 align:start position:0%
Personnel well so so um in some areas
 
00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
certainly not all in some areas so let's
 
00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
talk about when I say risk management
 
00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:02.200 align:start position:0%
well both systems have to have insurance
 
00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:03.400 align:start position:0%
on their
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
buildings um so maybe there's a resource
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
that we don't need of two full-time
 
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
people maybe I don't know we can work
 
00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
out something that one Sy we could one
 
00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
system could pay the other system for
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
for part of
 
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
that employees time if you will um same
 
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
thing with capital planning and
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
Facilities is there is there some
 
00:55:28.029 --> 00:55:28.039 align:start position:0%
something there that we can leverage so
 
00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
those are things we're exploring
 
00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799 align:start position:0%
sometimes it it's a dead end but it's
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
question can I have six another question
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh for both of you um several years back
 
00:55:48.109 --> 00:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
we were
 
00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
informed that there was a program that
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
was offered down UNH and Durham that
 
00:55:55.309 --> 00:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
they were going to move up to Plymouth
 
00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
State I believe it was the athletic
 
00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:59.349 align:start position:0%
State I believe it was the athletic
training

00:55:59.349 --> 00:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:56:03.150 --> 00:56:03.160 align:start position:0%
program and I think that's that's a good
 
00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
idea to be looking at our curriculum and
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
our offerings that way uh seeing that
 
00:56:09.029 --> 00:56:09.039 align:start position:0%
that you know rather than having
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
something split apart bring it together
 
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:13.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of what we've been just talking
 
00:56:16.029 --> 00:56:16.039 align:start position:0%
about from your side in terms of
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
managing contracts and business aspects
 
00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
and all that are we now starting to
 
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
engage in when a school like for example
 
00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:26.559 align:start position:0%
Plymouth came out and said we're going
 
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
to go in these five Cur our small
 
00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:31.549 align:start position:0%
to go in these five Cur our small
three-year

00:56:31.549 --> 00:56:31.559 align:start position:0%
three-year
 
00:56:35.309 --> 00:56:35.319 align:start position:0%
courses if if say Kean or UNH is saying
 
00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to go this direction is
 
00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
there any kind of prior to going that
 
00:56:42.789 --> 00:56:42.799 align:start position:0%
direction there's a communication with
 
00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
the central office of both right here
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
the at the Chancellor's level saying
 
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
wait a minute we're starting to
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
duplicate a program we have over here
 
00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:55.160 align:start position:0%
and that's going to you know split
 
00:56:57.789 --> 00:56:57.799 align:start position:0%
little Revenue that we have have going
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
the directions maybe we better putting
 
00:57:03.309 --> 00:57:03.319 align:start position:0%
it all in one pot um yes representative
 
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
lad absolutely that is part of the
 
00:57:07.789 --> 00:57:07.799 align:start position:0%
process there there are Provost meet
 
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
monthly um and before any new programs
 
00:57:13.109 --> 00:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
are rolled
 
00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
out there is conversation this just
 
00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
happened within the last couple months
 
00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:20.559 align:start position:0%
there's conversation
 
00:57:23.069 --> 00:57:23.079 align:start position:0%
around I'm I want to start this program
 
00:57:24.549 --> 00:57:24.559 align:start position:0%
what's at your school what's at your
 
00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
school now the the the the real bang for
 
00:57:31.309 --> 00:57:31.319 align:start position:0%
the buck will come when
 
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
when our online infrastructure
 
00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:36.109 align:start position:0%
when our online infrastructure
systemwide

00:57:36.109 --> 00:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
systemwide
 
00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
is humming at 100% because what we'd
 
00:57:42.829 --> 00:57:42.839 align:start position:0%
like what we need to be able to do is
 
00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
have a student um take a maybe they're
 
00:57:50.589 --> 00:57:50.599 align:start position:0%
they're living and studying at
 
00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
un and that course isn't offered there
 
00:57:56.589 --> 00:57:56.599 align:start position:0%
because they've eliminated the athletic
 
00:57:59.029 --> 00:57:59.039 align:start position:0%
training program but they have it at
 
00:57:59.039 --> 00:58:00.589 align:start position:0%
training program but they have it at
Plymouth

00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
Plymouth
 
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
so that we're working on that right now
 
00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
that has we
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
can't University system what understands
 
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
100% we can't do everything we're doing
 
00:58:14.589 --> 00:58:14.599 align:start position:0%
now it it doesn't work so how do we best
 
00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
leverage and integrate academic
 
00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
programming not just administrative work
 
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
but academic programming as well and our
 
00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:24.440 align:start position:0%
provos are working on that as we
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
speak can we have you know this is one
 
00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
of our long-term recommendations we have
 
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
in the governor's task force report and
 
00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
it talks about exploring offering
 
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
Community College courses and university
 
00:58:40.589 --> 00:58:40.599 align:start position:0%
courses at different
 
00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
locations uh
 
00:58:46.349 --> 00:58:46.359 align:start position:0%
and is there and it sort of aligns with
 
00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
what we just finished talking about of
 
00:58:54.309 --> 00:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
trying to you know offer at his campus
 
00:58:56.190 --> 00:58:56.200 align:start position:0%
the course which is actually made
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
streamed over here at that course but
 
00:59:00.109 --> 00:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
it's it's I think that's a real cost
 
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
saving to the student um do you have any
 
00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
kind of information on on how we're
 
00:59:06.829 --> 00:59:06.839 align:start position:0%
moving in that direction as far as the
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
number of courses we're actually trying
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
to do this now in I don't have details
 
00:59:15.029 --> 00:59:15.039 align:start position:0%
on the number of courses representative
 
00:59:15.039 --> 00:59:16.549 align:start position:0%
on the number of courses representative
lad

00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
lad
 
00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
I will guess in the next few months I
 
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
will we will have details on on courses
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
as I said the provot are working through
 
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
this question right now now
 
00:59:30.510 --> 00:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
MH we know that's where we have to
 
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
go I hope so you know that's that's
 
00:59:34.589 --> 00:59:34.599 align:start position:0%
where one of the reasons why we hired
 
00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:37.720 align:start position:0%
the president down at UNH she is very
 
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
involved in what she did out in
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
Washington in that state college system
 
00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
of bringing them under one accreditation
 
00:59:46.069 --> 00:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
which I think you're aiming at Mark a
 
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
little bit with the community college
 
00:59:49.230 --> 00:59:49.240 align:start position:0%
system with single
 
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
accreditation that's a perfect lead in
 
00:59:53.829 --> 00:59:53.839 align:start position:0%
Chancellor preventure just said a
 
00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
perfect lead into to the sixth item
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
we began last year to to evaluate the
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity for single accreditation
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
regional accreditation is a single
 
01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
Statewide Community
 
01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
College it's a
 
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
substantial and complicated decision we
 
01:00:17.309 --> 01:00:17.319 align:start position:0%
didn't want to ask our board to rush
 
01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:19.720 align:start position:0%
into that so we've spent the better part
 
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:21.720 align:start position:0%
of the last year working with the
 
01:00:23.309 --> 01:00:23.319 align:start position:0%
national Center for higher education
 
01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
Management Systems asking them to do an
 
01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:29.640 align:start position:0%
objective analysis data informed and to
 
01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:32.839 align:start position:0%
develop a set of options for us we're
 
01:00:35.309 --> 01:00:35.319 align:start position:0%
expecting to receive a report this week
 
01:00:37.789 --> 01:00:37.799 align:start position:0%
we expect that our board will receive it
 
01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:39.640 align:start position:0%
this week and we'll share it widely with
 
01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
the legislature with other stakeholders
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
over the next few months to evaluate
 
01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
what makes sense one option is single
 
01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:49.160 align:start position:0%
accreditation and to some degree it has
 
01:00:52.029 --> 01:00:52.039 align:start position:0%
the potential to uh address some of the
 
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
issues that you just raised the
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
efficiency the UN removing some of the
 
01:00:59.549 --> 01:00:59.559 align:start position:0%
intra system competition that may exist
 
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
for enrollment in certain programs uh
 
01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
allowing students to more seamlessly
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
navigate and take courses where it makes
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
sense to them particularly for our
 
01:01:11.549 --> 01:01:11.559 align:start position:0%
population which rather than often
 
01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
living on campus on a residential uh for
 
01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
a residential institution our students
 
01:01:18.390 --> 01:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
are working adults by and large they may
 
01:01:20.789 --> 01:01:20.799 align:start position:0%
be working in nsha but they may live in
 
01:01:23.589 --> 01:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
conquer or they may live in in Littleton
 
01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:25.559 align:start position:0%
but they may have a job that takes them
 
01:01:25.559 --> 01:01:26.549 align:start position:0%
but they may have a job that takes them
to

01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:26.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
uh to to lonia so the ability for
 
01:01:32.589 --> 01:01:32.599 align:start position:0%
students to participate in curriculum
 
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
where it makes sense but not to lose
 
01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
ground because those pieces fit together
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
would be one potential benefit of single
 
01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
accreditation when we receive the report
 
01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
I anticipate though that we're going to
 
01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
see a range of options some of which may
 
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
be addressed not by changing
 
01:01:49.349 --> 01:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
accreditation but by changing
 
01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
institutional and system policies that
 
01:01:53.029 --> 01:01:53.039 align:start position:0%
allow students to get those same
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
benefits without as much structural
 
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
upheaval right now as you might know the
 
01:02:02.349 --> 01:02:02.359 align:start position:0%
national landscape and higher education
 
01:02:06.029 --> 01:02:06.039 align:start position:0%
is is complicated um and regional
 
01:02:08.910 --> 01:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
accreditation is an area of perhaps some
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
uncertainty so at least one part of the
 
01:02:13.789 --> 01:02:13.799 align:start position:0%
consideration is how much energy to put
 
01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
into uh addressing regional
 
01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
accreditation when that landscape is is
 
01:02:23.269 --> 01:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
fluid and and that effort may not be as
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
sensible but we are committed to
 
01:02:29.069 --> 01:02:29.079 align:start position:0%
looking at options that allow us to
 
01:02:32.309 --> 01:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
better serve students and to find
 
01:02:35.069 --> 01:02:35.079 align:start position:0%
efficiencies are certainly part of it
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
but as I've said in other settings I I
 
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
think postsecondary education is growth
 
01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
industry that there's going to be more
 
01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
demand for people to continue education
 
01:02:47.549 --> 01:02:47.559 align:start position:0%
over the 40 or 50 years of a working
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
life and we've got to figure out how to
 
01:02:53.029 --> 01:02:53.039 align:start position:0%
reallocate our resource and our energy
 
01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:55.480 align:start position:0%
to support that growth not simply think
 
01:02:58.109 --> 01:02:58.119 align:start position:0%
about the contraction of the traditional
 
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
age demographic so we would expect that
 
01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
within the next week or so we'll have a
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
report that will go first to our board
 
01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
and then be circulated across our system
 
01:03:10.510 --> 01:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
and beyond and we expect that'll be the
 
01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:13.160 align:start position:0%
basis for discussions and deliberations
 
01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
over the next couple of months to see if
 
01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
we can map out what the next step is for
 
01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:19.720 align:start position:0%
the community college
 
01:03:21.789 --> 01:03:21.799 align:start position:0%
system those of you who served in the
 
01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
legisl for any length of time know that
 
01:03:26.589 --> 01:03:26.599 align:start position:0%
that you don't make a single decisive
 
01:03:28.349 --> 01:03:28.359 align:start position:0%
decision and that's it for the future
 
01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
you make the right decision for the
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
foreseeable future knowing that you will
 
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
at some point perhaps revisit it to
 
01:03:37.789 --> 01:03:37.799 align:start position:0%
either sustain that direction or or
 
01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
modify as as circumstances and and data
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
dictate thank
 
01:03:49.950 --> 01:03:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
questions go ahead just one observation
 
01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:55.960 align:start position:0%
we through all of this we have to keep
 
01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
our eye on
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
quality what's happening at different
 
01:04:03.789 --> 01:04:03.799 align:start position:0%
levels and so forth um I happen to be in
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
the legislation when the when the system
 
01:04:05.839 --> 01:04:06.549 align:start position:0%
the legislation when the when the system
was

01:04:06.549 --> 01:04:06.559 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:04:10.029 --> 01:04:10.039 align:start position:0%
formed and John Tucker was speaker he
 
01:04:11.789 --> 01:04:11.799 align:start position:0%
was a Plymouth State
 
01:04:14.549 --> 01:04:14.559 align:start position:0%
graduate proud and he was worried about
 
01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
the image of the university and Flagship
 
01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
and two tugboats so he had the vision
 
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
for the system and it was first out at
 
01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:26.039 align:start position:0%
at the U Le traffic circle and and the
 
01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
president of unh was the chancellor of
 
01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
the system well three schools and um it
 
01:04:34.829 --> 01:04:34.839 align:start position:0%
was an interesting
 
01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:38.440 align:start position:0%
experience but this is a natural now
 
01:04:41.829 --> 01:04:41.839 align:start position:0%
step forward to to systematize it small
 
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
s and and to link things together but
 
01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
I've been through this before and you
 
01:04:50.549 --> 01:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
got to keep your eye on quality what's
 
01:04:52.029 --> 01:04:52.039 align:start position:0%
happening what
 
01:04:54.109 --> 01:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
distinguishes what happens at a college
 
01:04:56.829 --> 01:04:56.839 align:start position:0%
of University from a secondary school
 
01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
my so where are we in the agenda here
 
01:05:08.269 --> 01:05:08.279 align:start position:0%
how much have you covered to have them
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
number seven left like yeah there was
 
01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:12.839 align:start position:0%
just there was just one other item we
 
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
talked about six we tal yes um the
 
01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
chancellor I just talked about six um
 
01:05:21.309 --> 01:05:21.319 align:start position:0%
that the seventh item there's a
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation in the task force report
 
01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
that talks about engaging with business
 
01:05:30.549 --> 01:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
communities across the state um to build
 
01:05:32.589 --> 01:05:32.599 align:start position:0%
Partnerships with business industry
 
01:05:33.789 --> 01:05:33.799 align:start position:0%
public high
 
01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
Ed even k12 and we stand ready to
 
01:05:45.549 --> 01:05:45.559 align:start position:0%
participate in that um however it's I I
 
01:05:48.630 --> 01:05:48.640 align:start position:0%
um frankly it can't fall on public high
 
01:05:53.069 --> 01:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
industry business and industry needs to
 
01:05:58.269 --> 01:05:58.279 align:start position:0%
engage engage so the chancellor and I
 
01:06:01.069 --> 01:06:01.079 align:start position:0%
will um reach out
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
to Taylor Caswell the Department of
 
01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:07.240 align:start position:0%
Economic Affairs um we think there's
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
there are Regional the acronym is Cedars
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
development organizations across the
 
01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
state um I believe that would be the
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
place to start to engage bring HED to
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
the table so that so that there's a
 
01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
more communication back and forth
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
between the needs of employers and and
 
01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
highed so we just want that item hadn't
 
01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
been included in previous reports our
 
01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:44.200 align:start position:0%
status reports and we both thought it
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
important to include that we want to
 
01:06:47.309 --> 01:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
start that work we haven't started that
 
01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:51.559 align:start position:0%
work but really in in my opinion
 
01:06:55.150 --> 01:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
Bea needs to help drive that I think for
 
01:06:56.829 --> 01:06:56.839 align:start position:0%
students to have an opportunity for an
 
01:06:58.910 --> 01:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
internship it's always very very
 
01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:00.200 align:start position:0%
exciting for them because they can
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
actually see what the real life is and
 
01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
what what they can do and also maybe
 
01:07:08.349 --> 01:07:08.359 align:start position:0%
prevent them from continuing if they
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
realize that this is not what they want
 
01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
to do right 100% and and um across the
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
university system the the inter we are
 
01:07:18.589 --> 01:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
plugged in to employers through
 
01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
internship programs um I think a lot of
 
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
this is also about looking forward and
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
thinking about
 
01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
what does the what the does business and
 
01:07:31.269 --> 01:07:31.279 align:start position:0%
industry and our employers uh what does
 
01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
curriculum need to look like in the
 
01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
future how do we plan for that together
 
01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:37.880 align:start position:0%
all of those things with
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
internships um
 
01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
mentorships certificate programs it
 
01:07:44.549 --> 01:07:44.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't even have to be degree programs
 
01:07:47.069 --> 01:07:47.079 align:start position:0%
right what does what does business and
 
01:07:50.430 --> 01:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
industry need and how how do we deliver
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
on that and that to really have a
 
01:07:55.109 --> 01:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
partnership well into the future do you
 
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
expect the problems lining up enough uh
 
01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:02.200 align:start position:0%
internships or experiences in the actual
 
01:08:05.309 --> 01:08:05.319 align:start position:0%
industry well um much of the time what
 
01:08:09.309 --> 01:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
we find with internships is students out
 
01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
ofate students who participate in
 
01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
internship are twice as likely to stay
 
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
and work here in New
 
01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the tough part of internships
 
01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes is that they're not paid yeah
 
01:08:24.070 --> 01:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
and in this climate when a student can
 
01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
go work at Target part time for a good
 
01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
wage or not get paid when they need
 
01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
that's that's an issue as well the other
 
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
thing here in New Hampshire so many of
 
01:08:36.789 --> 01:08:36.799 align:start position:0%
our businesses are small businesses and
 
01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
so an internship program takes some
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure right so um there's
 
01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
there's support needed there that they
 
01:08:48.349 --> 01:08:48.359 align:start position:0%
might not have to to have an effective
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
internship program we're working with
 
01:08:53.189 --> 01:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
small businesses on that but it's it's
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
another challenge for our small smaller
 
01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
businesses in the
 
01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:00.279 align:start position:0%
state so there be a
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh fund that bigger businesses could
 
01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
contribute to they will give a stien to
 
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
the people who go to smaller businesses
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
they can't get the salary and I can see
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
that as an
 
01:09:15.630 --> 01:09:15.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity not that the small business
 
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
can actually pay the intern anything but
 
01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
they can get a grant money so they can
 
01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
afford to do
 
01:09:27.390 --> 01:09:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:29.789 --> 01:09:29.799 align:start position:0%
suppose have to after more
 
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
money if if I might if I might offer
 
01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
credit commissioner Caswell for having
 
01:09:37.229 --> 01:09:37.239 align:start position:0%
some foresight for a number of years
 
01:09:39.789 --> 01:09:39.799 align:start position:0%
he's talked about the need for three
 
01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
three-sided uh uh structure to this that
 
01:09:46.030 --> 01:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
includes higher education State policy
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
makers and business and industry at the
 
01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
same table to problem solve these kinds
 
01:09:53.349 --> 01:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
of issues Chancellor preter and I both
 
01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
meet regularly with commissioner Caswell
 
01:09:58.830 --> 01:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
as part of his Council of partner
 
01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
agencies I do think
 
01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
that likewise uh Chancellor prevention I
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
both are connected to the business and
 
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
industry Association so I think we have
 
01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
the right players we just need to find
 
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
the table where we can sit down and
 
01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
problem solve I don't know if this is
 
01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
something that
 
01:10:20.669 --> 01:10:20.679 align:start position:0%
uh we would want to unilaterally suggest
 
01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:22.840 align:start position:0%
is the right strategy to ask the
 
01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
legislature to put together a fund for
 
01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
this I think think that conversation
 
01:10:29.669 --> 01:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
with Partners from business and industry
 
01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
and with u Bea might be a a good
 
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
starting point for framing what might
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
work s delay so again the way I read
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
number seven wasn't about internships it
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
was more about when I own my business I
 
01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
read a great book it was not the big
 
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
that eat the little it was the fast that
 
01:10:49.149 --> 01:10:49.159 align:start position:0%
eat the slow right meaning that you got
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
to be nimble you got to be able to move
 
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
or you're going to get overtaken and so
 
01:10:54.430 --> 01:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
the way I read this was the ability for
 
01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
the universi to be nimble to work with
 
01:10:58.750 --> 01:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire employers to be able
 
01:11:00.030 --> 01:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
to see what are the needs of New
 
01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employers right now and
 
01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
developing things I can know that it may
 
01:11:04.830 --> 01:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
be a five-year cycle and then you're
 
01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
moving on to something else because the
 
01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
industry's changed or 10e cycle in the
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
industry's changed so you know I I think
 
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
it's important to work with um The
 
01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
Business Leaders you know Bia is a great
 
01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
one but they're also got a huge umbrella
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
about things like the hospitality
 
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
industry and tourism industry in New
 
01:11:21.870 --> 01:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is so critical to what
 
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
we need and what those Employers in
 
01:11:26.189 --> 01:11:26.199 align:start position:0%
those areas need um I know I share ways
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
and means we do gaming and gaming
 
01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
industry is desperate for getting
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
trained dealers and trained servers in
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
their in their charal Gaming facilities
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
so again I read this as being that I
 
01:11:38.669 --> 01:11:38.679 align:start position:0%
think it's important that the uh
 
01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
University system of the community
 
01:11:42.629 --> 01:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
college system engage with those and I'm
 
01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
going to call them more granula than Bia
 
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
or Bea is that the hospitality
 
01:11:49.470 --> 01:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
Association or the you know the tourism
 
01:11:51.310 --> 01:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
Association the you know there's a
 
01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
manufacturers Association there's
 
01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
industries that if you bring them in
 
01:11:57.669 --> 01:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
they'll tell you this is what we need
 
01:11:59.550 --> 01:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
and they know right for the workforce
 
01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
what's needed and what's lacking in the
 
01:12:02.590 --> 01:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
people that are coming into the
 
01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
workforce now that need to be
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
strengthened that may provide some
 
01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
opportunities for you guys so I guess I
 
01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
would encourage you to be a little more
 
01:12:11.229 --> 01:12:11.239 align:start position:0%
granular and go to those industry
 
01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
specific associations and say we want to
 
01:12:15.070 --> 01:12:15.080 align:start position:0%
work with you guys to help you with your
 
01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
Workforce what can we do and what can we
 
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
provide and do a lot more granular work
 
01:12:22.189 --> 01:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
no no disagreement with you on that
 
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
point I think we're both connected to
 
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire life Sciences both
 
01:12:30.030 --> 01:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
connected to Army both connected in more
 
01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
granular ways but at some level just
 
01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
looking for where are we missing the
 
01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities and to some degree hoping
 
01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
that Bia and Bea may help us find those
 
01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
places where where we're missing only
 
01:12:45.550 --> 01:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
comment I'll make is the long the higher
 
01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
up the chain you get the more delayed
 
01:12:49.149 --> 01:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
the information is right so if you're
 
01:12:50.910 --> 01:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
talking to the hospitality industry they
 
01:12:52.390 --> 01:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
know what's going on in their industry
 
01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
last week right versus B Bia not got
 
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
that information for another six months
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
by the time it's rolled up in the Su
 
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
report right and so the idea of again
 
01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
engaging with the more granular you know
 
01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
especially the uh the industries in the
 
01:13:08.669 --> 01:13:08.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are key to our economic
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
success right and engaging with those
 
01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
the hospitality industry tourism
 
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
industry the those kind of things Marine
 
01:13:16.629 --> 01:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
industry right the Lakes W Lake wi Lake
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
W Squam Lake Squam Lake right they all
 
01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
have what kind of programs might work
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
and help those Industries get workers
 
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
that can come work there and keep the
 
01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:26.590 align:start position:0%
that can come work there and keep the
Hampshire's

01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
economic absolutely agree 100% Senator
 
01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
Lang the this is a a good example though
 
01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
of the difference between the community
 
01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
college system and the university system
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
so if an industry or an employer needs
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
something tomorrow the community college
 
01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
system is is more able to deliver on
 
01:13:50.430 --> 01:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
that our um almost all of our colleges
 
01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
within the University of New Hampshire
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
and at Kenan Plymouth have advisory
 
01:13:56.590 --> 01:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
boards from from people in business
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
saying okay let's think about what do
 
01:13:59.750 --> 01:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
you need for
 
01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
curriculum four years from now what kind
 
01:14:04.510 --> 01:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
of what kind of skills are you going to
 
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
need to help develop the curriculum so
 
01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
there are two we we're our curriculum's
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
thinking a little further ahead while
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
the community college system is I
 
01:14:16.830 --> 01:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
noticed Mark jot down oh excuse me
 
01:14:19.149 --> 01:14:19.159 align:start position:0%
Chancellor Rubenstein jot
 
01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
down you must have mentioned something
 
01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
about the gaming in industry and their
 
01:14:27.669 --> 01:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
their that is a per in my where I sit
 
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
that's a perfect example of something
 
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
that the community college system is
 
01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:34.520 align:start position:0%
here to do um anyway
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
so I think our if I could speak for the
 
01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:41.320 align:start position:0%
chancellor we can't this in my opinion
 
01:14:43.629 --> 01:14:43.639 align:start position:0%
this can't be one and done we need to
 
01:14:46.110 --> 01:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
set up a process why how do we get more
 
01:14:48.669 --> 01:14:48.679 align:start position:0%
granular and those Cedars those Regional
 
01:14:48.679 --> 01:14:50.030 align:start position:0%
granular and those Cedars those Regional
Economic

01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
Economic
 
01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:52.189 align:start position:0%
Economic
Development

01:14:52.189 --> 01:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
Development
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
um the regions might be a way for us to
 
01:14:57.870 --> 01:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
be intentional so it continues in
 
01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
perpetuity and it's not oneandone we we
 
01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
H public H Ed needs to be part of the
 
01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:06.310 align:start position:0%
H public H Ed needs to be part of the
landscape

01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
landscape
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
so this a quick note um when I face this
 
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
problem on the NorthShore and I was
 
01:15:13.870 --> 01:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
chairman of the NorthShore chamber I
 
01:15:17.070 --> 01:15:17.080 align:start position:0%
realized the chambers do show and tell
 
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
that the government people don't have
 
01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
time so I formed the NorthShore Alliance
 
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
for economic development on my campus
 
01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
and I had politicians I had Bankers
 
01:15:29.629 --> 01:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
anyone with a self-interest
 
01:15:32.830 --> 01:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
lawyers me and actually do e development
 
01:15:37.149 --> 01:15:37.159 align:start position:0%
work based around my office and with you
 
01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
two in the same place you'd be an ideal
 
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
place to to do something like form your
 
01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
own organization they'll come because
 
01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
they want they want to get together and
 
01:15:49.390 --> 01:15:49.400 align:start position:0%
do real what what needs well anyway I'll
 
01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:51.080 align:start position:0%
just leave it at
 
01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:53.960 align:start position:0%
that if I may Madam chair I'll add one
 
01:15:56.709 --> 01:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
more point that we're facing a math
 
01:15:58.470 --> 01:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
problem in this
 
01:16:02.629 --> 01:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
country this year I think 4.2 million
 
01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
people will reach age 65 we'll have
 
01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
about 4 million high school graduates
 
01:16:10.189 --> 01:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
and that will be true for the next
 
01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
several years the number of people it's
 
01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
not that the workforce begins at 18 and
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
ends at 65 for most of us but the
 
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
reality is that we're no longer
 
01:16:23.189 --> 01:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
replacing as rapidly as we once did and
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
we've got to figure out how to fit Get
 
01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
Talent find Talent everywhere develop
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
Talent everywhere and fit Talent where
 
01:16:31.629 --> 01:16:31.639 align:start position:0%
it's needed throughout the state as one
 
01:16:34.709 --> 01:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
of the older states in the nation we
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
face that problem more acutely than
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
other parts of the country and we've got
 
01:16:42.189 --> 01:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
problem any more questions from the
 
01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:47.679 align:start position:0%
members on
 
01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
set anything else you want to tell us
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
just thank you for your time I think the
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
chancellor and I feel pretty passionate
 
01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
about this work and so we're delighted
 
01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:00.159 align:start position:0%
to to um take a little bit of your time
 
01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
this afternoon well you have your work
 
01:17:07.070 --> 01:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
cut out for you thank you m chair yep um
 
01:17:08.430 --> 01:17:08.440 align:start position:0%
I thank you very much for coming in
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
today and and going through the the
 
01:17:14.110 --> 01:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
points which are in the corly report uh
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the task force as a total
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
that report back from March um there are
 
01:17:21.390 --> 01:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
short-term initiatives and there are
 
01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
some long-term
 
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations some of long-term
 
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations are going to take a
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
while to get there however I think it's
 
01:17:32.709 --> 01:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
important that this study committee
 
01:17:34.669 --> 01:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
address some of those or at least have
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
some discussion regarding I'm I'm
 
01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
looking at the first one I could go
 
01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
through them all but the first one and
 
01:17:41.070 --> 01:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
the last one are excellent but this one
 
01:17:43.350 --> 01:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
says analyze the fiscal assets and
 
01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
program utilization across both
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
systems um you're you're doing it with
 
01:17:52.149 --> 01:17:52.159 align:start position:0%
your I'll call them the central offices
 
01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
you're coming together over to nhti but
 
01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
but where are we in terms of all these
 
01:17:59.430 --> 01:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
assets between the seven community
 
01:18:03.950 --> 01:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
colleges and the University Systems
 
01:18:06.270 --> 01:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
three main branches I'm not talking
 
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester now or or conquer so where
 
01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
are we are there any Capital thing costs
 
01:18:15.790 --> 01:18:15.800 align:start position:0%
or fiscal assets which you know maybe we
 
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
could better utilize in terms of maybe
 
01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
inviting industry in or or or putting on
 
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
the market you and because all we're
 
01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
going to do is you know have deferred
 
01:18:27.229 --> 01:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
maintenance deferred maintenance up the
 
01:18:28.629 --> 01:18:28.639 align:start position:0%
wing wang and that's going to drive
 
01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
everything up too
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
so we we are so um the university system
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
is very much focused on that right now
 
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
we are not working with the community
 
01:18:45.629 --> 01:18:45.639 align:start position:0%
college system on evaluating footprint
 
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
um we have sold buildings we've
 
01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
demolished buildings we're getting out
 
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
of leas space we're now looking system
 
01:18:54.910 --> 01:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
each of the campuses looked at space
 
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
utilization now we're looking systemwide
 
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
what how else can we leverage um those
 
01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
assets we know the footprint needs to
 
01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
shrink as enrollment declines we have
 
01:19:09.149 --> 01:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
not yet started conversations with the
 
01:19:12.189 --> 01:19:12.199 align:start position:0%
community college system about I I we're
 
01:19:14.629 --> 01:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
we need to get our house in order I
 
01:19:17.310 --> 01:19:17.320 align:start position:0%
guess is where where I'm sitting right
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
now far be it for me to correct
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
Chancellor preventure but in fact they
 
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
have worked with us and That's the basis
 
01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
for relocating the system office to
 
01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
faram Hall on the nhti campus we have
 
01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
sold some smaller properties we are in
 
01:19:37.709 --> 01:19:37.719 align:start position:0%
the process of figuring out better uses
 
01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
or having conversations about some of
 
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
our facilities as you know our programs
 
01:19:45.390 --> 01:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
are very local we're in every region of
 
01:19:48.189 --> 01:19:48.199 align:start position:0%
the state because that's where we serve
 
01:19:50.830 --> 01:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
and in that regard as opposed to a
 
01:19:53.550 --> 01:19:53.560 align:start position:0%
system level conversation each campus
 
01:19:56.030 --> 01:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
leadership team presid is taking a look
 
01:19:57.990 --> 01:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
at the physical plant that they have to
 
01:19:59.830 --> 01:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
figure out what makes sense for the
 
01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
future um nhti has three residence Halls
 
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
one of those is currently being leased
 
01:20:07.950 --> 01:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
to uh another entity that can make
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
better use of it generates revenue for
 
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
nhti we are looking across our system at
 
01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
where we might make better use I I will
 
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
offer also as we I think said in other
 
01:20:22.189 --> 01:20:22.199 align:start position:0%
situations there may be state agencies
 
01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
when I hear commissioner Arling house
 
01:20:26.350 --> 01:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
talk about his 12 bucket buildings there
 
01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
may be state agencies that are not
 
01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
well-housed that that we could partner
 
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
with uh our Littleton facility at White
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
Mountains community colleges houses new
 
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
H an office of New Hampshire employment
 
01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
security as an example several of our
 
01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
campuses now have made space available
 
01:20:45.390 --> 01:20:45.400 align:start position:0%
for Head Start programs we're currently
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
leasing uh space in our Berlin Camp uh
 
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
Campus of White Mountains to um uh Boys
 
01:20:54.270 --> 01:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
and Girls Club of central New Hampshire
 
01:20:56.910 --> 01:20:56.920 align:start position:0%
to provide child care in that setting so
 
01:20:59.310 --> 01:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
we are looking at all of our spaces
 
01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:01.480 align:start position:0%
against Community needs against better
 
01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
use of those facilities than we might
 
01:21:06.189 --> 01:21:06.199 align:start position:0%
have for them may have just follow up
 
01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
that that's good conversation I I would
 
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
like to you know if we could in the near
 
01:21:14.350 --> 01:21:14.360 align:start position:0%
future maybe at another meeting um be
 
01:21:16.189 --> 01:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
looking at these physical assets which
 
01:21:19.229 --> 01:21:19.239 align:start position:0%
we have and how they're being utiliz
 
01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:20.920 align:start position:0%
whether it be down in Keen where the
 
01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
community college is on the same campus
 
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
or you know what we're doing in in
 
01:21:30.590 --> 01:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester with the Manchester plant
 
01:21:33.390 --> 01:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
there with the medical research and all
 
01:21:36.149 --> 01:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
that if this is an area where I'd like
 
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
to know where we're going with these
 
01:21:39.950 --> 01:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
Capital costs and what areas are we
 
01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
looking at building and do we need to be
 
01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
building or should we be renovating or
 
01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
should we just be selling off or you if
 
01:21:50.350 --> 01:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
if Madam chair if we could have
 
01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:52.719 align:start position:0%
something come back to us in that that
 
01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
is one of the recommendations in fact
 
01:21:57.550 --> 01:21:57.560 align:start position:0%
the top longterm recommendation we have
 
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
here in this report uh I'd like to start
 
01:22:01.189 --> 01:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
looking down at some of these
 
01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
recommendations here and seeing I think
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
this is where we need to be going I'm
 
01:22:06.830 --> 01:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
also looking at the last one right here
 
01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
which talks about we're in the buying in
 
01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
budget right now and establish as well
 
01:22:14.350 --> 01:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
let's have a a two-year look at let's
 
01:22:16.229 --> 01:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
have a a four-year look at a six-year
 
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
plan uh where are we going in terms
 
01:22:22.590 --> 01:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
of prioritizing needs which are going to
 
01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
be out six years from now um that's all
 
01:22:29.229 --> 01:22:29.239 align:start position:0%
I know the trustees look at this stuff
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh however where we as a responsibility
 
01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:34.360 align:start position:0%
here in this study committee need to be
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
I think also looking at that in terms of
 
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
how are we going to communicate to our
 
01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
legislative bodies which take care of
 
01:22:43.149 --> 01:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
some the finances here for example markx
 
01:22:44.550 --> 01:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
already mentioned about the concurrent
 
01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
dual enrollment program and we see that
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
as a wonderful way to get kids into this
 
01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
into this system learning trades and and
 
01:22:55.950 --> 01:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
getting this experience I can do it at
 
01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:58.719 align:start position:0%
the high at the college level and
 
01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
staying in this state uh so but you know
 
01:23:05.470 --> 01:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
I and but the budget request comes in at
 
01:23:09.229 --> 01:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
two and a half at $3 million or three
 
01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
and a half or three and a quarter and
 
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
we're knocking it down to two and a and
 
01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
a half is that really short-sightedness
 
01:23:17.390 --> 01:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
or is that just based upon what's
 
01:23:20.669 --> 01:23:20.679 align:start position:0%
available and that's all we got uh but I
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
I'd like to be making decisions on the
 
01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
priority of of the system in a long
 
01:23:28.990 --> 01:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
range plan rather on on singular
 
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
programs and maybe when somebody comes
 
01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
in the program oh I love that program
 
01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
that's what we're going to fund is that
 
01:23:38.669 --> 01:23:38.679 align:start position:0%
the top priority from you for uh uh our
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
looking at the buying and Bud budget
 
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
this is an important area Madam clerk
 
01:23:44.350 --> 01:23:44.360 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of good recommendations in
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
here I think we need to start looking at
 
01:23:47.950 --> 01:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
these long-term recommendations as
 
01:23:50.590 --> 01:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
well you can easily ask for a long-term
 
01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:54.040 align:start position:0%
plan you know well yeah they're here in
 
01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:55.270 align:start position:0%
plan you know well yeah they're here in
this

01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:23:57.709 --> 01:23:57.719 align:start position:0%
when are you going to do what you know
 
01:23:59.790 --> 01:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
which what are the priorities where do
 
01:24:02.910 --> 01:24:02.920 align:start position:0%
you want to start and well start here
 
01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:04.149 align:start position:0%
you want to start and well start here
they're

01:24:04.149 --> 01:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
stting yeah but you know on those fiscal
 
01:24:09.390 --> 01:24:09.400 align:start position:0%
assets I think that's one way we can
 
01:24:11.390 --> 01:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
start because I know you've got CTE
 
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
involved in some of that You' got
 
01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
community college system you know on
 
01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
Keen State um we've got real housing
 
01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:21.800 align:start position:0%
problems up in uh
 
01:24:26.110 --> 01:24:26.120 align:start position:0%
Plymouth uh for our m program and Beyond
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh even for kids so I'd like to have and
 
01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
we're deferring
 
01:24:33.390 --> 01:24:33.400 align:start position:0%
maintenance so I I'd like to have more
 
01:24:36.510 --> 01:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
information on our fiscal assets
 
01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
okay you got that right newly
 
01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
noted anything
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
else just one more remark you got to
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
raise the salary offered to the in your
 
01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
ad for the president of uh Nashville
 
01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
Community College it it's the average
 
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
salary of a dean and I know this is i'
 
01:24:58.990 --> 01:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
I've had some calls from friends in the
 
01:25:03.189 --> 01:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
community college network saying that I
 
01:25:05.070 --> 01:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
can't apply for that because it's not
 
01:25:06.709 --> 01:25:06.719 align:start position:0%
higher than what I'm doing now I know
 
01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
this is not your fault this is New
 
01:25:11.669 --> 01:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you know on the cheap but just
 
01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
just a comment and I think it would do
 
01:25:16.629 --> 01:25:16.639 align:start position:0%
the legislature well if if you were able
 
01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
to offer a market salary for that
 
01:25:22.709 --> 01:25:22.719 align:start position:0%
position got to remember that our our
 
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
system gets fewer dollars from the the
 
01:25:26.629 --> 01:25:26.639 align:start position:0%
state than any other system in the
 
01:25:31.109 --> 01:25:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:33.390 --> 01:25:33.400 align:start position:0%
okay did you have anything did you want
 
01:25:36.990 --> 01:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
it any wishes for the next time so thank
 
01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
you madam chair so I'd be interested in
 
01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
maybe talking to high school principal
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
on how it relates to the students the
 
01:25:46.990 --> 01:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
the 10th 12 11th and 12th graders we
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
were talking about is what they see is
 
01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
what is the do they even know about the
 
01:25:52.189 --> 01:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
fact that we have this automatic
 
01:25:53.790 --> 01:25:53.800 align:start position:0%
enrollment process and what are they
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
doing to get out there their students
 
01:25:58.990 --> 01:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
and and just see again from the from the
 
01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
principal's position the High School
 
01:26:02.669 --> 01:26:02.679 align:start position:0%
principal's position what are they see
 
01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
is limitations of helping them get the
 
01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
students into the higher education and
 
01:26:09.510 --> 01:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
get we talk
 
01:26:13.149 --> 01:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
about five right identify stakeholders
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
so I'd love to see a high school
 
01:26:16.270 --> 01:26:16.280 align:start position:0%
principal come in and chat with us okay
 
01:26:18.270 --> 01:26:18.280 align:start position:0%
um I know the K principal is asking to
 
01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
come and chat with him so I'm sure I can
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
maybe talk him into coming down um and
 
01:26:24.669 --> 01:26:24.679 align:start position:0%

I can talk to okay and see if they'd be
 
01:26:27.790 --> 01:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
interested in coming down and
 
01:26:29.470 --> 01:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
specifically I want to focus on the area
 
01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:32.360 align:start position:0%
of of post secondary of of of like
 
01:26:34.510 --> 01:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
really College in the college system and
 
01:26:36.229 --> 01:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
how they're interacting and how they're
 
01:26:38.229 --> 01:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
getting information
 
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
to get a different perspective from a
 
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
different level of people did you have a
 
01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:43.990 align:start position:0%
different level of people did you have a
your

your
 
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
wish pardon me did you have a wish
 
01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
something that you would like to know by
 
01:26:50.750 --> 01:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
the next time the stakeholder that you
 
01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:52.719 align:start position:0%
like to hear
 
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
from I know I I think the E development
 
01:26:59.390 --> 01:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
plan for how the community colleges fit
 
01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:07.390 --> 01:27:07.400 align:start position:0%
one do you have enough pH workor I I I
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
do Madam chair but if I may make one
 
01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:13.709 align:start position:0%
do Madam chair but if I may make one
comment

01:27:13.709 --> 01:27:13.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:13.719 --> 01:27:15.350 align:start position:0%
 
please

01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
I representative Burton did not make his
 
01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
statement in the form of a question but
 
01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
I would still like to respond we have
 
01:27:25.390 --> 01:27:25.400 align:start position:0%
been fortunate with then the resources
 
01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
we have to attract very talented
 
01:27:29.790 --> 01:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
leadership to our colleges and although
 
01:27:31.950 --> 01:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we lose in a search some
 
01:27:34.350 --> 01:27:34.360 align:start position:0%
candidates for whom that level of
 
01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
compensation will be a barrier I don't
 
01:27:39.189 --> 01:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
think it precludes us finding very
 
01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
talented people and I would look at the
 
01:27:44.590 --> 01:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
panel sitting in front of me who are not
 
01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
drawn to serve in the legislature by the
 
01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
salary they're drawn to service and for
 
01:27:52.830 --> 01:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
leadership at community colleges that's
 
01:27:54.430 --> 01:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
often true doesn't mean they shouldn't
 
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
be equitably and and appropriately
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
compensated but we have the benefit of
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
people who care about the mission and
 
01:28:03.189 --> 01:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
who will come to deliver quality for
 
01:28:07.950 --> 01:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:10.669 --> 01:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
that Madam chair I just say that one of
 
01:28:13.030 --> 01:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
the problems you have is Lucille's shoes
 
01:28:15.629 --> 01:28:15.639 align:start position:0%
are really hard to fill uh she was one
 
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
of the most highly respected presidents
 
01:28:19.750 --> 01:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
country any other suggestions for uh
 
01:28:26.109 --> 01:28:26.119 align:start position:0%
