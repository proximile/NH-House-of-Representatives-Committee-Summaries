25 um I'll keep it brief we have some
 
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
stakeholders here today to speak to this
 
00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
legislation um this bill allows the
 
00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
judge to assign an alternative sentence
 
00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
when they see fit
 
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
um an alternative sentence could include
 
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
drug treatment job training job
 
00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 align:start position:0%
placement financial literacy classes and
 
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
so forth stakeholders work together on
 
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
this legislation to ensure it only
 
00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
covers a limited list of crimes which
 
00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:14.429 align:start position:0%
covers a limited list of crimes which
are

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:14.439 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 align:start position:0%
non-violent per the legislation certain
 
00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
crimes are are exceptions and a judge is
 
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 align:start position:0%
not allowed to assign an alternative
 
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 align:start position:0%
sentence in those cases examples include
 
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
assault sexual crimes crimes against
 
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
children domestic violence
 
00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 align:start position:0%
etc for that reason you'll note that any
 
00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 align:start position:0%
any sort of treatment related to these
 
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
types of crimes is not listed under the
 
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
types of alternative sentencing in the
 
00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 align:start position:0%
bill because anyone convicted of that
 
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 align:start position:0%
type of crime wouldn't be eligible for
 
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.950 align:start position:0%
type of crime wouldn't be eligible for
alternative

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
sentencing while it was difficult to
 
00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 align:start position:0%
establish uh contact with the Coalition
 
00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:48.039 align:start position:0%
against sexual domestic violence in the
 
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
months leading up to um this hearing and
 
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 align:start position:0%
as we were working on the language uh
 
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
stakeholders did make a considered
 
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
effort to ensure that the coalition's
 
00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
concerns were incorporated into this
 
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.870 align:start position:0%
concerns were incorporated into this
language

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 align:start position:0%
um there are for example
 
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
are uh exceptions included that we
 
00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
believe the Coalition would
 
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
support making exceptions
 
00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
um so similar legislation has passed in
 
00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 align:start position:0%
other states this bill is modeled off of
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
Tennessee's uh recent law and uh this
 
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
legislation is brought forward in the
 
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
spirit of article 18 of the Bill of
 
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
Rights in our States Constitution
 
00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 align:start position:0%
which states in part that the true
 
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
design of all punishments is to reform
 
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 align:start position:0%
mankind um so this legislation is
 
00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
intended to ensure that our justice
 
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
system is uh actively engaged in
 
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
reforming as opposed to um simply
 
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
limiting because
 
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
philosophically when you go to uh when
 
00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
you are incarcerated your freedom your
 
00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 align:start position:0%
Liberty is taken for a period of time um
 
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
to punish you
 
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
um but if we're just catch and release
 
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
Catch and Release what are we achieving
 
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
and uh the idea with this legislation is
 
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
to ensure that people are funneled into
 
00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
um systems uh resources experiences that
 
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
would help them uh grow and improve as
 
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
human beings so that they won't be
 
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 align:start position:0%
incarcerated again happy to take any
 
00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:30.919 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
just for I'm I'm interested um did the
 
00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
does the court already not have the
 
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
option to impose these versus um I mean
 
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
because we don't have minimum or or
 
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
mandatory jail sentences right so can
 
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
they not already do this what what what
 
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
what makes this necessary the idea here
 
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
is to make it very clear that it's the
 
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
intent of the the preferred right okay
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
that when it's appropriate and it's up
 
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
to the judge um and in particular um the
 
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
use of the word caregiver is present
 
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
throughout the bill because we're
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
specifically looking at people who are
 
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
the Breadwinners in their household um
 
00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
we're thinking like you know talking
 
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
about maybe
 
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.670 align:start position:0%
about maybe
[Music]

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
um someone is the only person employed
 
00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:22.879 align:start position:0%
in their household maybe they have young
 
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
children dependent upon them maybe
 
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
they're paying child support maybe as in
 
00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
my case um my elderly mother lives with
 
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
me and I care for her and um people in
 
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:35.560 align:start position:0%
that type of situation the ripple effect
 
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
of incarceration is vast um if I
 
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
disappeared one day um even just for a
 
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
couple of months the impact on my mom's
 
00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919 align:start position:0%
quality of life would be severe and um
 
00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:48.879 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about children if
 
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
their only caregiver is gone um those
 
00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
children will potentially end up in the
 
00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:55.720 align:start position:0%
system we do have laws in New Hampshire
 
00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
that would preferentially send them to
 
00:07:59.950 --> 00:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
maybe grandparents or something but
 
00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
absent that sort of option um maybe
 
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
those children end up in the system um
 
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
that's a financial outlay to the state
 
00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:09.639 align:start position:0%
and the taxpayers um there could be
 
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
emotional impacts of losing a parent to
 
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
um the prison system that down the road
 
00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
maybe those people who are impacted end
 
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
up part of the uh Criminal Justice
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
System themselves and not in a great
 
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
way um and
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
similarly if let's say the situation is
 
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
like one of two parents uh is the bread
 
00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519 align:start position:0%
winner ends up
 
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
incarcerated uh maybe the other parent
 
00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
can't really make ends meet without that
 
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
other parent there they apply for
 
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
benefits their own welfare and all the
 
00:08:44.829 --> 00:08:44.839 align:start position:0%
while taxpayers are paying to house and
 
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
feed the productive parent the bread
 
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
winner that um would otherwise be able
 
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
to contribute to their household
 
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
independently so there's a financial
 
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
impact to incarceration if it's if it's
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
possible to address the behavioral
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
issues the criminal behavior of that
 
00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
person um through some kind of program
 
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:07.240 align:start position:0%
and the judge agrees that that would be
 
00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
effective and there's the bill includes
 
00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
um accountability as well um and the
 
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
option for the judge to revert to prison
 
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
time if necessary um but if uh the judge
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
feels it's appropriate there are so many
 
00:09:26.829 --> 00:09:26.839 align:start position:0%
benefits across um all aspects of life
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire from um you know the
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
impact on the taxpayers long-term impact
 
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
on youths who maybe have lost a loved
 
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
one to um incarceration and how their
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
lives could be changed by being able to
 
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:43.720 align:start position:0%
grow up with that caregiver in their
 
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
life um as opposed to you know the chaos
 
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
and Trauma that comes with losing a
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
loved one in that situation um and then
 
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
additionally if we can actually reform
 
00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
someone instead of Simply limiting their
 
00:10:01.389 --> 00:10:01.399 align:start position:0%
freedom and their liberties with
 
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:03.160 align:start position:0%
incarceration um then we should be
 
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
focused on
 
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
that thank you very much um forther
 
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
Muse you have a a pretty exhaustive list
 
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
of the of the exceptions uh what I'm
 
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
what I'm wondering about are the things
 
00:10:22.509 --> 00:10:22.519 align:start position:0%
that might be more the the rule in cases
 
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
like this so what kind of crimes uh do
 
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
you think would be eligible for this
 
00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:27.839 align:start position:0%
type of
 
00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:31.519 align:start position:0%
treatment um I think we're talking um PO
 
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
for example if someone has a serious
 
00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
pattern of maybe um speeding you know
 
00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
maybe not paying their tickets things
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
like that that's someone who would
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
benefit from financial literacy classes
 
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
um maybe like a defensive driving a more
 
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
extensive defensive driving course um
 
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
there's a variety of small Petty things
 
00:10:56.829 --> 00:10:56.839 align:start position:0%
that can pile up over time that could
 
00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
eventually lead to jail time where it's
 
00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
more an issue of
 
00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:05.720 align:start position:0%
someone just having it together um being
 
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
able to manage money manage their time
 
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
manage their own impulses which can come
 
00:11:13.629 --> 00:11:13.639 align:start position:0%
down to Simply mental health issues and
 
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
that's why uh therapy is part of the
 
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
list of um options for how to address
 
00:11:22.509 --> 00:11:22.519 align:start position:0%
these things uh just with ADHD alone
 
00:11:24.509 --> 00:11:24.519 align:start position:0%
which so many people in the country in
 
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
the world have um impulse control is a
 
00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
major problem um um and there's
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
different aspects of ADHD I I have it I
 
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
don't think I really have the impulse
 
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
control part of it so much compared to
 
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
other people um more of the um spaced
 
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
out variety of ADHD but um you know
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
there's that's kind of the issue right
 
00:11:51.389 --> 00:11:51.399 align:start position:0%
is that as we progress as a society and
 
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
we move on from using leeches to give
 
00:11:56.829 --> 00:11:56.839 align:start position:0%
medical care and we learn more um we
 
00:11:59.069 --> 00:11:59.079 align:start position:0%
become more scientific we do more
 
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:00.680 align:start position:0%
studies we start to learn that there are
 
00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:02.519 align:start position:0%
different ways to address behavioral
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
issues um than simply
 
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
you represent Mar thank you Mr
 
00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:15.519 align:start position:0%
chairman what numbers do you do you have
 
00:12:18.269 --> 00:12:18.279 align:start position:0%
any numbers on how many people would be
 
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
impacted by this because my impression
 
00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:23.839 align:start position:0%
is that a vast majority if not over 90%
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
of people who are currently incarcerated
 
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
are parents either mother father
 
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
caregiver they are so it just seems like
 
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
an enormous population would be impacted
 
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:37.720 align:start position:0%
and if I might also it's a two-part
 
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
question um do you think that sometimes
 
00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:43.519 align:start position:0%
taking a step out of a lifestyle to
 
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
relearn new habits um would be
 
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
beneficial as well just like a timeout
 
00:12:50.949 --> 00:12:50.959 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question on the
 
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:53.240 align:start position:0%
second part um there's other ways to
 
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
step out of Lifestyle besides
 
00:12:57.189 --> 00:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
incarceration that's the point of
 
00:12:59.949 --> 00:12:59.959 align:start position:0%
halfway homes um sober homes things like
 
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
that um so there are a lot of different
 
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
ways that human beings can address
 
00:13:08.189 --> 00:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
hanging out in the wrong crowd um
 
00:13:10.269 --> 00:13:10.279 align:start position:0%
otherwise if I thought my teenager was
 
00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
hanging out with the wrong crowd I'd
 
00:13:14.189 --> 00:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
just call the Hillsboro County Jail you
 
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
know so we have options um and on the
 
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
first part it's it's a two um there's
 
00:13:23.189 --> 00:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
two components here it's not simply
 
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:25.240 align:start position:0%
caregiver and it's not simply nonviolent
 
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
it's both so it's a non-violent crime
 
00:13:33.189 --> 00:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
that of which a caregiver is convicted
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
and that number should should be very
 
00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
small but for those people and for the
 
00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:42.839 align:start position:0%
people that depend on them the impact is
 
00:13:46.189 --> 00:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
significant um but I believe other
 
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
stakeholders on this legislation were
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
looking into getting that kind of data
 
00:13:51.389 --> 00:13:51.399 align:start position:0%
that was something that we talked about
 
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:53.480 align:start position:0%
in our many meetings um I don't have the
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
data but maybe someone else speaking
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
today would and if they're here I assume
 
00:13:58.990 --> 00:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
they don't even have to be asked they'
 
00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
just bring it
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
up further qu representative sing sorry
 
00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much this is um a bit of
 
00:14:07.749 --> 00:14:07.759 align:start position:0%
a followup on representative Reed's
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
question thank you for taking my
 
00:14:12.189 --> 00:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
question um so if a parent or a
 
00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
caregiver needed to be sentenced for
 
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:17.800 align:start position:0%
example to a halfway house um away from
 
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
their family temporarily to work through
 
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
their issues but would still have access
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
to visiting them and seeing them or
 
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps going to their place of
 
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
employment um is that something that is
 
00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839 align:start position:0%
possible with how this is written just
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
to so I understand I I don't believe so
 
00:14:38.749 --> 00:14:38.759 align:start position:0%
however um it is uh likely the
 
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
legislation says that the uh that a
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
judge could assign some other kind of um
 
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:47.240 align:start position:0%
resources or
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
experience um for the convicted person
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
if the judge finds it appropriate and I
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
think it's worth considering that um in
 
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
addition to incarceration halfway home
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
sober homes there's also partial
 
00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.150 align:start position:0%
sober homes there's also partial
inpatient

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
inpatient
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
hospitalization um that's something that
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
exists in New Hampshire and many other
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
parts of the country where you it's like
 
00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
a day camp for therapy and you spend a
 
00:15:13.749 --> 00:15:13.759 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of time Monday
 
00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
through Friday in um in a therapeutic
 
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
environment going to uh meetings I think
 
00:15:22.949 --> 00:15:22.959 align:start position:0%
it takes about a month and it's covered
 
00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:25.240 align:start position:0%
by Insurance typically um so there's a
 
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:29.720 align:start position:0%
lot of different ways to address um
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
exacerbated and untreated mental health
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
issues um aside from incarceration in a
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
way that really takes you out of your
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:42.749 --> 00:15:42.759 align:start position:0%
focus represent
 
00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
new thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:15:48.309 --> 00:15:48.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question um the way I read it
 
00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
I mean it says the court may may impose
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
individually assess uh an individually
 
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
assess sentence so what we're what we're
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
saying here I think that or I just want
 
00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
you to clarify if I have this correct
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
um so what we're saying here is you know
 
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that this is something that the
 
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
court may already take into
 
00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
consideration just as part of you know
 
00:16:08.749 --> 00:16:08.759 align:start position:0%
the way they're doing what you're trying
 
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:11.240 align:start position:0%
to say here is you're trying to um put
 
00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
into law um uh the requirement
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
essentially for this to be considered
 
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't actually mean they have
 
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:21.560 align:start position:0%
to impose this kind of sentence over
 
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
another it's an option is what I'm
 
00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
saying right and I think sometimes as
 
00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
lawmakers we
 
00:16:31.629 --> 00:16:31.639 align:start position:0%
sometimes I'm I'm frustrated when like
 
00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
an attorney is a lawmaker because
 
00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
they're always throwing a wrench in the
 
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:37.160 align:start position:0%
gears because they're on the other side
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
and they know how our attempts at
 
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
lawmaking end up playing out in real
 
00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:44.079 align:start position:0%
lives um and I think that's the
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
importance of of communicating to the
 
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
court our wishes as a
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
legislature but then also giving the
 
00:16:54.309 --> 00:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
court that
 
00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
discretion because we can't legislate to
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
every every individual type of situation
 
00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:04.959 align:start position:0%
we can't begin to imagine the variety of
 
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:07.480 align:start position:0%
predicaments that the court has to
 
00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.079 align:start position:0%
address um and I'd like to think that a
 
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
judge in working with the prosecution in
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
working with the defense can determine
 
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
on a case-by casee basis this person
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
would really benefit from and would be
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
able to grow from going into therapy as
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
their sentence
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
incarceration or something along those
 
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
you no um representative BRS thank you
 
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.390 align:start position:0%
you no um representative BRS thank you
Mr

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:17:48.029 --> 00:17:48.039 align:start position:0%
chairman um on line I'm just looking at
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
line 13 on the second page can you just
 
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
clarify where it says affordable and
 
00:17:57.149 --> 00:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
safe housing assistance is is that meant
 
00:18:00.909 --> 00:18:00.919 align:start position:0%
to be public housing or it actually let
 
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:02.200 align:start position:0%
me not tell you what I think what what
 
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
does that mean um we have programs in
 
00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
the state that help people
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
um go through the they assist them in
 
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
going through the process of obtaining
 
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
housing um when it comes to I mean I
 
00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
don't know if you've really interacted
 
00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
much with someone who's homeless um or
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
someone who's been applying for benefits
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
but for folks in that situation the
 
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
stress is so high
 
00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
their emotions are running so High um
 
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
they feel so much shame that I mean I've
 
00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:37.640 align:start position:0%
personally witness people trying to
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
apply for something helpful and it's
 
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:43.480 align:start position:0%
feels so invasive they feel so
 
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
scrutinized and it's really difficult to
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
move through the process and so we have
 
00:18:50.909 --> 00:18:50.919 align:start position:0%
entities in this state that can help you
 
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
respect like respectfully help you and
 
00:18:53.789 --> 00:18:53.799 align:start position:0%
encourage you to move through the
 
00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
process of for example um you know
 
00:18:58.669 --> 00:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
applying for a mortgage things like that
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
things that can be very daunting
 
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
especially if you have some mental
 
00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.390 align:start position:0%
especially if you have some mental
health

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
issues thank you and for the record I
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
was the welfare director in my town and
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
I've helped many people it's obvious
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
that you didn't I've helped many people
 
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
that were homeless I've helped many
 
00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:21.320 align:start position:0%
people with their rent assistance I've
 
00:19:23.149 --> 00:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
helped many people that had no places to
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
go I'm so my understanding is that if
 
00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:31.799 align:start position:0%
the the reason I'm asking this specific
 
00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:34.919 align:start position:0%
question is if an individual has a
 
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
felony on their record they weren't
 
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
allowed to apply for the public housing
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
and that's why I'm questioning
 
00:19:47.149 --> 00:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
this uh okay I don't think you could be
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
sentenced to live in public housing that
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
would be weird um I think it's more
 
00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
about um having assistance in obtaining
 
00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
housing of any type but also I didn't
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
know about your work history and I just
 
00:20:06.909 --> 00:20:06.919 align:start position:0%
generally think that very few people you
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
know so many people are just paying
 
00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:10.919 align:start position:0%
their bills picking their kids up from
 
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
school focused on their lives and and
 
00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:14.559 align:start position:0%
not a lot of people in my perspective
 
00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to watch someone
 
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
really crumble when they're faced with
 
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
paperwork and it sounds like you you
 
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
know firsthand what that's like and it's
 
00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:23.830 align:start position:0%
know firsthand what that's like and it's
rough

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
rough
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
um as a parent of a teenager I've
 
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
certainly spent a lot of time trying to
 
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
manage just one human's emotions and the
 
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
work that social workers do I think is
 
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
beyond my
 
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
capacity represent
 
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:43.240 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you um in section three on
 
00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919 align:start position:0%
the the last page it it gives a um the
 
00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:51.400 align:start position:0%
processes that the court can use then to
 
00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
determine whether the person has been um
 
00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
sentenced in accordance with this law to
 
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
be able to to follow up and determine if
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
the if the person is complying with with
 
00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:07.720 align:start position:0%
what's necessary to be eligible um is
 
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
that does that appear anywhere else in
 
00:21:11.549 --> 00:21:11.559 align:start position:0%
law or is is this a new thing that would
 
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
might be more helpful for for um a judge
 
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
to understand that there is certain
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
things that there's a process that they
 
00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:21.039 align:start position:0%
can go through to make sure that it's
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
complied with I couldn't tell you if
 
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
there's anything like that anywhere else
 
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
in law but um this section is is worded
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
in this way to it's reflective of the
 
00:21:37.269 --> 00:21:37.279 align:start position:0%
Tennessee law but um the Tennessee law
 
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
digs in deep and gives Specific
 
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
Instructions to the court and the in our
 
00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
work crafting the language of this bill
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
talking to different stakeholders um it
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
was clear
 
00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
that we would be creating more problems
 
00:21:53.789 --> 00:21:53.799 align:start position:0%
than we'd be solving by giving specific
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
dictates to the court about how to go
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
about establishing whether someone has
 
00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
met the requirements because they have
 
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
their own systems and procedures in
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
place already and so essentially the
 
00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
idea is just to say whatever your
 
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:18.269 --> 00:22:18.279 align:start position:0%
folks see no further questions oh oh oh
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry go
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
ahead I guess you go can I
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
go thank you Mr chair um thank you
 
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
representative balen for taking my
 
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
question I just have a question back to
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
the affordable and safe housing
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
assistance um that line 13 on page
 
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
two the the sentence prior uh says that
 
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
the the court may require the person to
 
00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:42.440 align:start position:0%
meet certain conditions and then it said
 
00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
affordable and safe housing assistance
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
is the requirement that they obtain
 
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
Assistance or is it the requirement that
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:02.190 align:start position:0%
 
housing

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.269 --> 00:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
did she um my read is assistance pardon
 
00:23:05.279 --> 00:23:06.149 align:start position:0%
did she um my read is assistance pardon
me

00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:23:08.269 --> 00:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
assistance um but it would be
 
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:11.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate to I mean honestly in this
 
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
housing market asking someone to obtain
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
housing as a condition of not being
 
00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:18.039 align:start position:0%
incarcerated me is probably way too much
 
00:23:21.149 --> 00:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
to ask um especially when you know you
 
00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
have to take into consideration their
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
credit um their financial status it's I
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
think it's more about assist
 
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
and so for example if someone is
 
00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
unhoused and they're being unhoused is
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
contributing in some way to whatever
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
bringing them back into the court system
 
00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.789 align:start position:0%
bringing them back into the court system
um

00:23:39.789 --> 00:23:39.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
then requiring them to do the work to
 
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
obtain housing um if the judge believes
 
00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
that obtaining housing could have an
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
impact on their likelihood of uh ending
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
up in front of a judge again um then
 
00:23:59.070 --> 00:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
that seems appropriate thank you can it
 
00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you on on that same page
 
00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
on page uh let's see line
 
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
25 is this um meant to if it talks about
 
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
the the person uh non-compliant person
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
having to reappear so they according to
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
line D in order for the the judge to um
 
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
impose the initial sentence of
 
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
confinement the person would have to be
 
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
non-compliant a couple of times
 
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
at least twice right because it says
 
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
it's of continued non-compliance because
 
00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
initially they could just add sanctions
 
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
or something but okay thank
 
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:43.960 align:start position:0%

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:47.240 align:start position:0%

it's um I just know that it's Tennessee
 
00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
and they passed this la and that blew my
 
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
mind because it is Tennessee I have a
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%

are stuck in jail simply because they
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
they don't have the money to pay and one
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
of the things of course my phone's
 
00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.710 align:start position:0%
of the things of course my phone's
ringing

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:59.350 --> 00:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
sorry uh yeah I think I
 
00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
think we've been busy believe me H any
 
00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
case yeah they don't have uh the
 
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:07.240 align:start position:0%
resources to pay so and it's typically
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
Low Cash bail non-violent types of
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
situations uh We've in the last we've
 
00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:15.880 align:start position:0%
bailed over 540 people throughout New
 
00:26:18.029 --> 00:26:18.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and
 
00:26:22.909 --> 00:26:22.919 align:start position:0%
275 just last year um and some one of
 
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
the things we do is we do give Brides to
 
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
people so we get to know some of these
 
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
folks uh uh when we can give a ride and
 
00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:32.440 align:start position:0%
uh to give some color to some of the
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
people who are primary caregivers uh we
 
00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:38.799 align:start position:0%
had one gentleman Dylan he called us in
 
00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
a panic because he's legally blind and
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
he's uh he
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
can't uh keep track of his meds because
 
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
his caregiver isn't was in Valley Street
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
jail so that just kind of gives you an
 
00:26:55.389 --> 00:26:55.399 align:start position:0%
idea of what that impact of just being
 
00:26:57.389 --> 00:26:57.399 align:start position:0%
separated from your primary caregiver
 
00:26:57.399 --> 00:26:58.389 align:start position:0%
separated from your primary caregiver
giv

00:26:58.389 --> 00:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
giv
 
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
does we had another person uh Sarah who
 
00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh we had a panic call from the attorney
 
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
so you got to get her out because if
 
00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
she's not out by today she's going to
 
00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
lose her job and she's going to lose her
 
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
kids so uh thankfully we had people
 
00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:19.640 align:start position:0%
available to do that but again this
 
00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
again this could this is just these are
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
minor crimes uh minor situations that
 
00:27:29.389 --> 00:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
are impacting people people's lives uh
 
00:27:32.549 --> 00:27:32.559 align:start position:0%
the other one um Debbie who was uh she
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
was in a her her apartment building uh
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
burned down and uh the next week she was
 
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
picked up on an old warrant for $100 of
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
a driving thing that happened like three
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
years prior uh she's got a
 
00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:50.360 align:start position:0%
four-year-old and the four-year-old was
 
00:27:52.269 --> 00:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
with her grandmother who's kind of
 
00:27:55.149 --> 00:27:55.159 align:start position:0%
infirm so she was really worried about
 
00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
the whole risk of that and she had spent
 
00:27:59.710 --> 00:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
four four days in jail at Valley Street
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
just for
 
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
$100 so I I just wanted to give some
 
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
color on what the impact of just being
 
00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
separated at when you're a primary
 
00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919 align:start position:0%
caregiver I know there's a lot of
 
00:28:12.909 --> 00:28:12.919 align:start position:0%
details to sort through if we we could
 
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
move forward with this but I think this
 
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
is something that's something we really
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
got to consider and it definitely would
 
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
be a good step forward for the community
 
00:28:24.909 --> 00:28:24.919 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you any questions um
 
00:28:27.549 --> 00:28:27.559 align:start position:0%
representative new thank you Mr chair
 
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here um my question
 
00:28:32.789 --> 00:28:32.799 align:start position:0%
is you know what your I just said when I
 
00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:35.720 align:start position:0%
was um speaking with um representative
 
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
balen um that you know this would be
 
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
something that would be taken into
 
00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
consideration now and the way what
 
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:44.200 align:start position:0%
you're describing is it not being really
 
00:28:45.789 --> 00:28:45.799 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't sound like it's being
 
00:28:47.669 --> 00:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
taken into consideration can you speak
 
00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
to kind of how often you see primary
 
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
caregivers um in in that type of
 
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:55.480 align:start position:0%
situation you know I don't have all the
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
um I I should go backtrack with our
 
00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
folks but I'd say it's maybe about 10%
 
00:29:03.149 --> 00:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
of the time we we we uh there is a
 
00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
involves um do you think that this would
 
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
be impactful and and help people who are
 
00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:13.640 align:start position:0%
in that situation oh absolutely you know
 
00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:14.799 align:start position:0%
and I just and the other thing I'm
 
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
worried about is what about the people
 
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
we can't get out you know the people
 
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
that can't get bail that that are
 
00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.509 align:start position:0%
that can't get bail that that are
primary

00:29:22.509 --> 00:29:22.519 align:start position:0%
primary
 
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:24.840 align:start position:0%

you represent Stone thank you for taking
 
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
my question my question is are these
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
individuals that you post bail for are
 
00:29:34.509 --> 00:29:34.519 align:start position:0%
these individuals that have been seen
 
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
before the court or they prior to their
 
00:29:37.549 --> 00:29:37.559 align:start position:0%

Kylie

00:30:04.269 --> 00:30:04.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
uh good morning Mr chair and members of
 
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Pamela kyg and
 
00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
I'm the public policy specialist at the
 
00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Coalition against Domestic
 
00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
and Sexual Violence uh the Coalition is
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
the umbrella Organization for our 12
 
00:30:18.509 --> 00:30:18.519 align:start position:0%
community- based crisis centers that
 
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
each year serve uh around
 
00:30:23.509 --> 00:30:23.519 align:start position:0%
14,000 victims of Domestic and Sexual
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
Violence each year and that includes uh
 
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
children um I here in opposition to HB
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
1039 uh legislation that could
 
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
inadvertently Place domestic violence
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
victims and Children at Risk um we truly
 
00:30:37.789 --> 00:30:37.799 align:start position:0%
appreciate the sponsor's commitment to
 
00:30:40.029 --> 00:30:40.039 align:start position:0%
ensuring that children grow up in safe
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
and supportive homes in New Hampshire
 
00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:43.480 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes to trying to
 
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
find solutions for children of
 
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:47.480 align:start position:0%
incarcerated parents and caregivers
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this proposal is in direct
 
00:30:52.669 --> 00:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
conflict with the goals of Public Safety
 
00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
normally we try to come to the table um
 
00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
and I just want to say we oppose similar
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
legislation that was brought forward
 
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
last session um and raised very similar
 
00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
concerns to what I'm going to address
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
here today um and so I think um better
 
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:08.120 align:start position:0%
Faith efforts could have been made to BR
 
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
bring broader stakeholders to the table
 
00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
to really work through um some of the
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
pieces in here to see if we could bring
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
forward a better solution um I think the
 
00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
underlying goal of this legislation has
 
00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
Merit the implementation of such a
 
00:31:24.629 --> 00:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
proposal really needs to be carefully
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
done even with substantial amendments to
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
today uh this proposal just isn't going
 
00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:33.919 align:start position:0%
to satisfy our concerns um an integral
 
00:31:35.549 --> 00:31:35.559 align:start position:0%
part of the coalition's mission is to
 
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
raise awareness and build Statewide and
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
local capacity to address the impact
 
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
that trauma can have on both victims and
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
their families it is especially
 
00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
important that children who have been
 
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
exposed to abuse and violence in their
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
homes receive support and learning how
 
00:31:51.389 --> 00:31:51.399 align:start position:0%
to cope um after these situations have
 
00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
occurred exposure to domestic violence
 
00:31:56.669 --> 00:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
is an adverse child experience and this
 
00:31:59.629 --> 00:31:59.639 align:start position:0%
bill as written doesn't address uh the
 
00:32:01.389 --> 00:32:01.399 align:start position:0%
impact that domestic violence could have
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
in a home we agree that children do well
 
00:32:06.269 --> 00:32:06.279 align:start position:0%
in a stable environment have been
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
longtime supporters of Early Childhood
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
interventions that seek to increase
 
00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:12.200 align:start position:0%
resiliency in children who have
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
experienced adversity however when
 
00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
someone needs a caregiver whether it's
 
00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:18.559 align:start position:0%
because of age disability or other
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
circumstances they're considered
 
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
especially vulnerable and sadly more
 
00:32:25.149 --> 00:32:25.159 align:start position:0%
likely to be victimized we have an
 
00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:27.519 align:start position:0%
obligation as members of a community to
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
protect our most vulnerable citizens
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
against harmful conduct by the people
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
responsible for their care in New
 
00:32:36.269 --> 00:32:36.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we often hold caregivers to
 
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
higher standards and this bill as
 
00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
written does the opposite in reviewing
 
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
the bill language we are concerned about
 
00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
situations where the underlying member
 
00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
who they're attempting to maintain care
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
over um could be actually charged or
 
00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
could um be returned back to their
 
00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:54.200 align:start position:0%
family even if they've abused their
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
dependent or child there's no car out in
 
00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
here that addresses a situation like
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
that and I know that um the office of
 
00:33:03.629 --> 00:33:03.639 align:start position:0%
child advocate has raised similar
 
00:33:07.389 --> 00:33:07.399 align:start position:0%
concerns the bill ignores um the needs
 
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
of the child or the dependent in uh
 
00:33:11.549 --> 00:33:11.559 align:start position:0%
these situations and doesn't guide the
 
00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
court to consider the possibility of
 
00:33:15.629 --> 00:33:15.639 align:start position:0%
whether the vulnerable person was the
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
victim um additionally many offenders in
 
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire plead to much less serious
 
00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
crimes than they are originally charged
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
with and we see this often in cases of
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
sexual and domestic violence and child
 
00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
abuse use consequently creating a
 
00:33:30.669 --> 00:33:30.679 align:start position:0%
laundry list of perceived violent
 
00:33:32.909 --> 00:33:32.919 align:start position:0%
offenses did not address the reality of
 
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
how these crimes are resolved in our
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
state I've attached a handout to the
 
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
testimony which I'll um uh which is a
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
chart of violent offenses like our
 
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
definitions of violent crimes in the
 
00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
state and the laundry list of crimes
 
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
that could are harmful or dangerous that
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
aren't encompassed in that this bill
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
would then create another list of non or
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
violent crimes that again will create
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
further complications and um more
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
complexities in our statute um and it's
 
00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
just creating a list of violent or
 
00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
non-violent of crimes is the wrong
 
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
approach to this type of policy when the
 
00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
goal is to both balance Public Safety
 
00:34:13.629 --> 00:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
and ensuring that caregivers are able to
 
00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
adequately care for their children um
 
00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:18.200 align:start position:0%
just to want to just share a couple of
 
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
scenarios to kind of illustrate this so
 
00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
in this bill RSA 169c which is the abuse
 
00:34:26.430 --> 00:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
and neglect statute is not included in
 
00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
this list
 
00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:30.200 align:start position:0%
um that means that a caregiver could be
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
considered who maybe is on the central
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
registry for abusing their child but
 
00:34:37.109 --> 00:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
maybe committed a crime that isn't on
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
this list of uh exemptions could then be
 
00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
returned home we need to be looking at
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
all of the factors at the table and
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
understand how everything comes together
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a comprehensive
 
00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
consideration of the whole situation not
 
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
peac meal or Patchwork approach to this
 
00:34:58.829 --> 00:34:58.839 align:start position:0%
and another example this bill could also
 
00:35:01.069 --> 00:35:01.079 align:start position:0%
create a situation where the caregiver
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
may have a protective order against them
 
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
under RSA 17 73b the domestic violence
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
statute also not listed in this um and
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
then they could then that abusive parent
 
00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:14.839 align:start position:0%
could be returned home even if they
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
committed another crime not included on
 
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
this list additionally vulnerable adults
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
could also still be victims of financial
 
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
exploitation or criminal neglect as
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
relevant statutes are not addressed rest
 
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
here so we just I just we implore you to
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
consider sort of the broader
 
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
implications of this and make sure that
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
we're looking really holistically at
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
this so that we can really come to an
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
agreeable solution um we hope that you
 
00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
will consider the best interest of the
 
00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
child and domestic violence victims and
 
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
vulnerable adults when you're um making
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
your decision on this bill and we ask
 
00:35:53.309 --> 00:35:53.319 align:start position:0%
you to itl thank
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
sake thank you and thank you for taking
 
00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
my question um I'm a little confused
 
00:36:04.309 --> 00:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
about some of your testimony because the
 
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
bill does specifically say people who
 
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
have committed domestic violence second
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
degree assault it also doesn't say that
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
it that these people have to be released
 
00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
it's giving a judge discretion in the
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
cases where there's not been violence
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
committed um or assault committed and my
 
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
understanding is if you assaulted a
 
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
child or abused a child that you know
 
00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:30.200 align:start position:0%
the judge would certainly take that into
 
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
consideration as a a reason not to take
 
00:36:37.069 --> 00:36:37.079 align:start position:0%
this as an option that this isn't saying
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
the judge must but the judge May and and
 
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
so I just I don't understand where it
 
00:36:46.829 --> 00:36:46.839 align:start position:0%
specifically addresses um certain things
 
00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
that you're saying it doesn't seem to
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
address it it seems to be within here um
 
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
and that a person who in the best
 
00:36:56.109 --> 00:36:56.119 align:start position:0%
interest of a child has arranged the the
 
00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
temporary care care of a child it mean
 
00:36:59.349 --> 00:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
it just focuses a lot on making sure
 
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
children are protected as well as elders
 
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
and so I I'm I'm just confused because
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem to match at all with
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
what you're saying yeah no thank you so
 
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
much for that question and for the
 
00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:11.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to clarify so um I think to
 
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
point out um so this uh this bill
 
00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
includes the definitions of violent
 
00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
crime under RSA
 
00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
6515 uh section 10 uh I can do this 13
 
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:27.640 align:start position:0%
um Roman numerals so I under that is a
 
00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:29.599 align:start position:0%
is a list um and I'll show uh when I
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
send out the chart you'll see this a bit
 
00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:34.280 align:start position:0%
more clearly on that list the only crime
 
00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
under RSA 173b or sorry but there's this
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
list doesn't include any of the issues
 
00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
under 173b this only includes the uh
 
00:37:47.069 --> 00:37:47.079 align:start position:0%
actual crime of domestic violence under
 
00:37:47.079 --> 00:37:48.309 align:start position:0%
actual crime of domestic violence under
RSA

00:37:48.309 --> 00:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:37:52.109 --> 00:37:52.119 align:start position:0%
631 um so what what I'm trying to say
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
here is that someone could violate a
 
00:37:57.309 --> 00:37:57.319 align:start position:0%
protective order they could have these
 
00:37:59.430 --> 00:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
other crimes of abuse against them like
 
00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty and all of these other
 
00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:03.640 align:start position:0%
things that show a pattern of domestic
 
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
violence and not be considered violent
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
in this case under this bill so there's
 
00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
gaps in this that don't look at the
 
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:14.680 align:start position:0%
whole situation because domestic
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
violence under
 
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
173b is not a crime you have to have
 
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
certain um so it's it's a it's a gap in
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
the legislation to make sure it's
 
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
holistic what about her question
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
regarding the fact that it's only an
 
00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:31.640 align:start position:0%
option for the judge versus mandatory
 
00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
yeah um there's I know there's some
 
00:38:34.349 --> 00:38:34.359 align:start position:0%
folks in the room that might be able to
 
00:38:36.069 --> 00:38:36.079 align:start position:0%
better answer the legal process around
 
00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:37.480 align:start position:0%
this but it's my understanding that
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
judges already have the discretion to um
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
make sentences tailored to the
 
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:46.040 align:start position:0%
individual so I also just don't know why
 
00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
this is necessary to begin with and I
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
think if the goal is to bring children
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
and caregivers together then we need to
 
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
be looking at funding more programming
 
00:38:57.309 --> 00:38:57.319 align:start position:0%
um to ensure sure that there's more
 
00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
options to expand what we already have
 
00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:02.200 align:start position:0%
in the state um and to make sure that it
 
00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:05.839 align:start position:0%
can be very safely
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
designed one followup thank you if this
 
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
legislation had the list of offenses you
 
00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
included as an amendment would you then
 
00:39:17.309 --> 00:39:17.319 align:start position:0%
support it
 
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
we that thank you so much for asking
 
00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
that question that is something we've
 
00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:24.280 align:start position:0%
mold over um for a really long time I
 
00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:26.440 align:start position:0%
just don't think the approach of
 
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
creating carve outs is going to
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
adequately address our concerns because
 
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
there's a plethora of scenarios that
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
contemplate here and if we're especially
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
going to be saying that folks need to
 
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
them be matched to specific resources in
 
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
programming then I think we have need to
 
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
have a better idea of what those
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
resources in programming are and so I
 
00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:48.839 align:start position:0%
think this just is going to need a lot
 
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
more work and discussion to better
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
understand who who is going to fall
 
00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
under this umbrella and how we can
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
adequately support them to make sure
 
00:39:58.309 --> 00:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
that this would be a successful
 
00:39:58.319 --> 00:39:59.510 align:start position:0%
that this would be a successful
successful

00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
successful
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
proposal and just to be clear for the
 
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
members and anyone else um there will be
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to do that because I'm
 
00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:08.079 align:start position:0%
going to put this on a subcommittee uh
 
00:40:08.079 --> 00:40:09.589 align:start position:0%
going to put this on a subcommittee uh
representative

00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:13.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
question so it seems like the situation
 
00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
that you've
 
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
described um the judge H has the ability
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
right now with any sentence without a
 
00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
list to assign these particular
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
Solutions and now with this
 
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
legislation it has a list but he could
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
still is is that not correct or am I am
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
I not understanding the the discretion
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
that the judge has now yeah no um and I
 
00:40:43.309 --> 00:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
again would love to defer that to
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
someone with a little bit more practice
 
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
in court than I do um have but I do
 
00:40:49.309 --> 00:40:49.319 align:start position:0%
think like what I was trying to say is
 
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
currently judges do have discretion but
 
00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it doesn't necessarily relate
 
00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:55.720 align:start position:0%
directly to this bill but I think the
 
00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:58.040 align:start position:0%
the biggest thing thing is just like I
 
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
don't think this solution fits within
 
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
the current framework that we have in
 
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
our state and so we're going to need to
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
do a lot more work to look at the whole
 
00:41:08.589 --> 00:41:08.599 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um within this to make
 
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
sure that the judges have adequate
 
00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
distraction and that the right pieces
 
00:41:15.309 --> 00:41:15.319 align:start position:0%
then can fall into place but I defer to
 
00:41:15.319 --> 00:41:18.150 align:start position:0%
then can fall into place but I defer to
Legal

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
experts see enough for the question oh
 
00:41:22.829 --> 00:41:22.839 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Mr Wheeler represent wheeler
 
00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I know a lot of
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
work went into this bill here uh and
 
00:41:29.589 --> 00:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
they reached out to a lot of different
 
00:41:32.109 --> 00:41:32.119 align:start position:0%
stakeholders um and I'm wondering did
 
00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
the sponsor Prime sponsor reach out to
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
the domestic violence coalition to try
 
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
and alleviate some of those concerns and
 
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
have you uh work and find some way of
 
00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:43.880 align:start position:0%
mulling it over together to find a
 
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
comprehensive solution yeah I think we
 
00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:49.720 align:start position:0%
did um get there were a few efforts to
 
00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
reach out and unfortunately we were not
 
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
able to connect on multiple occasions
 
00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
and I really don't think there was a
 
00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
good good faith effort there because it
 
00:41:59.710 --> 00:41:59.720 align:start position:0%
was kind of in the 11th hour before the
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
filing period um I I think again we had
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
a a really strong list of concerns that
 
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
were presented when this bill was first
 
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
filed and so a lot of those concerns
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
continue to today and we've expressed
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
them over and over again and implored
 
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
them to speak to other stakeholders that
 
00:42:21.069 --> 00:42:21.079 align:start position:0%
we knew had similar concerns I don't
 
00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
know if those efforts were followed
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
through quick followup Mr chairman
 
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
followup and then I assume the domestic
 
00:42:29.549 --> 00:42:29.559 align:start position:0%
violence Coalition will participate in
 
00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee that the chairman has
 
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
said that he'll propose on this bill we
 
00:42:34.549 --> 00:42:34.559 align:start position:0%
are more than happy to serve as a
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
resource we just want to be at the table
 
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
thank you and so you shall be um see you
 
00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:43.240 align:start position:0%
no further questions thank you for your
 
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:46.400 align:start position:0%

pass on this important
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
bill as one of the organizers who worked
 
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
closely on this bill the primary
 
00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
caregiver bill is not a get had a jail
 
00:44:29.069 --> 00:44:29.079 align:start position:0%
free card this legislation provides
 
00:44:31.069 --> 00:44:31.079 align:start position:0%
communitybased alternatives to prison
 
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
for parents and primary caregivers with
 
00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:35.960 align:start position:0%
nonviolent crimes and if the court
 
00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:37.880 align:start position:0%
determines they are not a threat or a
 
00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
danger to the community with bills like
 
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
PE like with bills like the primary
 
00:44:45.069 --> 00:44:45.079 align:start position:0%
caregiver Bill the primary caregivers
 
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
can stay with their children and
 
00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
families isn't that what we all want is
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
to try to keep families together instead
 
00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
of tearing them apart we see so often
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
that what that looks like and the
 
00:44:59.910 --> 00:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
long-term harm that it causes to
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
families there's
 
00:45:04.829 --> 00:45:04.839 align:start position:0%
2,442 people currently incarcerated in

00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
are parents to young children having a

00:45:16.589 --> 00:45:16.599 align:start position:0%

experienced two or more
 
00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
Aces I'd now like to take this moment to
 
00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
read a letter from a woman who had to
 
00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:49.640 align:start position:0%
leave her newborn baby behind to face
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
her jail sentence hello my name is Emy
 
00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
Landry and I am from lonia New Hampshire
 
00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
I have I have a daughter who will be
 
00:45:59.349 --> 00:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
turning six in July of this year when I
 
00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
was first incarcerated she was only a
 
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
month old the charges I received have
 
00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
received had stemmed from before she was
 
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
conceived and although I found out after
 
00:46:11.549 --> 00:46:11.559 align:start position:0%
my arrest that I was pregnant it did not
 
00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
change the outcome at all I was
 
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
sentenced to County year and served 9
 
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
months out of the 12 that was my first
 
00:46:20.549 --> 00:46:20.559 align:start position:0%
incarceration and there were no
 
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
Alternatives offered despite my efforts
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
there was very it was very difficult to
 
00:46:27.549 --> 00:46:27.559 align:start position:0%
accept especially going through
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
postpartum depression behind walls due
 
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
to these circumstances I was lucky to
 
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
have a mother willing to step in to take
 
00:46:36.589 --> 00:46:36.599 align:start position:0%
over temporary guardianship when I
 
00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't be there I took a drug class in
 
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
County but the resources were lacking
 
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
upon release I had been struggling with
 
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
addiction since I was a teenager and
 
00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
when I got out I still felt lost it was
 
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
difficult transitioning into being a
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
mother of a 10-month-old infant of whom
 
00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
I was never there for the first year of
 
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
a child's life is crucial for bonding
 
00:47:00.349 --> 00:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
and I wasn't even given that option I
 
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
was released out on probation where I
 
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
was violated multiple times for
 
00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:06.839 align:start position:0%
continued drug use those violations
 
00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:08.839 align:start position:0%
along with other charges led to a prison
 
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
sentence in which my daughter was almost
 
00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
3 years old thankfully she was still
 
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
very young so she didn't grasp the
 
00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
concept of exactly where I was she just
 
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:19.480 align:start position:0%
knew that her mother wasn't there during
 
00:47:21.549 --> 00:47:21.559 align:start position:0%
my time in prison she was able to come
 
00:47:23.309 --> 00:47:23.319 align:start position:0%
visit me which helped me build a better
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
relationship between the two of us the
 
00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
transition back home was still difficult
 
00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
because of the time I was coming home to
 
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
a toddler not the one-month-old baby I
 
00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
left years ago during my incarcerations
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
my daughter started having medical
 
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
problems she she was getting sick often
 
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
and started showing signs of anger and
 
00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:43.640 align:start position:0%
physical aggression she was kicked out
 
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
of multiple daycares due to concerns of
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
other children Her speech was delayed so
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
she was unable to communicate with her
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
wants and needs properly she has since
 
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
been diagnosed with ADHD as well as
 
00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
being on excuse me she has since been
 
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with ADHD as well as being on
 
00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:06.839 align:start position:0%
autism spectrum she has an is she has an
 
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
individual learning program at school
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
and does speech therapy three times a
 
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
week if we were to rewind back a few
 
00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
years to the charges that started this
 
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
all I personally believe there could
 
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
have been a better solution I was in the
 
00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:21.839 align:start position:0%
full swing of my long addiction when I
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
was arrested for sales and conspiracy to
 
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
sell drugs I found out almost a year
 
00:48:28.589 --> 00:48:28.599 align:start position:0%
later after my arrest I was pregnant
 
00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:30.200 align:start position:0%
with my daughter and pleaded with my
 
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
lawyer to try to find an alternative to
 
00:48:34.349 --> 00:48:34.359 align:start position:0%
being locked up whether it was house
 
00:48:36.309 --> 00:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
arrest on a bracelet counseling
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
community service a long-term treatment
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
facility or all the above they said
 
00:48:43.309 --> 00:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
there wasn't on the that it wasn't on
 
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
the table and I would have to serve time
 
00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
or in county jail or in the state prison
 
00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:49.480 align:start position:0%
there was no middle ground I truly
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
believe if this had been an option that
 
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
my path as well as my daughters could
 
00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:55.640 align:start position:0%
have been drastically different
 
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
different it's almost 6 years since my
 
00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
first incarceration and I'm thankful to
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
say that I have been sober now four of
 
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
those years and out of prison for almost
 
00:49:06.069 --> 00:49:06.079 align:start position:0%
three to enjoy time with my daughter and
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
build a relationship I was denied in the
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
beginning it hasn't been the easiest and
 
00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:12.200 align:start position:0%
I'm still going to court to get back fil
 
00:49:14.789 --> 00:49:14.799 align:start position:0%
custody and dissolve the guardianship
 
00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
had leg has had we had legislation back
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
then like HB 1039 Emmy would have been
 
00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
received the proper care she needed
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
which was going to be substance care
 
00:49:25.119 --> 00:49:26.150 align:start position:0%
which was going to be substance care
counselor

00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
counselor
 
00:49:28.109 --> 00:49:28.119 align:start position:0%
because as you see incarceration did not
 
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:30.559 align:start position:0%
help emy's case she kept violating
 
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
because of the drug misuse incarceration
 
00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:35.960 align:start position:0%
did not fix that honestly statistic has
 
00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:38.440 align:start position:0%
shown that incarceration only causes
 
00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
more harm but that's a conversation and
 
00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
topic for another day but had she had
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
the alternative to incarceration and got
 
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
the counsel counseling she needed she
 
00:49:48.789 --> 00:49:48.799 align:start position:0%
would not have kept violating and
 
00:49:50.309 --> 00:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
missing those most important and
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
Precious Years of her daughter's life
 
00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
and would have been there for her
 
00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:55.640 align:start position:0%
daughter because as you see her daughter
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
was experiencing a few Aces that I had
 
00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:00.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned before due to parental
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
incarceration so please chairman and
 
00:50:05.109 --> 00:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
members of the committee the time is now
 
00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:08.200 align:start position:0%
support HB 1039 let's invest in
 
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
treatment job training and affordable
 
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
housing so we can help provide families
 
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
like Emmy with the resources and the
 
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
support they need to thrive with
 
00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
community- based alternatives to prison
 
00:50:21.549 --> 00:50:21.559 align:start position:0%
that allow caregivers of all types of
 
00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:23.720 align:start position:0%
with all types to remain in their
 
00:50:27.309 --> 00:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
families and their communities thank
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
you and I will take any questions if
 
00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
anyone has
 
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
one see no questions thank you for your
 
00:50:38.549 --> 00:50:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:50.109 --> 00:50:50.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
you all right uh attorney Steven
 
00:50:54.440 --> 00:51:05.710 align:start position:0%
you all right uh attorney Steven
Enders

00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:07.109 --> 00:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
good morning chair members of the
 
00:51:09.069 --> 00:51:09.079 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Stephen endis I'm a
 
00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
prosecutor in the uh marac County
 
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
Attorney's Office I've been a prosecutor
 
00:51:16.309 --> 00:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
for over 20 years I I do oppose this
 
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
legislation simply because I believe
 
00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:19.789 align:start position:0%
legislation simply because I believe
it's

00:51:19.789 --> 00:51:19.799 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:51:23.069 --> 00:51:23.079 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um let me start out by by
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
reading you a quote from the New
 
00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:26.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court
 
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
Court in 1978 the New Hampshire Supreme
 
00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
Court wrote the real purpose of all
 
00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
sentencing is to reduce crime this
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
theoretically can be done by
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
rehabilitating the individual defendant
 
00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
so he will not offend again another way
 
00:51:41.549 --> 00:51:41.559 align:start position:0%
is to punish the individual defendant in
 
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
the hope that he'll be deterred from
 
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
repeating his crime moreover by
 
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
punishing the individual defendant
 
00:51:50.589 --> 00:51:50.599 align:start position:0%
others may be deterred from committing
 
00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
crimes whichever sentence is thought to
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
be likely to reduce the most crime is
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
the proper sent sentence to
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
impose and that's something that I think
 
00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
judges live by and understand in the
 
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and in New
 
00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:07.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire everybody gets an individually
 
00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
assessed sentence there are very very
 
00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
few crimes that have minimum mandatory
 
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
penalties and when I say very very few I
 
00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:17.640 align:start position:0%
haven't gone through and looked to try
 
00:52:19.309 --> 00:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
and count them up but my guess would be
 
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
there's under 10 of them throughout the
 
00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
entire criminal code in fact I know in
 
00:52:26.349 --> 00:52:26.359 align:start position:0%
2016 the legislature formed a
 
00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to look at all of the
 
00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
crimes that did have minimum mandatory
 
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
sentences and look at whether or not
 
00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
those minimum mandatory sentences were
 
00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate I know as a result of that
 
00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
2016 subcommittee they changed one
 
00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
statute most of the crimes in the state
 
00:52:44.589 --> 00:52:44.599 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that have minimum
 
00:52:47.789 --> 00:52:47.799 align:start position:0%
mandatory sentences have prerequisite
 
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
crimes meaning for example armed career
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
criminal has a minimum mandatory
 
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
sentence but in order in order to be an
 
00:52:58.030 --> 00:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
armed career criminal you need to have a
 
00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
certain number of prerequisite violent
 
00:53:02.789 --> 00:53:02.799 align:start position:0%
felonies on your
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
record the list of options in this bill
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
the a through I list are available in
 
00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
all cases to all
 
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
defendants so I don't believe that it's
 
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
necessary to carve out an exception
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
saying for caregivers only for
 
00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
non-violent offenses only because judges
 
00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
in this state have discretion to impose
 
00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:25.670 align:start position:0%
in this state have discretion to impose
this

00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:28.510 align:start position:0%
this
inappropriate

00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:28.520 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:32.200 align:start position:0%
cases I'm also concerned with paragraph
 
00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
three which requires a person to
 
00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
potentially reappear in court after
 
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
sentencing I think there would be um
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional challenges to that
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
because it theoretically allows the
 
00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
court to change the sentence after it's
 
00:53:49.549 --> 00:53:49.559 align:start position:0%
imposed one of the tenants in New
 
00:53:51.789 --> 00:53:51.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is that once a sentence is
 
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
imposed everyone leaving the courtroom
 
00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:55.480 align:start position:0%
at the end of sentencing needs needs to
 
00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
know exactly what that sentence is and
 
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
exactly what the parameters of that
 
00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:01.030 align:start position:0%
exactly what the parameters of that
sentence

00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
are in terms of communicating to the
 
00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:05.349 align:start position:0%
are in terms of communicating to the
court

00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:08.839 align:start position:0%
system um that the
 
00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
legislature is is hoping the court will
 
00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
will impose these options a through I as
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
Miss keig said I think the appropriate
 
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:19.720 align:start position:0%
way to communicate that is to fund these
 
00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:21.640 align:start position:0%
programs because I think there's a real
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
concern now we we love programming I can
 
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
tell you as a prosecutor I love programs
 
00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
because if a program is going to stop
 
00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
crime that's
 
00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
fantastic defense attorneys love
 
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
programs too because if it keeps their
 
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
client out of jail and keeps their
 
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
client out of jail for the rest of their
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
client's life they love
 
00:54:45.789 --> 00:54:45.799 align:start position:0%
programs the problem is finding these
 
00:54:48.589 --> 00:54:48.599 align:start position:0%
programs that don't always necessarily
 
00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:51.160 align:start position:0%
exist and as usual I'm happy to answer
 
00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:52.870 align:start position:0%
exist and as usual I'm happy to answer
any

00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:54:55.870 --> 00:54:55.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um
 
00:54:57.710 --> 00:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
00:55:00.789 --> 00:55:00.799 align:start position:0%
the I I understood that the court
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
already had the opportunity or the
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
availability to use all these in the
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
list but what about the message of
 
00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
legislative preference I know that for
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
example um it used to be in
 
00:55:14.349 --> 00:55:14.359 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um when it came to
 
00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
domestic violence arrest it used to say
 
00:55:18.589 --> 00:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
the preferred shall be
 
00:55:21.549 --> 00:55:21.559 align:start position:0%
arrest can the legislature not send its
 
00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:24.520 align:start position:0%
its intent that our preference would be
 
00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
that they take take into account in the
 
00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
cases of uh
 
00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
caregivers I assume the legislature's
 
00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
preference is to stop
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
crime in terms of stopping people from
 
00:55:39.119 --> 00:55:40.990 align:start position:0%
crime in terms of stopping people from
committing

00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
committing
 
00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
crimes I think that's the Court's
 
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
preference as well I think we're all on
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
the same page in terms of our goal as
 
00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
the government all three branches is to
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
stop crime the question is how does that
 
00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
occur her um and if the legislature has
 
00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
a preference for
 
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
programming that that's fine you can I
 
00:56:05.069 --> 00:56:05.079 align:start position:0%
think say the legislature prefers that
 
00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:07.240 align:start position:0%
the court impose programming other over
 
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
incarceration but I think that with that
 
00:56:11.829 --> 00:56:11.839 align:start position:0%
goes providing that programming to the
 
00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
that uh with regard to your
 
00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional concern about the um
 
00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
changing of the sentence is it not not
 
00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:27.640 align:start position:0%
similar to a suspended sentence if they
 
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
were to if if they impose a
 
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
incarceration and then say okay we're
 
00:56:33.309 --> 00:56:33.319 align:start position:0%
going to enact the car I mean it looks
 
00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
like they would be imposing a whole new
 
00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:37.160 align:start position:0%
sentence but if it were written as a
 
00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
suspended sentence would that be
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely if it were written as a
 
00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
suspended sentence where when the person
 
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
is sentenced they know I
 
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
have you know two to five in the state
 
00:56:50.109 --> 00:56:50.119 align:start position:0%
prison that's suspended for a period of
 
00:56:53.029 --> 00:56:53.039 align:start position:0%
time conditioned on me doing these
 
00:56:56.349 --> 00:56:56.359 align:start position:0%
things that's certainly legal if the
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
person doesn't do those things we could
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
file a motion to impose that sentence
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
they'd be entitled to an attorney they'd
 
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
be entitled to a due process hearing and
 
00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
then the court could impose the portion
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
of of the suspended sense they felt
 
00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate um
 
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
this leaves it much
 
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
more Squishy in terms of not having a
 
00:57:21.390 --> 00:57:21.400 align:start position:0%
suspended sentence in the court saying
 
00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
that in the event of non-compliance
 
00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
impose sanctions those sanctions need to
 
00:57:29.109 --> 00:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
be told to the defendant at the time of
 
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
sentencing in terms of this is what we
 
00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:34.799 align:start position:0%
will do if you don't do
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
this thank you representative wheeler
 
00:57:39.829 --> 00:57:39.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so you said the
 
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
caregiver exception is not needed
 
00:57:43.789 --> 00:57:43.799 align:start position:0%
because judges have the discretion to
 
00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
make that exception themselves so I'm
 
00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:47.480 align:start position:0%
wondering what should the committee do
 
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
and I assume there might be a sub
 
00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:49.839 align:start position:0%
commmittee what should the committee do
 
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
about the situation that uh Paul
 
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
testified to when it when it comes to
 
00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:55.720 align:start position:0%
someone like like Dylan the legally
 
00:57:59.470 --> 00:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
blind person who uh can't keep their is
 
00:58:00.829 --> 00:58:00.839 align:start position:0%
going to because their caregiv was going
 
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
to jail they can't keep their medicine
 
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
and so we're hearing that this is
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
happening I guess the question is how
 
00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
would your office see as best to address
 
00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:13.160 align:start position:0%
the fact that some of these care givers
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
are going to prison and and people are
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
being left by the
 
00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
wayside there's number of ways sentences
 
00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
get imposed the the first and I think by
 
00:58:25.789 --> 00:58:25.799 align:start position:0%
far the most common way in New Hampshire
 
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
is people come to an agreement on what
 
00:58:30.069 --> 00:58:30.079 align:start position:0%
the sentence is going to
 
00:58:33.789 --> 00:58:33.799 align:start position:0%
be um in those cases where people come
 
00:58:35.349 --> 00:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
to an agreement over what the sentence
 
00:58:37.789 --> 00:58:37.799 align:start position:0%
is going to be which again is the vast
 
00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
majority of cases I I don't know there's
 
00:58:44.069 --> 00:58:44.079 align:start position:0%
anything we can do to say um you know
 
00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
these are some of the the the thoughts
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
about the the the dependent um certainly
 
00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
that should be factored in in those
 
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
conversations between the defense and
 
00:58:57.390 --> 00:58:57.400 align:start position:0%
the prosecution in coming up with an
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
agreement other ways sentences get
 
00:59:03.069 --> 00:59:03.079 align:start position:0%
imposed is it it's left up to the court
 
00:59:04.829 --> 00:59:04.839 align:start position:0%
it can be left up to the court after a
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
plea it can be left up to the court
 
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
after a contested hearing but when it's
 
00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
left up to the court people can provide
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
Witnesses evidence um people can come in
 
00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:19.160 align:start position:0%
and testify write letters sentencing
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
there's very few parameters for
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
sentencing in New Hampshire in terms of
 
00:59:26.349 --> 00:59:26.359 align:start position:0%
keeping information out or letting
 
00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
information in and certainly at a
 
00:59:30.589 --> 00:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
contested hearing that person would be
 
00:59:34.349 --> 00:59:34.359 align:start position:0%
welcom to say I'm a caregiver and people
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
depend on me and if I go to jail it's
 
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
going to not just impact me but it's
 
00:59:41.029 --> 00:59:41.039 align:start position:0%
going to impact the community it's going
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
to you know present difficulties for a
 
00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:46.359 align:start position:0%
variety of people um and then the judge
 
00:59:48.670 --> 00:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
would make a determination based on all
 
00:59:50.349 --> 00:59:50.359 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
information I don't I hope that answers
 
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
your question
 
00:59:59.230 --> 00:59:59.240 align:start position:0%
I think it does so you're saying that um
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
if and I'm just going to use the example
 
01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:02.359 align:start position:0%
that was given again if there was a
 
01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:03.839 align:start position:0%
legally blind person who wasn't getting
 
01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
their medicine because their caregiver
 
01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
was going to prison you're saying that
 
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
that person would the way that at least
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
the attorney's office thinks that that
 
01:00:12.549 --> 01:00:12.559 align:start position:0%
person should go about this is petition
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
the court send letters get the person
 
01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:17.720 align:start position:0%
who's getting care and other people who
 
01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:19.960 align:start position:0%
might be affiliated with that to go to
 
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
the court sentencing hearing and
 
01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:23.640 align:start position:0%
participate in that to make it clear
 
01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
that there might be some
 
01:00:27.829 --> 01:00:27.839 align:start position:0%
reason why absolutely and and I think it
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
depends too what the caregiver is going
 
01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
to prison for or going to jail for I
 
01:00:36.069 --> 01:00:36.079 align:start position:0%
think right well yes you and then obious
 
01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:37.240 align:start position:0%
really quickly Mr chairman I just want
 
01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:39.160 align:start position:0%
to make sure your name is spelled
 
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
correctly on my notes here because I
 
01:00:41.589 --> 01:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
feel like I've been spelling it wrong
 
01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:42.799 align:start position:0%
the last few days that you've been here
 
01:00:45.069 --> 01:00:45.079 align:start position:0%
it's Steven with a V and it's endress e
 
01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
n d r s e n d okay thank you thank you
 
01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
just a a question for me um is it not
 
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
common do you not regularly hear defense
 
01:00:57.029 --> 01:00:57.039 align:start position:0%
attorneys when it comes to sentencing
 
01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
say my client is responsible for ab andc
 
01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:03.400 align:start position:0%
and he has you know these conditions and
 
01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
is that not AB absolutely I mean we hear
 
01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
that all the time from from defense
 
01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:09.910 align:start position:0%
that all the time from from defense
attorneys

01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
01:01:12.029 --> 01:01:12.039 align:start position:0%
that and those are things that are taken
 
01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
into consideration and nothing prohibits
 
01:01:16.829 --> 01:01:16.839 align:start position:0%
the judge from considering those when
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
weighing a sense absolutely and again a
 
01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
lot of this is negotiation between the
 
01:01:25.029 --> 01:01:25.039 align:start position:0%
defense and the prosecution and
 
01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:27.160 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of times we're able to
 
01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
come up with an agreement that sort of
 
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
everyone can live with including the
 
01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
defendant the victims the prosecutor
 
01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
defense counsel um and then we would
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
present that agreement to the court and
 
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
the court would have to approve it if we
 
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
can't come to an
 
01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
agreement we end up having contested
 
01:01:47.349 --> 01:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
sentencing hearings and even in those
 
01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:49.640 align:start position:0%
contested sentencing hearings there are
 
01:01:53.269 --> 01:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
often parameters there's a sort of a
 
01:01:57.069 --> 01:01:57.079 align:start position:0%
naked sentencing hearing where it's
 
01:01:59.510 --> 01:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
anybody can ask for whatever they want
 
01:02:01.789 --> 01:02:01.799 align:start position:0%
we also do cap sentencing hearings where
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
essentially the state is going to ask
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
for a certain sentence and the defense
 
01:02:07.589 --> 01:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
is going to argue for anything below
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
that and there's also the possibility to
 
01:02:13.870 --> 01:02:13.880 align:start position:0%
do capped floor sentencing arguments
 
01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
where the state's going to ask for one
 
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
thing the defendants going to ask for
 
01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
something lower and the court can impose
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
anything within those two parameters
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
that cap floor so it's it's not always a
 
01:02:30.269 --> 01:02:30.279 align:start position:0%
throw yourself on the mercy of the court
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
but certainly every defendant if they
 
01:02:36.309 --> 01:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
want to have a an open sort of naked
 
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:43.349 --> 01:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
so representative Harry
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
Katherine thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:02:48.109 --> 01:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question earlier you
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
stated that um in section three it said
 
01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
that it requires the person to appear in
 
01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
court um um I'm going to say the line 18
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
and line 20 says may correct and there
 
01:03:01.829 --> 01:03:01.839 align:start position:0%
is a difference so I just want to make
 
01:03:04.349 --> 01:03:04.359 align:start position:0%
sure that we're on the same absolutely
 
01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
it doesn't require them to appear but it
 
01:03:08.829 --> 01:03:08.839 align:start position:0%
may require them to appear so again
 
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
that's sorry finish a statement my
 
01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:14.680 align:start position:0%
concern is that that would violate the
 
01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:17.720 align:start position:0%
current um principles of due process in
 
01:03:21.269 --> 01:03:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:26.589 --> 01:03:26.599 align:start position:0%
sentencing okay follow up follow so um
 
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
again for me who's not a lawyer we look
 
01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
at that as being a discretion uh the
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
judge is that not correct if it says
 
01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
may it's my concern with that paragraph
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
is that at the moment you're sentenced
 
01:03:45.150 --> 01:03:45.160 align:start position:0%
you need to know exactly what the
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
sentence is and what the parameters of
 
01:03:50.269 --> 01:03:50.279 align:start position:0%
that sentence are so if at the moment of
 
01:03:53.309 --> 01:03:53.319 align:start position:0%
sentencing the judge says I'm sentencing
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
you to drug and alcohol treatment and
 
01:03:59.069 --> 01:03:59.079 align:start position:0%
then two months later the judge says I
 
01:04:01.309 --> 01:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
would like to see you to see how you're
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
doing in that drug and alcohol treatment
 
01:04:08.029 --> 01:04:08.039 align:start position:0%
I believe that runs a fowl of the
 
01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
finality of sentencing I think the Judge
 
01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
can say I'm sentencing you to drug and
 
01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
alcohol treatment and we're going to
 
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
have review hearings every two months to
 
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
see how you're doing and if you're not
 
01:04:21.789 --> 01:04:21.799 align:start position:0%
successful in drug and alcohol treatment
 
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
this is the sentence I'm going to impose
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
but has to be known to the defendant at
 
01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
sentencing go ahead okay with that said
 
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for that information um would
 
01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:37.160 align:start position:0%
you be willing to work with the group on
 
01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:39.640 align:start position:0%
that issue as well absolutely all right
 
01:04:42.269 --> 01:04:42.279 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you just so um if you
 
01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
could help me so everyone understands at
 
01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
sentencing you're
 
01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
either sentenced to further further
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
um further
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
supervision by the court or not correct
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
you can't be the court can't just kind
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
of reach out and pull you back in if
 
01:05:03.309 --> 01:05:03.319 align:start position:0%
you're not sentenced to it correct so
 
01:05:05.950 --> 01:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
you could be sentenced to probation and
 
01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:07.559 align:start position:0%
part of that could be going to this this
 
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
and this and if you don't you could be
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
violated and have a new hearing yes
 
01:05:13.349 --> 01:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
which would impose a new sentence for
 
01:05:15.789 --> 01:05:15.799 align:start position:0%
violation probation correct okay so you
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
can't just be the judge will call you
 
01:05:18.510 --> 01:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
back and check on you and if you're not
 
01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%
doing well he's going to send you to
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
jail correct okay thank you um
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative new new
 
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I'm thinking about
 
01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
drug and mental health courts and kind
 
01:05:32.349 --> 01:05:32.359 align:start position:0%
of how this interacts with that and I
 
01:05:35.029 --> 01:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
know that you know it's an evolution and
 
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
you know they're being um expanded over
 
01:05:39.549 --> 01:05:39.559 align:start position:0%
time I think mental health courts is is
 
01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:41.480 align:start position:0%
much more recent and I'm wondering how
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
this kind of interacts with this and how
 
01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:46.119 align:start position:0%
you would think that um that these the
 
01:05:48.309 --> 01:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
interplay between these things well
 
01:05:50.029 --> 01:05:50.039 align:start position:0%
there is a drug court program and a
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
mental health court program in maram
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
County right now um the the drug court
 
01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
program is a program for people who who
 
01:05:58.750 --> 01:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
do have substance misuse issues they
 
01:06:01.549 --> 01:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
apply to get in they have to be screened
 
01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
accepted um and my understanding is that
 
01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
that has a higher rate of success than
 
01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:12.640 align:start position:0%
sort of the standard incarceration model
 
01:06:14.029 --> 01:06:14.039 align:start position:0%
um mental health court at this point I
 
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
believe is only for misdemeanors in in
 
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
maram County but I know they've looked
 
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
at expanding that as well and I think
 
01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:23.240 align:start position:0%
again as I said earlier everyone in New
 
01:06:25.069 --> 01:06:25.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire gets an individually assess
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
sentence and if drug court or mental
 
01:06:29.069 --> 01:06:29.079 align:start position:0%
health court is
 
01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate hopefully that's what the
 
01:06:33.549 --> 01:06:33.559 align:start position:0%
judge imposes could I follow up really
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
quick okay um and so in the example that
 
01:06:40.029 --> 01:06:40.039 align:start position:0%
ailia gave thank you for that um
 
01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
speaking about I think it was Emma um
 
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
the situation that that she went through
 
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
um without um and repeatedly you know
 
01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
but do you think that now um clearly
 
01:06:51.390 --> 01:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
that was a few years ago do you think
 
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
that now a person in that same situation
 
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
may have been diverted to drug court
 
01:06:59.589 --> 01:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
instead potentially um it's tough to say
 
01:07:01.390 --> 01:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
without knowing that and again like
 
01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
you're saying it's very difficult to
 
01:07:03.789 --> 01:07:03.799 align:start position:0%
know without knowing all the
 
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
circumstances of that case but certainly
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
as I said earlier our goal is to to stop
 
01:07:13.309 --> 01:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
crime and our goal is to stop people
 
01:07:15.549 --> 01:07:15.559 align:start position:0%
from getting arrested and if someone
 
01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:18.200 align:start position:0%
says to me look sending this person to
 
01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
jail isn't going to essentially cure the
 
01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
problem but drug court will
 
01:07:26.549 --> 01:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
I think 10 out of 10 judges are going to
 
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
send the person to drug court because
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's our
 
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:37.480 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:07:39.549 --> 01:07:39.559 align:start position:0%
Jamber thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question it's been a while
 
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
since I was in college for my degree in
 
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
criminal justice so I I'm I'm hoping
 
01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
that you could give me some information
 
01:07:51.029 --> 01:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
that I'm I hope I'm correct yes um prior
 
01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:53.480 align:start position:0%
to sentencing for a felony the New
 
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire parole department probation
 
01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
parole department does a pre-sentence
 
01:08:01.309 --> 01:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
investigations is that still correct not
 
01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
as much anymore okay that that used to
 
01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:06.559 align:start position:0%
be a standard practice I think that's
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
not as um I think it's a potential but I
 
01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:11.839 align:start position:0%
think it's less common than it was in
 
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
the past okay followup follow um if that
 
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
were the practice today do you believe
 
01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
that the assessment uh that is required
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
in section two of the bill
 
01:08:27.149 --> 01:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
uh to determine because it says the the
 
01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
sentence in court will determine would
 
01:08:31.829 --> 01:08:31.839 align:start position:0%
that investigation be helpful to the
 
01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:38.669 --> 01:08:38.679 align:start position:0%
happen I I think more information is
 
01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
always helpful to the court in making a
 
01:08:44.709 --> 01:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
decision so I think if um what you're
 
01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
referring to is used to be a called a
 
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
PSI a PR sentence investigation those
 
01:08:52.149 --> 01:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
PSIs I think were helpful to the court
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
in the sense that probation or parole
 
01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
would talk to um the state they would
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
talk to the defendant they would talk to
 
01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
defense counsel they' talk to any of the
 
01:09:03.550 --> 01:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
victims and would make a recommendation
 
01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
to the court saying this is what we
 
01:09:08.829 --> 01:09:08.839 align:start position:0%
believe in appropriate sentences um so I
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
think all certainly if I was a judge
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
sentencing people I would want more
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
less representative
 
01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
Newman I have a question about the uh
 
01:09:26.910 --> 01:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
current law yes and the current law in
 
01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
sentencing and it's 6
 
01:09:36.030 --> 01:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
6512 subparagraph 4 d and I'll just read
 
01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
it it's very short upon recommendation
 
01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
by the Department of Corrections are by
 
01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:43.400 align:start position:0%
the county department of corrections a
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
court May sentence an in an
 
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
incarceration bound offender to a
 
01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
special alternative incarceration
 
01:09:54.430 --> 01:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
program involving
 
01:09:57.510 --> 01:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
short-term confinement followed by
 
01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
intensive community so to me that sounds
 
01:10:02.830 --> 01:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
a lot like this except for the
 
01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
short-term confinement and I'm wondering
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
about when it says intensive Community
 
01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
Supervision what does that realistically
 
01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
mean in in the state now um are any of
 
01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
these things that are on the list that
 
01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
might be considered uh is that part of
 
01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:21.560 align:start position:0%
Community Supervision do you have any
 
01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that law and and what it
 
01:10:27.630 --> 01:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
says yes and it's a relationship to what
 
01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about right now yes so
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
there there is a program and the name is
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
escaping me right now where a person
 
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
does a short period of incarceration
 
01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
during that period of incarceration they
 
01:10:43.870 --> 01:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
go through um a drug treatment program
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
and then they're released into the
 
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
community on uh probation supervision
 
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
but it's a more intensive probation
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
supervision than sort of standard
 
01:10:57.189 --> 01:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
probation where maybe instead of being
 
01:10:59.830 --> 01:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
checked in you know a couple times a
 
01:11:02.110 --> 01:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
week by a phone you have a probation
 
01:11:04.830 --> 01:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
officer visit your home more often uh
 
01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
that type of thing and that program does
 
01:11:08.189 --> 01:11:08.199 align:start position:0%
in fact exist in New Hampshire at this
 
01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
time thank
 
01:11:12.669 --> 01:11:12.679 align:start position:0%

kcki

01:11:32.350 --> 01:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
hello good after oh still the morning it
 
01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:35.880 align:start position:0%

Grace K I am the program coordinator for
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
the American friend service committee
 
01:11:47.149 --> 01:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire program uh and we are here
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
to urge the committee to vote to pass HB
 
01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:51.590 align:start position:0%
to urge the committee to vote to pass HB
turn

01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
turn
 
01:11:54.669 --> 01:11:54.679 align:start position:0%
1039 um because having incarcerated uh
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
parent is is and can be in and of itself
 
01:11:59.189 --> 01:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
a childhood an adverse childhood
 
01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
experience this is an opportunity for
 
01:12:03.149 --> 01:12:03.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to take the lead and to
 
01:12:05.310 --> 01:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
join three other states in passing
 
01:12:07.870 --> 01:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
legislation that would expand discretion
 
01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
in the courts for non-violent offenders
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
who are the caregivers of children edly
 
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
or disabled loved ones who are not also
 
01:12:17.629 --> 01:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
the victims of those perpetrators and so
 
01:12:19.390 --> 01:12:19.400 align:start position:0%
our Coalition I just wanted to address a
 
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
couple of things as I've heard
 
01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the meeting and to say that
 
01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
our Coalition has worked very hard over
 
01:12:26.669 --> 01:12:26.679 align:start position:0%
the last year in good faith to address
 
01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
some of the weaknesses of the bill from
 
01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
the last session we have reached out to
 
01:12:32.830 --> 01:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
multiple stakeholders have had very
 
01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
informative conversations in order to
 
01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
ensure that our bill um addresses those
 
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
two key concerns about the impact that
 
01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
it would have on uh victims as well as
 
01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
the impact that it would have in the
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
courts to ensure that sentencing was
 
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
made clear to uh those who are you know
 
01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
in front of the judge during their
 
01:12:53.229 --> 01:12:53.239 align:start position:0%
sentencing and throughout their their
 
01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
case cases and so we have reached out to
 
01:12:57.950 --> 01:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
not only Representatives within the
 
01:13:00.189 --> 01:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
parole and the probation system we have
 
01:13:02.110 --> 01:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
reached out and talked with Office of
 
01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
the child advocate New Hampshire Public
 
01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
Defenders and of course directly
 
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
impacted community members I would like
 
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
to make note that we have also done
 
01:13:12.149 --> 01:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of work to reach out and
 
01:13:13.950 --> 01:13:13.960 align:start position:0%
have conversations with the Coalition
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
for domestic violence um we have this
 
01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:20.440 align:start position:0%
these overtures began in the summer of
 
01:13:24.590 --> 01:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
2023 via phone and email um and after
 
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
multiple weeks of of reaching we were
 
01:13:30.430 --> 01:13:30.440 align:start position:0%
able to get about 10 minutes with Miss
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
uh Miss keig um myself and my associate
 
01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
ofilia uh brunette who you just heard a
 
01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
moment ago um this isn't something that
 
01:13:40.669 --> 01:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
I often speak about it's deeply personal
 
01:13:42.629 --> 01:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
um but I feel that it is important to
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
make note of today I myself am the
 
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
victim of a crime um I experience um
 
01:13:51.229 --> 01:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
horrific events as a child here in the
 
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire where I grew up
 
01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
um and I knew that I where I come from
 
01:13:57.470 --> 01:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
even though I've never had an
 
01:13:59.310 --> 01:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
incarcerated parent although I have
 
01:14:02.189 --> 01:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
incarcerated loved ones that this bill
 
01:14:04.709 --> 01:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
is still vital and important and will
 
01:14:08.350 --> 01:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
have an A A positive and outward impact
 
01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
on many people in this Comm in this
 
01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
community and so despite these multiple
 
01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
attempts um and being able to only have
 
01:14:19.229 --> 01:14:19.239 align:start position:0%
about 10 minutes with the with the
 
01:14:21.310 --> 01:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
coalition to hear their concerns and do
 
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
our best to incorporate them um our
 
01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
efforts afterward to reach out and to
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
share what we have put together what we
 
01:14:30.669 --> 01:14:30.679 align:start position:0%
were going to submit to the to the
 
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
legislature were rebuffed and we never
 
01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:35.080 align:start position:0%
heard back from the Coalition so we
 
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
continue to want to work together with
 
01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
stakeholders with the community to
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
ensure that this bill both is makes
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
sense is sensible as well as um truly um
 
01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
something that can create positive
 
01:14:50.709 --> 01:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
impact in the New Hampshire community
 
01:14:53.470 --> 01:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
and so one of the things that I so with
 
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
all that being said and I apologize I'm
 
01:14:56.830 --> 01:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
a little bit shaky cuz again it's not
 
01:14:58.350 --> 01:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
information that I I feel most
 
01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
comfortable speaking with in um a body
 
01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
of my peers but um I think what's also
 
01:15:06.189 --> 01:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
important is that at afsc we have the
 
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
immense privilege to be able to work
 
01:15:10.709 --> 01:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
directly with impact directly impacted
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
people who have either themselves
 
01:15:14.629 --> 01:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
experienced incarceration or have loved
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
ones who have experienced incarceration
 
01:15:19.229 --> 01:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
and we know that incarceration is not
 
01:15:21.629 --> 01:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
always the solution especially for
 
01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
low-level offenses for non-violent
 
01:15:27.310 --> 01:15:27.320 align:start position:0%
offenses often which are sometimes even
 
01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
often drug related and these things
 
01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
require treatment they require support
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
um and that incarceration is not always
 
01:15:37.229 --> 01:15:37.239 align:start position:0%
the answer and so what I would like to
 
01:15:40.510 --> 01:15:40.520 align:start position:0%
do is to read a brief testimony from a
 
01:15:42.669 --> 01:15:42.679 align:start position:0%
woman who was incarcerated a Community
 
01:15:43.629 --> 01:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
member in New Hampshire who was
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
incarcerated who was not able to be with
 
01:15:47.709 --> 01:15:47.719 align:start position:0%
us today because she does have her own
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
caregiving responsibilities um but would
 
01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that the committee
 
01:15:54.270 --> 01:15:54.280 align:start position:0%
heard her word
 
01:15:57.430 --> 01:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
today and so this is from Susie I
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
support the primary caregiver bill
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
because it makes sense for our community
 
01:16:03.709 --> 01:16:03.719 align:start position:0%
I have lived experience as a formerly
 
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
incarcerated woman who was separated
 
01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
from her children for quite a few years
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
beyond the financial impact which
 
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
directly influenced my children there
 
01:16:14.229 --> 01:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
were they were othered by the stigma of
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
having an incarcerated parent
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
incidentally now my son is being treated
 
01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
for anxiety as well as other
 
01:16:22.629 --> 01:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
psychological concerns due to this
 
01:16:22.639 --> 01:16:23.870 align:start position:0%
psychological concerns due to this
separation

01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
separation
 
01:16:26.550 --> 01:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
upon my return home I noticed my I had
 
01:16:28.629 --> 01:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
my my own inability to manage activities
 
01:16:30.669 --> 01:16:30.679 align:start position:0%
of daily living to needed to support
 
01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
three small children I imagined that my
 
01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
brain atrophied from years of sitting
 
01:16:37.149 --> 01:16:37.159 align:start position:0%
idle with limited decision-making and
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities in prison it also added
 
01:16:43.350 --> 01:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
to my own complex um PTSD this is
 
01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
important because my children have lived
 
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
the reifications of my lack of mother
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
and skills since I returned home from
 
01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:52.159 align:start position:0%
prison if we rewind some decades I had a
 
01:16:54.430 --> 01:16:54.440 align:start position:0%
high ad adverse childhood experience
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
score making me more susceptible to
 
01:16:58.709 --> 01:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
incarceration while this is not an
 
01:17:01.229 --> 01:17:01.239 align:start position:0%
excuse at all for my behavior it is not
 
01:17:03.070 --> 01:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
worthy to look at the roots of these
 
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
problems I believe that New Hampshire
 
01:17:07.070 --> 01:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
can break the cycle of recidivism and
 
01:17:09.149 --> 01:17:09.159 align:start position:0%
think big picture to see that this bill
 
01:17:10.669 --> 01:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
will have Ripple effects that will
 
01:17:13.229 --> 01:17:13.239 align:start position:0%
benefit many in our communities perhaps
 
01:17:15.310 --> 01:17:15.320 align:start position:0%
you thinking that this bill would allow
 
01:17:17.709 --> 01:17:17.719 align:start position:0%
people to forego accountability my
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
personal experience and those that I
 
01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:21.080 align:start position:0%
have witnessed did not allow for True
 
01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
accountability inside the walls of
 
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
prison where our nervous systems were
 
01:17:27.669 --> 01:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
continually activated due to the shaming
 
01:17:29.629 --> 01:17:29.639 align:start position:0%
and punitive environment as well as a
 
01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
separation from our loved ones perhaps
 
01:17:33.470 --> 01:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
you're thinking that prison is the only
 
01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:35.560 align:start position:0%
way to keep our community safe but
 
01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
prisons have been around for hundreds of
 
01:17:39.229 --> 01:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
years and yet we continue to face safety
 
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
threats from individuals who are
 
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
traumatized abused and suffering from
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
mental health issues as well as
 
01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
substance abuse the recidivism rate is
 
01:17:49.189 --> 01:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
high because we are failing to address
 
01:17:50.990 --> 01:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
the root causes of the problem and to
 
01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
remember that hurt people also hurt
 
01:17:55.870 --> 01:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
people we can do better and we can do
 
01:17:58.470 --> 01:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
better by passing HB
 
01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
1039 and so I would like to close my
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
testimony by making note that overall
 
01:18:05.950 --> 01:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
the incarceration rates in New Hampshire
 
01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
are far below the national average and
 
01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
the prison population has been declining
 
01:18:11.870 --> 01:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
and this is positive news because it
 
01:18:13.629 --> 01:18:13.639 align:start position:0%
shows that the E our efforts the efforts
 
01:18:15.550 --> 01:18:15.560 align:start position:0%
of this committee as well as the efforts
 
01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
within our judicial system are doing
 
01:18:20.350 --> 01:18:20.360 align:start position:0%
exactly what um Mr Enders was speaking
 
01:18:22.510 --> 01:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
of is ensuring that crimes are not being
 
01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
committed right and so this is an
 
01:18:26.910 --> 01:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity this bill is a way another
 
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
way an additional way that we can add to
 
01:18:32.189 --> 01:18:32.199 align:start position:0%
continue to safely reduce the prison
 
01:18:34.990 --> 01:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
population further leading to prison
 
01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
closures saving taxpayer dollars and all
 
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
the while keeping families together and
 
01:18:44.189 --> 01:18:44.199 align:start position:0%
so I urge you to um I'm no legal expert
 
01:18:45.629 --> 01:18:45.639 align:start position:0%
but I also wanted to just quickly
 
01:18:47.310 --> 01:18:47.320 align:start position:0%
address the well as well that in
 
01:18:50.510 --> 01:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
speaking with um law experts in crafting
 
01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
this bill as a coalition we were very
 
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
very thoughtful about thinking about
 
01:18:59.470 --> 01:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
would this go adverse to the um the due
 
01:19:01.390 --> 01:19:01.400 align:start position:0%
process that the importance of making
 
01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
sure that everyone who comes in front of
 
01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
a judge knows exactly what the terms of
 
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
their sentence is and so this bill would
 
01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
be an additional tool in the toolbox of
 
01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
the courts to say these are options this
 
01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
is an addition that we can add on to
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
your sentence and as long as you meet
 
01:19:19.870 --> 01:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
those conditions you meet those
 
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
requirements then the terms of the terms
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
of your sentence will not end in
 
01:19:26.629 --> 01:19:26.639 align:start position:0%
incarceration this is not a way to slip
 
01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
through the cracks or to go underneath
 
01:19:31.149 --> 01:19:31.159 align:start position:0%
the system but is an additional way for
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
our system to continue um bolstering the
 
01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
trend that we are seeing of making sure
 
01:19:39.229 --> 01:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
that people can be held accountable that
 
01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
families can stay together that
 
01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
communities can remain intact and we can
 
01:19:45.790 --> 01:19:45.800 align:start position:0%
continue having a safer State and a
 
01:19:48.189 --> 01:19:48.199 align:start position:0%
safer Community for all so I'm happy to
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:57.950 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:02.110 --> 01:20:02.120 align:start position:0%

gelli good
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
morning thank you for having me um I'm
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
going to be speaking from a different
 
01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
from uh a a few a few um different
 
01:20:30.669 --> 01:20:30.679 align:start position:0%
points of
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
view um before I before I uh before I
 
01:20:36.510 --> 01:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
give my testimony I just wanted to I
 
01:20:37.669 --> 01:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
wanted to touch on a few of the things
 
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
that I heard from some from the other
 
01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
from the people who are opposing the
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
bill and it's it's it's very it's pretty
 
01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
easy when you are not the one that's
 
01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
sitting on the defendant side of the
 
01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
table and me going be I've been through
 
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
the system um more than i' like to admit
 
01:20:57.950 --> 01:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
so I I know I know firsthand that the
 
01:21:00.669 --> 01:21:00.679 align:start position:0%
courts and all of these all of these
 
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
legal systems have a bias so yes they
 
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
have discretion but their discretion is
 
01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
always leaning towards whatever the
 
01:21:09.669 --> 01:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
prosecutor is suggesting so we don't
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
really have a chance unless there's some
 
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
a bill like this that's that says you
 
01:21:15.189 --> 01:21:15.199 align:start position:0%
know Al like a law that needs to be
 
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
followed along with the other ones as
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
far as the sentence being sentenced and
 
01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
then returning back there are such
 
01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:23.639 align:start position:0%
things as review hearings you can the
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
you can be sentenced to this and then be
 
01:21:27.310 --> 01:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
sentenced later on date come back as for
 
01:21:29.149 --> 01:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
a review hearing see if you completed
 
01:21:30.790 --> 01:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
anything and then you sentence ends that
 
01:21:32.669 --> 01:21:32.679 align:start position:0%
day and you're convicted that day I've
 
01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
been through
 
01:21:34.199 --> 01:21:35.709 align:start position:0%
been through
that

01:21:35.709 --> 01:21:35.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:21:35.719 --> 01:21:37.590 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:21:37.590 --> 01:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:39.750 align:start position:0%
um
also

01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh from from from the criminals point of
 
01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
view when when people are out there
 
01:21:46.590 --> 01:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
committing crimes and doing things that
 
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
are against the law the last thing that
 
01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
they're thinking about is how much time
 
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
they can get for doing it they're not
 
01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
thinking about the punishment in the
 
01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
moment and not that that's not that's
 
01:21:57.070 --> 01:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
not something that's being evaluated as
 
01:21:58.590 --> 01:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
they commit these crimes as these crimes
 
01:22:00.669 --> 01:22:00.679 align:start position:0%
are committed so the the more the worse
 
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
the punishment or the higher the the the
 
01:22:04.669 --> 01:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
longer the time is not going to make a
 
01:22:06.629 --> 01:22:06.639 align:start position:0%
difference in preventing people from
 
01:22:06.639 --> 01:22:09.669 align:start position:0%
difference in preventing people from
committing

01:22:09.669 --> 01:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:13.110 --> 01:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
crimes um and as far as um I heard
 
01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
someone say that it doesn't fit within
 
01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:15.270 align:start position:0%
someone say that it doesn't fit within
the

01:22:15.270 --> 01:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:17.470 --> 01:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure no it they're right it
 
01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
does not fit within the infrastructure
 
01:22:21.149 --> 01:22:21.159 align:start position:0%
that's the whole point it doesn't fit
 
01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
within the infrastructure we are we have
 
01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
enough they have enough things under
 
01:22:26.350 --> 01:22:26.360 align:start position:0%
their their in under their umbrella in
 
01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
their infrastructure to impose sentences
 
01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
and and sentence and convict people
 
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
where's the where is the help it's not
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's not a it's not a secret that
 
01:22:39.669 --> 01:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation is the key to to uh to
 
01:22:41.830 --> 01:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
reform people who are who are coming out
 
01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
of the prisons it's not it's not a
 
01:22:46.030 --> 01:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
secret this is known for many years
 
01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:47.560 align:start position:0%
through many
 
01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
studies so they're right it does not fit
 
01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:09.149 --> 01:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
testimony um I'd like to briefly share a
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
part of my story the part the part that
 
01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
left the deepest wound in my heart for a
 
01:23:18.270 --> 01:23:18.280 align:start position:0%
sake of time I'm just going to summarize
 
01:23:20.189 --> 01:23:20.199 align:start position:0%
um some of this some of my my upbringing
 
01:23:22.149 --> 01:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
and things um I grew up with my mother
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
who's Dominican Republic and I and I can
 
01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
count on one hand how many times I saw
 
01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
my father before he died I'm the oldest
 
01:23:29.430 --> 01:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
of three on my mom's side my mother
 
01:23:31.470 --> 01:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
remarried when I was 8 years old this
 
01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
would be this would become my brother's
 
01:23:35.790 --> 01:23:35.800 align:start position:0%
my young my brother's father and also my
 
01:23:37.950 --> 01:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
abuser I was sexually molested from the
 
01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
time that I from from that time of 8
 
01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
years old until my late teens I had been
 
01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
sexually abused for the majority of my
 
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
life at that point and I had actually
 
01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:48.199 align:start position:0%
believed that I was just fine yet the
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
following years would come to prove that
 
01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
I was not fine that I was not that I was
 
01:23:54.189 --> 01:23:54.199 align:start position:0%
not fine I was not mentally fine I was
 
01:23:56.350 --> 01:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
not emotionally fine I was not fine in
 
01:23:59.070 --> 01:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
any way I had my first child at 17 when
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
I started going to jail I had four kids
 
01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
and one on the way looking for love in
 
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
all the wrong places I got I got
 
01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
involved with I got involved with the
 
01:24:11.669 --> 01:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
wrong people and wanted I wanted to feel
 
01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
like I belong somewhere anywhere I it
 
01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:15.560 align:start position:0%
didn't really much matter where I just
 
01:24:17.709 --> 01:24:17.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to belong long story short I
 
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
ended up having to serve a two year two
 
01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
to four year sentence I had DCF
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
involvement due to my drug use and I was
 
01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
their Prime and I was their primary
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
caregiver I made sure they were fed
 
01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
clothed and sheltered no matter what I
 
01:24:29.950 --> 01:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
had to do to to make sure that that
 
01:24:32.030 --> 01:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
happened my mother was babysitting one
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
day and I was extremely stressed out and
 
01:24:34.990 --> 01:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
I uttered that I was going to jump off
 
01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
of the bridge to my mother I wouldn't
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
never go I would never go through with
 
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
it like anything like that it's just how
 
01:24:44.350 --> 01:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
I felt at that time my mother told DCF
 
01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
that I had said that that I had said
 
01:24:47.229 --> 01:24:47.239 align:start position:0%
that and they instructed her not to
 
01:24:49.830 --> 01:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
allow me to not to allow me to see my
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
children my mother having a language
 
01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
barrier didn't understand the ver the
 
01:24:55.709 --> 01:24:55.719 align:start position:0%
veracity of the situation my children
 
01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to come home with their mother
 
01:24:59.550 --> 01:24:59.560 align:start position:0%
and she brought them to me DCF found out
 
01:25:02.590 --> 01:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
and re remove them from her care the 12-
 
01:25:04.270 --> 01:25:04.280 align:start position:0%
month clock to fix the life that I had
 
01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
spent my entire life messing up started
 
01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
ticking being in prison didn't make me
 
01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
an exempt ultimately the time
 
01:25:12.109 --> 01:25:12.119 align:start position:0%
termination of parental rights rolled
 
01:25:14.229 --> 01:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
around I was able to prove my 5year
 
01:25:16.709 --> 01:25:16.719 align:start position:0%
sobriety I was no longer the same person
 
01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
I did I I did a complete sustainable
 
01:25:22.830 --> 01:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
180 I had set out to proed that I
 
01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
deserved my own children back I was
 
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
convinced that I had that I had that the
 
01:25:30.030 --> 01:25:30.040 align:start position:0%
fact is I never had a chance my parental
 
01:25:31.470 --> 01:25:31.480 align:start position:0%
rights were terminated because I did not
 
01:25:33.669 --> 01:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
comply within 12 months I wasn't aable
 
01:25:35.669 --> 01:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
to obtain suitable shelter I had one
 
01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
last visit with them 14 years
 
01:25:41.229 --> 01:25:41.239 align:start position:0%
ago when they were four five and six
 
01:25:41.239 --> 01:25:42.270 align:start position:0%
ago when they were four five and six
years

01:25:42.270 --> 01:25:42.280 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
old had this bill been in place during
 
01:25:45.870 --> 01:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
that time I would have had a better
 
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
chances of regaining custody of my
 
01:25:51.070 --> 01:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
children because I I want because at
 
01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
that time I did um I had submitted to
 
01:25:56.350 --> 01:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
the court to to uh me to amend my
 
01:25:59.790 --> 01:25:59.800 align:start position:0%
sentence to be able to uh to Le to go
 
01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
into a program instead of um committing
 
01:26:04.590 --> 01:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
the rest of my the remainder of my time
 
01:26:06.430 --> 01:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
and it was denied so the judge's
 
01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
discretion didn't help me in that
 
01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
case it's too um someone someone else uh
 
01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
I had this bill been in place during
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
that time I would have I would have had
 
01:26:17.550 --> 01:26:17.560 align:start position:0%
better chances of regaining custody of
 
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
my children it's too late for that for
 
01:26:22.030 --> 01:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
me anyway but it doesn't have to be tooo
 
01:26:24.149 --> 01:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
late for someone else someone else
 
01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
experienced a Sim similar situation this
 
01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:28.360 align:start position:0%
would help eliminate having to cause
 
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
more trauma than necessary to the
 
01:26:32.470 --> 01:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
innocent parties involved I have lived
 
01:26:34.350 --> 01:26:34.360 align:start position:0%
experience I've endured many things in
 
01:26:36.430 --> 01:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
my life but none compared to the pain of
 
01:26:38.550 --> 01:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
losing three of my children at one time
 
01:26:40.109 --> 01:26:40.119 align:start position:0%
I think it's time we shift the direction
 
01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:42.040 align:start position:0%
this year we claim to provide re
 
01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation in these Correctional
 
01:26:46.750 --> 01:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
Facilities when we know it's not true
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
when will when will we start to
 
01:26:49.310 --> 01:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
listening to the ones who've been
 
01:26:51.910 --> 01:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
through it the ones who know firsthand
 
01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
who who knows better than than one who's
 
01:26:56.590 --> 01:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
been through it someone up there knows
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
better than what knows better what I've
 
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
been through than me support this bill
 
01:27:03.390 --> 01:27:03.400 align:start position:0%
show the people show the people what
 
01:27:05.189 --> 01:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation looks like the Resto the
 
01:27:06.910 --> 01:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
restorative justice looks like what
 
01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
alternative sentencing looks like what
 
01:27:11.550 --> 01:27:11.560 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation not incarceration looks
 
01:27:16.229 --> 01:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:19.030 --> 01:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:27:21.709 --> 01:27:21.719 align:start position:0%
Muse just one quick question and I'm I'm
 
01:27:23.790 --> 01:27:23.800 align:start position:0%
sorry if for for what you've been
 
01:27:26.430 --> 01:27:26.440 align:start position:0%
through um you said something right at
 
01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
the beginning of your testimony that was
 
01:27:30.790 --> 01:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
really interesting um judges have
 
01:27:33.109 --> 01:27:33.119 align:start position:0%
discretion but they also have
 
01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
biases um to what extent do you think a
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
law like this would be helpful
 
01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
in maybe sending a message to judges
 
01:27:46.669 --> 01:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
that they need to consider things like a
 
01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
defendant family situation um and not
 
01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
just uh
 
01:27:56.189 --> 01:27:56.199 align:start position:0%
um I guess not not simply other factors
 
01:27:59.590 --> 01:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
associated with the crime so to what
 
01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
extent do you think this bill would
 
01:28:03.550 --> 01:28:03.560 align:start position:0%
actually be really useful in
 
01:28:06.310 --> 01:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
helping maybe change what you went
 
01:28:08.830 --> 01:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
through for somebody else I would think
 
01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
it would help because if it's passed
 
01:28:13.109 --> 01:28:13.119 align:start position:0%
then the judge would the judge would
 
01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
have to he would have to abide by it
 
01:28:17.590 --> 01:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
because it would be law just like all
 
01:28:18.750 --> 01:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
the other laws so they would have to
 
01:28:20.790 --> 01:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
abide by it wouldn't be a suggestion or
 
01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
a recommendation it would be something
 
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
that's in black and white that has to be
 
01:28:27.149 --> 01:28:27.159 align:start position:0%
followed just like all the other ones
 
01:28:28.430 --> 01:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
that's how I think it would it would
 
01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
help I mean we we we all know that there
 
01:28:33.310 --> 01:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
are plenty of cases that you know go to
 
01:28:35.550 --> 01:28:35.560 align:start position:0%
appeals because all all the things are
 
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
not followed within the courts and
 
01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
that's just the little ones that we
 
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's just the small things that we
 
01:28:42.430 --> 01:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
know of there's so many there there's so
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
many things that like hearing the
 
01:28:46.270 --> 01:28:46.280 align:start position:0%
prosecutor up here talking they love
 
01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:47.800 align:start position:0%
programs they love programs well then
 
01:28:49.109 --> 01:28:49.119 align:start position:0%
how come there aren't any more people in
 
01:28:50.830 --> 01:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
programs how come there's more people in
 
01:28:52.629 --> 01:28:52.639 align:start position:0%
prison than anywhere else if they love
 
01:28:54.669 --> 01:28:54.679 align:start position:0%
programs so much I mean that's just
 
01:28:56.470 --> 01:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
that's all Bs to be honest with you
 
01:28:57.470 --> 01:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
that's what that's what he was up here
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
sitting talking because nothing that he
 
01:29:01.629 --> 01:29:01.639 align:start position:0%
really said was was actually anything
 
01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
based on fact and that whatever that
 
01:29:05.109 --> 01:29:05.119 align:start position:0%
quote was that he said the two choices
 
01:29:07.950 --> 01:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
well we all know by by by the studies
 
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
and by the proof that we've been
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
incarcerating people for how long have
 
01:29:13.870 --> 01:29:13.880 align:start position:0%
we been incarcerating people how long
 
01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
has it made the problem better has the
 
01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
punishments made people behave no
 
01:29:19.070 --> 01:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
because that's not what they need we
 
01:29:20.590 --> 01:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
need to get to the root of the problem
 
01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
we need to find out what's making these
 
01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:24.119 align:start position:0%
people do this why are they doing this
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
what caused them you know what caused
 
01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
them being taken away from their mother
 
01:29:28.590 --> 01:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
at the age of four and 5 years old and
 
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
never seeing their parents again
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
thinking that they were neglected and
 
01:29:32.669 --> 01:29:32.679 align:start position:0%
Abandoned and left and weren't loved
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's what's causing that that's the
 
01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
root of that problem I mean not the only
 
01:29:39.510 --> 01:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
one but that's part of it so we need to
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
we we need to start want punish punish
 
01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:42.920 align:start position:0%
everybody wants to punish until it's
 
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
until it's the other way around until
 
01:29:46.709 --> 01:29:46.719 align:start position:0%
the table is turned then then people get
 
01:29:48.629 --> 01:29:48.639 align:start position:0%
some sense of humanity and empathy and
 
01:29:50.669 --> 01:29:50.679 align:start position:0%
compassion and sympathy for other people
 
01:29:51.709 --> 01:29:51.719 align:start position:0%
because we're not all from the same
 
01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
place we didn't all get the same things
 
01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:55.400 align:start position:0%
growing up and we we didn't all don't
 
01:29:59.109 --> 01:29:59.119 align:start position:0%
all handle the same things the same
 
01:29:59.119 --> 01:30:00.870 align:start position:0%
all handle the same things the same
way

01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:03.390 align:start position:0%
way
followup

01:30:03.390 --> 01:30:03.400 align:start position:0%
followup
 
01:30:06.310 --> 01:30:06.320 align:start position:0%

you see no further questions thank you
 
01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:31.189 align:start position:0%
 
testimony

01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
good morning uh my name is Brian Townsen
 
01:30:35.189 --> 01:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
II I'm a senior Assistant Attorney
 
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
General at the New Hampshire Department
 
01:30:39.030 --> 01:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
of Justice I'm the prosecutor for New
 
01:30:40.950 --> 01:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's elder abuse and financial
 
01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
exploitation unit um the unit is
 
01:30:45.870 --> 01:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
responsible for uh Prosecuting crimes
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
committed against our elder population
 
01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
that's individuals 60 years of age and
 
01:30:52.669 --> 01:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
older uh I'm speaking today in
 
01:30:55.629 --> 01:30:55.639 align:start position:0%
opposition of House Bill uh
 
01:30:58.870 --> 01:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
1039 uh I won't rehash uh what others
 
01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
have said in opposition although I agree
 
01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
with much of
 
01:31:04.629 --> 01:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
it um what I will say is my uh
 
01:31:07.950 --> 01:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
perspective here um in terms of uh a
 
01:31:09.709 --> 01:31:09.719 align:start position:0%
message that wants to be sent surely
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is not mandatory if it passes
 
01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
the court is not mandated to uh provide
 
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
alternative sentencing um but as the
 
01:31:19.629 --> 01:31:19.639 align:start position:0%
members of this committee have said and
 
01:31:22.270 --> 01:31:22.280 align:start position:0%
as the sponsor said this sends a signal
 
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
to judges um asserting a preference a
 
01:31:27.870 --> 01:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
preference for what um this legislature
 
01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
wants to see
 
01:31:32.030 --> 01:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
happen and so in that respect um I would
 
01:31:33.669 --> 01:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
ask the committee to think long and hard
 
01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
about that message because I think they
 
01:31:38.270 --> 01:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
are glaring omissions from House Bill
 
01:31:41.669 --> 01:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
1039 and that is consideration of uh
 
01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
Financial crimes committed against um
 
01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
elderly individuals older adults in this
 
01:31:50.950 --> 01:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
state um representative uh uh uh Balden
 
01:31:54.109 --> 01:31:54.119 align:start position:0%
provided that this focuses on and allows
 
01:31:56.470 --> 01:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
for alternative sentencing of minor
 
01:31:59.310 --> 01:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
crimes I would dispute that um just
 
01:32:02.109 --> 01:32:02.119 align:start position:0%
because a crime is uh non-violent does
 
01:32:05.390 --> 01:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
not mean it is a minor crime I prosecute
 
01:32:06.910 --> 01:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
cases throughout this state and have
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
done so for the last six years involving
 
01:32:13.470 --> 01:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
um the theft by caregivers by
 
01:32:16.629 --> 01:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
fiduciaries from their own dependence um
 
01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
of tens of thousands hundreds of
 
01:32:20.229 --> 01:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
thousands of
 
01:32:23.709 --> 01:32:23.719 align:start position:0%
dollars these have devastating impacts
 
01:32:25.669 --> 01:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
on these individuals who would be
 
01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
considered dependents under this bill um
 
01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
and uh they are victims of these crimes
 
01:32:34.590 --> 01:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
this bill does not contemplate when the
 
01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
dependent is a victim of a financial
 
01:32:40.109 --> 01:32:40.119 align:start position:0%
crime committed by the caregiver and I
 
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
think that is a a glaring Omission um
 
01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
and so in terms of a message that uh
 
01:32:50.590 --> 01:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
would be sent by um passing this law um
 
01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
I I think that is one glaring Omission
 
01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing I will say is that it is
 
01:32:58.910 --> 01:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
in um direct contrast to other
 
01:33:00.910 --> 01:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
sentencing requirements and financial
 
01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
crimes so uh the legislature has passed
 
01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:05.030 align:start position:0%
crimes so uh the legislature has passed
under

01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
6516 uh 1l um an extended term of
 
01:33:12.270 --> 01:33:12.280 align:start position:0%
imprisonment for uh individuals who
 
01:33:14.629 --> 01:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
commit Financial crimes including theft
 
01:33:17.430 --> 01:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
and fraud um against elderly and
 
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
disabled individuals and so uh this
 
01:33:22.350 --> 01:33:22.360 align:start position:0%
would be in contrast to that uh you
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
would be suggesting that there should be
 
01:33:26.350 --> 01:33:26.360 align:start position:0%
alternative sentencing uh or at least
 
01:33:28.470 --> 01:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
allowing for alternative sentencing at
 
01:33:30.669 --> 01:33:30.679 align:start position:0%
the same time that you were saying uh
 
01:33:32.270 --> 01:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
that uh there should be an extended term
 
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
of imprisonment for these individuals so
 
01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
that's really it I'm happy to uh take
 
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
questions um but again I'm not going to
 
01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
sit here and repeat uh what the
 
01:33:43.709 --> 01:33:43.719 align:start position:0%
Coalition said or what attorney Enders
 
01:33:47.790 --> 01:33:47.800 align:start position:0%
said thank you um with regard to that we
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
heard it as well with um as far as
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
potentially returning victims to a home
 
01:33:55.189 --> 01:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
where they were abuser and in this case
 
01:33:57.390 --> 01:33:57.400 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming returning someone back to
 
01:33:59.430 --> 01:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
where they financially abused an
 
01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
elder if the bill
 
01:34:05.350 --> 01:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
hypothetically had a a a trigger
 
01:34:06.750 --> 01:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
mechanism where someone could be
 
01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
stripped of the status or of caregiver
 
01:34:12.430 --> 01:34:12.440 align:start position:0%
in the case if they
 
01:34:14.830 --> 01:34:14.840 align:start position:0%
were if they were to be returned to a
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
victim in other words if if the crime
 
01:34:19.350 --> 01:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
they're there for is victimizing someone
 
01:34:21.709 --> 01:34:21.719 align:start position:0%
who would give them caregiver status
 
01:34:23.430 --> 01:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
would it not possibly be then to say
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
okay you don't qualify for that status
 
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
um I I think that would be helpful I
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
think that would be a start would it fix
 
01:34:30.990 --> 01:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
all the problems with the bill it would
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
not yeah um I think part of the bigger
 
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
concern is carving out um just
 
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
non-violent offenses um you know again U
 
01:34:40.669 --> 01:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
representative Balden provided that this
 
01:34:42.790 --> 01:34:42.800 align:start position:0%

year uh in the State per year um I can
 
01:35:23.709 --> 01:35:23.719 align:start position:0%
just tell you that in terms of financial
 
01:35:26.310 --> 01:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
exploitation referrals uh we get 35 a
 
01:35:29.709 --> 01:35:29.719 align:start position:0%
week um so uh we get upwards of just shy
 
01:35:32.910 --> 01:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
of 2,000 a year uh referrals are all of
 
01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
them um valid uh the county the counties
 
01:35:37.590 --> 01:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
handle um a lot of them but I can tell
 
01:35:39.149 --> 01:35:39.159 align:start position:0%
you just from the referrals that we get
 
01:35:44.550 --> 01:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:47.830 --> 01:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
week representa s thank you and thank
 
01:35:51.070 --> 01:35:51.080 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um the bill
 
01:35:53.109 --> 01:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
provides that the judge may do these
 
01:35:56.590 --> 01:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
things but not shall do these things and
 
01:35:58.910 --> 01:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
would you agree that a well-trained
 
01:36:01.910 --> 01:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
well-educated judge which hopefully
 
01:36:05.070 --> 01:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
would be all of our judges um would take
 
01:36:07.870 --> 01:36:07.880 align:start position:0%
into consideration that putting the
 
01:36:11.070 --> 01:36:11.080 align:start position:0%
perpetrator of a crime back into the
 
01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
home of the person against whom they
 
01:36:14.590 --> 01:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
committed the crime would not be
 
01:36:17.669 --> 01:36:17.679 align:start position:0%
advisable and therefore would not use
 
01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
this as the appropriate uh
 
01:36:22.270 --> 01:36:22.280 align:start position:0%
followup thank you for your question I I
 
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
would hope so um absolutely but I think
 
01:36:27.109 --> 01:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
making an Express uh makes a lot of
 
01:36:29.470 --> 01:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
sense here and in addition um again if
 
01:36:31.830 --> 01:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
you are providing a message or sending
 
01:36:34.270 --> 01:36:34.280 align:start position:0%
an intention uh above and beyond what is
 
01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
already authorized as discretionary by
 
01:36:40.149 --> 01:36:40.159 align:start position:0%
the court um I would I would urge this
 
01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
committee uh to have within it that
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
intent that specifically includes not
 
01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
placing a caregiver back in the same
 
01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:53.040 align:start position:0%

that

01:53:07.109 --> 01:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:08.709 --> 01:53:08.719 align:start position:0%

Bill 1097 and invite the sponsor to
 
01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:25.189 align:start position:0%
 
bill

01:53:25.189 --> 01:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:27.069 --> 01:53:27.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair good morning Mr chair
 
01:53:29.310 --> 01:53:29.320 align:start position:0%
committee members and guests today I'm
 
01:53:31.030 --> 01:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
here sponsoring a bill that allow single
 
01:53:32.430 --> 01:53:32.440 align:start position:0%
party recording of
 
01:53:34.270 --> 01:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
conversations this issue is brought to
 
01:53:36.270 --> 01:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
my attention by a constituent after
 
01:53:37.790 --> 01:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
doing research and doing a deep dive
 
01:53:39.709 --> 01:53:39.719 align:start position:0%
into this issue I see the importance of
 
01:53:40.950 --> 01:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
being here today and presenting this to
 
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
the committee single party recording is
 
01:53:45.589 --> 01:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
the practice of recording a conversation
 
01:53:47.470 --> 01:53:47.480 align:start position:0%
or an interaction without the consent or
 
01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the other
 
01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
party this may sound unethical or
 
01:53:52.830 --> 01:53:52.840 align:start position:0%
illegal but in fact it's perfectly legal
 
01:53:55.109 --> 01:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
in 36
 
01:53:57.310 --> 01:53:57.320 align:start position:0%
States why would anybody want to record
 
01:53:59.109 --> 01:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
a conversation without another person's
 
01:54:02.030 --> 01:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
consent well this may benefit reasons
 
01:54:03.870 --> 01:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
for doing so and I will share them with
 
01:54:06.550 --> 01:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
you today first of all single party
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
recording can provide personal safety
 
01:54:11.790 --> 01:54:11.800 align:start position:0%
and protection against false accusations
 
01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
imagine you're in a situation where you
 
01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
are threatened harassed assaulted by
 
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
someone if you have a recording device
 
01:54:19.790 --> 01:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
with you you can capture the evidence
 
01:54:21.510 --> 01:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
with a crime use it to report to the
 
01:54:23.149 --> 01:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
authorities and defend yourself in a
 
01:54:26.270 --> 01:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
court of law this can also deter the
 
01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
perpetrator from hiring you in the
 
01:54:30.149 --> 01:54:30.159 align:start position:0%
future if they know they can be
 
01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
recorded an example would be in 2019 a
 
01:54:35.149 --> 01:54:35.159 align:start position:0%
woman in New York recorded her boss
 
01:54:37.589 --> 01:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
sexually harassing her at work she used
 
01:54:38.990 --> 01:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
this recording as proof to file a
 
01:54:41.550 --> 01:54:41.560 align:start position:0%
lawsuit against him and the company the
 
01:54:43.750 --> 01:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
recording was also exposed the toxic
 
01:54:45.830 --> 01:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
work environment in the culture that was
 
01:54:47.470 --> 01:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
involved in the company and the
 
01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:48.669 align:start position:0%
involved in the company and the
organization

01:54:48.669 --> 01:54:48.679 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:54:51.550 --> 01:54:51.560 align:start position:0%
itself another benefit of single party
 
01:54:53.229 --> 01:54:53.239 align:start position:0%
recording is that it can help
 
01:54:55.709 --> 01:54:55.719 align:start position:0%
journalists activists expose corruption
 
01:54:58.390 --> 01:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
Injustice abuse and power journalists
 
01:55:00.069 --> 01:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
and activists often face dangers and
 
01:55:01.750 --> 01:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
obstacles when they try to uncover the
 
01:55:04.750 --> 01:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
truth and inform the
 
01:55:07.030 --> 01:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
public they may be denied access
 
01:55:09.629 --> 01:55:09.639 align:start position:0%
intimidated or attacked by those that
 
01:55:12.189 --> 01:55:12.199 align:start position:0%
are trying to silence them by recording
 
01:55:13.709 --> 01:55:13.719 align:start position:0%
these interviews meetings and encounters
 
01:55:15.430 --> 01:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
with the sources and officials they can
 
01:55:17.629 --> 01:55:17.639 align:start position:0%
protect themselves and other sources and
 
01:55:20.750 --> 01:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
also document the facts of their stories
 
01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
an example of this was in a case of Mike
 
01:55:24.629 --> 01:55:24.639 align:start position:0%
Stanton a former investigative reporter
 
01:55:25.990 --> 01:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
of Providence
 
01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
Journal he did a hidden tape uh in an
 
01:55:30.790 --> 01:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
interview that he was doing with the son
 
01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
of a bob
 
01:55:34.750 --> 01:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
Moss uh Stanton's recordings revealed
 
01:55:37.109 --> 01:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
that the Bob the m boss was involved in
 
01:55:39.750 --> 01:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
racketeering extortion murder and he had
 
01:55:41.229 --> 01:55:41.239 align:start position:0%
connections to corrupt politicians and
 
01:55:43.470 --> 01:55:43.480 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officials Stanton's
 
01:55:45.069 --> 01:55:45.079 align:start position:0%
articles led to federal indictments and
 
01:55:47.310 --> 01:55:47.320 align:start position:0%
several of his associates helped to
 
01:55:49.109 --> 01:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
influence this and the state of Rhode
 
01:55:49.119 --> 01:55:50.790 align:start position:0%
influence this and the state of Rhode
Island

01:55:50.790 --> 01:55:50.800 align:start position:0%
Island
 
01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
another benefit of single partnering
 
01:55:53.790 --> 01:55:53.800 align:start position:0%
coord is this can enhance the technology
 
01:55:55.790 --> 01:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
landscape and enable Innovation and
 
01:55:57.589 --> 01:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
creativity with the advancement of
 
01:55:59.910 --> 01:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
Technology of recording devices have
 
01:56:02.510 --> 01:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
become more affordable and versatile for
 
01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
people to use you can record on your
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
smartphone your Smartwatch your laptop
 
01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
Etc you can also use various apps to
 
01:56:12.990 --> 01:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
record conversations this opens up new
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
possibilities for personal and
 
01:56:16.750 --> 01:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
professional protections for the
 
01:56:18.669 --> 01:56:18.679 align:start position:0%
individual finally single party
 
01:56:20.109 --> 01:56:20.119 align:start position:0%
recording can promote transparency
 
01:56:22.149 --> 01:56:22.159 align:start position:0%
accountability and Society by recording
 
01:56:23.629 --> 01:56:23.639 align:start position:0%
your interactions with others you can
 
01:56:25.589 --> 01:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
ensure that you and the other party are
 
01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
honest respectful and
 
01:56:29.149 --> 01:56:29.159 align:start position:0%
responsible you can also avoid
 
01:56:31.030 --> 01:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings conflicts or disputes
 
01:56:33.870 --> 01:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
that may arise from miscommunication or
 
01:56:35.709 --> 01:56:35.719 align:start position:0%
misinterpretation you can also use your
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
recordings to support claims arguments
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
opinions to challenge and verify the
 
01:56:42.629 --> 01:56:42.639 align:start position:0%
claims arguments and opinions of others
 
01:56:44.629 --> 01:56:44.639 align:start position:0%
for example you can record transactions
 
01:56:47.350 --> 01:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
with businesses when contracts are
 
01:56:49.510 --> 01:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
written when warranties are agreed to
 
01:56:51.950 --> 01:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
and any other issues that would evolve
 
01:56:54.350 --> 01:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
around that um you can also record
 
01:56:55.790 --> 01:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
conversations with public officials such
 
01:56:57.390 --> 01:56:57.400 align:start position:0%
as politicians bureaucrats law
 
01:56:59.830 --> 01:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement and Ed these recordings to
 
01:57:02.030 --> 01:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
hold them accountable to their word and
 
01:57:04.430 --> 01:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
their promises as you can see single
 
01:57:06.109 --> 01:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
party recording has many benefits and
 
01:57:08.709 --> 01:57:08.719 align:start position:0%
advantages for individuals in society it
 
01:57:11.149 --> 01:57:11.159 align:start position:0%
is allowed in 36 States
 
01:57:14.069 --> 01:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
currently it can provide personal safety
 
01:57:16.390 --> 01:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
protection and empowerment and it can

allow journalists and activists to
 
01:57:20.069 --> 01:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
expose truth in the public enhance
 
01:57:22.270 --> 01:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
technological landscape and promote
 
01:57:23.950 --> 01:57:23.960 align:start position:0%
transparency and
 
01:57:25.709 --> 01:57:25.719 align:start position:0%
accountability thank you for your time
 
01:57:27.069 --> 01:57:27.079 align:start position:0%
this morning if any has any questions i'
 
01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:34.270 --> 01:57:34.280 align:start position:0%
him represent s do you have any con
 
01:57:35.550 --> 01:57:35.560 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:57:36.910 --> 01:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
question do you have any concern about
 
01:57:38.950 --> 01:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
the potential unintended consequences
 
01:57:41.270 --> 01:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
like someone using single party
 
01:57:43.470 --> 01:57:43.480 align:start position:0%
recordings for the purposes of malicious
 
01:57:45.550 --> 01:57:45.560 align:start position:0%
intent to harm the other
 
01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
party thank you for your question um it
 
01:57:50.069 --> 01:57:50.079 align:start position:0%
is allowed currently on 30 states it is
 
01:57:52.470 --> 01:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
working so I would say there's always
 
01:57:54.550 --> 01:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
potential for that but I would think the
 
01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:57.510 align:start position:0%
potential for that but I would think the
advantages

01:57:57.510 --> 01:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:00.310 --> 01:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
outweigh um
 
01:58:02.830 --> 01:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
representative the um unlike the other
 
01:58:04.550 --> 01:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
36 States we just passed a
 
01:58:05.910 --> 01:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment in New
 
01:58:09.030 --> 01:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire whereby the citizens of New
 
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Express their interest in
 
01:58:13.870 --> 01:58:13.880 align:start position:0%
privacy um how do you think you're your
 
01:58:17.830 --> 01:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
bill squares with that recent
 
01:58:19.750 --> 01:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
amendment I would I would think that if
 
01:58:20.950 --> 01:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
you're an honest person it wouldn't
 
01:58:22.510 --> 01:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
affect it at all if you're not afraid of
 
01:58:24.030 --> 01:58:24.040 align:start position:0%
what you say if you keep to your word
 
01:58:26.629 --> 01:58:26.639 align:start position:0%
then it wouldn't affect it at all thank
 
01:58:31.229 --> 01:58:31.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:33.669 --> 01:58:33.679 align:start position:0%
questions okay all right thank you thank
 
01:58:36.109 --> 01:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony appreciate
 
01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
it um the chair recognized Mr Binet from
 
01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:47.950 align:start position:0%
it um the chair recognized Mr Binet from
the

01:58:47.950 --> 01:58:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:50.709 --> 01:58:50.719 align:start position:0%
ACLU thank you Mr chairman Gil Binet on
 
01:58:53.189 --> 01:58:53.199 align:start position:0%
behalf of uh the ACLU of New Hampshire
 
01:58:54.390 --> 01:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
I'm the legal director there I do have
 
01:58:55.990 --> 01:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
written testimony though I do I am going
 
01:58:58.069 --> 01:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
to um make some adjustments to it and
 
01:58:59.550 --> 01:58:59.560 align:start position:0%
send it to the committee probably later
 
01:59:02.350 --> 01:59:02.360 align:start position:0%
today or Monday um just to reflect uh
 
01:59:03.669 --> 01:59:03.679 align:start position:0%
some of the comments that have been made
 
01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
by the uh the sponsor and the intent
 
01:59:07.430 --> 01:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
behind the sponsor but I this is a bill
 
01:59:10.189 --> 01:59:10.199 align:start position:0%
that we do oppose uh we oppose on on
 
01:59:12.270 --> 01:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
privacy grounds listen we think it it's
 
01:59:14.310 --> 01:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
important to maintain semblance of
 
01:59:16.189 --> 01:59:16.199 align:start position:0%
privacy particularly where there are
 
01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable expectations of privacy in
 
01:59:21.030 --> 01:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
own homes hotel rooms Etc and so I think
 
01:59:22.990 --> 01:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
that's a vitally important protection
 
01:59:25.750 --> 01:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
that we have not only uh in our current
 
01:59:27.910 --> 01:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
wiretapping statute but as the chairman
 
01:59:29.470 --> 01:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned U you know we have
 
01:59:30.870 --> 01:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional protections now with
 
01:59:32.550 --> 01:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
respect to informational privacy so I
 
01:59:34.069 --> 01:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
think this is really like a a strong New
 
01:59:36.510 --> 01:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire value it is true that New
 
01:59:38.069 --> 01:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is in the minority of states
 
01:59:39.790 --> 01:59:39.800 align:start position:0%
that require two-party consent but I
 
01:59:41.189 --> 01:59:41.199 align:start position:0%
think it is in the minority of States
 
01:59:44.950 --> 01:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
because it reflects that unique um U
 
01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
privacy policy importance that we all
 
01:59:50.030 --> 01:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
have as a state um so and the ACL shares
 
01:59:52.470 --> 01:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
that view and supports that view uh with
 
01:59:54.870 --> 01:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
with respect to privacy and thinks uh to
 
01:59:56.830 --> 01:59:56.840 align:start position:0%
that extent our wiretapping statute
 
01:59:59.310 --> 01:59:59.320 align:start position:0%
should not change um I do want to get in
 
02:00:01.669 --> 02:00:01.679 align:start position:0%
just the text of the bill very briefly
 
02:00:03.270 --> 02:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know I had a spirited discussion
 
02:00:04.510 --> 02:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
with the Attorney General's office and
 
02:00:06.069 --> 02:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
back I think there we we I think we're
 
02:00:07.709 --> 02:00:07.719 align:start position:0%
both kind of confused about some of the
 
02:00:11.550 --> 02:00:11.560 align:start position:0%
text of the bill um I myself included um
 
02:00:13.669 --> 02:00:13.679 align:start position:0%
when you look at just the language I
 
02:00:15.189 --> 02:00:15.199 align:start position:0%
know that it seems like the intent
 
02:00:17.830 --> 02:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
behind the bill is to kind of have one
 
02:00:21.030 --> 02:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
party consent throughout um uh but it it
 
02:00:22.750 --> 02:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
there there is reasonable expectation of
 
02:00:25.390 --> 02:00:25.400 align:start position:0%
privacy language in here baked into the
 
02:00:27.390 --> 02:00:27.400 align:start position:0%
statute so it seems like it's still
 
02:00:31.229 --> 02:00:31.239 align:start position:0%
would be a crime if there's one party
 
02:00:34.709 --> 02:00:34.719 align:start position:0%
consent where the person being recorded
 
02:00:36.470 --> 02:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
had an expectation a reasonable
 
02:00:39.669 --> 02:00:39.679 align:start position:0%
expectation of Prophecy that's how I I
 
02:00:41.430 --> 02:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh read it and I actually want to be
 
02:00:42.470 --> 02:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
clear that I think that's actually
 
02:00:44.189 --> 02:00:44.199 align:start position:0%
already in the law so it is true that
 
02:00:46.470 --> 02:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
we're a two-party consent state but
 
02:00:48.470 --> 02:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
there is an exception to two-party
 
02:00:50.350 --> 02:00:50.360 align:start position:0%
consent um and that's when the person
 
02:00:52.550 --> 02:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
being recorded does not have a
 
02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable expectation of privacy and I
 
02:00:55.870 --> 02:00:55.880 align:start position:0%
give you like a really good example of
 
02:00:57.430 --> 02:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
that and it came up in a case about 10
 
02:01:00.229 --> 02:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
years ago it was an individual recording
 
02:01:03.069 --> 02:01:03.079 align:start position:0%
um a police officer in wear as that
 
02:01:05.910 --> 02:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
officer was performing his duties out in
 
02:01:07.510 --> 02:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
public and of course the officer had not
 
02:01:10.069 --> 02:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
consented to that um but the court
 
02:01:11.629 --> 02:01:11.639 align:start position:0%
concluded the district court concluded
 
02:01:13.229 --> 02:01:13.239 align:start position:0%
there that that that doesn't violate the
 
02:01:15.069 --> 02:01:15.079 align:start position:0%
wir tab statute because when you look at
 
02:01:16.910 --> 02:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
section one of the wir tab statute which
 
02:01:20.229 --> 02:01:20.239 align:start position:0%
defines oral communication um this uh
 
02:01:22.149 --> 02:01:22.159 align:start position:0%
you know there is kind of you there is
 
02:01:24.109 --> 02:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
language that says an oral communication
 
02:01:26.550 --> 02:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
that's covered under the statute is one
 
02:01:29.629 --> 02:01:29.639 align:start position:0%
where um there's a reasonable
 
02:01:31.189 --> 02:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
expectation that the communication is
 
02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
not subject to interception under
 
02:01:35.350 --> 02:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances justifying the exception I
 
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
think that's legal Leed to say
 
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
reasonable expectation of privacy so um
 
02:01:41.550 --> 02:01:41.560 align:start position:0%
I I want to be very clear that we
 
02:01:44.189 --> 02:01:44.199 align:start position:0%
already have baked into the statute
 
02:01:46.189 --> 02:01:46.199 align:start position:0%
protections that allow for recording
 
02:01:47.669 --> 02:01:47.679 align:start position:0%
where we want government accountability
 
02:01:49.350 --> 02:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
right where we want to be able to record
 
02:01:50.510 --> 02:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
public officials where they're
 
02:01:51.990 --> 02:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
performing their work in public where
 
02:01:53.709 --> 02:01:53.719 align:start position:0%
there's no reasonable expectation of
 
02:01:56.310 --> 02:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
privacy there isn't a need there for
 
02:01:57.910 --> 02:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
two-party consent so I think in New
 
02:01:59.149 --> 02:01:59.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire actually though we are in the
 
02:02:01.470 --> 02:02:01.480 align:start position:0%
minority of States our current law does
 
02:02:03.830 --> 02:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
a very good job of balancing privacy
 
02:02:05.470 --> 02:02:05.480 align:start position:0%
rights but also with the need to in
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances record um when
 
02:02:09.430 --> 02:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
there's no expectation of privacy
 
02:02:12.350 --> 02:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
including government officials so um I
 
02:02:14.950 --> 02:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
think for those reasons um you know we
 
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
don't support the bill it either already
 
02:02:20.030 --> 02:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
does what the sponsors want or or it
 
02:02:21.910 --> 02:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
goes even further depending how you read
 
02:02:25.229 --> 02:02:25.239 align:start position:0%
it to ban outright um or or to mandate
 
02:02:27.189 --> 02:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
in all circumstances one party consent
 
02:02:28.669 --> 02:02:28.679 align:start position:0%
which we would have serious concerns
 
02:02:31.709 --> 02:02:31.719 align:start position:0%
with thank you any
 
02:02:33.990 --> 02:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:02:37.030 --> 02:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
scitec Mr Vette what about my privacy
 
02:02:39.270 --> 02:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
right why can't I have something the
 
02:02:41.189 --> 02:02:41.199 align:start position:0%
size of a pack of cigarettes in my shirt
 
02:02:43.750 --> 02:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
pocket to record my day for whatever
 
02:02:47.109 --> 02:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
purpose I want yeah I mean I think that
 
02:02:48.589 --> 02:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
that would be a good argument if that
 
02:02:50.229 --> 02:02:50.239 align:start position:0%
went wasn't also impacting other
 
02:02:52.270 --> 02:02:52.280 align:start position:0%
individuals rights right and I think it
 
02:02:54.750 --> 02:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
would if that individual being recorded
 
02:02:58.470 --> 02:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
has no understanding or no um uh has an
 
02:03:01.189 --> 02:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy um I think that
 
02:03:03.069 --> 02:03:03.079 align:start position:0%
person's rights would be impacted by it
 
02:03:04.669 --> 02:03:04.679 align:start position:0%
and I think what current law is trying
 
02:03:06.790 --> 02:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
to do are balancing balance those two
 
02:03:08.589 --> 02:03:08.599 align:start position:0%
things if that person that you're
 
02:03:10.750 --> 02:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
recording as you're going about your day
 
02:03:12.589 --> 02:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't have an expectation of privacy
 
02:03:13.990 --> 02:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
maybe depending on where you are you
 
02:03:15.950 --> 02:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
could be out in a in a public place
 
02:03:18.229 --> 02:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
where other people could hear you um the
 
02:03:20.229 --> 02:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
wiretap stat statute wouldn't apply um
 
02:03:22.109 --> 02:03:22.119 align:start position:0%
so I think it really depends on the
 
02:03:24.310 --> 02:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
circumstance uh because that the
 
02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:28.390 align:start position:0%
circumstance uh because that the
circumstances

02:03:28.390 --> 02:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
matter no further questions thank you
 
02:03:32.510 --> 02:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the uh the accommodation
 
02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:44.629 --> 02:03:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:46.430 --> 02:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
bolinski good
 
02:03:48.870 --> 02:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
morning um just to be up front for
 
02:03:50.629 --> 02:03:50.639 align:start position:0%
because that's how I am I'm actually the
 
02:03:52.189 --> 02:03:52.199 align:start position:0%
one that asked Ron D to bring this
 
02:03:54.350 --> 02:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
forward I'm the
 
02:03:57.149 --> 02:03:57.159 align:start position:0%
constituent the reason I wanted bring
 
02:03:58.790 --> 02:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
this forward
 
02:04:01.270 --> 02:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
and you can put amendments in it if you
 
02:04:03.390 --> 02:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
want to narrow it down a little more is
 
02:04:05.069 --> 02:04:05.079 align:start position:0%
I've been involved with town lary for a
 
02:04:06.549 --> 02:04:06.559 align:start position:0%
long time I liveed there I've been there
 
02:04:08.750 --> 02:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
38 years been in New Hampshire going on
 
02:04:11.470 --> 02:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
55 I'm 63 years
 
02:04:14.430 --> 02:04:14.440 align:start position:0%
old and I've had many conversations with
 
02:04:16.430 --> 02:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
for with Town managers former Town
 
02:04:18.549 --> 02:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
managers over what's going on in the
 
02:04:20.990 --> 02:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
town stuff that affects the people of
 
02:04:23.549 --> 02:04:23.559 align:start position:0%
the town I was also the town treasurer
 
02:04:27.149 --> 02:04:27.159 align:start position:0%
for three years back in the early
 
02:04:30.310 --> 02:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
2000s and what they'll tell you in
 
02:04:32.790 --> 02:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
private is totally different than what
 
02:04:36.709 --> 02:04:36.719 align:start position:0%
they'll admit to at a public council
 
02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
meeting and that's an issue it's you
 
02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
know there's money issues involved
 
02:04:44.470 --> 02:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
there's just a lot of issues where
 
02:04:45.750 --> 02:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
they'll deny they even had the
 
02:04:48.390 --> 02:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
conversation with you I've followed the
 
02:04:51.669 --> 02:04:51.679 align:start position:0%
law not recorded those if you say a
 
02:04:53.310 --> 02:04:53.320 align:start position:0%
couple times I said I want to record
 
02:04:55.709 --> 02:04:55.719 align:start position:0%
this and like well we're not having this
 
02:04:58.589 --> 02:04:58.599 align:start position:0%
conversation if it was narrowed down to
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
elected public officials or dealing with
 
02:05:03.549 --> 02:05:03.559 align:start position:0%
a company I recently had an instance
 
02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
before this um after this was put in I
 
02:05:08.030 --> 02:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
had to have a refrigerator repair done
 
02:05:09.629 --> 02:05:09.639 align:start position:0%
on my refrigerator they come in they
 
02:05:12.910 --> 02:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
diagnosed it $1,300 it didn't fix it
 
02:05:14.430 --> 02:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
they did the same thing over again
 
02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
didn't fix it they finally said we don't
 
02:05:18.030 --> 02:05:18.040 align:start position:0%
want to do this anymore we're going to
 
02:05:19.950 --> 02:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
give you your money
 
02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
back now they're saying they're not
 
02:05:22.950 --> 02:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
going to do anything they haven't given
 
02:05:24.189 --> 02:05:24.199 align:start position:0%
your money back I could have recorded
 
02:05:25.589 --> 02:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
that this we didn't say that yeah you
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
did my wife heard it I heard it that's
 
02:05:30.109 --> 02:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
the type stuff I'm looking at I
 
02:05:32.750 --> 02:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
understand the Privacy within your
 
02:05:35.589 --> 02:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
home but you know the good can outweigh
 
02:05:39.589 --> 02:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
the bad on this in my opinion 35 States
 
02:05:42.229 --> 02:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
plus the District of Columbia don't have
 
02:05:44.709 --> 02:05:44.719 align:start position:0%
a problem with the worlds haven't ended
 
02:05:47.189 --> 02:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh you can go to just there's
 
02:05:50.270 --> 02:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
a they have the uh requirements within
 
02:05:52.310 --> 02:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
those States you know maybe it's
 
02:05:53.870 --> 02:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
something to look at and we have to
 
02:05:55.990 --> 02:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
implement some of their requirements May
 
02:05:58.109 --> 02:05:58.119 align:start position:0%
some may be good some may be bad
 
02:06:00.030 --> 02:06:00.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere people have to be accountable
 
02:06:02.870 --> 02:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
for not telling the truth that's my
 
02:06:05.310 --> 02:06:05.320 align:start position:0%
whole thing about this is could it hurt
 
02:06:07.310 --> 02:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
in some ways yeah I guess it
 
02:06:09.950 --> 02:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
could but does the good outweigh the bad
 
02:06:12.510 --> 02:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
I think it can I don't think you'll
 
02:06:14.549 --> 02:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
actually have to end up recording a lot
 
02:06:16.109 --> 02:06:16.119 align:start position:0%
of times because just the fact that
 
02:06:19.149 --> 02:06:19.159 align:start position:0%
people know you can now do it they may
 
02:06:20.669 --> 02:06:20.679 align:start position:0%
say I better tell the truth or they just
 
02:06:23.030 --> 02:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
won't have the conversation with you at
 
02:06:25.750 --> 02:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
all you have to look what goes on in our
 
02:06:29.750 --> 02:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
town it happens all the time and every
 
02:06:31.430 --> 02:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
time I try to bring it up in public so
 
02:06:33.870 --> 02:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
the public knows oh we never had that
 
02:06:35.549 --> 02:06:35.559 align:start position:0%
conversation what are you talking you
 
02:06:38.310 --> 02:06:38.320 align:start position:0%
weren't in my office this is the type
 
02:06:41.109 --> 02:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
stuff I'm trying to avoid
 
02:06:44.669 --> 02:06:44.679 align:start position:0%
so yeah people may not like it but if
 
02:06:46.310 --> 02:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
you don't lie and you tell the truth
 
02:06:48.350 --> 02:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be an issue I always
 
02:06:51.470 --> 02:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
tell tell the truth at least I believe
 
02:06:53.189 --> 02:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
I'm always telling the truth maybe you
 
02:06:55.950 --> 02:06:55.960 align:start position:0%
know I'm misinformed on something I
 
02:06:57.270 --> 02:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say anything here I wouldn't
 
02:07:00.229 --> 02:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
say in public or in a council meeting
 
02:07:01.870 --> 02:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
I've been thrown out of Council meetings
 
02:07:04.910 --> 02:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
for telling the truth and then they look
 
02:07:06.990 --> 02:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
at the law that I gave them counselor
 
02:07:10.069 --> 02:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
dun can testify to that and they say oh
 
02:07:12.589 --> 02:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
yeah he was right where does it startop
 
02:07:14.790 --> 02:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
where do they where and I know you're
 
02:07:16.510 --> 02:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
elected officials and I'm sorry to put
 
02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
it this
 
02:07:21.790 --> 02:07:21.800 align:start position:0%
way when do we get our rights protected
 
02:07:24.589 --> 02:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
from people who are put to represent us
 
02:07:27.030 --> 02:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
we not telling the truth they say one
 
02:07:30.069 --> 02:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
thing behind closed doors and then in
 
02:07:33.030 --> 02:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
public they say nope never happened I
 
02:07:34.950 --> 02:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
think just the I don't want to use the
 
02:07:36.229 --> 02:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
word threat just the idea that they
 
02:07:39.870 --> 02:07:39.880 align:start position:0%
could be recorded maybe that will stop
 
02:07:41.750 --> 02:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
you know maybe the committee takes a you
 
02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
know I can leave this one copy and it's
 
02:07:47.750 --> 02:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
online and has all the states that are
 
02:07:50.390 --> 02:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
and for and you know how they go about
 
02:07:54.830 --> 02:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
it um do you need to change the wording
 
02:07:58.310 --> 02:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
as the ASL yeah probably I I can agree
 
02:08:00.030 --> 02:08:00.040 align:start position:0%
with that I don't care how it's worded
 
02:08:03.189 --> 02:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
that's up to you people you have to give
 
02:08:06.310 --> 02:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
the common citizen some more
 
02:08:08.430 --> 02:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
protection in certain stuff if you want
 
02:08:09.830 --> 02:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
to say you can't do it in somebody's
 
02:08:12.189 --> 02:08:12.199 align:start position:0%
home that's fine I'm fine with that but
 
02:08:13.629 --> 02:08:13.639 align:start position:0%
if it's a company that you're deal in
 
02:08:15.790 --> 02:08:15.800 align:start position:0%
business with and they're lying to you
 
02:08:18.149 --> 02:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
or an official we should be protected
 
02:08:19.990 --> 02:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
Maybe we put some restrictions in it as
 
02:08:21.669 --> 02:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
to what you can use it
 
02:08:24.109 --> 02:08:24.119 align:start position:0%
for you know he says there some built in
 
02:08:26.229 --> 02:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
there already you know the reasonable
 
02:08:27.910 --> 02:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
you know you know what he was talking
 
02:08:30.709 --> 02:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
about you know does the average citizen
 
02:08:32.229 --> 02:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
going to take that to court on their
 
02:08:34.629 --> 02:08:34.639 align:start position:0%
dime where if it could just be recorded
 
02:08:35.790 --> 02:08:35.800 align:start position:0%
they don't have to take somebody to
 
02:08:37.990 --> 02:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
court that's what these towns depend on
 
02:08:39.390 --> 02:08:39.400 align:start position:0%
there's been many times I've brought
 
02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
stuff up in the Town Council or the town
 
02:08:44.189 --> 02:08:44.199 align:start position:0%
manager will say well then take us to
 
02:08:46.390 --> 02:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
court yeah that's easy for you to say
 
02:08:49.549 --> 02:08:49.559 align:start position:0%
you're using the taxpayers money
 
02:08:51.750 --> 02:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
they just did it to the publisher of the
 
02:08:54.750 --> 02:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
linary times and they lost it cost the
 
02:08:57.229 --> 02:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
town 15,000 it was so outrageous the
 
02:08:59.950 --> 02:08:59.960 align:start position:0%
judge made them pay her her fees
 
02:09:02.390 --> 02:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
too this has to stop that's what they do
 
02:09:03.750 --> 02:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
they count on you not having the money
 
02:09:05.470 --> 02:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
to take them to court when they could
 
02:09:07.910 --> 02:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
just answer the questions I mean I could
 
02:09:09.149 --> 02:09:09.159 align:start position:0%
go through a lot of examples when
 
02:09:10.510 --> 02:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
they're talk about you know we don't
 
02:09:11.589 --> 02:09:11.599 align:start position:0%
have the you don't have the time for
 
02:09:14.470 --> 02:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
that so that's why I brought it forward
 
02:09:17.149 --> 02:09:17.159 align:start position:0%
if it needs to be amended adjusted the
 
02:09:19.030 --> 02:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with that
 
02:09:20.549 --> 02:09:20.559 align:start position:0%
but there has to be some protection for
 
02:09:22.310 --> 02:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
people for the average citizen that's
 
02:09:26.030 --> 02:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
why you're elected 70.5% of the states
 
02:09:27.790 --> 02:09:27.800 align:start position:0%
includ and the District of Columbia
 
02:09:29.149 --> 02:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
that's how you get the
 
02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
36 that's a
 
02:09:33.629 --> 02:09:33.639 align:start position:0%
70.5% approval if you guys won your
 
02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
elections by 70.5% you'd be thrilled you
 
02:09:41.030 --> 02:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
know so that's all I have to say on it
 
02:09:42.549 --> 02:09:42.559 align:start position:0%
could you uh give that document to the
 
02:09:43.910 --> 02:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative on the end please I'd
 
02:09:47.310 --> 02:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate it any questions for the
 
02:09:49.310 --> 02:09:49.320 align:start position:0%

02:10:07.629 --> 02:10:07.639 align:start position:0%
Enders good morning Stephen ERS I'm an
 
02:10:09.229 --> 02:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
assistant County attorney with the marac
 
02:10:11.750 --> 02:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
county attorney's office I I don't know
 
02:10:14.310 --> 02:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
if I support this or oppose it
 
02:10:18.310 --> 02:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
um I I do think that the WAP statute is
 
02:10:20.990 --> 02:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
is a statute that's sort of ripe for for
 
02:10:26.030 --> 02:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment and where we see this in in my
 
02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:27.870 align:start position:0%
Amendment and where we see this in in my
life

02:10:27.870 --> 02:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
life
 
02:10:27.880 --> 02:10:29.510 align:start position:0%
life
is

02:10:29.510 --> 02:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:10:32.830 --> 02:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
it whenever someone is about to start a
 
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
lawsuit or is going to be the victim of
 
02:10:35.790 --> 02:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
a crime or that type of thing we always
 
02:10:38.189 --> 02:10:38.199 align:start position:0%
tell them to document everything and
 
02:10:39.510 --> 02:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
really the best way to document
 
02:10:41.430 --> 02:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
something is to record it and everyone
 
02:10:43.390 --> 02:10:43.400 align:start position:0%
now has a cellphone in their pocket and
 
02:10:45.629 --> 02:10:45.639 align:start position:0%
has the ability to audio and video
 
02:10:48.310 --> 02:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
record what's going on so we'll end up
 
02:10:52.470 --> 02:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
having domestic violence cases where the
 
02:10:54.069 --> 02:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
the victim of domestic violence will
 
02:10:57.709 --> 02:10:57.719 align:start position:0%
record what happened and it leaves no
 
02:10:59.910 --> 02:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
doubt what was said it leaves no doubt
 
02:11:03.549 --> 02:11:03.559 align:start position:0%
what occurred um the difficulty is that
 
02:11:05.149 --> 02:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
if that recording was made
 
02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
surreptitiously or secretly it has the
 
02:11:11.669 --> 02:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
potential to uh run a foul of the
 
02:11:14.189 --> 02:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
current wiretap statute we've certainly
 
02:11:15.750 --> 02:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
had cases where we've had neighbor
 
02:11:19.350 --> 02:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
disputes where the police tell them
 
02:11:21.270 --> 02:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
just film what's going on and that way
 
02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
we'll know exactly what's going on if
 
02:11:25.430 --> 02:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
this ends up in court and certainly we
 
02:11:28.629 --> 02:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
had a neighbor that did exactly that uh
 
02:11:29.830 --> 02:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
filmed himself actually getting
 
02:11:31.950 --> 02:11:31.960 align:start position:0%
assaulted by his neighbor and the court
 
02:11:33.790 --> 02:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
said unfortunately under the wiretap
 
02:11:35.629 --> 02:11:35.639 align:start position:0%
statute I have to keep that out of
 
02:11:37.390 --> 02:11:37.400 align:start position:0%
evidence because that was IL legally
 
02:11:39.870 --> 02:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
obtained um that
 
02:11:42.589 --> 02:11:42.599 align:start position:0%
recording so that's sort of the point of
 
02:11:45.470 --> 02:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
view we come from is it would be nice to
 
02:11:49.069 --> 02:11:49.079 align:start position:0%
allow victims of crime or for people in
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
situations where they're going to end up
 
02:11:52.629 --> 02:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
in court to be able to record what's
 
02:11:54.109 --> 02:11:54.119 align:start position:0%
going on so that we know exactly what
 
02:11:57.229 --> 02:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
was said and exactly what happened um
 
02:12:00.310 --> 02:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
and the difficulty is again the WAP
 
02:12:05.709 --> 02:12:05.719 align:start position:0%
statute sometime is implicated by that I
 
02:12:07.069 --> 02:12:07.079 align:start position:0%
I'm the one that had the conversation
 
02:12:10.270 --> 02:12:10.280 align:start position:0%
with attorney biset um during the break
 
02:12:12.870 --> 02:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
and we're not really sure what the the
 
02:12:15.470 --> 02:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
consequences of this statute would be as
 
02:12:19.430 --> 02:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
I read it um paragraph one is the
 
02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
current state of the law um the current
 
02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
law doesn't use the term expectation of
 
02:12:28.350 --> 02:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
privacy it uses the term uh having a
 
02:12:29.750 --> 02:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable expectation that the
 
02:12:31.669 --> 02:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
conversation is not subject to
 
02:12:34.350 --> 02:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
interception I would recommend that the
 
02:12:36.069 --> 02:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
language mirror what's currently in the
 
02:12:37.830 --> 02:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
statute because I think expectation of
 
02:12:40.069 --> 02:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
privacy could be different than an
 
02:12:41.350 --> 02:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
expectation that something is not
 
02:12:42.470 --> 02:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
subject to
 
02:12:46.549 --> 02:12:46.559 align:start position:0%
interception um paragraph 1 a and
 
02:12:48.910 --> 02:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph 1 the only only difference I
 
02:12:51.510 --> 02:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
see between them is the mental state
 
02:12:53.950 --> 02:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
where it would be a felony if you
 
02:12:56.549 --> 02:12:56.559 align:start position:0%
willfully intercepted and a misdemeanor
 
02:12:58.750 --> 02:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
if you knowingly
 
02:13:02.629 --> 02:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
intercepted um I don't know how you
 
02:13:04.910 --> 02:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
would knowingly intercept something
 
02:13:07.470 --> 02:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
without willfully intercepting it so I
 
02:13:09.709 --> 02:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
think you'd almost always end up in that
 
02:13:12.350 --> 02:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
that paragraph one felony and then
 
02:13:15.950 --> 02:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
paragraph 1B as as I interpret that
 
02:13:18.350 --> 02:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
paragraph and attorney biset I may
 
02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
disagree on this if one party is aware
 
02:13:26.109 --> 02:13:26.119 align:start position:0%
that the recording is being made then it
 
02:13:29.189 --> 02:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
is not illegal to make the recording so
 
02:13:31.629 --> 02:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
as long as one person there knows it's
 
02:13:33.830 --> 02:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
being recorded then it wouldn't be
 
02:13:37.830 --> 02:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
illegal that would certainly solve those
 
02:13:39.990 --> 02:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
domestic violence victim problems would
 
02:13:42.149 --> 02:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
solve the the neighborhood dispute
 
02:13:45.149 --> 02:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
problems but as you heard there's
 
02:13:47.270 --> 02:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
certainly unintended consequences with
 
02:13:48.750 --> 02:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
that regarding
 
02:13:51.870 --> 02:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
uh people's personal privacy so happy to
 
02:13:54.350 --> 02:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
02:13:56.950 --> 02:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
questions what how does the the current
 
02:13:59.149 --> 02:13:59.159 align:start position:0%
state of law impact things like the the
 
02:14:01.750 --> 02:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
ring video doorbell that that records
 
02:14:03.990 --> 02:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
people and without their permission
 
02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:05.069 align:start position:0%
people and without their permission
ostensively

02:14:05.069 --> 02:14:05.079 align:start position:0%
ostensively
 
02:14:09.510 --> 02:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
so again the the definition of um oral
 
02:14:11.229 --> 02:14:11.239 align:start position:0%
communication in the current statute
 
02:14:12.870 --> 02:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
indicates that it's a
 
02:14:15.149 --> 02:14:15.159 align:start position:0%
communication that you have a reasonable
 
02:14:16.750 --> 02:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
expectation it's not subject to
 
02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
interception under circumstances
 
02:14:21.189 --> 02:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
justifying that
 
02:14:26.510 --> 02:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
exception I would say in today's world
 
02:14:28.990 --> 02:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
you're being intercepted almost
 
02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
constantly I know that I have an iPhone
 
02:14:34.870 --> 02:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
if I yell out hey Siri I think
 
02:14:36.990 --> 02:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
everyone's iPhone beeps because my
 
02:14:39.510 --> 02:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
iPhone is constantly intercepting what
 
02:14:41.910 --> 02:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
I'm saying waiting to be sort of woken
 
02:14:41.920 --> 02:14:43.910 align:start position:0%
I'm saying waiting to be sort of woken
up

02:14:43.910 --> 02:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:14:46.390 --> 02:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
um it's my position that if you're
 
02:14:48.830 --> 02:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
standing on someone's front porch
 
02:14:50.430 --> 02:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
you don't have an expectation that
 
02:14:52.109 --> 02:14:52.119 align:start position:0%
you're not being subject to intercept
 
02:14:55.069 --> 02:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
there because there's ring cameras
 
02:14:57.069 --> 02:14:57.079 align:start position:0%
everywhere um you could certainly make
 
02:14:59.390 --> 02:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
the argument that I had no idea standing
 
02:15:00.790 --> 02:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
on someone's porch I was being
 
02:15:02.470 --> 02:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
intercepted but I don't know that that
 
02:15:06.030 --> 02:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
would necessarily fly in in today's
 
02:15:09.310 --> 02:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
society thank you further questions
 
02:15:09.320 --> 02:15:10.430 align:start position:0%
society thank you further questions
representative

02:15:10.430 --> 02:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:15:14.430 --> 02:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
scitech does interception mean recording
 
02:15:17.109 --> 02:15:17.119 align:start position:0%
no what does interception meanc
 
02:15:17.119 --> 02:15:19.189 align:start position:0%
no what does interception meanc
interception

02:15:19.189 --> 02:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
interception
 
02:15:22.510 --> 02:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
means the oral or other acquisition of
 
02:15:24.950 --> 02:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
or the recording of the contents of any
 
02:15:27.629 --> 02:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
telecommunication or oral communication
 
02:15:29.549 --> 02:15:29.559 align:start position:0%
through the use of any electronic
 
02:15:31.390 --> 02:15:31.400 align:start position:0%
mechanical or other
 
02:15:34.510 --> 02:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
device so as I read that
 
02:15:39.149 --> 02:15:39.159 align:start position:0%
definition my phone the oral
 
02:15:41.830 --> 02:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
interception my phone is constantly
 
02:15:44.109 --> 02:15:44.119 align:start position:0%
listening to what I'm saying waiting for
 
02:15:46.709 --> 02:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
me to say certain keywords to sort of
 
02:15:48.310 --> 02:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
wake it up
 
02:15:50.069 --> 02:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
so I think my phone even though it's not
 
02:15:51.950 --> 02:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
recording everything I'm saying is
 
02:15:53.790 --> 02:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
intercepting everything I'm
 
02:15:56.669 --> 02:15:56.679 align:start position:0%
saying so while interception includes
 
02:16:01.430 --> 02:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:04.109 --> 02:16:04.119 align:start position:0%
recording so interception is broader
 
02:16:07.229 --> 02:16:07.239 align:start position:0%
than recording absolutely uh I once
 
02:16:09.990 --> 02:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
heard this said is this true that I
 
02:16:12.750 --> 02:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
could have a secret camera watching as
 
02:16:16.229 --> 02:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
long as it's not recording audio under
 
02:16:18.790 --> 02:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
is that true under the WAP statute that
 
02:16:21.109 --> 02:16:21.119 align:start position:0%
would be accurate the WAP statute only
 
02:16:24.510 --> 02:16:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:27.629 --> 02:16:27.639 align:start position:0%
video rep Stone thank you and thank you
 
02:16:29.709 --> 02:16:29.719 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh when I look at
 
02:16:31.990 --> 02:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
this statute it reminds me of an older
 
02:16:34.030 --> 02:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
time when there was the business of
 
02:16:36.309 --> 02:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
doing one party consents to get wire
 
02:16:40.190 --> 02:16:40.200 align:start position:0%
interceptions or uh UC operations and uh
 
02:16:41.990 --> 02:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
it was explicit that you'd get the
 
02:16:43.030 --> 02:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
permission to do those through the
 
02:16:44.950 --> 02:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office on most
 
02:16:47.469 --> 02:16:47.479 align:start position:0%
offenses uh I look at this as more of a
 
02:16:49.830 --> 02:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
step statute for government than for
 
02:16:51.270 --> 02:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
actual individuals even though actual
 
02:16:53.309 --> 02:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
individuals could apply and throughout
 
02:16:54.429 --> 02:16:54.439 align:start position:0%
history as you know and may have
 
02:16:56.190 --> 02:16:56.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned we've evolved into a different
 
02:16:58.469 --> 02:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
time so would you in your opinion feel
 
02:17:00.070 --> 02:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
that this statute might need to be
 
02:17:02.790 --> 02:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
visited at some point to refresh it to
 
02:17:06.389 --> 02:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
where we are today absolutely um the
 
02:17:09.429 --> 02:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
wiretap statute in New Hampshire was
 
02:17:12.870 --> 02:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
initially adopted I want to say in in
 
02:17:16.870 --> 02:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
1969 and that was part of it the New
 
02:17:18.549 --> 02:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire wi taps statute is essentially
 
02:17:20.870 --> 02:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
copied directly from the federal I think
 
02:17:23.509 --> 02:17:23.519 align:start position:0%
it's the Omnibus crime bill of 1969 is
 
02:17:26.190 --> 02:17:26.200 align:start position:0%
part three of that and when you when you
 
02:17:29.030 --> 02:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
think about the technology in 1969 the
 
02:17:31.589 --> 02:17:31.599 align:start position:0%
WAP statute's really concerned with
 
02:17:34.870 --> 02:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
essentially like putting alligator clips
 
02:17:37.309 --> 02:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
on someone's you know phone lines and
 
02:17:39.150 --> 02:17:39.160 align:start position:0%
somehow listening into their those
 
02:17:41.629 --> 02:17:41.639 align:start position:0%
conversations it talks about um
 
02:17:43.750 --> 02:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
switchboard operators it talks about a
 
02:17:47.190 --> 02:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
number of things um technology obviously
 
02:17:50.230 --> 02:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
has changed since then and when I look
 
02:17:53.190 --> 02:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
at you know we I I had a conversation
 
02:17:54.830 --> 02:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
with another attorney in my office about
 
02:17:56.870 --> 02:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not hearing aids that
 
02:17:59.950 --> 02:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
actually enhance your hearing Beyond
 
02:18:02.270 --> 02:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
normal level would constitute a
 
02:18:04.709 --> 02:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
violation of wiretap Statute I think
 
02:18:06.469 --> 02:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
technically under the current law they
 
02:18:09.429 --> 02:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
may um but I certainly think it's it's
 
02:18:11.750 --> 02:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
worth revisiting the WAP statute
 
02:18:12.750 --> 02:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
especially in light of all the
 
02:18:16.150 --> 02:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
technology that currently exists thank
 
02:18:19.629 --> 02:18:19.639 align:start position:0%
you how many prosecutions do you see per
 
02:18:22.150 --> 02:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
per year roughly if any um for
 
02:18:24.110 --> 02:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
violations of the wab
 
02:18:28.110 --> 02:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
statute uh hardly any um it's very
 
02:18:30.830 --> 02:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
uncommon for us to prosecute someone for
 
02:18:33.750 --> 02:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
violating the WAP statute where we see
 
02:18:38.469 --> 02:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
it come up most again is on the victim
 
02:18:40.429 --> 02:18:40.439 align:start position:0%
or witness side of things where we've
 
02:18:42.349 --> 02:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
had a victim or witness surreptitiously
 
02:18:45.030 --> 02:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
recording it we have no interest in
 
02:18:47.830 --> 02:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
charging this person um but it presents
 
02:18:49.589 --> 02:18:49.599 align:start position:0%
an obstacle to getting that information
 
02:18:51.950 --> 02:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
in front of the court does the court
 
02:18:54.309 --> 02:18:54.319 align:start position:0%
always disallow it or will they allow
 
02:18:56.589 --> 02:18:56.599 align:start position:0%
the video portion and not the
 
02:19:00.389 --> 02:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:02.349 --> 02:19:02.359 align:start position:0%
there's different judges have
 
02:19:05.549 --> 02:19:05.559 align:start position:0%
interpreted the statute differently um
 
02:19:08.270 --> 02:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
there's a provision within the current
 
02:19:10.870 --> 02:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
wiretap Statute in
 
02:19:16.429 --> 02:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
570a um which prohibits use
 
02:19:19.509 --> 02:19:19.519 align:start position:0%
of the intercepted Communication in
 
02:19:23.709 --> 02:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
court if it would be illegal to uh
 
02:19:23.719 --> 02:19:25.349 align:start position:0%
court if it would be illegal to uh
distribute

02:19:25.349 --> 02:19:25.359 align:start position:0%
distribute
 
02:19:28.469 --> 02:19:28.479 align:start position:0%
it under the current wiretap statute and
 
02:19:31.190 --> 02:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
I hope I can explain this there's a
 
02:19:33.870 --> 02:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
class there's a felony level wir tap
 
02:19:37.750 --> 02:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
where if nobody has permission
 
02:19:40.870 --> 02:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
to if no one knows it's being recorded
 
02:19:42.030 --> 02:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
02:19:44.509 --> 02:19:44.519 align:start position:0%
felony if one person in the
 
02:19:46.549 --> 02:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
communication knows it's being recorded
 
02:19:48.030 --> 02:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
then it ends up being a
 
02:19:50.790 --> 02:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor so under the felony if
 
02:19:52.469 --> 02:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
you're secretly recording a conversation
 
02:19:53.830 --> 02:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
between two people and neither one of
 
02:19:56.150 --> 02:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
them are aware you're committing a
 
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
felony also under the felony statute if
 
02:20:04.429 --> 02:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
you use that conversation um or I don't
 
02:20:06.110 --> 02:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
know the exact word that's used in the
 
02:20:09.389 --> 02:20:09.399 align:start position:0%
statute but essentially if you use that
 
02:20:11.550 --> 02:20:11.560 align:start position:0%
conversation distribute that
 
02:20:14.510 --> 02:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
conversation it's an additional felony
 
02:20:16.389 --> 02:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
so it's a felony to make it and then
 
02:20:18.830 --> 02:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
it's another felony use it under the
 
02:20:21.190 --> 02:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor section of the statute again
 
02:20:23.030 --> 02:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
if two people are talking and one person
 
02:20:24.710 --> 02:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
knows they're being recorded we're in
 
02:20:26.910 --> 02:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
the misdemeanor section of the statute
 
02:20:29.030 --> 02:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's a misdemeanor to make the recording
 
02:20:31.790 --> 02:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
but there's no additional crime to use
 
02:20:34.710 --> 02:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
the recording or distribute the
 
02:20:38.910 --> 02:20:38.920 align:start position:0%
recording the way the exceptions to the
 
02:20:41.710 --> 02:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
statutes the prohibition on using it
 
02:20:45.670 --> 02:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
says if it were illegal to distribute it
 
02:20:48.389 --> 02:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
it can't be used in court some judges
 
02:20:50.630 --> 02:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
have interpreted that to mean only that
 
02:20:54.230 --> 02:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
felony level um intercept so if one
 
02:20:56.110 --> 02:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
person knew about it you could still use
 
02:20:58.590 --> 02:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
it in court some judges have interpreted
 
02:21:01.309 --> 02:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
it more broadly to mean any wiretap you
 
02:21:03.429 --> 02:21:03.439 align:start position:0%
can't use in court and we've seen other
 
02:21:06.150 --> 02:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
judges as you've said indicate I'll show
 
02:21:09.150 --> 02:21:09.160 align:start position:0%
the video portion but take the audio
 
02:21:11.830 --> 02:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
portion out of it so no Cas has made it
 
02:21:14.790 --> 02:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
to the Supreme Court no okay all right
 
02:21:17.630 --> 02:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
representative sake thank you and thank
 
02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um I have a
 
02:21:21.190 --> 02:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
similar question to what I asked the
 
02:21:23.469 --> 02:21:23.479 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill which is um do you
 
02:21:26.550 --> 02:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
see potential for um unintended
 
02:21:28.710 --> 02:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
consequences especially in the case of
 
02:21:31.670 --> 02:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps a domestic abuser who um might
 
02:21:34.510 --> 02:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
use something like this to force someone
 
02:21:36.429 --> 02:21:36.439 align:start position:0%
to record something without their
 
02:21:38.510 --> 02:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge or might abuse something in
 
02:21:41.790 --> 02:21:41.800 align:start position:0%
that way yeah absolutely I think there's
 
02:21:44.349 --> 02:21:44.359 align:start position:0%
potential unintended consequences of
 
02:21:47.790 --> 02:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
allowing people to record essentially
 
02:21:51.150 --> 02:21:51.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:54.910 --> 02:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
them thank you do you see um some sort
 
02:21:56.750 --> 02:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
of language that could go into an
 
02:21:59.670 --> 02:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
amendment that would help um prevent
 
02:22:01.990 --> 02:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
that type of unintended
 
02:22:08.270 --> 02:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
consequence um potentially I I
 
02:22:10.830 --> 02:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
think listening to the sponsor and the
 
02:22:12.429 --> 02:22:12.439 align:start position:0%
individual before me who spoke about
 
02:22:15.389 --> 02:22:15.399 align:start position:0%
this bill their intent is
 
02:22:18.790 --> 02:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
essentially um to keep businesses
 
02:22:20.830 --> 02:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
politicians that type of thing on the up
 
02:22:24.830 --> 02:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
and up my concern is really um people
 
02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
documenting crimes whether they be the
 
02:22:30.469 --> 02:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
victim or or a witness to a crime so I
 
02:22:32.110 --> 02:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
think that you could certainly write an
 
02:22:33.950 --> 02:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
amendment to the wiretap statute that
 
02:22:36.670 --> 02:22:36.680 align:start position:0%
would allow for people to document what
 
02:22:39.630 --> 02:22:39.640 align:start position:0%
they reasonably believe is a crime to
 
02:22:42.670 --> 02:22:42.680 align:start position:0%
either provide that material to the
 
02:22:45.790 --> 02:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
police or a court or or that type of
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
thing I think that would address some of
 
02:22:49.309 --> 02:22:49.319 align:start position:0%
my concerns I don't know that that would
 
02:22:51.710 --> 02:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
address the concerns of the the bill
 
02:22:54.870 --> 02:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor essentially to keep businesses
 
02:22:58.070 --> 02:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
um or politicians on on the up and up
 
02:23:00.830 --> 02:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
and that I'm sure you could could try
 
02:23:02.670 --> 02:23:02.680 align:start position:0%
and craft another amendment that would
 
02:23:04.950 --> 02:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
allow you know the recording of public
 
02:23:06.790 --> 02:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
officials or the recording of people
 
02:23:11.790 --> 02:23:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:15.349 --> 02:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
business represent Stone thank you and
 
02:23:16.429 --> 02:23:16.439 align:start position:0%
once again thank you for taking my
 
02:23:18.830 --> 02:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
question I know we've seen and heard of
 
02:23:21.309 --> 02:23:21.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh anybody recording under I
 
02:23:23.670 --> 02:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
believe it's the the Auditors the
 
02:23:25.910 --> 02:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
freedom Auditors that go around
 
02:23:28.590 --> 02:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
videotaping uh your local town office
 
02:23:31.070 --> 02:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
your cour houses that kind of thing
 
02:23:32.630 --> 02:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they actually be already
 
02:23:35.389 --> 02:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
covered if it's in in public a
 
02:23:38.630 --> 02:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely and I I know that
 
02:23:41.190 --> 02:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
the I know the individuals that I've run
 
02:23:45.190 --> 02:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
into are open in notoriously recording
 
02:23:47.950 --> 02:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
you and open in not iously recording
 
02:23:49.590 --> 02:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
someone does not run a foul with the wi
 
02:23:52.110 --> 02:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
tap statute thank
 
02:23:54.309 --> 02:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
you her
 
02:23:56.429 --> 02:23:56.439 align:start position:0%
n thank you Mr chair and thanks for
 
02:23:58.550 --> 02:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm wondering you
 
02:23:59.910 --> 02:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
know especially when you're recording
 
02:24:01.230 --> 02:24:01.240 align:start position:0%
things what you said was you know it's
 
02:24:03.349 --> 02:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
the best way to document uh what
 
02:24:05.429 --> 02:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
somebody says my question and I'm going
 
02:24:06.750 --> 02:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
to put it in the context of another bill
 
02:24:10.550 --> 02:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
that we had just as an example um around
 
02:24:13.349 --> 02:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
oh around well what what we essentially
 
02:24:15.990 --> 02:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
called it shorthand is fighting words MH
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
um and the way that would be a
 
02:24:19.389 --> 02:24:19.399 align:start position:0%
provocation so if you started recording
 
02:24:21.510 --> 02:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
after just using that example cuz it's
 
02:24:23.110 --> 02:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
fresh on our minds if you started
 
02:24:25.790 --> 02:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
recording after that kind of um
 
02:24:28.389 --> 02:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
instigating Point um are those kind of
 
02:24:29.590 --> 02:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
things you know if something like this
 
02:24:32.150 --> 02:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
were um implemented would that be taken
 
02:24:34.309 --> 02:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
into consideration of of how it might
 
02:24:38.309 --> 02:24:38.319 align:start position:0%
have been um not the whole story yeah
 
02:24:42.030 --> 02:24:42.040 align:start position:0%
and again under current law if you were
 
02:24:44.070 --> 02:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
sort of secretly recording the fighting
 
02:24:47.349 --> 02:24:47.359 align:start position:0%
words it would be a misdemeanor because
 
02:24:48.990 --> 02:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
it would be that one party knows one
 
02:24:50.469 --> 02:24:50.479 align:start position:0%
party doesn't
 
02:24:54.790 --> 02:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
know under this bill as I read it it
 
02:24:57.550 --> 02:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a crime because one party
 
02:24:59.630 --> 02:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
knows and as long as one party knows it
 
02:25:02.389 --> 02:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
no longer fits into the the wiretap
 
02:25:05.429 --> 02:25:05.439 align:start position:0%
statute thank you I I think my I should
 
02:25:06.750 --> 02:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
have said it a little more clear oh I'm
 
02:25:09.830 --> 02:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
sorry can I follow up okay um is that
 
02:25:11.870 --> 02:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
you know would would the point at which
 
02:25:13.150 --> 02:25:13.160 align:start position:0%
it was started be taken into
 
02:25:15.670 --> 02:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
consideration If This Were uh used as
 
02:25:18.590 --> 02:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
evidence um again someone with the with
 
02:25:21.429 --> 02:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
the idea that I just wonder about it
 
02:25:24.750 --> 02:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
being um not the whole story right
 
02:25:27.830 --> 02:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
exactly it's certainly I think that a
 
02:25:30.590 --> 02:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
court has the ability to limit evidence
 
02:25:33.910 --> 02:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
coming in um if it has the potential to
 
02:25:35.870 --> 02:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
mislead in the sense that it's it's not
 
02:25:38.150 --> 02:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
telling the whole
 
02:25:41.550 --> 02:25:41.560 align:start position:0%
story is um in your opinion is there not
 
02:25:45.349 --> 02:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
potential for provocation of tape and
 
02:25:47.710 --> 02:25:47.720 align:start position:0%
then result on tape
 
02:25:50.269 --> 02:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
for example in the cases of of uh
 
02:25:54.309 --> 02:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
spouses um divorce proceedings um
 
02:25:56.790 --> 02:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
someone saying you know what you're this
 
02:25:59.469 --> 02:25:59.479 align:start position:0%
record now you get the results
 
02:26:02.349 --> 02:26:02.359 align:start position:0%
back no I think that's absolutely a
 
02:26:05.790 --> 02:26:05.800 align:start position:0%
potential and as we were saying I think
 
02:26:06.910 --> 02:26:06.920 align:start position:0%
that comes
 
02:26:10.110 --> 02:26:10.120 align:start position:0%
into um you know the court being able to
 
02:26:13.070 --> 02:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
to limit what what they're looking at
 
02:26:16.550 --> 02:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
but we have we have certainly had cases
 
02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:18.070 align:start position:0%
but we have we have certainly had cases
where

02:26:18.070 --> 02:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:26:20.630 --> 02:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
I know I'm aware of at least one case
 
02:26:22.630 --> 02:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
where we had a person who I would
 
02:26:25.389 --> 02:26:25.399 align:start position:0%
consider the abusive
 
02:26:29.230 --> 02:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
partner um who is holding his phone
 
02:26:32.309 --> 02:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
going I'm afraid of you stop hitting me
 
02:26:34.510 --> 02:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
like you know and trying to record that
 
02:26:36.790 --> 02:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
to make it seem as though he's the one
 
02:26:40.469 --> 02:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
who was actually in Peril when he was
 
02:26:43.070 --> 02:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
not represent
 
02:26:45.469 --> 02:26:45.479 align:start position:0%
scitech would you give an example of a
 
02:26:48.429 --> 02:26:48.439 align:start position:0%
felony uh inter reception because you
 
02:26:51.550 --> 02:26:51.560 align:start position:0%
said if no party is aware of it and I
 
02:26:58.070 --> 02:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
understand that um so if I had see for
 
02:26:59.910 --> 02:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
example there's a conference room in
 
02:27:03.469 --> 02:27:03.479 align:start position:0%
this building where you guys you know
 
02:27:04.910 --> 02:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
have private
 
02:27:07.150 --> 02:27:07.160 align:start position:0%
conversations and I sneak into that
 
02:27:08.830 --> 02:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
conference room and I put my phone in
 
02:27:11.309 --> 02:27:11.319 align:start position:0%
there and I put my phone on record and I
 
02:27:13.670 --> 02:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
put it under my you know a jacket or a
 
02:27:16.269 --> 02:27:16.279 align:start position:0%
hat and I leave and I know that you're
 
02:27:17.830 --> 02:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
about to step into that conference room
 
02:27:19.389 --> 02:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
and have a private conversation with
 
02:27:21.389 --> 02:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
someone and you then go in that
 
02:27:23.590 --> 02:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
conference room you have a conversation
 
02:27:26.230 --> 02:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
you leave I go back in afterwards and
 
02:27:27.950 --> 02:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
retrieve my phone that would be an
 
02:27:29.830 --> 02:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
example of a a felony violation of the
 
02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:33.309 align:start position:0%
example of a a felony violation of the
wiretap

02:27:33.309 --> 02:27:33.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:35.389 --> 02:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
statute there be no further questions
 
02:27:36.830 --> 02:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
02:27:38.190 --> 02:27:38.200 align:start position:0%

02:28:52.830 --> 02:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
enrichment
 
02:28:56.550 --> 02:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh we have four covered bridges in
 
02:28:59.309 --> 02:28:59.319 align:start position:0%
Swansea and then the town next to to us
 
02:29:02.670 --> 02:29:02.680 align:start position:0%
has two more all of which carry traffic
 
02:29:06.349 --> 02:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
uh this bill is a is an attempt to help
 
02:29:08.950 --> 02:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
preserve those historic covered bridges
 
02:29:10.150 --> 02:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
um I know other people are going to be
 
02:29:12.110 --> 02:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
talking about the value of these Bridges
 
02:29:14.630 --> 02:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
to the state uh me talk a little bit
 
02:29:17.550 --> 02:29:17.560 align:start position:0%
about what the bill does um as you might
 
02:29:21.429 --> 02:29:21.439 align:start position:0%
know right now we um Pro prohibit towns
 
02:29:23.910 --> 02:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
and the state from General video
 
02:29:26.429 --> 02:29:26.439 align:start position:0%
recording of traffic there are a few
 
02:29:30.030 --> 02:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
exceptions made such as uh toll barriers
 
02:29:31.469 --> 02:29:31.479 align:start position:0%
where it's required for security
 
02:29:34.510 --> 02:29:34.520 align:start position:0%
purposes Etc and we're proposing to add
 
02:29:38.349 --> 02:29:38.359 align:start position:0%
one more exception which is to monitor
 
02:29:40.750 --> 02:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
historic covered bridges for the purpose
 
02:29:42.710 --> 02:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
of identifying the cause of damage to
 
02:29:46.710 --> 02:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
those bridges and and have you know
 
02:29:48.510 --> 02:29:48.520 align:start position:0%
Safeguard in here that that be the only
 
02:29:51.630 --> 02:29:51.640 align:start position:0%
purpose they could be uh collected for
 
02:29:53.870 --> 02:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
and any recording not needed for that
 
02:29:57.550 --> 02:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
purpose would be erased on a regular
 
02:30:01.269 --> 02:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
basis um I can tell you that I live
 
02:30:02.469 --> 02:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
about a quarter mile from one of the
 
02:30:04.469 --> 02:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
bridges I think is probably the the
 
02:30:06.429 --> 02:30:06.439 align:start position:0%
bridge that handles the most regular
 
02:30:08.389 --> 02:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
traffic at least among the one lane
 
02:30:10.070 --> 02:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
historic bridges in the
 
02:30:13.590 --> 02:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
state um it gets banged up regularly I
 
02:30:17.269 --> 02:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
think there there are three separate um
 
02:30:19.230 --> 02:30:19.240 align:start position:0%
incidents of damage to the bridge since
 
02:30:19.240 --> 02:30:20.190 align:start position:0%
incidents of damage to the bridge since
last

02:30:20.190 --> 02:30:20.200 align:start position:0%
last
 
02:30:23.110 --> 02:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
summer uh it's a burden on the town to
 
02:30:26.710 --> 02:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
repair those it uh detracts from the
 
02:30:29.309 --> 02:30:29.319 align:start position:0%
attractiveness I know we have tourists
 
02:30:32.150 --> 02:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
come up every day to take pictures of
 
02:30:34.269 --> 02:30:34.279 align:start position:0%
the bridge we have bus loads of people
 
02:30:35.870 --> 02:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
come up especially in the bridge to I
 
02:30:38.590 --> 02:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
mean in the in the fall to to seagar
 
02:30:41.150 --> 02:30:41.160 align:start position:0%
Bridges I mean it's a it's an important
 
02:30:45.790 --> 02:30:45.800 align:start position:0%
resource uh I find it disturbing to see
 
02:30:48.110 --> 02:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
the degree of damage I mean a lot of it
 
02:30:51.670 --> 02:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
is cosmetic uh but
 
02:30:55.150 --> 02:30:55.160 align:start position:0%
um it's it's it's nonetheless
 
02:30:57.309 --> 02:30:57.319 align:start position:0%
uh an issue that we all should be
 
02:30:58.590 --> 02:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about even if we don't have a
 
02:31:02.150 --> 02:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
bridge in our town so uh I I try to have
 
02:31:04.550 --> 02:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
this carefully crafted so that it would
 
02:31:06.349 --> 02:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
respect the Privacy rights of those who
 
02:31:09.030 --> 02:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
drive their bridge and don't cause
 
02:31:12.469 --> 02:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
damage um or who you know stop and
 
02:31:15.670 --> 02:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
Report the the damage so that the that
 
02:31:17.030 --> 02:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:31:19.429 --> 02:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
the bills can be sent to the right place
 
02:31:20.389 --> 02:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh but I think it's something it's
 
02:31:21.910 --> 02:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
important to do to kind of prevent this
 
02:31:24.790 --> 02:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
sort of ongoing damage I mean it's it's
 
02:31:26.710 --> 02:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
it's frequent in my town
 
02:31:26.720 --> 02:31:28.630 align:start position:0%
it's frequent in my town
anyway

02:31:28.630 --> 02:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
02:31:31.309 --> 02:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
um ready to answer any questions if if
 
02:31:34.590 --> 02:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
there are any thank you um is most of
 
02:31:36.910 --> 02:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
the damage vandalism or is it from
 
02:31:38.950 --> 02:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
Vehicles Bridge from my personal
 
02:31:41.469 --> 02:31:41.479 align:start position:0%
observation I know uh that Town
 
02:31:42.990 --> 02:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
Administrator from Swansea is here but
 
02:31:45.110 --> 02:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
he may be able to give you a little more
 
02:31:47.190 --> 02:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
comprehensive but from my observation it
 
02:31:49.030 --> 02:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
is vehicle
 
02:31:50.870 --> 02:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
strikes uh
 
02:31:53.150 --> 02:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
either uh trucks that are too tall and
 
02:31:55.510 --> 02:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
they take out some of the FAS or siding
 
02:31:58.230 --> 02:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
at the top or somebody pulling a trailer
 
02:32:00.670 --> 02:32:00.680 align:start position:0%
and they pull too close to the edge and
 
02:32:04.950 --> 02:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
clip off a corner uh again what you can
 
02:32:07.710 --> 02:32:07.720 align:start position:0%
see is sort of the Cosmetic I mean
 
02:32:10.070 --> 02:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
they're you know these boards here that
 
02:32:11.590 --> 02:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
kind of get ripped off easily and get
 
02:32:15.269 --> 02:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
replaced fairly easily uh I think the
 
02:32:17.150 --> 02:32:17.160 align:start position:0%
other I think we want to have a
 
02:32:20.269 --> 02:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
disincentive for people to drive over
 
02:32:22.030 --> 02:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
Bridges with vehicles that aren't
 
02:32:23.670 --> 02:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
suitable a lot of these bridges are
 
02:32:26.710 --> 02:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
weighted limited by weight certainly by
 
02:32:28.190 --> 02:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
height and
 
02:32:31.429 --> 02:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
uh and every time you have a overweight
 
02:32:32.870 --> 02:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle go over the bridge there's some
 
02:32:34.870 --> 02:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
unseen damage too so to the extent that
 
02:32:38.349 --> 02:32:38.359 align:start position:0%
we can create a disincentive to people
 
02:32:40.750 --> 02:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
to kind of try to sneak across because
 
02:32:44.389 --> 02:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
nobody's going to see or if they
 
02:32:46.230 --> 02:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
accidentally hit the bridge and then
 
02:32:47.670 --> 02:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
figure nobody's looking so I'm taking
 
02:32:51.190 --> 02:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
off I think that uh the uh the
 
02:32:53.750 --> 02:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
disincentive effect of this would be
 
02:32:56.670 --> 02:32:56.680 align:start position:0%
would be valuable on its
 
02:32:59.710 --> 02:32:59.720 align:start position:0%
own represent Manion thank you and thank
 
02:33:01.510 --> 02:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh is it not
 
02:33:02.910 --> 02:33:02.920 align:start position:0%
true that under that statute there's
 
02:33:05.070 --> 02:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
already a provision to allow that for
 
02:33:07.950 --> 02:33:07.960 align:start position:0%
certain bridges that are named uh not
 
02:33:09.510 --> 02:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
wooden not wooden bridges but certain
 
02:33:11.790 --> 02:33:11.800 align:start position:0%
list of bridges right there are a number
 
02:33:14.950 --> 02:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
of listed listed exceptions um so this
 
02:33:18.670 --> 02:33:18.680 align:start position:0%
would apply to there are 58 bridges in
 
02:33:20.230 --> 02:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
the state covered bridges in the state
 
02:33:23.030 --> 02:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
about 40 of which regularly carry
 
02:33:26.230 --> 02:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
traffic so you know again it would be up
 
02:33:28.269 --> 02:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
to the municipality or the state whoever
 
02:33:29.590 --> 02:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
is responsible for the bridge whether
 
02:33:31.429 --> 02:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
they want to monitor it or not but it
 
02:33:34.030 --> 02:33:34.040 align:start position:0%
would include that whole group of U of
 
02:33:36.230 --> 02:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
bridges in the in the exception okay so
 
02:33:38.349 --> 02:33:38.359 align:start position:0%
you're looking to expand it to to these
 
02:33:38.359 --> 02:33:39.590 align:start position:0%
you're looking to expand it to to these
historic

02:33:39.590 --> 02:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
historic
 
02:33:41.950 --> 02:33:41.960 align:start position:0%

02:33:41.960 --> 02:33:44.349 align:start position:0%
Bridges historic covered bridges right
thank

02:33:44.349 --> 02:33:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:46.389 --> 02:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
you further questions thank than give
 
02:33:50.110 --> 02:33:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:58.550 --> 02:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:01.030 --> 02:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
rhods thank you Mr chairman for the
 
02:34:02.870 --> 02:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
record I'm representative J for roess I
 
02:34:05.309 --> 02:34:05.319 align:start position:0%
represent chesher County District 17
 
02:34:07.230 --> 02:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
which is wi Winchester Richmond Swansea
 
02:34:09.910 --> 02:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
Troy and Fitz William I do share the
 
02:34:12.910 --> 02:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
towns of Swansea and Richmond with
 
02:34:14.790 --> 02:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
representative that just presented this
 
02:34:17.910 --> 02:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
bill and I pretty much agree with
 
02:34:20.469 --> 02:34:20.479 align:start position:0%
everything he said uh the one thing I
 
02:34:23.710 --> 02:34:23.720 align:start position:0%
did see as of about 15 minutes ago just
 
02:34:25.030 --> 02:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
double checking to make sure that I
 
02:34:26.990 --> 02:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't incorrect is my understanding
 
02:34:29.469 --> 02:34:29.479 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire has 70
 
02:34:33.070 --> 02:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
covered bridges with with which 58 of
 
02:34:36.750 --> 02:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
those have an actual state ID state ID
 
02:34:39.790 --> 02:34:39.800 align:start position:0%
number um there are a total of six cover
 
02:34:41.389 --> 02:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
bridges in the two towns that I
 
02:34:44.269 --> 02:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
represent and because these bridges are
 
02:34:47.030 --> 02:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
historic tourist attraction the towns go
 
02:34:48.630 --> 02:34:48.640 align:start position:0%
to Great Lengths to make sure that these
 
02:34:50.790 --> 02:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
bridges are held at a standard a little
 
02:34:53.190 --> 02:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
bit above the norm when there's Damage
 
02:34:55.750 --> 02:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
Done to these Bridges the state doesn't
 
02:34:58.510 --> 02:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
take responsibility to fix that damage
 
02:35:00.269 --> 02:35:00.279 align:start position:0%
the towns are responsible for that and
 
02:35:04.429 --> 02:35:04.439 align:start position:0%
it's thousands of dollars per incident
 
02:35:06.710 --> 02:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunately because the state doesn't
 
02:35:09.309 --> 02:35:09.319 align:start position:0%
help if there is a bridge that is closed
 
02:35:11.190 --> 02:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
for any period of time that greatly
 
02:35:12.910 --> 02:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
affects the Commerce in that town
 
02:35:17.230 --> 02:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
overall with the entire State um
 
02:35:19.190 --> 02:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
I would ask that the committee please
 
02:35:21.750 --> 02:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
support this bill especially because the
 
02:35:24.030 --> 02:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
people from my town are here and that
 
02:35:27.590 --> 02:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
would be great um there's any questions
 
02:35:30.990 --> 02:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:33.630 --> 02:35:33.640 align:start position:0%
them see no questions thank you thank

02:35:51.990 --> 02:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you Mr chairman
 
02:35:53.710 --> 02:35:53.720 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record I'm
 
02:35:55.429 --> 02:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
representative Margaret dry serving
 
02:35:58.150 --> 02:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
Sullivan district 7 uh includes the
 
02:36:00.349 --> 02:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
towns of Newport Unity Charlestown
 
02:36:03.070 --> 02:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
planfield and Cornish the home of the
 
02:36:05.150 --> 02:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
iconic Cornish Windsor covered bridge
 
02:36:06.750 --> 02:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
over the Connecticut
 
02:36:10.150 --> 02:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
River uh this bill is a companion to my
 
02:36:14.150 --> 02:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
Bill H Bill 1457 that raises the amount
 
02:36:16.910 --> 02:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
charged for damages to wooden covered
 
02:36:20.070 --> 02:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
bridges uh this is a necessary bill this
 
02:36:22.349 --> 02:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
one here because a good number of
 
02:36:24.510 --> 02:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
incidents that cause damage to cover
 
02:36:26.070 --> 02:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
bridges are hit and
 
02:36:28.870 --> 02:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
run extensive police time has to be
 
02:36:31.309 --> 02:36:31.319 align:start position:0%
devoted to tracking down the vehicle and
 
02:36:33.790 --> 02:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
many times it is never found yet the
 
02:36:35.870 --> 02:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
damage that's done to the bridge still
 
02:36:38.469 --> 02:36:38.479 align:start position:0%
has to be repaired in a small town like
 
02:36:41.790 --> 02:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
Cornish this is a costly process both in
 
02:36:44.870 --> 02:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
terms of police time and Bridge
 
02:36:47.309 --> 02:36:47.319 align:start position:0%
repair the requirements set forth in
 
02:36:49.670 --> 02:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
this bill are as careful as possible
 
02:36:52.269 --> 02:36:52.279 align:start position:0%
about privacy the use is restricted to
 
02:36:55.389 --> 02:36:55.399 align:start position:0%
one purpose the time the video is kept
 
02:36:57.309 --> 02:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
is the time needed to determine if it
 
02:37:00.550 --> 02:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
will be necessary to pursue charges and
 
02:37:04.190 --> 02:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
unneeded videos are erased within seven
 
02:37:06.910 --> 02:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
days um this morning I got a message
 
02:37:10.150 --> 02:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
from the um Cornish police chief that
 
02:37:13.110 --> 02:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
I'd like to read to you uh I'm Doug
 
02:37:14.790 --> 02:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
Hackett the chief of police for the town
 
02:37:16.469 --> 02:37:16.479 align:start position:0%
of Cornish where I've been employed
 
02:37:20.830 --> 02:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
since 1988 I stand in support of hb1
 
02:37:23.190 --> 02:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
1217 the Cornish Police Department
 
02:37:25.269 --> 02:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
routinely responds to one of its four
 
02:37:27.510 --> 02:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
covered bridges to take reports of past
 
02:37:30.670 --> 02:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
t damage to the bridge each time the
 
02:37:33.150 --> 02:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
officer arrives to find shattered wood
 
02:37:36.269 --> 02:37:36.279 align:start position:0%
small pieces of cars and routinely no
 
02:37:38.990 --> 02:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
drivers or vehicles around it becomes
 
02:37:41.309 --> 02:37:41.319 align:start position:0%
very frustrating to see our historic
 
02:37:43.910 --> 02:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
Bridges routinely damaged by oversized
 
02:37:46.469 --> 02:37:46.479 align:start position:0%
vehicles and the drivers get away with
 
02:37:49.190 --> 02:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
it leaving the cost of the repairs in
 
02:37:52.070 --> 02:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers hands I'm a strong
 
02:37:53.910 --> 02:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
advocate for placing cameras on the
 
02:37:56.990 --> 02:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
bridges in some in the case of the
 
02:37:59.870 --> 02:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
Cornish Windsor historic Covered Bridge
 
02:38:01.910 --> 02:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
damage is routinely called in in a
 
02:38:04.309 --> 02:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
timely fashion but some of the smaller
 
02:38:06.510 --> 02:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
Bridges may result in a notification a
 
02:38:09.070 --> 02:38:09.080 align:start position:0%
day or two later with that in mind I
 
02:38:10.750 --> 02:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
would not encourage short retention
 
02:38:12.830 --> 02:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
spans for the data I would think
 
02:38:14.910 --> 02:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
ensuring that we had at least 15 to 30
 
02:38:17.590 --> 02:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
days of data would be imperative please
 
02:38:20.990 --> 02:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
join me in supporting hb1 1217 and
 
02:38:23.230 --> 02:38:23.240 align:start position:0%
showing support for protection of our
 
02:38:24.590 --> 02:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
historic covered
 
02:38:26.910 --> 02:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
bridges um I don't have any problem with
 
02:38:30.150 --> 02:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
extending the time period um or keeping
 
02:38:32.990 --> 02:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
the bill as written and um I am asking
 
02:38:35.510 --> 02:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
you to please help protect our historic
 
02:38:38.309 --> 02:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
icons and support this bill and I'm open

branley good afternoon thank you for
 
02:39:08.030 --> 02:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
having me uh my name is Michael branley

I am the Town Administrator in the town
 
02:39:11.990 --> 02:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
of Swansea as has been mentioned uh
 
02:39:15.910 --> 02:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
Swansea has several covered bridges um a
 
02:39:17.269 --> 02:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
bridge is on our town seal and
 
02:39:19.830 --> 02:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
letterhead the message on our website
 
02:39:22.070 --> 02:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
has at times said Swansea bridging
 
02:39:24.790 --> 02:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
tradition and change uh historically
 
02:39:26.830 --> 02:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
when the Slate Bridge was the victim of
 
02:39:29.990 --> 02:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
arson and burned down in the 1990s
 
02:39:32.750 --> 02:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
voters of the Town funded a new kind of
 
02:39:34.630 --> 02:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh reproduction cover bridge that looked
 
02:39:37.830 --> 02:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
like the old one and in 2022 this town
 
02:39:40.670 --> 02:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
spent nearly $60,000 to paint the
 
02:39:43.469 --> 02:39:43.479 align:start position:0%
exterior of the Thompson Covered Bridge
 
02:39:46.230 --> 02:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
so needless to say uh cover bridges are
 
02:39:49.070 --> 02:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
important to swansea's history identity
 
02:39:50.870 --> 02:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
and sense of community we take their
 
02:39:50.880 --> 02:39:52.469 align:start position:0%
and sense of community we take their
preservation

02:39:52.469 --> 02:39:52.479 align:start position:0%
preservation
 
02:39:54.670 --> 02:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
seriously uh many cover bridges in New
 
02:39:56.429 --> 02:39:56.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are on Scenic back roads and
 
02:39:58.710 --> 02:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
see low levels of traffic other than
 
02:40:01.150 --> 02:40:01.160 align:start position:0%
local traffic and tourists taking Scenic
 
02:40:03.870 --> 02:40:03.880 align:start position:0%
pictures in the fall I expect most of
 
02:40:06.150 --> 02:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
these Bridges largely Faire okay and do
 
02:40:08.469 --> 02:40:08.479 align:start position:0%
not receive much much damage from
 
02:40:12.190 --> 02:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
traffic um local traffic knows uh best
 
02:40:14.190 --> 02:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
what what vehicles belong on them and
 
02:40:17.070 --> 02:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
three of swansea's uh cover Bridges meet
 
02:40:19.550 --> 02:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
this description and and don't have
 
02:40:21.469 --> 02:40:21.479 align:start position:0%
serious issues but our exception is the
 
02:40:23.590 --> 02:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
Crescent Bridge which representative of
 
02:40:26.110 --> 02:40:26.120 align:start position:0%
funner mentioned uh it's on Sawyer
 
02:40:28.389 --> 02:40:28.399 align:start position:0%
crossing road which is an unnumbered
 
02:40:30.309 --> 02:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
State Highway and one of the few primary
 
02:40:33.269 --> 02:40:33.279 align:start position:0%
routes from Swansea to the city of Keane
 
02:40:34.990 --> 02:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
uh the Crescent Bridge handles thousands
 
02:40:36.950 --> 02:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
of vehicles per day most of which are
 
02:40:40.070 --> 02:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
cars pickup trucks SUVs they yield to
 
02:40:41.870 --> 02:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
traffic on the bridge and cross one at a
 
02:40:44.550 --> 02:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
time unfortunately all too com all too
 
02:40:46.150 --> 02:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
common are box trucks trucks
 
02:40:47.950 --> 02:40:47.960 align:start position:0%
recreational vehicles commercial
 
02:40:50.110 --> 02:40:50.120 align:start position:0%
vehicles and other vehicles that are too
 
02:40:51.990 --> 02:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
heavy or too tall to safely cross the
 
02:40:54.070 --> 02:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
bridge we know how most of them get
 
02:40:56.710 --> 02:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
their they're following a GPS they
 
02:40:58.510 --> 02:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
disregard the warning signs or they're
 
02:41:01.110 --> 02:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
just plain not paying attention some of
 
02:41:02.630 --> 02:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
them I'm sure are oblivious of the
 
02:41:04.429 --> 02:41:04.439 align:start position:0%
impending obstacle until they hit the
 
02:41:07.389 --> 02:41:07.399 align:start position:0%
bridge others uh are observed kind of
 
02:41:09.510 --> 02:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
stopping before seeming to calculate
 
02:41:11.550 --> 02:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
whether they're going to make it or not
 
02:41:14.230 --> 02:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
and then uh and then they go for it some
 
02:41:15.950 --> 02:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
of them make it through uncap
 
02:41:18.469 --> 02:41:18.479 align:start position:0%
unscathed and some of them do not uh
 
02:41:20.710 --> 02:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
it's the ones who make it through and
 
02:41:22.150 --> 02:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
damage the bridge but are able to
 
02:41:24.670 --> 02:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
continue that this legislation uh would
 
02:41:27.349 --> 02:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
help address so communities could
 
02:41:29.190 --> 02:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
identify and hold them
 
02:41:31.469 --> 02:41:31.479 align:start position:0%
accountable uh as also been mentioned so
 
02:41:32.750 --> 02:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
far Swansea has been relatively
 
02:41:34.389 --> 02:41:34.399 align:start position:0%
fortunate and most of our damage has
 
02:41:36.830 --> 02:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
been superficial and not structural but
 
02:41:38.469 --> 02:41:38.479 align:start position:0%
other towns have not been so lucky and
 
02:41:40.910 --> 02:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
have seen their cover Bridges uh reive
 
02:41:42.389 --> 02:41:42.399 align:start position:0%
significant damage that forced their
 
02:41:46.550 --> 02:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
closure for uh long-term instances
 
02:41:48.349 --> 02:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
even relatively minor damage requires
 
02:41:49.990 --> 02:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
the bridge to be closed to traffic for
 
02:41:52.230 --> 02:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
repairs and when an insurance company is
 
02:41:54.190 --> 02:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
not involved the town's not going to
 
02:41:57.190 --> 02:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
incur the expense of hiring a contractor
 
02:42:00.190 --> 02:42:00.200 align:start position:0%
um so we use it with DPW staff which is
 
02:42:02.230 --> 02:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
already over taxed and takes away from
 
02:42:04.429 --> 02:42:04.439 align:start position:0%
their other duties uh if this
 
02:42:06.309 --> 02:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
legislation is approved word would get
 
02:42:07.790 --> 02:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
out that cameras are monitoring the
 
02:42:09.510 --> 02:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
bridges when they get damaged and I'm
 
02:42:11.910 --> 02:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
confident that uh the damage to cover
 
02:42:13.710 --> 02:42:13.720 align:start position:0%
Bridges throughout the state would be
 
02:42:16.429 --> 02:42:16.439 align:start position:0%
reduced as has been mention the statute
 
02:42:19.389 --> 02:42:19.399 align:start position:0%
already outlined some exemptions for uh
 
02:42:22.950 --> 02:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
the blanket uh inability of towns to
 
02:42:25.830 --> 02:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
serve surveil on public roads I do agree
 
02:42:27.630 --> 02:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
with the sentiment behind the statute
 
02:42:28.990 --> 02:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
that doesn't and do not think that
 
02:42:31.389 --> 02:42:31.399 align:start position:0%
cameras should be common on public roads
 
02:42:33.150 --> 02:42:33.160 align:start position:0%
but I feel uh that historic cover
 
02:42:34.670 --> 02:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
Bridges should be Exempted so New
 
02:42:36.389 --> 02:42:36.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can preserve them for the
 
02:42:41.349 --> 02:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:44.150 --> 02:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
come representative
 
02:42:47.110 --> 02:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
Jam thank you thank you uh something you
 
02:42:48.590 --> 02:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
said in your statement kind of clicked
 
02:42:50.269 --> 02:42:50.279 align:start position:0%
with me and I have to ask this question
 
02:42:53.510 --> 02:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
I'm so sorry it's pressing you said if
 
02:42:56.590 --> 02:42:56.600 align:start position:0%
this law is passed it would it would
 
02:43:00.670 --> 02:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
notify everybody that um this that we're
 
02:43:02.590 --> 02:43:02.600 align:start position:0%
surveilling the bridges for
 
02:43:04.670 --> 02:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
damage what are your thoughts on
 
02:43:07.830 --> 02:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
requiring a sign 100 ft down the road
 
02:43:10.070 --> 02:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
from the from the bridge saying video
 
02:43:12.510 --> 02:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
recording in progress I would have no
 
02:43:14.269 --> 02:43:14.279 align:start position:0%
issue with
 
02:43:14.279 --> 02:43:16.070 align:start position:0%
issue with
that

02:43:16.070 --> 02:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:43:17.550 --> 02:43:17.560 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you for
 
02:43:20.070 --> 02:43:20.080 align:start position:0%

for the record I'm representative
 
02:44:49.269 --> 02:44:49.279 align:start position:0%
Jennifer rhs I represent Winchester with
 
02:44:50.870 --> 02:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
Winchester Richmond Swansea Troy and
 
02:44:54.750 --> 02:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:57.670 --> 02:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
17 I in front of you this morning to
 
02:44:59.429 --> 02:44:59.439 align:start position:0%
present legislation that will hopefully
 
02:45:01.190 --> 02:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
fix RSA
 
02:45:03.910 --> 02:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
6449 from being used as a loophole in
 
02:45:06.590 --> 02:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
prosecution for of perpetrators that
 
02:45:09.110 --> 02:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
knowingly and willingly violate a
 
02:45:11.510 --> 02:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
Minor's privacy only being charged with
 
02:45:13.150 --> 02:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
a misdem meanor crime instead of a
 
02:45:15.469 --> 02:45:15.479 align:start position:0%
felony offense that we would see and any
 
02:45:17.349 --> 02:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
other Child Protection
 
02:45:19.750 --> 02:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
Law because RSA
 
02:45:22.590 --> 02:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
6449 does not take the age of a victim
 
02:45:22.600 --> 02:45:23.469 align:start position:0%
6449 does not take the age of a victim
into

02:45:23.469 --> 02:45:23.479 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:45:26.429 --> 02:45:26.439 align:start position:0%
account when a person violates a child's
 
02:45:29.070 --> 02:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
privacy in their own home in a bathroom
 
02:45:31.910 --> 02:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
a locker room or any other place that
 
02:45:33.790 --> 02:45:33.800 align:start position:0%
any reasonable person would consider to
 
02:45:33.800 --> 02:45:34.950 align:start position:0%
any reasonable person would consider to
be

02:45:34.950 --> 02:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:45:37.790 --> 02:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
private that results in that person that
 
02:45:39.950 --> 02:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
secretly recorded a child only being
 
02:45:43.150 --> 02:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
charged with a misdemeanor
 
02:45:45.110 --> 02:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
consequence it would be the same
 
02:45:47.349 --> 02:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
consequence is if a person secretly
 
02:45:49.830 --> 02:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
recorded a person in their kitchen
 
02:45:52.230 --> 02:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
instead of a child taking a
 
02:45:54.510 --> 02:45:54.520 align:start position:0%
shower sadly this is happening in the
 
02:45:55.590 --> 02:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and it has
 
02:45:58.030 --> 02:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
happened more than
 
02:46:00.750 --> 02:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
once it's very unfortunate that you will
 
02:46:02.870 --> 02:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
hear this afternoon from a mother that
 
02:46:06.230 --> 02:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
is living this terrorizing account every
 
02:46:09.389 --> 02:46:09.399 align:start position:0%
single day crimes against children are
 
02:46:12.269 --> 02:46:12.279 align:start position:0%
considered more heinous due to the vul
 
02:46:14.230 --> 02:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
vulnerability of the victim in the
 
02:46:16.710 --> 02:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
long-lasting such offenses can have and
 
02:46:19.230 --> 02:46:19.240 align:start position:0%
most often on the child's physical and
 
02:46:19.240 --> 02:46:20.830 align:start position:0%
most often on the child's physical and
emotional

02:46:20.830 --> 02:46:20.840 align:start position:0%
emotional
 
02:46:23.150 --> 02:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
well-being we need to recognize that
 
02:46:25.510 --> 02:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
sexual exploitation of a minor is
 
02:46:27.469 --> 02:46:27.479 align:start position:0%
adequately addressed in the law and
 
02:46:29.710 --> 02:46:29.720 align:start position:0%
place a higher moral value on protecting
 
02:46:32.150 --> 02:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
those who are defenseless and unable to
 
02:46:34.750 --> 02:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
comprehend that their V vulnerability is
 
02:46:34.760 --> 02:46:36.389 align:start position:0%
comprehend that their V vulnerability is
being

02:46:36.389 --> 02:46:36.399 align:start position:0%
being
 
02:46:38.429 --> 02:46:38.439 align:start position:0%
targeted we have already addressed
 
02:46:40.510 --> 02:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
violations of privacy and we have we
 
02:46:42.150 --> 02:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
have addressed child
 
02:46:45.269 --> 02:46:45.279 align:start position:0%
pornography please let us make this the
 
02:46:48.510 --> 02:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
year that we pass House Bill 1260 and
 
02:46:49.870 --> 02:46:49.880 align:start position:0%
make it clear that New Hampshire will
 
02:46:52.309 --> 02:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
not tolerate nor condone this Behavior
 
02:46:54.349 --> 02:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
en close the loophole by adequately
 
02:46:56.429 --> 02:46:56.439 align:start position:0%
addressing the seriousness of the
 
02:46:59.070 --> 02:46:59.080 align:start position:0%
offense as the disturbing sex crime that
 
02:46:59.080 --> 02:47:00.030 align:start position:0%
offense as the disturbing sex crime that
this

02:47:00.030 --> 02:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:47:02.670 --> 02:47:02.680 align:start position:0%
is thank you Mr
 
02:47:04.870 --> 02:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you I just have a quick
 
02:47:06.510 --> 02:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
question it seems to me you've been
 
02:47:08.670 --> 02:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
working on this issue for years um is
 
02:47:10.309 --> 02:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
this the first bill that we've seen on
 
02:47:14.070 --> 02:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
this or um I I recall us working on this
 
02:47:17.830 --> 02:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:20.150 --> 02:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know how far how far back you're
 
02:47:22.510 --> 02:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
meaning this is my second term I do know
 
02:47:25.110 --> 02:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
that we addressed the Privacy Law which
 
02:47:27.590 --> 02:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
we passed and unfortunately I think what
 
02:47:29.269 --> 02:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
has happened is this has been an
 
02:47:32.150 --> 02:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
unattended con consequence of not
 
02:47:33.910 --> 02:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
addressing the age of the minor so
 
02:47:35.710 --> 02:47:35.720 align:start position:0%
instead of this being charged as child
 
02:47:37.750 --> 02:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
pornography which is what everybody
 
02:47:39.950 --> 02:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
thought when this first came up every
 
02:47:41.790 --> 02:47:41.800 align:start position:0%
single person I talk to every single
 
02:47:44.110 --> 02:47:44.120 align:start position:0%
person I talk to about co-sponsoring
 
02:47:47.389 --> 02:47:47.399 align:start position:0%
along with self the first thing was
 
02:47:50.030 --> 02:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
isn't that child pornography but because
 
02:47:53.030 --> 02:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
it was secretly recorded it was not
 
02:47:54.870 --> 02:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
considered to be child pornography
 
02:47:57.150 --> 02:47:57.160 align:start position:0%
because it was not shared it was not
 
02:47:58.910 --> 02:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
considered to be the sex crime that it
 
02:48:00.510 --> 02:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
is so
 
02:48:02.190 --> 02:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the way that the
 
02:48:04.190 --> 02:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
information was gathered is the way it
 
02:48:06.950 --> 02:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
had to be prosecuted and obviously um
 
02:48:08.349 --> 02:48:08.359 align:start position:0%
attorney Enders is here and he can
 
02:48:10.309 --> 02:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
explain how this law has been affected
 
02:48:11.910 --> 02:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
and been used as a loophole I certainly
 
02:48:14.990 --> 02:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
am not the one to explain that in depth
 
02:48:17.910 --> 02:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you see no questions thank you for
 
02:48:20.230 --> 02:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
oh representative
 
02:48:22.910 --> 02:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
M so basically this this bill is an
 
02:48:27.269 --> 02:48:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:31.990 --> 02:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
child yes you could say that okay thank
 
02:48:38.070 --> 02:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:42.630 --> 02:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:57.870 --> 02:48:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:00.269 --> 02:49:00.279 align:start position:0%
rookie mistake thank you for taking my
 
02:49:02.790 --> 02:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
testimony um I am here just on behalf of
 
02:49:04.990 --> 02:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
myself and the community of children
 
02:49:07.030 --> 02:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
around the state of New Hampshire that
 
02:49:09.910 --> 02:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
have voices that are not being heard um
 
02:49:11.710 --> 02:49:11.720 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses the fact that a
 
02:49:15.230 --> 02:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
minor can be unwillingly uh video taped
 
02:49:17.710 --> 02:49:17.720 align:start position:0%
in the privacy of their own home and
 
02:49:20.469 --> 02:49:20.479 align:start position:0%
their perpetrator is now charged with a
 
02:49:22.750 --> 02:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor the message that this
 
02:49:24.389 --> 02:49:24.399 align:start position:0%
sends to our children is yeah you're
 
02:49:27.309 --> 02:49:27.319 align:start position:0%
important but not that important it's a
 
02:49:29.229 --> 02:49:29.239 align:start position:0%
it's a slap on the wrist it's something
 
02:49:30.990 --> 02:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
that you know a misdemeanor is something
 
02:49:33.110 --> 02:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
that basically says you did something
 
02:49:35.110 --> 02:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
wrong but not that wrong and so I think
 
02:49:37.550 --> 02:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
for the psychological health and
 
02:49:39.750 --> 02:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
well-being of these children who are
 
02:49:41.309 --> 02:49:41.319 align:start position:0%
having to go through this process to
 
02:49:43.150 --> 02:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
realize that perhaps a very trusted
 
02:49:45.269 --> 02:49:45.279 align:start position:0%
person within their inner Circle within
 
02:49:48.309 --> 02:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
their family has violated their most
 
02:49:52.150 --> 02:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
fundamental personal right to privacy
 
02:49:54.229 --> 02:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
you know whether it's in in the in a
 
02:49:57.030 --> 02:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
restroom when they're taking a shower to
 
02:49:58.950 --> 02:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
say that this is a misdemeanor that it's
 
02:50:00.389 --> 02:50:00.399 align:start position:0%
just you know well we're going to give
 
02:50:01.910 --> 02:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
you a smack on the wrist and send you on
 
02:50:03.630 --> 02:50:03.640 align:start position:0%
your way you're not listed as a sex
 
02:50:05.710 --> 02:50:05.720 align:start position:0%
offender you are in no way protecting
 
02:50:08.429 --> 02:50:08.439 align:start position:0%
children moving forward from being
 
02:50:11.710 --> 02:50:11.720 align:start position:0%
subjected to this person's bad behavior
 
02:50:13.910 --> 02:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
and so I think in support of this
 
02:50:15.429 --> 02:50:15.439 align:start position:0%
current bill
 
02:50:18.550 --> 02:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh it really takes it to a level of
 
02:50:21.190 --> 02:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
seriousness that says to the public if
 
02:50:22.950 --> 02:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
you're a victim we care about you if
 
02:50:24.269 --> 02:50:24.279 align:start position:0%
you're a victim we're going to support
 
02:50:26.429 --> 02:50:26.439 align:start position:0%
you and we're going to have something of
 
02:50:28.750 --> 02:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
a penalty that represents the severity
 
02:50:30.790 --> 02:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
of what has happened to you and I think
 
02:50:33.190 --> 02:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
for perpetrators it says you can't get
 
02:50:35.630 --> 02:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
away with utilizing technology to your
 
02:50:37.630 --> 02:50:37.640 align:start position:0%
advantage to these unwitting children I
 
02:50:39.910 --> 02:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
think part of the problem is our laws
 
02:50:42.110 --> 02:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
haven't kept up with our technology you
 
02:50:44.150 --> 02:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
know we have so many ways of doing
 
02:50:45.670 --> 02:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
horrible things things to people
 
02:50:47.550 --> 02:50:47.560 align:start position:0%
photographically you know through video
 
02:50:50.309 --> 02:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
through taping to invade our privacy and
 
02:50:52.190 --> 02:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
I think that this bill at least protects
 
02:50:54.590 --> 02:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
the children who are at the the you know
 
02:50:56.870 --> 02:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
have the least ability to be aware of
 
02:50:59.110 --> 02:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
their environment to be looking you know
 
02:51:01.030 --> 02:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
is there a is there a red flashing light
 
02:51:03.229 --> 02:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
that's watching me following me you know
 
02:51:05.590 --> 02:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
so if if you know we have to address
 
02:51:07.469 --> 02:51:07.479 align:start position:0%
this on a different level for adults you
 
02:51:09.150 --> 02:51:09.160 align:start position:0%
know so be it but at least for the
 
02:51:10.550 --> 02:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
children's sake I think that this bill
 
02:51:12.910 --> 02:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
is incredibly important sends a strong
 
02:51:16.309 --> 02:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
message that you matter your your safety
 
02:51:19.670 --> 02:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
your innocence they matter so with that
 
02:51:21.229 --> 02:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that I can answer any
 
02:51:25.070 --> 02:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
questions but I'd be happy to thank you
 
02:51:26.630 --> 02:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
see no questions thank you thank you for
 
02:51:26.640 --> 02:51:27.990 align:start position:0%
see no questions thank you thank you for
your

02:51:27.990 --> 02:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:51:43.550 --> 02:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:43.560 --> 02:51:48.510 align:start position:0%
 
Kylie

02:51:48.510 --> 02:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:50.389 --> 02:51:50.399 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon uh Mr chair and
 
02:51:52.030 --> 02:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee again my name
 
02:51:54.309 --> 02:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
is Pamela kyg and I'm the public policy
 
02:51:56.510 --> 02:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
specialist for the Coalition uh who
 
02:51:58.950 --> 02:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
represents uh our 12 community- based
 
02:52:00.990 --> 02:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
crisis centers and survivors in the
 
02:52:04.269 --> 02:52:04.279 align:start position:0%
state I'm here in support of hb1 1260
 
02:52:06.030 --> 02:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
today legislation that seeks to address
 
02:52:08.830 --> 02:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
a dangerous loophole in the violation of
 
02:52:12.110 --> 02:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
privacy statute um most people in New
 
02:52:13.630 --> 02:52:13.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire believe that a person who
 
02:52:16.269 --> 02:52:16.279 align:start position:0%
surreptitiously videotapes or uses a
 
02:52:18.229 --> 02:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
cell phone to record someone in a public
 
02:52:20.510 --> 02:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
bathroom would be charged with a felony
 
02:52:23.070 --> 02:52:23.080 align:start position:0%
um if you open a web page to Google and
 
02:52:25.269 --> 02:52:25.279 align:start position:0%
enter into a search bar the terms video
 
02:52:27.389 --> 02:52:27.399 align:start position:0%
recording in public bathroom you will
 
02:52:29.790 --> 02:52:29.800 align:start position:0%
probably see very comfortable amount of
 
02:52:31.550 --> 02:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
videos where people committed crimes a
 
02:52:33.710 --> 02:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
violation of privacy in New Hampshire
 
02:52:35.150 --> 02:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
however because of our statutory
 
02:52:37.429 --> 02:52:37.439 align:start position:0%
framework these people who may have
 
02:52:39.110 --> 02:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
captured hundreds of children in
 
02:52:41.150 --> 02:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
bathrooms can only be charged with a
 
02:52:43.150 --> 02:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor if law enforcement and
 
02:52:45.349 --> 02:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
prosecutors cannot improve
 
02:52:48.150 --> 02:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
distribution um I just kind of want to
 
02:52:49.469 --> 02:52:49.479 align:start position:0%
walk through a couple of scenarios I
 
02:52:50.710 --> 02:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
know it was touched on a little bit in
 
02:52:52.389 --> 02:52:52.399 align:start position:0%
the introduction of this bill and we had
 
02:52:54.229 --> 02:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
a pretty lengthy conversation about wire
 
02:52:56.030 --> 02:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
tapping which is one of the examples
 
02:53:00.229 --> 02:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to uh address today um so
 
02:53:01.990 --> 02:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh I just wanted to walk um take a
 
02:53:03.790 --> 02:53:03.800 align:start position:0%
moment to walk through kind of where
 
02:53:06.150 --> 02:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
filming a naked child in a is a felony
 
02:53:09.150 --> 02:53:09.160 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so if it's distributed
 
02:53:11.150 --> 02:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
um if there is sound like um the wiet
 
02:53:13.630 --> 02:53:13.640 align:start position:0%
tapping statute um and if the child is
 
02:53:16.070 --> 02:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
engaged in sexual explicit conduct
 
02:53:18.110 --> 02:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
however what this bill is addressing is
 
02:53:21.269 --> 02:53:21.279 align:start position:0%
the account is um the situation that is
 
02:53:23.389 --> 02:53:23.399 align:start position:0%
not accounted for where a perpetrator
 
02:53:25.790 --> 02:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
films the child does not distribute the
 
02:53:28.030 --> 02:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
video has no recorded sound and the
 
02:53:29.510 --> 02:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
child is not touching themselves
 
02:53:31.670 --> 02:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
sexually this scenario is only a
 
02:53:33.670 --> 02:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor for the first offense this
 
02:53:35.670 --> 02:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
means that people can secretly record
 
02:53:37.389 --> 02:53:37.399 align:start position:0%
children and face very little
 
02:53:40.389 --> 02:53:40.399 align:start position:0%
consequence this scenario is real and as
 
02:53:42.030 --> 02:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
you've heard this morning happens more
 
02:53:43.469 --> 02:53:43.479 align:start position:0%
than I think we would like to realize in
 
02:53:45.910 --> 02:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um and many families are
 
02:53:47.670 --> 02:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
often horrified that the crimes
 
02:53:49.070 --> 02:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
committed against their children has
 
02:53:51.309 --> 02:53:51.319 align:start position:0%
such a little consequence um so we
 
02:53:53.030 --> 02:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
really ask the committee to urgently
 
02:53:56.110 --> 02:53:56.120 align:start position:0%
address this loophole today um again as
 
02:53:58.229 --> 02:53:58.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned this is addressing a small um
 
02:54:01.710 --> 02:54:01.720 align:start position:0%
a small part of RSA 6449 the violations
 
02:54:03.389 --> 02:54:03.399 align:start position:0%
of privacy statute and just making a
 
02:54:05.670 --> 02:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
very explicit carve out for those under
 
02:54:08.750 --> 02:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
the age of 18 um we know that violations
 
02:54:10.710 --> 02:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
of privacy are not just about peeping
 
02:54:12.590 --> 02:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
into a window it's recognizing that
 
02:54:15.070 --> 02:54:15.080 align:start position:0%
these crimes can have lasting impacts on
 
02:54:17.429 --> 02:54:17.439 align:start position:0%
the emotional and physical well-being of
 
02:54:20.590 --> 02:54:20.600 align:start position:0%
a victim especially children um and just
 
02:54:23.349 --> 02:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
in conclusion um priv uh privacy
 
02:54:25.710 --> 02:54:25.720 align:start position:0%
violations are not victimless crimes and
 
02:54:27.269 --> 02:54:27.279 align:start position:0%
offenders who commit these acts have
 
02:54:29.389 --> 02:54:29.399 align:start position:0%
often impacted countless victims
 
02:54:31.550 --> 02:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
families and communities these crimes
 
02:54:33.750 --> 02:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
not just violate a child child's privacy
 
02:54:35.429 --> 02:54:35.439 align:start position:0%
but their sense of Safety and Security
 
02:54:37.910 --> 02:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
within their own home and Beyond um so I
 
02:54:39.150 --> 02:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
would just ask you all to please
 
02:54:41.030 --> 02:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
consider supporting this bill and help
 
02:54:43.190 --> 02:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
end um this form of child exploitation
 
02:54:45.269 --> 02:54:45.279 align:start position:0%
in our state thank you so
 
02:54:49.389 --> 02:54:49.399 align:start position:0%
much thank you questions representative
 
02:54:52.030 --> 02:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
scitec you said you said that in your
 
02:54:54.150 --> 02:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
testimony that uh distribution may be
 
02:54:55.910 --> 02:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
hard to prove but if you got it on the
 
02:55:00.429 --> 02:55:00.439 align:start position:0%
Internet isn't that distribution so yeah
 
02:55:01.910 --> 02:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
um and I know that there are a couple of
 
02:55:03.349 --> 02:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
folks that can speak more specifically
 
02:55:05.710 --> 02:55:05.720 align:start position:0%
to the nuances of the law um and I'll be
 
02:55:07.469 --> 02:55:07.479 align:start position:0%
passing around a chart that kind of very
 
02:55:11.269 --> 02:55:11.279 align:start position:0%
carefully articulates um kind of how um
 
02:55:13.590 --> 02:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
this bill has an inadvertent loophole
 
02:55:16.389 --> 02:55:16.399 align:start position:0%
that I don't think anyone intended to
 
02:55:18.830 --> 02:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
have in this um in when it you know in
 
02:55:22.229 --> 02:55:22.239 align:start position:0%
the statute so in violations of privacy
 
02:55:24.269 --> 02:55:24.279 align:start position:0%
in the situation um that we were trying
 
02:55:28.269 --> 02:55:28.279 align:start position:0%
to describe someone did took a video in
 
02:55:29.710 --> 02:55:29.720 align:start position:0%
like you know someone could take a video
 
02:55:31.750 --> 02:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
in a bathroom or another private space
 
02:55:34.750 --> 02:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
of a child who is not wearing clothes
 
02:55:37.150 --> 02:55:37.160 align:start position:0%
who is not doing anything sexually
 
02:55:38.990 --> 02:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
explicit but it is for sexual
 
02:55:41.229 --> 02:55:41.239 align:start position:0%
gratification the violations of privacy
 
02:55:42.950 --> 02:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
statute is trying to address those
 
02:55:45.750 --> 02:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
situations and so someone can have this
 
02:55:47.429 --> 02:55:47.439 align:start position:0%
video and not distribute it and it's
 
02:55:49.510 --> 02:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
just a misdemeanor so it it can't be
 
02:55:51.710 --> 02:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
charged under any other Statute in the
 
02:55:53.830 --> 02:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
law I hope that clarified things and not
 
02:55:53.840 --> 02:55:56.510 align:start position:0%
law I hope that clarified things and not
muddled

02:55:56.510 --> 02:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:01.630 --> 02:56:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:13.110 --> 02:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:13.120 --> 02:56:43.830 align:start position:0%
 
Martin

02:56:43.830 --> 02:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:43.840 --> 02:56:53.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:56:53.510 --> 02:56:53.520 align:start position:0%

02:57:11.429 --> 02:57:11.439 align:start position:0%
1260 this bill is extremely important to
 
02:57:13.389 --> 02:57:13.399 align:start position:0%
me thank you for the opportunity to
 
02:57:15.349 --> 02:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
speak to that
 
02:57:17.790 --> 02:57:17.800 align:start position:0%
the unthinkable happened to my daughter
 
02:57:19.990 --> 02:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
a man that we both trusted had been
 
02:57:22.670 --> 02:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
filming her a child in our family
 
02:57:25.389 --> 02:57:25.399 align:start position:0%
bathroom capturing every part of her
 
02:57:28.309 --> 02:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
body this went on for years without
 
02:57:29.469 --> 02:57:29.479 align:start position:0%
either of us
 
02:57:32.510 --> 02:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
knowing until she caught him and bravely
 
02:57:35.429 --> 02:57:35.439 align:start position:0%
came forward I was devastated to learn
 
02:57:37.710 --> 02:57:37.720 align:start position:0%
what had happened and outraged when I
 
02:57:40.070 --> 02:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
found out that the punishment for this
 
02:57:43.070 --> 02:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
crime of secretly recording a child in a
 
02:57:45.550 --> 02:57:45.560 align:start position:0%
bathroom was was a
 
02:57:48.190 --> 02:57:48.200 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor I continue to be so upset at
 
02:57:50.070 --> 02:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
what happened and the lack of
 
02:57:51.990 --> 02:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
accountability has made the whole
 
02:57:55.630 --> 02:57:55.640 align:start position:0%
situation even worse it is absolutely
 
02:57:58.150 --> 02:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
disturbing that such a sickening crime
 
02:58:00.790 --> 02:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
would only be a Class A Miss demeanor in
 
02:58:02.870 --> 02:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire with no
 
02:58:05.190 --> 02:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
requirement to register as a sex
 
02:58:07.670 --> 02:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
offender while very little Justice was
 
02:58:10.030 --> 02:58:10.040 align:start position:0%
served for my daughter I want to see
 
02:58:12.830 --> 02:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
that anyone else out there gets more
 
02:58:15.790 --> 02:58:15.800 align:start position:0%
Justice than we had and that individuals
 
02:58:18.229 --> 02:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
who sexually exploit minors get the
 
02:58:20.790 --> 02:58:20.800 align:start position:0%
punishment they deserve I've been
 
02:58:22.750 --> 02:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
working with the New Hampshire Coalition
 
02:58:25.110 --> 02:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
against Domestic and Sexual Violence to
 
02:58:27.030 --> 02:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
introduce legislation that would
 
02:58:30.110 --> 02:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
increase the penalty to a felony charge
 
02:58:31.590 --> 02:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
for the invasion of
 
02:58:34.030 --> 02:58:34.040 align:start position:0%
privacy the innocence of a child should
 
02:58:37.110 --> 02:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
be protected at all costs I didn't know
 
02:58:39.469 --> 02:58:39.479 align:start position:0%
there was a monster living under my roof
 
02:58:43.349 --> 02:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
for years this hor this whole ordeal has
 
02:58:45.030 --> 02:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
been EX extremely
 
02:58:47.630 --> 02:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
horrifying due to the inadequacy of the
 
02:58:49.910 --> 02:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
current law the man who sexually
 
02:58:52.750 --> 02:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
exploited my daughter only served 2
 
02:58:55.309 --> 02:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
months out of two years in
 
02:58:57.950 --> 02:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
jail what other means are out there to
 
02:59:00.269 --> 02:59:00.279 align:start position:0%
prevent him from doing this again to
 
02:59:01.830 --> 02:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
someone else's
 
02:59:04.269 --> 02:59:04.279 align:start position:0%
child when our children come forward and
 
02:59:07.510 --> 02:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
ask for help we must believe them we
 
02:59:09.510 --> 02:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
also have an obligation to protect them
 
02:59:12.229 --> 02:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
against this type of abuse how am I
 
02:59:14.070 --> 02:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to adequately protect my
 
02:59:15.990 --> 02:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
daughter when there is not an adequate
 
02:59:18.950 --> 02:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
system in place to proberly hold the
 
02:59:18.960 --> 02:59:20.349 align:start position:0%
system in place to proberly hold the
perpetrator

02:59:20.349 --> 02:59:20.359 align:start position:0%
perpetrator
 
02:59:22.990 --> 02:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
accountable while this legislation can't
 
02:59:24.710 --> 02:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
undo the harm that was caused to my
 
02:59:28.229 --> 02:59:28.239 align:start position:0%
family it can help ensure moving forward
 
02:59:29.710 --> 02:59:29.720 align:start position:0%
people who abuse children in New
 
02:59:33.229 --> 02:59:33.239 align:start position:0%
hampture are held responsible I urge you
 
02:59:35.910 --> 02:59:35.920 align:start position:0%

02:59:38.269 --> 02:59:38.279 align:start position:0%
children everywhere like my daughter are
 
02:59:41.910 --> 02:59:41.920 align:start position:0%

Hester good morning Mr chair members of

am a lieuten with the New Hampshire
 
03:00:17.150 --> 03:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
State Police I'm currently the commander
 
03:00:20.030 --> 03:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
of the special investigations unit uh
 
03:00:21.670 --> 03:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
where we work closely with the New
 
03:00:22.870 --> 03:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire internet crimes against
 
03:00:25.309 --> 03:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
children task force we are an affiliate
 
03:00:27.830 --> 03:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
member where we primarily investigate
 
03:00:30.429 --> 03:00:30.439 align:start position:0%
the child the exploitation of children
 
03:00:32.670 --> 03:00:32.680 align:start position:0%
based on Nick MC cyber tips as well as
 
03:00:35.590 --> 03:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
reports that come in from individuals um
 
03:00:37.950 --> 03:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
such as Mrs Martin who just
 
03:00:40.349 --> 03:00:40.359 align:start position:0%
testified um so current state current
 
03:00:41.710 --> 03:00:41.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state law has the same
 
03:00:43.990 --> 03:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
penalty across the board regardless of
 
03:00:46.790 --> 03:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
age of the victim under 6449 with this
 
03:00:48.349 --> 03:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
proposed addition it will further
 
03:00:50.190 --> 03:00:50.200 align:start position:0%
protect minors who are being violated
 
03:00:52.309 --> 03:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
and exploited this type of crime can
 
03:00:54.670 --> 03:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
occur anywhere by both strangers and
 
03:00:57.190 --> 03:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
individuals known to the victim um many
 
03:00:59.190 --> 03:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
times this happens with inhome
 
03:01:01.349 --> 03:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
offenders the material is often being
 
03:01:03.229 --> 03:01:03.239 align:start position:0%
retained for sexual gratification and
 
03:01:05.750 --> 03:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
therefore constantly revictimized
 
03:01:07.750 --> 03:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
individuals this amendment will allow
 
03:01:09.510 --> 03:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
law enforcement a mechanism to charge
 
03:01:10.950 --> 03:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
individuals with a felony who are
 
03:01:12.750 --> 03:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
unlawfully recording miners while they
 
03:01:14.469 --> 03:01:14.479 align:start position:0%
were in a private place and protecting
 
03:01:16.550 --> 03:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
the privacy of their bodies while they
 
03:01:18.150 --> 03:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
are unknowingly being
 
03:01:20.469 --> 03:01:20.479 align:start position:0%
violated violations of an individual's
 
03:01:21.950 --> 03:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
privacy have long-lasting and
 
03:01:24.950 --> 03:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
irreparable effects on a minor without
 
03:01:27.150 --> 03:01:27.160 align:start position:0%
dissemination or publication the crime
 
03:01:27.990 --> 03:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
remains a
 
03:01:30.110 --> 03:01:30.120 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor crimes such as this go hand
 
03:01:32.070 --> 03:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
inand with other crimes such as this the
 
03:01:34.070 --> 03:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
threat of disseminating the material as
 
03:01:36.229 --> 03:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
well as extortion it's imperative that
 
03:01:37.750 --> 03:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
individuals are held accountable for
 
03:01:39.670 --> 03:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
their actions and we continue to protect
 
03:01:39.680 --> 03:01:40.510 align:start position:0%
their actions and we continue to protect
child

03:01:40.510 --> 03:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
child
 
03:01:42.910 --> 03:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
victims and I also just wanted to touch
 
03:01:45.150 --> 03:01:45.160 align:start position:0%
on one of the other um the testimony or
 
03:01:47.870 --> 03:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
the question that was asked about um the
 
03:01:49.990 --> 03:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
definition of uh child sexual abuse
 
03:01:52.510 --> 03:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
material um so there's a very strict
 
03:01:54.269 --> 03:01:54.279 align:start position:0%
definition of child sexual abuse
 
03:01:58.910 --> 03:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
material as uh articulated in 649a to um
 
03:02:01.990 --> 03:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
and this would actually basically cover
 
03:02:04.030 --> 03:02:04.040 align:start position:0%
the offenses that may not meet those
 
03:02:07.990 --> 03:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
elements in terms of um under 649a it's
 
03:02:11.229 --> 03:02:11.239 align:start position:0%
luden lascivious uh exhibition of the uh
 
03:02:12.950 --> 03:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
butex or genitalia as well as there's
 
03:02:14.750 --> 03:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
some some additional language that goes
 
03:02:17.590 --> 03:02:17.600 align:start position:0%
in there um as mentioned by uh the
 
03:02:19.229 --> 03:02:19.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Coalition there are certain
 
03:02:20.990 --> 03:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
crimes such as just individuals being in
 
03:02:22.990 --> 03:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
the new that may not fall into the
 
03:02:26.469 --> 03:02:26.479 align:start position:0%
definition of 649a but would fall into
 
03:02:32.830 --> 03:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:35.950 --> 03:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
statute anybody representative
 
03:02:38.830 --> 03:02:38.840 align:start position:0%
scitec this may not be answerable either
 
03:02:41.590 --> 03:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
by you or Mr Andrew Andrew but I'm
 
03:02:45.030 --> 03:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
amazed to hear and maybe you had in your
 
03:02:48.349 --> 03:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
testimony a reason why he only got two
 
03:02:51.710 --> 03:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
months was there some I you think the
 
03:02:53.670 --> 03:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
Judge would have done everything he
 
03:02:56.710 --> 03:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
possibly could to this to the
 
03:02:59.550 --> 03:02:59.560 align:start position:0%
perpetrator I can't speak to that that
 
03:03:01.389 --> 03:03:01.399 align:start position:0%
particular case because I'm not familiar
 
03:03:04.630 --> 03:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
with it but um often times what happens
 
03:03:06.309 --> 03:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
is though it sounds like he may have
 
03:03:08.790 --> 03:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
been sentenced to more he probably
 
03:03:12.229 --> 03:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
received time off for in prison or jail
 
03:03:13.990 --> 03:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
what would have been considered good
 
03:03:16.670 --> 03:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
behavior representative Pratt all just
 
03:03:19.469 --> 03:03:19.479 align:start position:0%
one quick question please um if a person
 
03:03:22.309 --> 03:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
does this more than once is the crime a
 
03:03:24.309 --> 03:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
penalty more if they've done it more
 
03:03:25.630 --> 03:03:25.640 align:start position:0%
than once or if they just done it once
 
03:03:29.190 --> 03:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:31.349 --> 03:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
crime it sounds like occurred over a
 
03:03:33.670 --> 03:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
long period of time so would that be a a
 
03:03:37.590 --> 03:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
worse penalty than uh just a onetime
 
03:03:42.469 --> 03:03:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:45.750 --> 03:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
compounded uh yes sir it is actually
 
03:03:48.070 --> 03:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
considered under the current statute
 
03:03:50.429 --> 03:03:50.439 align:start position:0%
under paragraph six states that a um
 
03:03:52.190 --> 03:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
second or subsequent offense under
 
03:03:54.389 --> 03:03:54.399 align:start position:0%
paragraphs 1 through 3A would be
 
03:03:57.710 --> 03:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
considered class B felony class B
 
03:04:00.110 --> 03:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
felony represent wheeler thank you Mr
 
03:04:01.750 --> 03:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
chairman so following up on
 
03:04:03.550 --> 03:04:03.560 align:start position:0%
representative Pratt's
 
03:04:06.309 --> 03:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
question how in the scenario that
 
03:04:08.269 --> 03:04:08.279 align:start position:0%
someone is doing this for two years is
 
03:04:10.269 --> 03:04:10.279 align:start position:0%
that not is that not considered a
 
03:04:12.030 --> 03:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
subsequent offense if someone is doing
 
03:04:13.550 --> 03:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
this repeatedly over the course of two
 
03:04:14.830 --> 03:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
years and then they they would not be
 
03:04:17.110 --> 03:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
charged with the class B felony under
 
03:04:19.269 --> 03:04:19.279 align:start position:0%
that case subsequent offense generally
 
03:04:20.590 --> 03:04:20.600 align:start position:0%
speaking means that they would have had
 
03:04:23.110 --> 03:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
to been convicted of a first offense
 
03:04:24.990 --> 03:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
right I
 
03:04:28.110 --> 03:04:28.120 align:start position:0%
see representative Stone thank you and
 
03:04:29.030 --> 03:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
03:04:30.469 --> 03:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant can you give us some
 
03:04:32.070 --> 03:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
background on how this material is used
 
03:04:34.070 --> 03:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
for extortion that you've seen during
 
03:04:36.389 --> 03:04:36.399 align:start position:0%
your career yes
 
03:04:39.550 --> 03:04:39.560 align:start position:0%
so cyber crime as as everyone knows is
 
03:04:41.710 --> 03:04:41.720 align:start position:0%
not limited specifically to to this type
 
03:04:44.870 --> 03:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
of material but it is specifically used
 
03:04:47.190 --> 03:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
in order to it's uh it's actually
 
03:04:49.229 --> 03:04:49.239 align:start position:0%
terminology now it's called sextortion
 
03:04:52.349 --> 03:04:52.359 align:start position:0%
so if an individual possesses an image
 
03:04:55.269 --> 03:04:55.279 align:start position:0%
or a video of someone that they think
 
03:04:57.790 --> 03:04:57.800 align:start position:0%
that can they can gain either some sort
 
03:05:00.910 --> 03:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
of financial gain or coer a victim into
 
03:05:04.710 --> 03:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
maybe um producing more material that is
 
03:05:07.750 --> 03:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
often how it is utilized to ex extort
 
03:05:11.030 --> 03:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
them so for example we've seen cases
 
03:05:13.950 --> 03:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
where um a suspect will
 
03:05:15.469 --> 03:05:15.479 align:start position:0%
if it if it occurs through some sort of
 
03:05:17.990 --> 03:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
online platform they will uh continue to
 
03:05:19.790 --> 03:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
ask for money so it might start at a
 
03:05:21.990 --> 03:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
small amount and then it will continue
 
03:05:23.950 --> 03:05:23.960 align:start position:0%
to the amount will get larger and larger
 
03:05:26.630 --> 03:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
and larger and they will threaten to
 
03:05:29.269 --> 03:05:29.279 align:start position:0%
disseminate to either family or friends
 
03:05:31.710 --> 03:05:31.720 align:start position:0%
or or
 
03:05:34.870 --> 03:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
schoolmates thank you
 
03:05:37.190 --> 03:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
yes see no further questions thank you
 
03:05:40.550 --> 03:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
for your um representative man thank you
 
03:05:42.750 --> 03:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
Mr sh one question so I this is
 
03:05:44.550 --> 03:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
increasing the the penalty to class B
 
03:05:47.150 --> 03:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
for this violation according to the
 
03:05:48.590 --> 03:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
statute of second offense would also be
 
03:05:50.510 --> 03:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
a Class B would it what are your
 
03:05:52.630 --> 03:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
thoughts on making a second Offense for
 
03:05:53.990 --> 03:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
this certain chapter this certain
 
03:05:56.110 --> 03:05:56.120 align:start position:0%
section A Class a
 
03:05:58.469 --> 03:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
felony I I think that would be
 
03:06:03.150 --> 03:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:05.990 --> 03:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for your testimony thank
 
03:06:12.190 --> 03:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:12.200 --> 03:06:25.070 align:start position:0%
 
Enders

03:06:25.070 --> 03:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:26.630 --> 03:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Stephen Andrew I'm an
 
03:06:28.190 --> 03:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
assistant County attorney in marac
 
03:06:30.349 --> 03:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
County um I'm a prosecutor I've been a
 
03:06:31.990 --> 03:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
prosecutor for over 20 years I do
 
03:06:34.070 --> 03:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
support this legislation and the marac
 
03:06:36.469 --> 03:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
county attorney's office supports this
 
03:06:38.590 --> 03:06:38.600 align:start position:0%
legislation uh essentially this doesn't
 
03:06:40.630 --> 03:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
create a new crime it creates an
 
03:06:44.030 --> 03:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
increased penalty when
 
03:06:46.190 --> 03:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
the the perpetrator knows or should know
 
03:06:48.910 --> 03:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
that the person um they're recording as
 
03:06:48.920 --> 03:06:49.710 align:start position:0%
that the person um they're recording as
a

03:06:49.710 --> 03:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:06:53.070 --> 03:06:53.080 align:start position:0%
child prior to 2024 all violation
 
03:06:55.910 --> 03:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
privacy was a misdemeanor last year uh
 
03:06:57.830 --> 03:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
thankfully the legislature did pass a
 
03:07:00.110 --> 03:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
second offense being being a
 
03:07:03.110 --> 03:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
felony but
 
03:07:05.349 --> 03:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I
 
03:07:08.630 --> 03:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
was I got asked about Miss Martin's case
 
03:07:11.710 --> 03:07:11.720 align:start position:0%
essentially was given that scenario and
 
03:07:14.630 --> 03:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
was shocked when and uh when I looked at
 
03:07:16.550 --> 03:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
this and said I I think that's a
 
03:07:18.670 --> 03:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and I know a number of other
 
03:07:20.269 --> 03:07:20.279 align:start position:0%
prosecutors we all sort of racked our
 
03:07:21.950 --> 03:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
brains to try and find a felony there
 
03:07:26.229 --> 03:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
and we we couldn't find one um a as was
 
03:07:28.309 --> 03:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
indicated it doesn't necessarily fit
 
03:07:31.670 --> 03:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
into child sexual abuse images because
 
03:07:33.990 --> 03:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
um just changing your clothes or taking
 
03:07:37.269 --> 03:07:37.279 align:start position:0%
a shower isn't sexually explicit conduct
 
03:07:40.389 --> 03:07:40.399 align:start position:0%
where the dissemination part fit in was
 
03:07:43.150 --> 03:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
under 6449 a the non-consensual
 
03:07:45.510 --> 03:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
dissemination of private sexual images
 
03:07:47.790 --> 03:07:47.800 align:start position:0%
which is sort of colloquially the
 
03:07:50.269 --> 03:07:50.279 align:start position:0%
revenge porn statute if you have a nude
 
03:07:52.070 --> 03:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
photograph of someone and you distribute
 
03:07:54.110 --> 03:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
it without their permission that
 
03:07:55.630 --> 03:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
potentially is a felony under that
 
03:07:57.630 --> 03:07:57.640 align:start position:0%
statute but in this case we didn't have
 
03:07:59.910 --> 03:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
dissemination so it didn't fit into that
 
03:08:03.190 --> 03:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
statute either what I like about the
 
03:08:04.990 --> 03:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
language in this bill is that it really
 
03:08:09.269 --> 03:08:09.279 align:start position:0%
focuses on what the perpetrator is doing
 
03:08:10.910 --> 03:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of where they're hiding this
 
03:08:12.630 --> 03:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
camera and and I think that's an
 
03:08:14.910 --> 03:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
important thing to to keep in mind when
 
03:08:18.469 --> 03:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
I think about um you know I think about
 
03:08:21.910 --> 03:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
like a a a Walmart or a Target or some
 
03:08:24.030 --> 03:08:24.040 align:start position:0%
type of department store and someone
 
03:08:26.710 --> 03:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
hiding a camera in there and certainly
 
03:08:29.990 --> 03:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's there's adult dressing rooms in
 
03:08:31.990 --> 03:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
those stores and I think hiding a camera
 
03:08:35.349 --> 03:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
in a in an adult dressing room is is bad
 
03:08:38.070 --> 03:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
don't get me wrong but there's also a
 
03:08:40.070 --> 03:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
children's section of those stores and I
 
03:08:43.030 --> 03:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
think if you're hiding a camera in the
 
03:08:45.070 --> 03:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
children's dressing
 
03:08:47.550 --> 03:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
rooms that sort of implicates a whole
 
03:08:51.309 --> 03:08:51.319 align:start position:0%
new level of you know of perhaps
 
03:08:53.070 --> 03:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
sickness on the part of the person doing
 
03:08:54.790 --> 03:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
it and I think that this bill
 
03:08:56.670 --> 03:08:56.680 align:start position:0%
appropriately would make that a class B
 
03:09:00.349 --> 03:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
felony I'm happy to answer any
 
03:09:03.550 --> 03:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:09:06.229 --> 03:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair I'm I'm
 
03:09:09.670 --> 03:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
reading the rsay that this is changing
 
03:09:13.710 --> 03:09:13.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure if my concern is is um
 
03:09:16.150 --> 03:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
valid or not but basically if there were
 
03:09:18.790 --> 03:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
to be high schoolers you know filming a
 
03:09:20.710 --> 03:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
Tik Tok or something while they're at
 
03:09:22.269 --> 03:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
school in the locker room or something
 
03:09:24.630 --> 03:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
is that going to put them at risk of a
 
03:09:26.630 --> 03:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
class B
 
03:09:26.640 --> 03:09:30.190 align:start position:0%
class B
felony

03:09:30.190 --> 03:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:33.830 --> 03:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
if the statute now has installs or uses
 
03:09:37.269 --> 03:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
a device well I think if high school
 
03:09:39.190 --> 03:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
students are filming within the locker
 
03:09:41.110 --> 03:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
room where people have an expectation of
 
03:09:43.229 --> 03:09:43.239 align:start position:0%
privacy I think that certainly would run
 
03:09:45.469 --> 03:09:45.479 align:start position:0%
a fowl of the statute as it's currently
 
03:09:47.469 --> 03:09:47.479 align:start position:0%
written and if they know that there's
 
03:09:49.030 --> 03:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
children in that locker room then it
 
03:09:50.950 --> 03:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
would be a
 
03:09:55.590 --> 03:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
felony thank you represent Stone just to
 
03:09:58.070 --> 03:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
clarify that felony if the individual
 
03:09:59.750 --> 03:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
was under the age of 18 would be treated
 
03:10:02.349 --> 03:10:02.359 align:start position:0%
as a juvenile justice correct it it
 
03:10:04.750 --> 03:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be an adult it would go through
 
03:10:06.469 --> 03:10:06.479 align:start position:0%
the juvenile process juvenile process
 
03:10:06.479 --> 03:10:08.990 align:start position:0%
the juvenile process juvenile process
corre

03:10:08.990 --> 03:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:10.870 align:start position:0%
 
than

03:10:10.870 --> 03:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
than
 
03:10:13.349 --> 03:10:13.359 align:start position:0%
and Anders would it not be incumbent
 
03:10:15.269 --> 03:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
upon the schools to have a policy of no
 
03:10:17.429 --> 03:10:17.439 align:start position:0%
making Tik Tok videos in the in the
 
03:10:19.750 --> 03:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
school dressing
 
03:10:19.760 --> 03:10:21.349 align:start position:0%
school dressing
room

03:10:21.349 --> 03:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
room
 
03:10:23.590 --> 03:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
um yeah I mean I think that's that's
 
03:10:26.429 --> 03:10:26.439 align:start position:0%
common sense and I think it implicates a
 
03:10:33.269 --> 03:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
a a bigger issue of um people under 18
 
03:10:35.950 --> 03:10:35.960 align:start position:0%
memorializing um perhaps other people
 
03:10:41.190 --> 03:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:44.110 --> 03:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
activity representative s
 
03:10:46.150 --> 03:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um and thank you for taking my
 
03:10:47.950 --> 03:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
question attorney Anders just to clarify
 
03:10:49.630 --> 03:10:49.640 align:start position:0%
something that you brought up so you
 
03:10:50.950 --> 03:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
talked about putting a camera for
 
03:10:52.229 --> 03:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
example in a dressing room in a
 
03:10:54.950 --> 03:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
department store um and I think about my
 
03:10:58.349 --> 03:10:58.359 align:start position:0%
own children who by 13 no longer fit in
 
03:10:59.870 --> 03:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
the clothes in the children's section
 
03:11:01.870 --> 03:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
and therefore we're changing in what
 
03:11:03.229 --> 03:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
would I guess you would consider the
 
03:11:05.110 --> 03:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
adult section right but really is for
 
03:11:09.510 --> 03:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
anyone over the age of 10 um so if
 
03:11:11.710 --> 03:11:11.720 align:start position:0%
they're in the section that but by your
 
03:11:14.309 --> 03:11:14.319 align:start position:0%
interpretation if this were enacted if
 
03:11:15.630 --> 03:11:15.640 align:start position:0%
they're in the same dressing room that
 
03:11:15.640 --> 03:11:16.429 align:start position:0%
they're in the same dressing room that
I'm

03:11:16.429 --> 03:11:16.439 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
03:11:18.910 --> 03:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
using and and this camera has been set
 
03:11:21.630 --> 03:11:21.640 align:start position:0%
up surreptitiously to tape
 
03:11:26.229 --> 03:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
them is it would they be subject to a a
 
03:11:29.349 --> 03:11:29.359 align:start position:0%
felony or to a misdemeanor because
 
03:11:30.950 --> 03:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
there're still minors who are being
 
03:11:33.550 --> 03:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
subjected to the same abuse it's just
 
03:11:35.150 --> 03:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
that they needed to go to a more age
 
03:11:38.269 --> 03:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate location to change the way
 
03:11:41.150 --> 03:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
the statute is is currently proposed we
 
03:11:43.710 --> 03:11:43.720 align:start position:0%
would have to show that the person
 
03:11:48.950 --> 03:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
who put the camera there knows or um
 
03:11:51.309 --> 03:11:51.319 align:start position:0%
should know that the person entitled to
 
03:11:52.910 --> 03:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
privacy therein is a
 
03:11:57.309 --> 03:11:57.319 align:start position:0%
child so if you sort of accidentally
 
03:12:00.349 --> 03:12:00.359 align:start position:0%
catch a child on your your secret hidden
 
03:12:02.190 --> 03:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
camera that wouldn't necessarily run a
 
03:12:07.710 --> 03:12:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:11.469 --> 03:12:11.479 align:start position:0%
written so for clarity if someone put a
 
03:12:13.590 --> 03:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
camera hoping to catch generally
 
03:12:15.870 --> 03:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
speaking women in the in the changing
 
03:12:18.710 --> 03:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
room and they happen to catch a child
 
03:12:20.429 --> 03:12:20.439 align:start position:0%
they'd still be charged with the felony
 
03:12:22.190 --> 03:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
because of the child is that not correct
 
03:12:24.309 --> 03:12:24.319 align:start position:0%
or do they you have to prove intent to
 
03:12:25.870 --> 03:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
catch a child correct you'd have to
 
03:12:28.750 --> 03:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
prove intent to catch the child I see if
 
03:12:32.830 --> 03:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
you had a you know it's an adult locker
 
03:12:36.030 --> 03:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
room say where you had no knowledge that
 
03:12:38.349 --> 03:12:38.359 align:start position:0%
children were ever using it it would
 
03:12:40.590 --> 03:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
still be a misdemeanor even if a child
 
03:12:43.229 --> 03:12:43.239 align:start position:0%
happened to to be there under this
 
03:12:46.389 --> 03:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
language um you could certainly amend it
 
03:12:48.670 --> 03:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
to make it so that any you know
 
03:12:50.429 --> 03:12:50.439 align:start position:0%
surreptitiously recorded video that
 
03:12:53.830 --> 03:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:58.670 --> 03:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
felony okay thank further questions um
 
03:13:00.510 --> 03:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you Mr
 
03:13:02.269 --> 03:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
chairman one point I could think of if
 
03:13:04.110 --> 03:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
of a child being in an adult changing
 
03:13:06.190 --> 03:13:06.200 align:start position:0%
room is parents will go in with their
 
03:13:07.790 --> 03:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
kids as they change all the way on
 
03:13:11.190 --> 03:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
through so there should be no um
 
03:13:13.229 --> 03:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
distinction right between
 
03:13:15.590 --> 03:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
where it should just be a given that
 
03:13:17.550 --> 03:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to get no matter where it
 
03:13:20.309 --> 03:13:20.319 align:start position:0%
is right I think you can certainly craft
 
03:13:25.910 --> 03:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
a statute that says if you um are
 
03:13:28.110 --> 03:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
surreptitiously recording and you catch
 
03:13:31.389 --> 03:13:31.399 align:start position:0%
a child it's a felony okay thank
 
03:13:35.790 --> 03:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
you under the current statute um is
 
03:13:38.910 --> 03:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
catching an adult or child either or
 
03:13:41.550 --> 03:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
does it require registration on the sex
 
03:13:41.560 --> 03:13:43.429 align:start position:0%
does it require registration on the sex
offender

03:13:43.429 --> 03:13:43.439 align:start position:0%
offender
 
03:13:46.550 --> 03:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
I believe it does I'm not 100% sure I
 
03:13:48.990 --> 03:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
can check for it if you is it explicit
 
03:13:51.389 --> 03:13:51.399 align:start position:0%
in the new Statute in the proposed bill
 
03:13:56.190 --> 03:13:56.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:59.710 --> 03:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
uh just look up the do you recommend
 
03:14:01.670 --> 03:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
that if it's not that it should
 
03:14:03.590 --> 03:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
be I certainly don't think it would
 
03:14:05.389 --> 03:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily be a bad idea if you were
 
03:14:07.590 --> 03:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
convicted of a felony level violation of
 
03:14:09.070 --> 03:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
privacy that you have to register as a
 
03:14:12.590 --> 03:14:12.600 align:start position:0%

Newington a few years ago in 2016 New
 
04:07:59.510 --> 04:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire joined a growing number of
 
04:08:01.469 --> 04:08:01.479 align:start position:0%
states when we finally criminalized
 
04:08:04.229 --> 04:08:04.239 align:start position:0%
image-based sexual abuse which is more
 
04:08:06.950 --> 04:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
commonly known as revenge porn section
 
04:08:10.349 --> 04:08:10.359 align:start position:0%
644 4 colon 9 of New Hampshire law makes
 
04:08:12.309 --> 04:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
the non-consensual dissemination of
 
04:08:14.469 --> 04:08:14.479 align:start position:0%

activity or intimate Parts a class B
 
04:08:20.189 --> 04:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
felony what my bill does is bring the
 
04:08:22.109 --> 04:08:22.119 align:start position:0%
statute up to date by closing some
 
04:08:25.070 --> 04:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
loopholes the technology along with the
 
04:08:27.469 --> 04:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
very worst in human nature have
 
04:08:30.670 --> 04:08:30.680 align:start position:0%
created first of all the bill expands
 
04:08:33.510 --> 04:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
the defin definition of disseminate from
 
04:08:35.630 --> 04:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
Real World things like printing
 
04:08:37.950 --> 04:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
publishing and Manufacturing to the
 
04:08:40.149 --> 04:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
virtual world so it specifically
 
04:08:43.590 --> 04:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
includes posting or sharing an image
 
04:08:45.510 --> 04:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
electronically while it can be argued
 
04:08:47.309 --> 04:08:47.319 align:start position:0%
that the current definition includes
 
04:08:49.710 --> 04:08:49.720 align:start position:0%
electronic posting and sharing it's not
 
04:08:52.510 --> 04:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
in there so it can also be argued that
 
04:08:54.870 --> 04:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't this small change would
 
04:08:57.309 --> 04:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
remove the ambiguity and would clarify
 
04:08:58.670 --> 04:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
how the law should
 
04:09:02.590 --> 04:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
work the second thing that HB 1319 does
 
04:09:04.670 --> 04:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
is criminalize the act of making and
 
04:09:09.510 --> 04:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
sharing non-consensual deep fake porn
 
04:09:12.189 --> 04:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
videos Deep fakes are visual content
 
04:09:13.710 --> 04:09:13.720 align:start position:0%
that's created using artificial
 
04:09:13.720 --> 04:09:14.910 align:start position:0%
that's created using artificial
intelligence

04:09:14.910 --> 04:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
intelligence
 
04:09:17.269 --> 04:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
technology this technology does not
 
04:09:20.189 --> 04:09:20.199 align:start position:0%
require a room-sized computer uh today
 
04:09:21.990 --> 04:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's actually available to anybody with
 
04:09:22.000 --> 04:09:22.750 align:start position:0%
it's actually available to anybody with
a

04:09:22.750 --> 04:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:09:25.349 --> 04:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
smartphone it doesn't require any
 
04:09:28.229 --> 04:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
special skills or any special training
 
04:09:30.429 --> 04:09:30.439 align:start position:0%
some of these apps can realistically
 
04:09:32.950 --> 04:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
swap the face of a celebrity or a porn
 
04:09:35.950 --> 04:09:35.960 align:start position:0%
star with the face of a victim others
 
04:09:37.990 --> 04:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
use deep learning algorithms that can be
 
04:09:40.590 --> 04:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
trained to remove clothes from images or
 
04:09:42.870 --> 04:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
videos of women and replace them with
 
04:09:45.229 --> 04:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
images of other people's naked body
 
04:09:47.910 --> 04:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
parts the results are extremely
 
04:09:49.910 --> 04:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
realistic and are increasingly
 
04:09:52.070 --> 04:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
indistinguishable from the real
 
04:09:55.790 --> 04:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
thing there are also deep fake creators
 
04:09:58.030 --> 04:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
uh of content who take commissions and
 
04:10:00.790 --> 04:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
who charge as little as $30 to
 
04:10:04.149 --> 04:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
seamlessly uh insert the facial features
 
04:10:07.550 --> 04:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh uh of a person uh onto the body of a
 
04:10:11.030 --> 04:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
porn star uh or the facial features onto
 
04:10:12.790 --> 04:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
anybody that they actually feel like
 
04:10:15.070 --> 04:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
targeting and that can include uh your
 
04:10:18.070 --> 04:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
24-year-old daughter uh who's uh in the
 
04:10:19.950 --> 04:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
process of searching for a job whose new
 
04:10:22.269 --> 04:10:22.279 align:start position:0%
employer might be Googling her name on
 
04:10:24.269 --> 04:10:24.279 align:start position:0%
the Internet uh these videos are
 
04:10:26.030 --> 04:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
actually showing up in things like
 
04:10:27.269 --> 04:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
Google search
 
04:10:29.710 --> 04:10:29.720 align:start position:0%
results they can be used to extort money
 
04:10:33.030 --> 04:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
from a victim to rec a reputation or
 
04:10:35.630 --> 04:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
just for the simple thrill that comes to
 
04:10:38.590 --> 04:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
those who enjoy ruining other people's
 
04:10:41.469 --> 04:10:41.479 align:start position:0%
lives in 2023 the New Hampshire Supreme
 
04:10:43.189 --> 04:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
Court ruled that deep vake computer
 
04:10:46.269 --> 04:10:46.279 align:start position:0%
images can constitute harassment in the
 
04:10:48.870 --> 04:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
case SD versus NB the offender uploaded
 
04:10:50.830 --> 04:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
a profile of the victim onto an online
 
04:10:53.389 --> 04:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
dating app using her own profile picture
 
04:10:55.469 --> 04:10:55.479 align:start position:0%
he then used software to create
 
04:10:58.149 --> 04:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
computer-generated images of her these
 
04:11:00.710 --> 04:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
images showed her naked being choked by
 
04:11:02.950 --> 04:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
a police officer and being
 
04:11:05.429 --> 04:11:05.439 align:start position:0%
stabbed the victim eventually obtained a
 
04:11:06.870 --> 04:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
stalking protective order but the
 
04:11:09.990 --> 04:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
perpetrator objected arguing that fake
 
04:11:11.710 --> 04:11:11.720 align:start position:0%
the fake digital images that he was
 
04:11:14.429 --> 04:11:14.439 align:start position:0%
creating and posting were a form of
 
04:11:16.630 --> 04:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
expression protected by Free
 
04:11:18.750 --> 04:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
Speech the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
04:11:20.750 --> 04:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
upheld the order finding that the
 
04:11:23.070 --> 04:11:23.080 align:start position:0%
defendant's Behavior Uh including the
 
04:11:25.189 --> 04:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
post using computer generated images of
 
04:11:27.710 --> 04:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
sexual and physical violence constituted
 
04:11:30.670 --> 04:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
a threat this ruling came on top of a
 
04:11:34.149 --> 04:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
2015 ruling State versus Craig where the
 
04:11:36.149 --> 04:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court ruled threatening or

harassing social media post about a
 
04:11:40.910 --> 04:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
person can still count as stocking even
 
04:11:42.870 --> 04:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
if the offender never directly sent them
 
04:11:44.109 --> 04:11:44.119 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:11:47.030 --> 04:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
victim this sort of Behavior Uh
 
04:11:49.550 --> 04:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly harms women and children
 
04:11:51.550 --> 04:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately right now it's booming
 
04:11:54.870 --> 04:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
online at an unprecedented rate during
 
04:11:56.630 --> 04:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
the first 9 months of
 
04:11:56.640 --> 04:11:58.349 align:start position:0%
the first 9 months of
2023

04:11:58.349 --> 04:11:58.359 align:start position:0%
2023
 
04:12:00.990 --> 04:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
113,000 deep fake porn videos were
 
04:12:04.309 --> 04:12:04.319 align:start position:0%
uploaded to the top 35 websites that
 
04:12:07.309 --> 04:12:07.319 align:start position:0%
Host this sort of content that's nearly
 
04:12:09.269 --> 04:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
double the number of deep fake porn
 
04:12:11.630 --> 04:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
videos that were uploaded in all of the
 
04:12:11.640 --> 04:12:12.429 align:start position:0%
videos that were uploaded in all of the
year

04:12:12.429 --> 04:12:12.439 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:12:14.910 --> 04:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
before there are currently no federal
 
04:12:16.830 --> 04:12:16.840 align:start position:0%
laws in the United States against the
 
04:12:19.790 --> 04:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
creation and sharing of non-consensual
 
04:12:22.389 --> 04:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
deep fake
 
04:12:25.429 --> 04:12:25.439 align:start position:0%
pornography for a victim a deep fake
 
04:12:29.510 --> 04:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
video can be a a lifelong sentence um it
 
04:12:32.109 --> 04:12:32.119 align:start position:0%
might only take the creator of a video
 
04:12:33.910 --> 04:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
like that a few minutes to put something
 
04:12:35.710 --> 04:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
like that on the internet but once it's
 
04:12:37.510 --> 04:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
up on the internet I I think I think as
 
04:12:40.550 --> 04:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
we all know uh it can pretty much live
 
04:12:42.590 --> 04:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
forever what this bill would do is
 
04:12:45.189 --> 04:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
something that's very simple it extends
 
04:12:47.510 --> 04:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
an existing New Hampshire law in a way
 
04:12:49.349 --> 04:12:49.359 align:start position:0%
that ensures there are very real
 
04:12:52.670 --> 04:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
consequences for the very real harm and
 
04:12:56.830 --> 04:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
dis uh that this sort of Behavior Uh uh
 
04:12:59.670 --> 04:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
entails and and and for the destructive
 
04:13:03.510 --> 04:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
nature of it um that ruins lives uh and
 
04:13:06.149 --> 04:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
reputations and with that I'll take any
 
04:13:09.189 --> 04:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:12.510 --> 04:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
yeah um my question
 
04:13:17.990 --> 04:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
is how how would you know if the image
 
04:13:19.950 --> 04:13:19.960 align:start position:0%
you possess in other words people share
 
04:13:22.910 --> 04:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
images if someone shared such an image
 
04:13:24.269 --> 04:13:24.279 align:start position:0%
that they got from someone else how
 
04:13:26.030 --> 04:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
would they know that it was a deep fake
 
04:13:27.630 --> 04:13:27.640 align:start position:0%
or would they be subject to this or is
 
04:13:29.550 --> 04:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
this only targeted at the
 
04:13:32.030 --> 04:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
Creator so you're asking how how would
 
04:13:33.990 --> 04:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
you know it's a deep fake image yeah how
 
04:13:35.950 --> 04:13:35.960 align:start position:0%
would how would you charge someone with
 
04:13:37.870 --> 04:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
with a violation of this for sharing a
 
04:13:40.309 --> 04:13:40.319 align:start position:0%
deep faked image or posting it if they
 
04:13:42.070 --> 04:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
got it somewhere else I mean in other
 
04:13:43.990 --> 04:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
words these things come from everywhere
 
04:13:45.670 --> 04:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
um I I think that there's a person from
 
04:13:47.030 --> 04:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
the state police who might be able to
 
04:13:49.349 --> 04:13:49.359 align:start position:0%
answer that question better than me but
 
04:13:52.710 --> 04:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
um uh a lot of these videos are actually
 
04:13:55.349 --> 04:13:55.359 align:start position:0%
posted on uh websites that are dedicated
 
04:13:58.109 --> 04:13:58.119 align:start position:0%
for that purpose so bottom line is if if
 
04:13:59.750 --> 04:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
if it's on one of these websites it's
 
04:14:03.149 --> 04:14:03.159 align:start position:0%
likely to be a deep fake okay represent
 
04:14:06.269 --> 04:14:06.279 align:start position:0%
re yes is there any way to trace and see
 
04:14:08.670 --> 04:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
where the who made these videos is there
 
04:14:11.070 --> 04:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
like an identifier to know who who
 
04:14:13.189 --> 04:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
started these deep fake pictures or
 
04:14:15.630 --> 04:14:15.640 align:start position:0%
whatever or is it Anonymous are they
 
04:14:18.469 --> 04:14:18.479 align:start position:0%
easy to trace um another great question
 
04:14:20.870 --> 04:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
for the State Police I'm I'm sure that
 
04:14:22.670 --> 04:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
there are cases where they are traceable
 
04:14:24.269 --> 04:14:24.279 align:start position:0%
back to the person and there are ways to
 
04:14:27.630 --> 04:14:27.640 align:start position:0%
do that um I'm I'm not aware of anything
 
04:14:30.710 --> 04:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
in the video itself that would uh you
 
04:14:34.389 --> 04:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
know indicate who created it um and
 
04:14:37.990 --> 04:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
there may be depending on
 
04:14:39.349 --> 04:14:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh and and I'm kind of getting a little
 
04:14:40.990 --> 04:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
bit outside my area of knowledge but
 
04:14:42.790 --> 04:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
there there are metadata that typically
 
04:14:44.710 --> 04:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
get created along with digital files I
 
04:14:47.109 --> 04:14:47.119 align:start position:0%
know with photography files still image
 
04:14:49.309 --> 04:14:49.319 align:start position:0%
files uh there's actually quite a bit of
 
04:14:51.229 --> 04:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
metadata that can be recorded what I'm
 
04:14:53.950 --> 04:14:53.960 align:start position:0%
less sure of is what what gets recorded
 
04:14:56.469 --> 04:14:56.479 align:start position:0%
in something like an MPEG file uh a
 
04:15:00.229 --> 04:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
motion picture file representative Jamon
 
04:15:01.670 --> 04:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:15:05.229 --> 04:15:05.239 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
04:15:07.750 --> 04:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
um I I noticed that you're talking about
 
04:15:10.590 --> 04:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
synthetic image um and in your testimony
 
04:15:13.910 --> 04:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
you said video um is there a reason why
 
04:15:15.389 --> 04:15:15.399 align:start position:0%
when you were drafting the bill you
 
04:15:18.910 --> 04:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
didn't say video and image because they
 
04:15:22.109 --> 04:15:22.119 align:start position:0%
they can be different yeah I
 
04:15:24.550 --> 04:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
think there's a difference between a
 
04:15:26.670 --> 04:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
video let's say that's taken of you on a
 
04:15:30.149 --> 04:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
video camera and uh an image that can be
 
04:15:34.269 --> 04:15:34.279 align:start position:0%
generated through I AI so for example um
 
04:15:37.349 --> 04:15:37.359 align:start position:0%
you can generate um what looks like a
 
04:15:40.030 --> 04:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
video of a person from from as little as
 
04:15:42.830 --> 04:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
a single still image and the more still
 
04:15:45.389 --> 04:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
images that you have taken from the more
 
04:15:47.149 --> 04:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
taken from more angles the more
 
04:15:50.510 --> 04:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
realistic that representation can be but
 
04:15:54.389 --> 04:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
what it is is it's really a glorified am
 
04:15:57.469 --> 04:15:57.479 align:start position:0%
uh uh animation that looks photoreal so
 
04:15:59.710 --> 04:15:59.720 align:start position:0%
to you and I looking at that video we
 
04:16:01.830 --> 04:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
look at it and say oh my God that's
 
04:16:04.429 --> 04:16:04.439 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a video of real people
 
04:16:07.189 --> 04:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
um but the reality is is that with the
 
04:16:09.149 --> 04:16:09.159 align:start position:0%
use of artificial uh artificial
 
04:16:12.790 --> 04:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
intelligence technology videos like that
 
04:16:15.510 --> 04:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
can be put together in a way so so that
 
04:16:17.149 --> 04:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
they're indistinguishable I mean another
 
04:16:19.550 --> 04:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
way to think of it is it's at some point
 
04:16:22.590 --> 04:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
in the future we're going to see uh
 
04:16:24.550 --> 04:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
Hollywood film stars that have been dead
 
04:16:27.429 --> 04:16:27.439 align:start position:0%
for 60 years like uh Humphrey Bogart and
 
04:16:31.389 --> 04:16:31.399 align:start position:0%
Lauren Mcall realistically acting in new
 
04:16:33.510 --> 04:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
movies I'm looking forward to that
 
04:16:36.630 --> 04:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
actually um representative jamer thank
 
04:16:38.750 --> 04:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
you for allowing the followup um this
 
04:16:41.630 --> 04:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
would be very similar to a video I saw
 
04:16:43.189 --> 04:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
about 10 years ago with Hank Williams
 
04:16:46.269 --> 04:16:46.279 align:start position:0%
and Hank Williams J Jr singing uh family
 
04:16:48.870 --> 04:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
tradition together um but the question I
 
04:16:52.229 --> 04:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
have now is in the drafting of the bill
 
04:16:56.229 --> 04:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
if I I'm going to point to um line five
 
04:17:00.870 --> 04:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
of the draft here of the bill um it says
 
04:17:03.189 --> 04:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
distribute twice I'm wondering if
 
04:17:05.510 --> 04:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
striking the first word distribute in
 
04:17:07.469 --> 04:17:07.479 align:start position:0%
that line and just leaving or otherwise
 
04:17:09.750 --> 04:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
distribute would be make more sense cuz
 
04:17:13.469 --> 04:17:13.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:17.790 --> 04:17:17.800 align:start position:0%
twice I I I'm sorry striking which which
 
04:17:22.269 --> 04:17:22.279 align:start position:0%
word um in line five yeah it says I'll
 
04:17:23.710 --> 04:17:23.720 align:start position:0%
I'll read the line
 
04:17:26.109 --> 04:17:26.119 align:start position:0%
electronically comment distribute sell
 
04:17:28.389 --> 04:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
lease exhibit display or otherwise
 
04:17:31.670 --> 04:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
distribute you distributes it twice oh
 
04:17:35.790 --> 04:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:38.469 --> 04:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
catch I would probably get rid of the
 
04:17:38.479 --> 04:17:39.469 align:start position:0%
catch I would probably get rid of the
first

04:17:39.469 --> 04:17:39.479 align:start position:0%
first
 
04:17:43.510 --> 04:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
distribute yeah represent Stone thank
 
04:17:44.910 --> 04:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you and thank you for taking
 
04:17:44.920 --> 04:17:45.630 align:start position:0%
you thank you and thank you for taking
my

04:17:45.630 --> 04:17:45.640 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:17:48.109 --> 04:17:48.119 align:start position:0%
question would this also apply to images
 
04:17:50.149 --> 04:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
of politicians or any other celebrity
 
04:17:51.990 --> 04:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
that's in a still shot that would be
 
04:17:56.389 --> 04:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
shared on new multiple platforms that I
 
04:18:02.030 --> 04:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:04.109 --> 04:18:04.119 align:start position:0%
uh I think one of the things that we've
 
04:18:05.910 --> 04:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
seen is we've seen over the years this
 
04:18:08.790 --> 04:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
technology um can be used for other
 
04:18:11.990 --> 04:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
things um and I think when it comes to
 
04:18:13.790 --> 04:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
politicians there's a First Amendment
 
04:18:18.670 --> 04:18:18.680 align:start position:0%
issue um around uh fair use and parity
 
04:18:21.750 --> 04:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
and things things like that so um I I
 
04:18:25.309 --> 04:18:25.319 align:start position:0%
think a a statute around uh prohibiting
 
04:18:27.830 --> 04:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
the use of it in political campaigns
 
04:18:30.349 --> 04:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
might be something that's that's needed
 
04:18:31.870 --> 04:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
but it would be very complicated to
 
04:18:33.710 --> 04:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
write and there there there are
 
04:18:35.429 --> 04:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
potentially First Amendment landmines
 
04:18:38.269 --> 04:18:38.279 align:start position:0%
all over the place um and I think this
 
04:18:41.389 --> 04:18:41.399 align:start position:0%
is something that's much narrower and I
 
04:18:43.750 --> 04:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
I actually have a a professional
 
04:18:46.710 --> 04:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
experience from a few years back I was
 
04:18:49.950 --> 04:18:49.960 align:start position:0%
uh the uh the project manager of uh of a
 
04:18:52.389 --> 04:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
health app where we did uh age
 
04:18:54.389 --> 04:18:54.399 align:start position:0%
progression and one of the things that
 
04:18:57.269 --> 04:18:57.279 align:start position:0%
we we did was we used iOS facial
 
04:19:01.149 --> 04:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
recognition um uh 2016 version which was
 
04:19:03.429 --> 04:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
a lot less capable than than than what's
 
04:19:05.670 --> 04:19:05.680 align:start position:0%
available now and we actually sent
 
04:19:08.030 --> 04:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
images back to the University of Toronto
 
04:19:10.950 --> 04:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
in a Mainframe where the an artificial
 
04:19:12.830 --> 04:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
intelligence program was used to
 
04:19:17.109 --> 04:19:17.119 align:start position:0%
actually age uh the app was intended for
 
04:19:19.349 --> 04:19:19.359 align:start position:0%
young people let's say in their in their
 
04:19:21.189 --> 04:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
20s who could take a selfie of
 
04:19:24.349 --> 04:19:24.359 align:start position:0%
themselves um and then in about about 30
 
04:19:26.349 --> 04:19:26.359 align:start position:0%
seconds they would see what they look
 
04:19:29.830 --> 04:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
like let's say at the age of 45 if they
 
04:19:32.750 --> 04:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
go into a tanning booth uh every week
 
04:19:35.389 --> 04:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
you know for the next 20 years um if
 
04:19:37.349 --> 04:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
they drink a certain amount of alcohol
 
04:19:39.790 --> 04:19:39.800 align:start position:0%
every week for the next 20 years um sun
 
04:19:43.710 --> 04:19:43.720 align:start position:0%
exposure weight gain so the idea the
 
04:19:47.189 --> 04:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
idea of the app was to try to influence
 
04:19:50.990 --> 04:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
behavior it called uh basically there
 
04:19:52.990 --> 04:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
there's a behavioral Factor called the
 
04:19:56.830 --> 04:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
temporal distancing where um uh it's
 
04:20:00.830 --> 04:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
sort of the the the the uh the father
 
04:20:03.189 --> 04:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
you are the father away you are from the
 
04:20:05.309 --> 04:20:05.319 align:start position:0%
consequences of your behavior whether it
 
04:20:07.630 --> 04:20:07.640 align:start position:0%
can be years or whatever the less likely
 
04:20:10.229 --> 04:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
you are to kind of modify your behavior
 
04:20:13.469 --> 04:20:13.479 align:start position:0%
so that you um you have a better outcome
 
04:20:15.309 --> 04:20:15.319 align:start position:0%
down the road which is a long way of
 
04:20:18.189 --> 04:20:18.199 align:start position:0%
saying that beer I can drink now feels a
 
04:20:20.349 --> 04:20:20.359 align:start position:0%
lot better than worrying about that 45y
 
04:20:22.950 --> 04:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
old guy 25 25 years from now who has a
 
04:20:25.389 --> 04:20:25.399 align:start position:0%
big gut because he drank too much beer
 
04:20:26.910 --> 04:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
I'd rather have that beer now that's
 
04:20:29.189 --> 04:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
called temporal distancing so there
 
04:20:30.870 --> 04:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
there are ways you can actually use this
 
04:20:32.750 --> 04:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
technology in in in a way that's
 
04:20:34.309 --> 04:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
extremely productive and when I was out
 
04:20:36.670 --> 04:20:36.680 align:start position:0%
on the iTunes Store in addition to def
 
04:20:39.670 --> 04:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
finding face swapping a apps which are
 
04:20:42.149 --> 04:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
which are out there um there are also
 
04:20:44.030 --> 04:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
age progression apps that work about 100
 
04:20:45.550 --> 04:20:45.560 align:start position:0%
times better than the one that we did
 
04:20:49.469 --> 04:20:49.479 align:start position:0%
back in 2016 so the the technology has
 
04:20:51.510 --> 04:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
really really evolved and
 
04:20:56.149 --> 04:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:59.469 --> 04:20:59.479 align:start position:0%
yep represent
 
04:21:01.710 --> 04:21:01.720 align:start position:0%
Newman yeah I just have a question about
 
04:21:03.710 --> 04:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
line 19 which is the definition of the
 
04:21:06.710 --> 04:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
synthetic image and in your testimon
 
04:21:08.550 --> 04:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
you've often used Ai and it's really
 
04:21:10.950 --> 04:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
realistic would this law apply would it
 
04:21:14.189 --> 04:21:14.199 align:start position:0%
be a violation of the law no matter how
 
04:21:17.229 --> 04:21:17.239 align:start position:0%
you made it re a realistic image that is
 
04:21:19.510 --> 04:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
a false representation doesn't have to
 
04:21:21.469 --> 04:21:21.479 align:start position:0%
be done by AI you've said that but I
 
04:21:23.309 --> 04:21:23.319 align:start position:0%
don't know whether that that is true if
 
04:21:25.510 --> 04:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
you are very skilled at a program like
 
04:21:28.670 --> 04:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
like Photoshop or a non- AI program it
 
04:21:30.790 --> 04:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
would and and essentially it got to the
 
04:21:33.870 --> 04:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
same outcome um it would have the same
 
04:21:35.349 --> 04:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
it would have the same effect under the
 
04:21:37.109 --> 04:21:37.119 align:start position:0%
law which is why it's written that way
 
04:21:39.429 --> 04:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
and and by the way the the definitions
 
04:21:42.030 --> 04:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
were written with the help of the uh the
 
04:21:43.830 --> 04:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Coalition against Domestic
 
04:21:45.389 --> 04:21:45.399 align:start position:0%
and Sexual
 
04:21:48.309 --> 04:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
Violence thank
 
04:21:51.189 --> 04:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions thank you
 
04:21:51.199 --> 04:21:52.229 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions thank you
thank

04:21:52.229 --> 04:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:22:05.349 --> 04:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:05.359 --> 04:22:11.630 align:start position:0%
 
Enders

04:22:11.630 --> 04:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:13.109 --> 04:22:13.119 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Stephen Enders I'm an
 
04:22:14.630 --> 04:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
assistant County attorney in Marat
 
04:22:17.269 --> 04:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
County uh we do in fact support this
 
04:22:20.030 --> 04:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
bill I think that as technology advances
 
04:22:21.469 --> 04:22:21.479 align:start position:0%
you always end up in this situation
 
04:22:23.590 --> 04:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
where Bad actors use that technology to
 
04:22:26.109 --> 04:22:26.119 align:start position:0%
exploit people until the law eventually
 
04:22:29.469 --> 04:22:29.479 align:start position:0%
catches up and what this bill does is be
 
04:22:31.070 --> 04:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
proactive and sort of get ahead of that
 
04:22:33.830 --> 04:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
before it occurs so we do support it and
 
04:22:39.349 --> 04:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:39.359 --> 04:22:41.149 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:22:41.149 --> 04:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:22:44.070 --> 04:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
Jamon thank you Mr chairman um and thank
 
04:22:46.349 --> 04:22:46.359 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question attorney
 
04:22:49.870 --> 04:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
uh this bill deals with uh
 
04:22:49.880 --> 04:22:51.389 align:start position:0%
uh this bill deals with uh
non-consensual

04:22:51.389 --> 04:22:51.399 align:start position:0%
non-consensual
 
04:22:53.990 --> 04:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
dissemination do you believe that this
 
04:22:57.189 --> 04:22:57.199 align:start position:0%
same protection should be at some point
 
04:23:00.510 --> 04:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
extended to the protection of
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:08.710 --> 04:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
consent this would include miners within
 
04:23:12.469 --> 04:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
it as it is now if you were making um
 
04:23:15.189 --> 04:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
synthetic images of miners engaged in
 
04:23:17.630 --> 04:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
sexual activity that would run a foul of
 
04:23:19.830 --> 04:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
the child sexual abuse images statute
 
04:23:23.790 --> 04:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
which would be a a whole separate felony
 
04:23:23.800 --> 04:23:24.710 align:start position:0%
which would be a a whole separate felony
thank

04:23:24.710 --> 04:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:23:29.229 --> 04:23:29.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:32.109 --> 04:23:32.119 align:start position:0%
scitec I'm concerned that um it's a
 
04:23:34.710 --> 04:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
wonderful idea of course but can this is
 
04:23:36.990 --> 04:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
almost B with is Tech technology make
 
04:23:38.990 --> 04:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
this almost
 
04:23:41.229 --> 04:23:41.239 align:start position:0%
unenforcable because of how much can be
 
04:23:45.229 --> 04:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
done and anonymity and I I don't think
 
04:23:47.109 --> 04:23:47.119 align:start position:0%
necessarily technology makes it
 
04:23:49.189 --> 04:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
unenforceable um certainly I think there
 
04:23:53.710 --> 04:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
are ways to investigate crimes um you
 
04:23:57.070 --> 04:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
know I can for example if we had a
 
04:24:00.349 --> 04:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
suspect that we suspected was making um
 
04:24:02.309 --> 04:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
syn synthetic images and distributing
 
04:24:04.070 --> 04:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
them you could obtain a search warrant
 
04:24:05.870 --> 04:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
for that suspect's computer and that
 
04:24:08.590 --> 04:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
computer would show um artifacts which
 
04:24:10.870 --> 04:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
would lead you to believe that perhaps
 
04:24:13.670 --> 04:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
that was the computer used in the
 
04:24:17.670 --> 04:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
crime follow up I guess really what I'm
 
04:24:20.750 --> 04:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
saying is if one of these appears is
 
04:24:26.750 --> 04:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:29.309 --> 04:24:29.319 align:start position:0%
from I think it would be difficult
 
04:24:31.109 --> 04:24:31.119 align:start position:0%
certainly to trace where it came from
 
04:24:35.149 --> 04:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
unless you had um a
 
04:24:35.159 --> 04:24:36.870 align:start position:0%
unless you had um a
suspect

04:24:36.870 --> 04:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
suspect
 
04:24:38.710 --> 04:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
and that was my question kind of what I
 
04:24:41.469 --> 04:24:41.479 align:start position:0%
was asking represent Muse is is this is
 
04:24:43.830 --> 04:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
this more of a targeted at the Creator
 
04:24:47.750 --> 04:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
or possessor of these images um so in
 
04:24:50.189 --> 04:24:50.199 align:start position:0%
other words if someone's on a a message
 
04:24:53.269 --> 04:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
board or some site and gets a picture
 
04:24:54.830 --> 04:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
and sends it to his friend and say hey
 
04:24:56.189 --> 04:24:56.199 align:start position:0%
look at this this hilarious and their
 
04:24:57.590 --> 04:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
friend says hey that's offensive I'm
 
04:24:59.870 --> 04:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
going to report that he didn't create it
 
04:25:02.710 --> 04:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
so I think it's it's aimed at anyone
 
04:25:04.550 --> 04:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
who's disseminating it so anyone who
 
04:25:06.389 --> 04:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
passes it back and forth correct which I
 
04:25:10.229 --> 04:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
think the current statute 6449 a
 
04:25:12.790 --> 04:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
addresses anyone who
 
04:25:16.790 --> 04:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
disseminates um non-consensual sexual
 
04:25:18.750 --> 04:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
abuse images so whether that's the
 
04:25:20.870 --> 04:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
person that created it or whether that's
 
04:25:22.630 --> 04:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
the person who got it and is
 
04:25:26.070 --> 04:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
redistributing it um the current statute
 
04:25:27.750 --> 04:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
and this bill would Target both of those
 
04:25:30.109 --> 04:25:30.119 align:start position:0%
individuals I guess my question or maybe
 
04:25:30.119 --> 04:25:30.870 align:start position:0%
individuals I guess my question or maybe
my

04:25:30.870 --> 04:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:25:34.429 --> 04:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
concern some some places some
 
04:25:37.830 --> 04:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
celebrities May pose nude um and someone
 
04:25:39.349 --> 04:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
may share that with someone say hey look
 
04:25:41.790 --> 04:25:41.800 align:start position:0%
this is so and so Star right and it ends
 
04:25:43.670 --> 04:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
up being not a real one is that person
 
04:25:47.070 --> 04:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
now going to be culpable for this felony
 
04:25:48.750 --> 04:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
I mean do you have to prove that they
 
04:25:51.469 --> 04:25:51.479 align:start position:0%
knew it was a false image well you also
 
04:25:53.030 --> 04:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
have to show that they had the intent to
 
04:25:55.149 --> 04:25:55.159 align:start position:0%
harass intimidate threaten or course the
 
04:25:57.830 --> 04:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
depicted person
 
04:26:01.590 --> 04:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
okay okay that clears it up thank you
 
04:26:04.990 --> 04:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:07.950 --> 04:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
Balden I remember still you're a really
 
04:26:10.630 --> 04:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
entertaining testimony in this committee
 
04:26:15.630 --> 04:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
um the last bym on the bill to ban uh
 
04:26:18.630 --> 04:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
which passed and is now a law to ban um
 
04:26:21.070 --> 04:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
the non-con central sharing of digital
 
04:26:24.229 --> 04:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
private images is this is this bill
 
04:26:27.229 --> 04:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
essentially an expansion of that to
 
04:26:30.030 --> 04:26:30.040 align:start position:0%
include images that aren't in their
 
04:26:32.469 --> 04:26:32.479 align:start position:0%
original form I don't know if it's an
 
04:26:34.510 --> 04:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
expansion of that bill as much as an
 
04:26:37.030 --> 04:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
expansion of the the
 
04:26:39.870 --> 04:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
6449 the the quote unquote revenge porn
 
04:26:42.510 --> 04:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
statute the non-consensual dissemination
 
04:26:45.750 --> 04:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
of private sexual images um I think the
 
04:26:48.030 --> 04:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
con the concern obviously is
 
04:26:51.349 --> 04:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
that you know if you if there's a
 
04:26:53.309 --> 04:26:53.319 align:start position:0%
picture of you floating around that
 
04:26:55.670 --> 04:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
somebody has you're frightened that they
 
04:26:57.109 --> 04:26:57.119 align:start position:0%
may distribute
 
04:26:59.229 --> 04:26:59.239 align:start position:0%
it the fact of the matter is that
 
04:27:01.429 --> 04:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
technology exist now that that picture
 
04:27:04.070 --> 04:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
of you doesn't have to exist and someone
 
04:27:06.149 --> 04:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
can create it out of whole cloth and
 
04:27:08.269 --> 04:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
then distribute it and this would
 
04:27:15.070 --> 04:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:17.149 --> 04:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
concern see no further questions thank
 
04:27:18.349 --> 04:27:18.359 align:start position:0%

04:27:20.229 --> 04:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
testimony is there anyone else wishing
 
04:27:21.630 --> 04:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
to testify on this bill who has not
 
04:27:21.640 --> 04:27:23.309 align:start position:0%
to testify on this bill who has not

committee my name is Tamara Hester I'm a
 
04:27:51.149 --> 04:27:51.159 align:start position:0%
lieutenant with the New Hampshire State
 
04:27:53.189 --> 04:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
Police I'm the commander of the special
 
04:27:56.550 --> 04:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
investigations unit we investigate uh
 
04:27:59.309 --> 04:27:59.319 align:start position:0%
child exploitation offenses as well as
 
04:28:02.229 --> 04:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
conducting uh cyber crime investigations
 
04:28:04.830 --> 04:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
and doing digital forensics on digital
 
04:28:06.349 --> 04:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
evidence that comes in
 
04:28:08.590 --> 04:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of New Hampshire in
 
04:28:10.510 --> 04:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
terms of this particular bill um
 
04:28:13.349 --> 04:28:13.359 align:start position:0%
amending this existing statute will give
 
04:28:15.030 --> 04:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
law enforcement the clear ability to
 
04:28:16.670 --> 04:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
enforce the sharing of material in an
 
04:28:20.149 --> 04:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
online platform um the expansion of the
 
04:28:22.710 --> 04:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
definition of disseminate does actually
 
04:28:25.030 --> 04:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
assist in the current technological age
 
04:28:27.269 --> 04:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
that we live in it's no longer necessary
 
04:28:29.309 --> 04:28:29.319 align:start position:0%
to connect with individuals in person in
 
04:28:31.309 --> 04:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
order to share material it's as simple
 
04:28:33.189 --> 04:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
as a click of a button to generate as
 
04:28:35.030 --> 04:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
well as share an image across multiple
 
04:28:37.109 --> 04:28:37.119 align:start position:0%
platforms and from there the image can
 
04:28:39.710 --> 04:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
be circulated around the world with the
 
04:28:41.109 --> 04:28:41.119 align:start position:0%
advancement of the digital age it's
 
04:28:42.670 --> 04:28:42.680 align:start position:0%
created new forms of harassment and
 
04:28:45.030 --> 04:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
cyber bullying since the statute was
 
04:28:47.269 --> 04:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
enacted technology has evolved currently
 
04:28:48.830 --> 04:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
there are numerous software programs
 
04:28:50.990 --> 04:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
available most of them free that can
 
04:28:53.030 --> 04:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
generate realistic images or videos that
 
04:28:54.910 --> 04:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
are virtually indistinguishable from a
 
04:28:54.920 --> 04:28:55.750 align:start position:0%
are virtually indistinguishable from a
real

04:28:55.750 --> 04:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
real
 
04:28:57.950 --> 04:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
person there have been many instances
 
04:28:59.790 --> 04:28:59.800 align:start position:0%
across the country as well as ones that
 
04:29:01.149 --> 04:29:01.159 align:start position:0%
I can attest to in the state of New
 
04:29:02.910 --> 04:29:02.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire of individuals utilizing
 
04:29:04.830 --> 04:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence to create fake
 
04:29:06.590 --> 04:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
pornographic images and share them
 
04:29:09.070 --> 04:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
across multiple social media platforms
 
04:29:10.590 --> 04:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
many of them in a fashion which is
 
04:29:12.990 --> 04:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
considered revenge porn these images can
 
04:29:15.590 --> 04:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
be of both adults and children sharing
 
04:29:16.830 --> 04:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
of an image that is nearly
 
04:29:18.710 --> 04:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
indistinguishable from a real person and
 
04:29:20.309 --> 04:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
shares the characteristics of that
 
04:29:22.269 --> 04:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
person can have a crippling effect on an
 
04:29:23.790 --> 04:29:23.800 align:start position:0%
individual's life and to create a
 
04:29:25.910 --> 04:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
lasting stigma as is difficult to
 
04:29:27.269 --> 04:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
completely remove something from the
 
04:29:30.070 --> 04:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
internet once it's there defendants are
 
04:29:32.109 --> 04:29:32.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes able to avoid being criminally
 
04:29:33.910 --> 04:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
charged by taking images of those real
 
04:29:35.389 --> 04:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
people and altering them in a computer
 
04:29:38.030 --> 04:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
gener ated
 
04:29:40.229 --> 04:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
fashion this creates an endless
 
04:29:43.109 --> 04:29:43.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity to victimize
 
04:29:45.269 --> 04:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
individuals um and I just I wanted to
 
04:29:46.429 --> 04:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
address one of the questions that came
 
04:29:47.590 --> 04:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
up from other one of the other

Representatives I apologize because I
 
04:29:51.429 --> 04:29:51.439 align:start position:0%
don't remember who asked it about um how
 
04:29:54.510 --> 04:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
to trace back once the images have been
 
04:29:56.269 --> 04:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
disseminated I think the question was
 
04:29:58.510 --> 04:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
answered about um the the intent of the
 
04:30:01.429 --> 04:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
statute of dissemination but um if if
 
04:30:04.229 --> 04:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
the victim reports and they know the
 
04:30:06.309 --> 04:30:06.319 align:start position:0%
account that it comes from enforcement
 
04:30:09.309 --> 04:30:09.319 align:start position:0%
can then um as as the uh County attorney
 
04:30:11.950 --> 04:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
indicated we can then uh take that
 
04:30:14.309 --> 04:30:14.319 align:start position:0%
account information and subsequently
 
04:30:16.710 --> 04:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
conduct legal process in order to
 
04:30:20.070 --> 04:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:23.429 --> 04:30:23.439 align:start position:0%

place of Representative uh Gabby Gman

wanted to respectfully let you know that
 
04:31:37.550 --> 04:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
is my intention for hb5 Dean uh 87 FN to
 
04:31:40.030 --> 04:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
request an itl from the criminal justice
 
04:31:42.830 --> 04:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
and Public Safety Committee on Friday
 
04:31:44.429 --> 04:31:44.439 align:start position:0%
unless there is testimony that comes
 
04:31:45.790 --> 04:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
forward that would demonstrate that
 
04:31:48.109 --> 04:31:48.119 align:start position:0%
there is still a need after much
 
04:31:49.710 --> 04:31:49.720 align:start position:0%
research and discussion with State
 
04:31:52.030 --> 04:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
Police ACLU student transportation
 
04:31:54.269 --> 04:31:54.279 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and vendors surveillance
 
04:31:57.070 --> 04:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
vendors disability stakeholders it has
 
04:31:59.550 --> 04:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
come to our attention that school buses
 
04:32:01.670 --> 04:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire including the big buses
 
04:32:04.149 --> 04:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
and the smaller buses are not required
 
04:32:06.630 --> 04:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
to have video surveillance a mandate it
 
04:32:08.269 --> 04:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
was our belief that this legislation
 
04:32:10.030 --> 04:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
would provide equity and safety on
 
04:32:12.750 --> 04:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
special education buses when we first
 
04:32:15.710 --> 04:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
put this legislation in in 2018 there
 
04:32:17.790 --> 04:32:17.800 align:start position:0%
was a different need at that time the
 
04:32:19.790 --> 04:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
conquered School District was still not
 
04:32:21.670 --> 04:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
requiring surveillance for all their
 
04:32:24.550 --> 04:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
contracts with bus providers that is no
 
04:32:27.510 --> 04:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
longer the case in 2024 without a
 
04:32:30.030 --> 04:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
mandate uh this is under local control
 
04:32:31.990 --> 04:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
and contract negotiations for school
 
04:32:34.469 --> 04:32:34.479 align:start position:0%
districts and transportation providers
 
04:32:35.950 --> 04:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
both parties have ackn knowled the
 
04:32:37.830 --> 04:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
importance and currently there have been
 
04:32:41.149 --> 04:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
no issues reported uh and uh there's a
 
04:32:43.469 --> 04:32:43.479 align:start position:0%
belief that 99% of Transportation
 
04:32:45.109 --> 04:32:45.119 align:start position:0%
vendors and school districts are
 
04:32:47.670 --> 04:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
requiring this already the Hudson New
 
04:32:49.590 --> 04:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire case had video surveillance on
 
04:32:52.590 --> 04:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
the bus Which captured uh abuse uh the
 
04:32:54.189 --> 04:32:54.199 align:start position:0%
Mandate from the state would take away
 
04:32:55.950 --> 04:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
the local control that has caught up
 
04:32:58.349 --> 04:32:58.359 align:start position:0%
with many public safety standards and
 
04:33:01.229 --> 04:33:01.239 align:start position:0%
talking with Trooper Greg Hildreth from
 
04:33:03.149 --> 04:33:03.159 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety that handles
 
04:33:05.789 --> 04:33:05.799 align:start position:0%
Pupil Transportation he also found
 
04:33:07.230 --> 04:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
another direct conflict with the
 
04:33:09.189 --> 04:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
wiretapping statute involving School
 
04:33:11.869 --> 04:33:11.879 align:start position:0%
recordings which I've attached below
 
04:33:13.990 --> 04:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
Trooper hildr has not heard of any
 
04:33:15.629 --> 04:33:15.639 align:start position:0%
situations involving Pupil
 
04:33:17.390 --> 04:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
Transportation that didn't have
 
04:33:19.869 --> 04:33:19.879 align:start position:0%
surveillance since the smaller buses are
 
04:33:21.670 --> 04:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
included under the definition of school
 
04:33:25.269 --> 04:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
buses if a school requires surveillance
 
04:33:28.109 --> 04:33:28.119 align:start position:0%
uh for a contract the smaller buses are
 
04:33:31.070 --> 04:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
included the issue came up uh because of
 
04:33:33.789 --> 04:33:33.799 align:start position:0%
minivans uh and vans and Trooper
 
04:33:36.670 --> 04:33:36.680 align:start position:0%
Hildreth believes that most vendors want
 
04:33:39.590 --> 04:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
this protection as do schools uh and are
 
04:33:41.949 --> 04:33:41.959 align:start position:0%
using cameras for their own liability
 
04:33:44.670 --> 04:33:44.680 align:start position:0%
purposes I appreciate your time and
 
04:33:46.990 --> 04:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
attention to this request for an itl is
 
04:33:49.590 --> 04:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor it appears the issue
 
04:33:51.349 --> 04:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
has already resolved itself with
 
04:33:54.670 --> 04:33:54.680 align:start position:0%
technology time and local attention to
 
04:33:57.230 --> 04:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
safety um see you in committee and if
 
04:33:58.910 --> 04:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
you have any questions feel free to
 
04:34:04.269 --> 04:34:04.279 align:start position:0%

05:31:52.510 --> 05:31:52.520 align:start position:0%
provisions in the bill uh would set the
 
05:31:56.230 --> 05:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
limit for a jury trial at $20 and that
 
05:31:59.470 --> 05:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
is so low that it would clog our courts
 
05:32:02.310 --> 05:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
and all the court system definitely
 
05:32:04.788 --> 05:32:04.798 align:start position:0%

um part of The Whistleblower protection
 
05:33:29.430 --> 05:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
even if they aren't aware that they are
 
05:33:31.150 --> 05:33:31.160 align:start position:0%
part of the program it's just too vague
 
05:33:34.190 --> 05:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
and not workable in its current form
 
05:33:35.510 --> 05:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you who made the
 
05:33:38.030 --> 05:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
second I did would you like speak to you
 
05:33:42.708 --> 05:33:42.718 align:start position:0%
a second I I agree that that it um Lees
 
05:33:44.470 --> 05:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
people who may not know they're in The
 
05:33:47.628 --> 05:33:47.638 align:start position:0%
Whistleblower program uh offering to
 
05:33:49.190 --> 05:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
help a police officer because they say
 
05:33:51.430 --> 05:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
hey we're just looking for so and so if
 
05:33:54.070 --> 05:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
they just say oh I'm helping the police
 
05:33:56.628 --> 05:33:56.638 align:start position:0%
they're down the street they could
 
05:33:59.150 --> 05:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
become a victim of a crime they could be
 
05:34:01.310 --> 05:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
a criminal and I I think it's just way
 
05:34:02.470 --> 05:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
too vague
 
05:34:06.750 --> 05:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
and would lead to a lot of chaos thank
 
05:34:11.030 --> 05:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
you um I I'm just going to add I I fully
 
05:34:13.670 --> 05:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
endorse the idea of giving protection to
 
05:34:17.390 --> 05:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
actual whistleblowers for their
 
05:34:20.310 --> 05:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
actual fact that they are whistleblowers
 
05:34:21.788 --> 05:34:21.798 align:start position:0%
but this doesn't
 
05:34:25.230 --> 05:34:25.240 align:start position:0%
specify whistleblowers for the crime so
 
05:34:27.590 --> 05:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
if the police said hey I'm looking for
 
05:34:30.230 --> 05:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
so and so because I want to ask some
 
05:34:31.510 --> 05:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
questions I think they may have killed
 
05:34:33.590 --> 05:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
someone and you cooperate with the
 
05:34:35.788 --> 05:34:35.798 align:start position:0%
police and they make an arrest on that
 
05:34:37.270 --> 05:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
you could be charged because they were
 
05:34:39.230 --> 05:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
also a whistleblower it doesn't specify
 
05:34:41.628 --> 05:34:41.638 align:start position:0%
it's very vague so it's it's a dangerous
 
05:34:44.430 --> 05:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
Bill vague bills are dangerous further
 
05:34:46.708 --> 05:34:46.718 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none I ask clerk to

absolutely um overstated it it just it
 
05:38:09.548 --> 05:38:09.558 align:start position:0%
could um exclude things like driver's
 
05:38:10.948 --> 05:38:10.958 align:start position:0%

discussion representative
 
05:38:30.470 --> 05:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
scitec the W the future I'm wondering if
 
05:38:32.470 --> 05:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
interim study might not I'm not going to
 
05:38:34.150 --> 05:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
push for it but it seems like interim
 
05:38:36.230 --> 05:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
study might make more sense there is
 
05:38:39.150 --> 05:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
some room for digital
 
05:38:43.230 --> 05:38:43.240 align:start position:0%
inut information being used and I hate
 
05:38:46.390 --> 05:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
to just say no but I'm not going to push
 
05:38:48.628 --> 05:38:48.638 align:start position:0%
it either I'm just making the statement
 
05:38:50.868 --> 05:38:50.878 align:start position:0%
your input is well taken and I I agree
 
05:38:52.948 --> 05:38:52.958 align:start position:0%
with you however with the number of
 
05:38:54.670 --> 05:38:54.680 align:start position:0%
bills we have in the short time we have
 
05:38:57.390 --> 05:38:57.400 align:start position:0%
with the campaign season coming up um I
 
05:38:58.990 --> 05:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
think that the the onus would have been
 
05:39:00.070 --> 05:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
on the
 
05:39:03.750 --> 05:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
on the uh sponsor to take that time but
 
05:39:05.990 --> 05:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it will be back to your point
 
05:39:07.590 --> 05:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
um seeing no further discussion I would
 
05:39:09.670 --> 05:39:09.680 align:start position:0%

House Bill 169 19 and recognize
 
05:40:02.990 --> 05:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative stone for a motion Mr
 
05:40:05.868 --> 05:40:05.878 align:start position:0%
chair I recommend making a motion to
 
05:40:09.590 --> 05:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
itl can I get a second second second by
 
05:40:11.548 --> 05:40:11.558 align:start position:0%
representative appr would you like to
 
05:40:13.948 --> 05:40:13.958 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion Mr chair I would uh
 
05:40:16.510 --> 05:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee met we uh unanimously
 
05:40:18.990 --> 05:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
voted itl 4 to zero there was no one
 
05:40:20.590 --> 05:40:20.600 align:start position:0%
from the public who came to speak the
 
05:40:22.750 --> 05:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor was not there to speak either uh
 
05:40:24.230 --> 05:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
one of the big issues that the committee
 
05:40:25.910 --> 05:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
felt is that the uh language and
 
05:40:28.350 --> 05:40:28.360 align:start position:0%
redefining was very conflicting and very
 
05:40:30.708 --> 05:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
problematic for the entire bill with
 
05:40:32.590 --> 05:40:32.600 align:start position:0%
also conflicting with other parts of New
 
05:40:36.030 --> 05:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statutes uh this uh entire
 
05:40:39.030 --> 05:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
bill was written in such a way that it's
 
05:40:41.948 --> 05:40:41.958 align:start position:0%
really hard to follow and creates uh
 
05:40:43.910 --> 05:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
numerous problems in addition to
 
05:40:46.190 --> 05:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
operationally uh providing individuals
 
05:40:48.070 --> 05:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
who are released from custody but are
 
05:40:49.270 --> 05:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
still in State's custody because they
 
05:40:50.948 --> 05:40:50.958 align:start position:0%
still have a pending sentence to have
 
05:40:52.230 --> 05:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
firearms is not in the interest of
 
05:40:52.240 --> 05:40:53.350 align:start position:0%
firearms is not in the interest of
Public

05:40:53.350 --> 05:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
Public
 
05:40:56.030 --> 05:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
Safety thank you um representative PR do
 
05:40:59.788 --> 05:40:59.798 align:start position:0%
you agree unintended consequences
 
05:41:02.830 --> 05:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
abound in this bill so we don't have
 
05:41:04.670 --> 05:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
time to fix it and the sponsor didn't
 
05:41:07.390 --> 05:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
seem like he wanted to fix it so I think
 
05:41:09.670 --> 05:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
we should just let it go further
 
05:41:13.070 --> 05:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
discussion representative s thank you I
 
05:41:15.030 --> 05:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
I agree with the motion to itl I would
 
05:41:17.788 --> 05:41:17.798 align:start position:0%
say however I do believe that it's too
 
05:41:19.788 --> 05:41:19.798 align:start position:0%
late this session but for uh next year
 
05:41:20.990 --> 05:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
for those of us who are reelected I
 
05:41:22.788 --> 05:41:22.798 align:start position:0%
would love to bring forward a bill to
 
05:41:25.548 --> 05:41:25.558 align:start position:0%
give the right to vote back to all
 
05:41:28.670 --> 05:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
people okay representative Murray I was
 
05:41:30.948 --> 05:41:30.958 align:start position:0%
going to share what representative celix
 
05:41:33.830 --> 05:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
shared that I do support um giving um
 
05:41:36.270 --> 05:41:36.280 align:start position:0%
incarcerated people the right to vote um
 
05:41:37.990 --> 05:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
but it seems like it was unworkable in
 
05:41:40.030 --> 05:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
the time we have with this bill to limit
 
05:41:43.910 --> 05:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
it to just that scope thank you further

05:44:32.590 --> 05:44:32.600 align:start position:0%
representative PR to make a motion I
 
05:44:36.070 --> 05:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
move itl I'll second seconded by
 
05:44:37.310 --> 05:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
representative har GA right would you
 
05:44:38.150 --> 05:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your motion
 
05:44:41.310 --> 05:44:41.320 align:start position:0%
representative Pro I would so we heard
 
05:44:44.190 --> 05:44:44.200 align:start position:0%
that as the bill as the law stands right
 
05:44:47.390 --> 05:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
now there are plenty of protections for
 
05:44:51.030 --> 05:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
people playing jokes having
 
05:44:54.190 --> 05:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
Novelties uh but there is
 
05:44:56.788 --> 05:44:56.798 align:start position:0%
also which I think needs to be there
 
05:44:59.230 --> 05:44:59.240 align:start position:0%
that if somebody is definitely placed
 
05:45:01.628 --> 05:45:01.638 align:start position:0%
something with an intent to
 
05:45:05.510 --> 05:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
cause chaos dismay
 
05:45:07.628 --> 05:45:07.638 align:start position:0%
whatever to have people think that it's
 
05:45:11.070 --> 05:45:11.080 align:start position:0%
a real explosive is an issue and there
 
05:45:13.788 --> 05:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
needs to be protection of the public
 
05:45:16.390 --> 05:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
against that because people start
 
05:45:18.910 --> 05:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
running away from one of these things
 
05:45:22.750 --> 05:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
people get hurt all that stuff so I
 
05:45:25.150 --> 05:45:25.160 align:start position:0%
don't think we need to repeal this I
 
05:45:27.430 --> 05:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
think the way the law stands
 
05:45:29.468 --> 05:45:29.478 align:start position:0%
is just fine
 
05:45:31.310 --> 05:45:31.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative GA would you
 
05:45:33.390 --> 05:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your second no I think
 
05:45:35.270 --> 05:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
he did a great job good further
 
05:45:38.310 --> 05:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
discussion the quot seeing Oh
 
05:45:38.320 --> 05:45:40.910 align:start position:0%
discussion the quot seeing Oh
representative

05:45:40.910 --> 05:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:43.948 --> 05:45:43.958 align:start position:0%
scitech de over about
 
05:45:43.958 --> 05:45:45.948 align:start position:0%
scitech de over about
intent

05:45:45.948 --> 05:45:45.958 align:start position:0%
intent
 
05:45:49.230 --> 05:45:49.240 align:start position:0%
so I would add that the um the the there
 
05:45:51.868 --> 05:45:51.878 align:start position:0%
was an example given of somebody who was
 
05:45:53.948 --> 05:45:53.958 align:start position:0%
over zealously prosecuted or threatened
 
05:45:55.590 --> 05:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
with prosecution because they had a what
 
05:45:57.868 --> 05:45:57.878 align:start position:0%
was obviously a gag that's the reason we
 
05:45:59.948 --> 05:45:59.958 align:start position:0%
have judges if if a officer were to
 
05:46:02.750 --> 05:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
bring a a spous charge like that the
 
05:46:04.628 --> 05:46:04.638 align:start position:0%
court would look would frown upon that
 
05:46:07.628 --> 05:46:07.638 align:start position:0%
I'm quite sure um having said that no
 
05:46:09.430 --> 05:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
further discussion I would ask cl to
 
05:46:11.670 --> 05:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
call the RO motion of floor is itl oh
 
05:46:13.230 --> 05:46:13.240 align:start position:0%

your motion represent sure uh just
 
05:47:34.830 --> 05:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
because we have the ability to build
 
05:47:36.670 --> 05:47:36.680 align:start position:0%
something doesn't mean we should just
 
05:47:38.548 --> 05:47:38.558 align:start position:0%
because we have the ability to legalize
 
05:47:41.510 --> 05:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
something doesn't mean we should uh this
 
05:47:44.948 --> 05:47:44.958 align:start position:0%
bill is the uh the king of the
 
05:47:48.510 --> 05:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences Bill bills uh
 
05:47:51.510 --> 05:47:51.520 align:start position:0%

don't believe a AI should be used to
 
05:47:59.990 --> 05:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
kill anybody uh for any reason so I
 
05:48:01.590 --> 05:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
don't think this bill is necessary at
 
05:48:06.190 --> 05:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
this time thank you um and so my hopes
 
05:48:10.430 --> 05:48:10.440 align:start position:0%

public hearing on House Bill 1599 and I

open a executive session House Bill 1237
 
05:49:10.948 --> 05:49:10.958 align:start position:0%
and recognize representative Stone to
 
05:49:13.190 --> 05:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
make a motion Mr chair I make a motion
 
05:49:17.430 --> 05:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
to itl um second seconded when we open
 
05:49:19.788 --> 05:49:19.798 align:start position:0%
the discussion can bring it up um
 
05:49:22.868 --> 05:49:22.878 align:start position:0%
somebody else wants to no um someone had
 
05:49:24.390 --> 05:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
asked to introduce an amendment well
 
05:49:25.708 --> 05:49:25.718 align:start position:0%
let's have the discussion on the motion
 
05:49:29.310 --> 05:49:29.320 align:start position:0%
on the floor first um representative
 
05:49:30.350 --> 05:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
Stone would you like to speak to your
 
05:49:32.548 --> 05:49:32.558 align:start position:0%
motion Mr chairman I would uh this bill
 
05:49:33.948 --> 05:49:33.958 align:start position:0%
is discriminatory in nature for
 
05:49:36.310 --> 05:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities it impedes on local
 
05:49:39.190 --> 05:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
control uh it's not in the interest of
 
05:49:41.030 --> 05:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
Public Safety and it seems to exclude
 
05:49:42.990 --> 05:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
the largest agency that uses ghost cars
 
05:49:44.150 --> 05:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
in the state of New
 
05:49:46.110 --> 05:49:46.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representative BR would you
 
05:49:48.030 --> 05:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
like to speak to you a
 
05:49:52.468 --> 05:49:52.478 align:start position:0%
second I will but you won't like it
 
05:49:55.190 --> 05:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
um to me this
 
05:49:58.150 --> 05:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
was put in by somebody who just doesn't
 
05:50:00.548 --> 05:50:00.558 align:start position:0%
want to get a speeding ticket so I would
 
05:50:02.548 --> 05:50:02.558 align:start position:0%
suggest you buy a radar detector instead
 
05:50:06.628 --> 05:50:06.638 align:start position:0%
of putting in a bill like this
 
05:50:10.270 --> 05:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
um because we use the police use those
 
05:50:13.590 --> 05:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
vehicles to patrol for people who are
 
05:50:15.948 --> 05:50:15.958 align:start position:0%
driving reckless and protect Public
 
05:50:20.070 --> 05:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
Safety and if we don't have that Tool uh
 
05:50:22.868 --> 05:50:22.878 align:start position:0%
they can't do their job quite as well
 
05:50:25.110 --> 05:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
all righty um representative Murray
 
05:50:27.830 --> 05:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak on discussion
 
05:50:30.030 --> 05:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just wanted to let
 
05:50:31.670 --> 05:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
members of the committee know that I've
 
05:50:33.510 --> 05:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
given you each a copy of an amendment
 
05:50:35.548 --> 05:50:35.558 align:start position:0%
that I submitted to OS that narrows the
 
05:50:39.110 --> 05:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
scope of the bill um ensures that uh any
 
05:50:41.390 --> 05:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
Vehicles purchased on or after January
 
05:50:43.670 --> 05:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
1st 2025 would be marked and labeled
 
05:50:46.110 --> 05:50:46.120 align:start position:0%
identifying it as a police vehicle um
 
05:50:47.468 --> 05:50:47.478 align:start position:0%
and that would only be applicable to
 
05:50:49.670 --> 05:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
those explicitly performing traffic law
 
05:50:52.468 --> 05:50:52.478 align:start position:0%
enforcement and any officer who is in an
 
05:50:55.510 --> 05:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
unmarked vehicle and observes um an
 
05:50:57.628 --> 05:50:57.638 align:start position:0%
offens of reckless driving uh potential
 
05:51:00.230 --> 05:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
DUI or or any other threat to Public
 
05:51:02.430 --> 05:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
Safety would still be able to make a
 
05:51:05.868 --> 05:51:05.878 align:start position:0%
traffic stop um under this
 
05:51:08.708 --> 05:51:08.718 align:start position:0%
amendment so should the motion on the fa
 
05:51:11.310 --> 05:51:11.320 align:start position:0%
floor fail uh represent Murray tends to
 
05:51:14.468 --> 05:51:14.478 align:start position:0%
offer this amendment um
 
05:51:17.590 --> 05:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
discussion representative um sing first
 
05:51:22.868 --> 05:51:22.878 align:start position:0%
and bden thank you um so I think that
 
05:51:24.628 --> 05:51:24.638 align:start position:0%
I'm very conflicted on the bill I I
 
05:51:26.830 --> 05:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate the intent of the person who
 
05:51:29.270 --> 05:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
wrote it and hope that they will work
 
05:51:30.948 --> 05:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
with law enforcement
 
05:51:33.350 --> 05:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
agencies um to bring something better
 
05:51:35.910 --> 05:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
back next year um I think one of the
 
05:51:37.468 --> 05:51:37.478 align:start position:0%
things that's really complicated is
 
05:51:39.390 --> 05:51:39.400 align:start position:0%
especially in small towns there are
 
05:51:41.788 --> 05:51:41.798 align:start position:0%
often very few vehicles and they may be
 
05:51:44.670 --> 05:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
used for all sorts of purposes where it
 
05:51:46.788 --> 05:51:46.798 align:start position:0%
may not be practicable for them to have
 
05:51:48.708 --> 05:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
one designated specifically to traffic
 
05:51:51.030 --> 05:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement and others for various
 
05:51:52.708 --> 05:51:52.718 align:start position:0%
undercover operations and sorts of
 
05:51:54.750 --> 05:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
things and so to me it feels like
 
05:51:56.948 --> 05:51:56.958 align:start position:0%
there's too many complexities that are
 
05:51:59.868 --> 05:51:59.878 align:start position:0%
not resolved and as much as I appreciate
 
05:52:01.310 --> 05:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
the intent and think it should actually
 
05:52:04.750 --> 05:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
apply to State Vehicles as well um it
 
05:52:06.830 --> 05:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
there's too much there there aren't
 
05:52:06.840 --> 05:52:10.070 align:start position:0%
there's too much there there aren't
enough

05:52:10.070 --> 05:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:12.750 --> 05:52:12.760 align:start position:0%
nuances on the topic of Public Safety
 
05:52:14.310 --> 05:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
one time I was paying attention I
 
05:52:16.708 --> 05:52:16.718 align:start position:0%
remember that we received testimony from
 
05:52:20.030 --> 05:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
a trooper who said that the presence of
 
05:52:22.468 --> 05:52:22.478 align:start position:0%
marked police vehicles has a positive
 
05:52:25.150 --> 05:52:25.160 align:start position:0%
effect on driver behavior um a
 
05:52:28.468 --> 05:52:28.478 align:start position:0%
demonstrably positive effect and I think
 
05:52:31.310 --> 05:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
I'd rather have fewer people dying in
 
05:52:34.510 --> 05:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
car accidents in our state than more
 
05:52:36.628 --> 05:52:36.638 align:start position:0%
tickets thank you I believe he said
 
05:52:38.230 --> 05:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
there was a study that showed they
 
05:52:39.468 --> 05:52:39.478 align:start position:0%
actually had numbers I don't know what
 
05:52:41.230 --> 05:52:41.240 align:start position:0%
they were representative
 
05:52:43.628 --> 05:52:43.638 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair I just forgot
 
05:52:45.990 --> 05:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
to know as I had sent to the committee
 
05:52:48.990 --> 05:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
the other states that have um similar
 
05:52:51.830 --> 05:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
laws in place California DC Idaho
 
05:52:54.628 --> 05:52:54.638 align:start position:0%
Montana New Mexico Ohio Oklahoma and
 
05:52:57.030 --> 05:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
South Carolina all requireed that
 
05:52:59.990 --> 05:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle uh police Les always be marked
 
05:53:02.468 --> 05:53:02.478 align:start position:0%
um and then states that have uh laws
 
05:53:04.670 --> 05:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
similar to the amendment I'm I hope to
 
05:53:07.070 --> 05:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
present are Connecticut Georgia Michigan
 
05:53:09.230 --> 05:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
New Jersey New York North Carolina
 
05:53:11.390 --> 05:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
Oregon Pennsylvania Washington and
 
05:53:15.070 --> 05:53:15.080 align:start position:0%
Wyoming um so just to name that um that
 
05:53:16.390 --> 05:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be the first by any means
 
05:53:18.230 --> 05:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
many states have similar
 
05:53:20.910 --> 05:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
laws definitely further discussion
 
05:53:20.920 --> 05:53:22.750 align:start position:0%
laws definitely further discussion
representative

05:53:22.750 --> 05:53:22.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:53:26.350 --> 05:53:26.360 align:start position:0%
PR representative Sy I must have missed
 
05:53:30.030 --> 05:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
his intent so what was the intent of the
 
05:53:33.350 --> 05:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
bill that you perceived because I
 
05:53:34.628 --> 05:53:34.638 align:start position:0%
perceived that he was looking to get out
 
05:53:36.548 --> 05:53:36.558 align:start position:0%
of speeding tickets and red light
 
05:53:40.468 --> 05:53:40.478 align:start position:0%
tickets by unmarking by marking police
 
05:53:43.830 --> 05:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
cars I don't recall um if he did say his
 
05:53:46.310 --> 05:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
intent but represent thank you I I
 
05:53:49.628 --> 05:53:49.638 align:start position:0%
interpreted his bill to to mean that he
 
05:53:51.150 --> 05:53:51.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to prevent situations like the
 
05:53:52.670 --> 05:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
one where representative new was in
 
05:53:55.230 --> 05:53:55.240 align:start position:0%
where people who were in plane clothes
 
05:53:58.670 --> 05:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
and not in marked Vehicles were um
 
05:54:01.190 --> 05:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
potentially stopping people and and the
 
05:54:02.270 --> 05:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
difficulty with
 
05:54:04.628 --> 05:54:04.638 align:start position:0%
identifying um police in certain
 
05:54:07.070 --> 05:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
circumstances and having been in similar
 
05:54:10.990 --> 05:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances myself um I I recognize
 
05:54:14.110 --> 05:54:14.120 align:start position:0%
the terror of having someone having
 
05:54:15.390 --> 05:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
flashing lights behind you and not being
 
05:54:16.788 --> 05:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
able to determine whether or not they
 
05:54:18.230 --> 05:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
are in fact police in the days before
 
05:54:19.910 --> 05:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
there were cell phones because I'm you
 
05:54:22.468 --> 05:54:22.478 align:start position:0%
know old enough for for that I will say
 
05:54:24.628 --> 05:54:24.638 align:start position:0%
um as a former resident of Maryland um
 
05:54:27.070 --> 05:54:27.080 align:start position:0%
the state police there often took uh no
 
05:54:29.468 --> 05:54:29.478 align:start position:0%
longer usable um state trooper vehicles
 
05:54:31.750 --> 05:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
and slice them in half and put the half
 
05:54:33.590 --> 05:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
on different parts of the highway system
 
05:54:34.788 --> 05:54:34.798 align:start position:0%
so people would drive up and it would
 
05:54:37.230 --> 05:54:37.240 align:start position:0%
appear there was a State Trooper there
 
05:54:39.150 --> 05:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
um just something to keep in mind and
 
05:54:41.430 --> 05:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
all the traffic would go from 95 miles
 
05:54:45.070 --> 05:54:45.080 align:start position:0%
an hour down to like 55 very quickly in
 
05:54:47.310 --> 05:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
those sections um and then you know
 
05:54:48.788 --> 05:54:48.798 align:start position:0%
you'd get past it and realize the other
 
05:54:51.310 --> 05:54:51.320 align:start position:0%
side was a wood frame I would add that
 
05:54:53.430 --> 05:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
if someone were to bring a bill and they
 
05:54:56.750 --> 05:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
were to actually do a study and and show
 
05:54:59.110 --> 05:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
how many people were stopped by unmarked
 
05:55:02.590 --> 05:55:02.600 align:start position:0%
vehicles and and to and if it were
 
05:55:04.788 --> 05:55:04.798 align:start position:0%
adversely impacting the public versus
 
05:55:07.110 --> 05:55:07.120 align:start position:0%
how many vehicles how many accidents it
 
05:55:09.468 --> 05:55:09.478 align:start position:0%
saved I'd like to see numbers more than
 
05:55:11.868 --> 05:55:11.878 align:start position:0%
just you know I don't like the idea of
 
05:55:15.070 --> 05:55:15.080 align:start position:0%
of sneaky cars represent man thank you
 
05:55:18.670 --> 05:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so a couple things here the the
 
05:55:19.670 --> 05:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
first thing I want everyone to
 
05:55:20.948 --> 05:55:20.958 align:start position:0%
understand is is unmarked vehicles are
 
05:55:22.628 --> 05:55:22.638 align:start position:0%
not the same as ghost Vehicles ghost
 
05:55:24.548 --> 05:55:24.558 align:start position:0%
vehicles are marked Vehicles they're
 
05:55:26.230 --> 05:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
just subtle and actually they're more
 
05:55:28.350 --> 05:55:28.360 align:start position:0%
visible at night than a marked as you
 
05:55:30.548 --> 05:55:30.558 align:start position:0%
would say police car uh some of marked
 
05:55:32.230 --> 05:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
police cars aren't don't have reflective
 
05:55:33.990 --> 05:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
lettering on it but it's they different
 
05:55:35.310 --> 05:55:35.320 align:start position:0%
color so you can clearly see it during
 
05:55:37.270 --> 05:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
the day but at night these ghost cars
 
05:55:39.548 --> 05:55:39.558 align:start position:0%
are more visible they're fully marked
 
05:55:41.868 --> 05:55:41.878 align:start position:0%
it's just a more subtle subdued marking
 
05:55:44.150 --> 05:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
on the side uh people that are operating
 
05:55:47.948 --> 05:55:47.958 align:start position:0%
those are in uniform generally so the
 
05:55:50.868 --> 05:55:50.878 align:start position:0%
issue I have um with that is the
 
05:55:52.310 --> 05:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
unmarked Vehicles where it's a plain
 
05:55:53.590 --> 05:55:53.600 align:start position:0%
closed person they're not not really
 
05:55:55.270 --> 05:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
doing traffic enforcement and if you
 
05:55:57.030 --> 05:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
want to make a a bill that says if
 
05:55:58.468 --> 05:55:58.478 align:start position:0%
you're going to do traffic enfor you
 
05:56:00.628 --> 05:56:00.638 align:start position:0%
must be in full uniform that I could
 
05:56:03.110 --> 05:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
accept uh to alleviate that however by
 
05:56:05.948 --> 05:56:05.958 align:start position:0%
today's in today there's cell phones you
 
05:56:07.070 --> 05:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to drive to the police
 
05:56:08.868 --> 05:56:08.878 align:start position:0%
station slowly obey the laws call
 
05:56:10.868 --> 05:56:10.878 align:start position:0%
dispatch you can't get any trouble for
 
05:56:13.590 --> 05:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
that because for that reason um another
 
05:56:16.310 --> 05:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
thing is we're we're we're micromanaging
 
05:56:18.708 --> 05:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
as a state legislature our local police
 
05:56:20.708 --> 05:56:20.718 align:start position:0%
Chiefs they should have the authority to
 
05:56:23.868 --> 05:56:23.878 align:start position:0%
operate their Department as they see fit
 
05:56:25.750 --> 05:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
whatever Vehicles they see they they
 
05:56:27.990 --> 05:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
deem to be most useful we should should
 
05:56:31.390 --> 05:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
allow them to use them on the on the uh
 
05:56:33.750 --> 05:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
comment about Vehicles marked Vehicles
 
05:56:35.990 --> 05:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
being uh deterring crime War that's
 
05:56:37.868 --> 05:56:37.878 align:start position:0%
that's true however if your department
 
05:56:39.788 --> 05:56:39.798 align:start position:0%
has one ghost vehicle they use
 
05:56:42.430 --> 05:56:42.440 align:start position:0%
specifically for DWI patrols and traffic
 
05:56:45.310 --> 05:56:45.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement patrols it has a purpose and
 
05:56:46.948 --> 05:56:46.958 align:start position:0%
to take that tool away from our local
 
05:56:49.310 --> 05:56:49.320 align:start position:0%
police and tell our police Chiefs you
 
05:56:50.548 --> 05:56:50.558 align:start position:0%
can't decide what's best for your
 
05:56:53.830 --> 05:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
community we will I think it's wrong I
 
05:56:54.868 --> 05:56:54.878 align:start position:0%
think we should leave it up to local
 
05:56:56.430 --> 05:56:56.440 align:start position:0%
control I don't think we should be
 
05:56:58.190 --> 05:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
taking away this option for them to use
 
05:57:00.310 --> 05:57:00.320 align:start position:0%
them um that's that's where I'm at with
 
05:57:01.948 --> 05:57:01.958 align:start position:0%
it that's a brings up a good point and
 
05:57:03.350 --> 05:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
if anyone can tell me I'd be happy to
 
05:57:05.910 --> 05:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
hear it do we
 
05:57:08.910 --> 05:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
prohibit towns from voting as to what
 
05:57:11.510 --> 05:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
they want to use for police
 
05:57:14.350 --> 05:57:14.360 align:start position:0%
vehicles if you can answer yeah well Mr
 
05:57:15.990 --> 05:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
chairman because there's no because
 
05:57:17.708 --> 05:57:17.718 align:start position:0%
we're at dyan's rule state there's no
 
05:57:19.548 --> 05:57:19.558 align:start position:0%
RSA on the books that says that they can
 
05:57:22.830 --> 05:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
do that they cannot so there there is
 
05:57:25.070 --> 05:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
not an ability for a local municipality
 
05:57:28.190 --> 05:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
to go out and and ban that until law
 
05:57:29.910 --> 05:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
that describes what police vehicles have
 
05:57:32.150 --> 05:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
to look like I don't know the answer to
 
05:57:33.390 --> 05:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
that question if there isn't one then
 
05:57:35.590 --> 05:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
they can but wouldn't there have to be
 
05:57:37.110 --> 05:57:37.120 align:start position:0%
and sorry for the conversation wouldn't
 
05:57:40.390 --> 05:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
there have to be um uh I mean as far as
 
05:57:41.868 --> 05:57:41.878 align:start position:0%
I understand for in order for a
 
05:57:43.830 --> 05:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
municipality to pass a law there has to
 
05:57:46.190 --> 05:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
be a law on the books that says they can
 
05:57:47.310 --> 05:57:47.320 align:start position:0%
well they're allowed to with their
 
05:57:48.990 --> 05:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
budget because I know I just had to
 
05:57:50.468 --> 05:57:50.478 align:start position:0%
approve a new Cruiser for our town on
 
05:57:52.670 --> 05:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
the budget committee so my question is
 
05:57:54.628 --> 05:57:54.638 align:start position:0%
is do we can they say we're going to go
 
05:57:57.548 --> 05:57:57.558 align:start position:0%
with Fords you know CR vict versus you
 
05:57:58.990 --> 05:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
know whatever we're going to go with
 
05:58:00.910 --> 05:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
Explorers so if they can pick what kind
 
05:58:04.110 --> 05:58:04.120 align:start position:0%
of vehicle they want um are not are they
 
05:58:06.190 --> 05:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
not allowed to say locally all our
 
05:58:07.750 --> 05:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
police cars have to be marked with
 
05:58:09.350 --> 05:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
through an ordinance we're about to make
 
05:58:11.670 --> 05:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
that law telling Towns how the C's going
 
05:58:13.430 --> 05:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
to look no no no I'm saying are the
 
05:58:15.190 --> 05:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
towns not able to make that law if they
 
05:58:17.270 --> 05:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
so choose back to your point with local
 
05:58:19.468 --> 05:58:19.478 align:start position:0%
control could the voters of a town not
 
05:58:21.350 --> 05:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
go to their Town Council and say hey we
 
05:58:23.110 --> 05:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
want all of our Cruisers in this town to
 
05:58:24.830 --> 05:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
be marked we don't want unmarked
 
05:58:27.030 --> 05:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
Cruisers yeah through a warrant article
 
05:58:28.350 --> 05:58:28.360 align:start position:0%
I don't but because we a Dylan's real
 
05:58:29.708 --> 05:58:29.718 align:start position:0%
State I don't know if they're able to do
 
05:58:31.868 --> 05:58:31.878 align:start position:0%
that though actually uh Mr chairman
 
05:58:34.670 --> 05:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
that's under the the selectman's or the
 
05:58:37.708 --> 05:58:37.718 align:start position:0%
the board if it's a BAL or Alderman have
 
05:58:40.430 --> 05:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
the ability to um dictate policy on
 
05:58:42.868 --> 05:58:42.878 align:start position:0%
purchases of the town and uh they
 
05:58:44.628 --> 05:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
control Town property which the police
 
05:58:46.830 --> 05:58:46.840 align:start position:0%
cruisers would be and it would be up to
 
05:58:49.868 --> 05:58:49.878 align:start position:0%
that board to determine what the police
 
05:58:51.830 --> 05:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
cars should look like they are allowed
 
05:58:54.430 --> 05:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
under that statute oh to control Town
 
05:58:56.070 --> 05:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
property what it looks like and such
 
05:58:57.430 --> 05:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
since we don't have a statute to your
 
05:58:59.190 --> 05:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
point that describes what all police
 
05:59:01.150 --> 05:59:01.160 align:start position:0%
cars have to look like therefore they
 
05:59:02.910 --> 05:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
can control Town property however they
 
05:59:05.390 --> 05:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
want so to my original point I believe
 
05:59:07.990 --> 05:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
that if voters in a town hated getting
 
05:59:10.510 --> 05:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
caught by an unmarked car they could all
 
05:59:11.910 --> 05:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
go to town hall say we want a war
 
05:59:14.270 --> 05:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
article no more of that um all we could
 
05:59:15.948 --> 05:59:15.958 align:start position:0%
control is our friends at the State
 
05:59:18.990 --> 05:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
Police um and I I I have grave concerns
 
05:59:20.548 --> 05:59:20.558 align:start position:0%
over over what that might do to our
 
05:59:24.030 --> 05:59:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:26.750 --> 05:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
Balden that's the thing right is that if
 
05:59:28.548 --> 05:59:28.558 align:start position:0%
part of what informs this conversation
 
05:59:30.948 --> 05:59:30.958 align:start position:0%
is data that even we and the legislature
 
05:59:34.070 --> 05:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
don't have as to the impact of a marked
 
05:59:36.548 --> 05:59:36.558 align:start position:0%
versus a marked vehicle on driver
 
05:59:38.670 --> 05:59:38.680 align:start position:0%
Behavior and the propensity for M
 
05:59:41.230 --> 05:59:41.240 align:start position:0%
committing traffic violations how is any
 
05:59:43.868 --> 05:59:43.878 align:start position:0%
given small municipality expected to
 
05:59:45.190 --> 05:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
obtain that information and make an
 
05:59:48.670 --> 05:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
informed decision and as much as um
 
05:59:51.350 --> 05:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
local control is a phrase that sounds
 
05:59:53.628 --> 05:59:53.638 align:start position:0%
nice there have been issues in the past
 
05:59:55.190 --> 05:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
that really aren't workable for local
 
05:59:57.910 --> 05:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
control for example gun laws if you're
 
06:00:01.590 --> 06:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
traveling from like Dairy to Milford how
 
06:00:03.670 --> 06:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
many laws are you going to break in the
 
06:00:06.390 --> 06:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
interim with uh you know gun in your
 
06:00:09.230 --> 06:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
vehicle so we can't just worship at the
 
06:00:11.110 --> 06:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
altar of local control there are some
 
06:00:12.628 --> 06:00:12.638 align:start position:0%
things that need to be dictated at the
 
06:00:14.670 --> 06:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
state level I think that's why this
 
06:00:17.590 --> 06:00:17.600 align:start position:0%
building's here true and I appreciate
 
06:00:20.788 --> 06:00:20.798 align:start position:0%
your passion however a local a local
 
06:00:23.110 --> 06:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
police department um doesn't really the
 
06:00:25.430 --> 06:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
the data they going to have is in their
 
06:00:27.270 --> 06:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
Police Department because they're not
 
06:00:28.430 --> 06:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
they're they're just covering their
 
06:00:30.230 --> 06:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
their town so they know how many
 
06:00:32.270 --> 06:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
accidents they have they know the
 
06:00:33.750 --> 06:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
statistics of how many Speeders they
 
06:00:35.948 --> 06:00:35.958 align:start position:0%
pull over for the State Police is much
 
06:00:38.110 --> 06:00:38.120 align:start position:0%
more difficult to your point because we
 
06:00:40.270 --> 06:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
don't know how many tens of thousands of
 
06:00:42.350 --> 06:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
vehicles travel over the state highways
 
06:00:44.230 --> 06:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
but I would assume most towns can pull
 
06:00:46.670 --> 06:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
that information readly pretty quickly
 
06:00:48.708 --> 06:00:48.718 align:start position:0%
as far as how many stops the traffic the
 
06:00:51.548 --> 06:00:51.558 align:start position:0%
dangers of stuff um so if if a local
 
06:00:54.270 --> 06:00:54.280 align:start position:0%
Town decides that they don't want this
 
06:00:56.990 --> 06:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
they can they are free to do it um but
 
06:00:58.708 --> 06:00:58.718 align:start position:0%
more importantly are you changing your
 
06:01:01.110 --> 06:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
position because that's an initial you
 
06:01:02.910 --> 06:01:02.920 align:start position:0%
said that you didn't really favor the
 
06:01:05.670 --> 06:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
bill now you kind of just made a defense
 
06:01:07.750 --> 06:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
he did can we climb out of the rabbit
 
06:01:10.310 --> 06:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
hole now need more Cofe I don't even
 
06:01:11.708 --> 06:01:11.718 align:start position:0%
know I feel like I'm talking to The
 
06:01:14.948 --> 06:01:14.958 align:start position:0%
Madhatter I don't know very good um uh
 
06:01:16.548 --> 06:01:16.558 align:start position:0%
wait a minute representative Stone hold
 
06:01:17.948 --> 06:01:17.958 align:start position:0%
on thank you I'd like to remind
 
06:01:19.548 --> 06:01:19.558 align:start position:0%
everybody that we also have towns and
 
06:01:21.590 --> 06:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
cities in New Hampshire and the current
 
06:01:23.030 --> 06:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
case of clamont we have a police
 
06:01:24.788 --> 06:01:24.798 align:start position:0%
commission that is in charge of the
 
06:01:26.430 --> 06:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
police department and budget is in
 
06:01:28.070 --> 06:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
charge of the city council
 
06:01:31.110 --> 06:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
therefore the city police commission
 
06:01:33.230 --> 06:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
dictates what goes on for markings
 
06:01:35.270 --> 06:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures and I as many of
 
06:01:37.390 --> 06:01:37.400 align:start position:0%
you aware most departments have policies
 
06:01:39.430 --> 06:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
involving the use of how they use
 
06:01:40.910 --> 06:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
unmarked vehicles for traffic
 
06:01:43.030 --> 06:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement so that's something that is
 
06:01:44.830 --> 06:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
uh highly scrutinized by the individual
 
06:01:46.910 --> 06:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
agencies across the state of New
 
06:01:49.750 --> 06:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and who's next representative
 
06:01:51.030 --> 06:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
Newman's had his hand
 
06:01:53.430 --> 06:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
for I have more of a parliamentary
 
06:01:55.468 --> 06:01:55.478 align:start position:0%
question what we have a we have a motion
 
06:01:58.788 --> 06:01:58.798 align:start position:0%
on the floor of itl yeah so then what is
 
06:02:01.670 --> 06:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
our next vote I mean I we're having
 
06:02:03.150 --> 06:02:03.160 align:start position:0%
discussion on that okay so we will have
 
06:02:05.430 --> 06:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
an itl so in that case we will never get
 
06:02:06.910 --> 06:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
to vote on the amendment well if the itl
 
06:02:09.390 --> 06:02:09.400 align:start position:0%
fails she can induce her Amendment so
 
06:02:11.510 --> 06:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
she's trying to convince people to vote
 
06:02:13.270 --> 06:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
against the itl so that she can induce
 
06:02:15.430 --> 06:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
her yeah I I thought it might be order
 
06:02:17.230 --> 06:02:17.240 align:start position:0%
more in the or I thought that the
 
06:02:19.468 --> 06:02:19.478 align:start position:0%
Motions might be in more of the order
 
06:02:22.868 --> 06:02:22.878 align:start position:0%
that we see in when we go to session
 
06:02:26.628 --> 06:02:26.638 align:start position:0%
where they where Mo a committee vote
 
06:02:28.788 --> 06:02:28.798 align:start position:0%
they bring up a committee Amendment if
 
06:02:31.548 --> 06:02:31.558 align:start position:0%
if one approves but whatever if that's
 
06:02:33.990 --> 06:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
what it is that's what it is yeah okay
 
06:02:35.788 --> 06:02:35.798 align:start position:0%
um represent
 
06:02:38.270 --> 06:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
jamr thank you Mr chairman one of the
 
06:02:41.430 --> 06:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
things that we had discussed um or I
 
06:02:44.788 --> 06:02:44.798 align:start position:0%
remember being discussed was article 28a
 
06:02:46.628 --> 06:02:46.638 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to read it State shall not
 
06:02:48.590 --> 06:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
mandate or assign any new expanded or
 
06:02:51.670 --> 06:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
modified programs or responsibilities to
 
06:02:53.468 --> 06:02:53.478 align:start position:0%
any political subdivision in such a way
 
06:02:55.230 --> 06:02:55.240 align:start position:0%
as to necessitate additional local
 
06:02:57.548 --> 06:02:57.558 align:start position:0%
expenditure by the political subdivision
 
06:02:59.590 --> 06:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
unless such programs or responsibilities
 
06:03:02.830 --> 06:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
are fully funded by the state dot dot
 
06:03:05.590 --> 06:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
dot so if if we're going to tell these
 
06:03:07.590 --> 06:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
local departments what they must be
 
06:03:11.390 --> 06:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
using we are mandating a responsibility
 
06:03:13.708 --> 06:03:13.718 align:start position:0%
and it would have a cost which would be
 
06:03:16.708 --> 06:03:16.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:19.788 --> 06:03:19.798 align:start position:0%
state okay um final comments
 
06:03:22.628 --> 06:03:22.638 align:start position:0%
representative first representative
 
06:03:26.150 --> 06:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
Ro thank you Mr chairman so on the same
 
06:03:28.070 --> 06:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
on the same side if if you're if you're
 
06:03:28.080 --> 06:03:29.350 align:start position:0%
on the same side if if you're if you're
saying

06:03:29.350 --> 06:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
saying
 
06:03:31.788 --> 06:03:31.798 align:start position:0%
that if a car is marked you're going to
 
06:03:33.510 --> 06:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
slow down because you don't want to get
 
06:03:35.990 --> 06:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
a ticket the same thing could be said if
 
06:03:38.190 --> 06:03:38.200 align:start position:0%
you know that the cars aren't marked and
 
06:03:40.070 --> 06:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
any one of them could be a cop at any
 
06:03:43.910 --> 06:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
time that equally should slow you down
 
06:03:47.468 --> 06:03:47.478 align:start position:0%
and I recognize that maybe I use the
 
06:03:51.230 --> 06:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
speed limit as a suggestion and that's
 
06:03:53.590 --> 06:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
you know when I get pulled over I have
 
06:03:56.310 --> 06:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
the answer to that um but if I know that
 
06:03:58.788 --> 06:03:58.798 align:start position:0%
the town's have cars that aren't marked
 
06:04:01.628 --> 06:04:01.638 align:start position:0%
I I usually let off a little bit so it
 
06:04:02.910 --> 06:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
could go either way however you want to
 
06:04:04.070 --> 06:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
make the argument it's not going to
 
06:04:05.670 --> 06:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
change your behavior unless you want to
 
06:04:07.230 --> 06:04:07.240 align:start position:0%
change your
 
06:04:10.270 --> 06:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
behavior representative here gather yes
 
06:04:12.150 --> 06:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
I just want to make the point that it's
 
06:04:14.390 --> 06:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's not all vehicles it's nothing in
 
06:04:15.990 --> 06:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
the section should be construed to
 
06:04:18.830 --> 06:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
prohibit the use of unmarked vehicles or
 
06:04:21.788 --> 06:04:21.798 align:start position:0%
vehicles with steal of or ghostling for
 
06:04:26.150 --> 06:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
any purpose other than traffic law
 
06:04:26.160 --> 06:04:28.030 align:start position:0%
any purpose other than traffic law
enforcement

06:04:28.030 --> 06:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
06:04:30.910 --> 06:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
so this is specific it is but to an
 
06:04:33.190 --> 06:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
earlier Point many towns don't have more
 
06:04:34.750 --> 06:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
than two cars and you're cutting their
 
06:04:36.390 --> 06:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
Fleet in half if you say they can't use
 
06:04:38.510 --> 06:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
it for that um only people who haven't
 
06:04:40.830 --> 06:04:40.840 align:start position:0%
spoken representative Reed thank you Mr
 
06:04:43.030 --> 06:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
chairman let's look at it this way I
 
06:04:46.030 --> 06:04:46.040 align:start position:0%
mean obviously there's people who don't
 
06:04:47.468 --> 06:04:47.478 align:start position:0%
want to get pulled over and don't want
 
06:04:50.230 --> 06:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
to be surprised by the police however
 
06:04:52.590 --> 06:04:52.600 align:start position:0%
think of it as you have somebody that
 
06:04:55.468 --> 06:04:55.478 align:start position:0%
you love on the road the police are an
 
06:04:58.150 --> 06:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
extra set of eyes we are public safety
 
06:05:00.390 --> 06:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
criminal justice and Public Safety thank
 
06:05:04.708 --> 06:05:04.718 align:start position:0%
you for I think that we need to also
 
06:05:06.350 --> 06:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
it's an extra set of eyes watching
 
06:05:09.270 --> 06:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
somebody you love drive and I will
 
06:05:11.510 --> 06:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
always vote in favor of whatever that
 
06:05:14.708 --> 06:05:14.718 align:start position:0%
takes to keep the people I love safe on
 
06:05:16.150 --> 06:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
the road thank you anyone else who
 
06:05:17.948 --> 06:05:17.958 align:start position:0%
hasn't spoken wish to
 
06:05:20.990 --> 06:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
comment okay I think um we can continue
 
06:05:22.628 --> 06:05:22.638 align:start position:0%
this debate on the elevator and the way
 
06:05:24.830 --> 06:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
down I'd ask to call the role the
 
06:05:26.190 --> 06:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
motional floor is inexpedient to
 
06:05:26.200 --> 06:05:27.628 align:start position:0%

06:07:25.468 --> 06:07:25.478 align:start position:0%
everything second representative Stone
 
06:07:28.350 --> 06:07:28.360 align:start position:0%
second did that
 
06:07:29.190 --> 06:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
yeah we
 
06:07:29.200 --> 06:07:30.788 align:start position:0%
yeah we
did

06:07:30.788 --> 06:07:30.798 align:start position:0%
did
 
06:07:33.430 --> 06:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
yeah okay go
 
06:07:37.070 --> 06:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
ahead I motion itl yeah
 
06:07:42.390 --> 06:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:44.468 --> 06:07:44.478 align:start position:0%
Auctioneer represent Stone second would
 
06:07:46.030 --> 06:07:46.040 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your motion yes I
 
06:07:47.310 --> 06:07:47.320 align:start position:0%
would so this is similar to the last
 
06:07:49.830 --> 06:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
bill we had however this it's talking
 
06:07:51.430 --> 06:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
about just Municipal Police plates which
 
06:07:54.230 --> 06:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
are pretty identifiable uh the concern I
 
06:07:56.510 --> 06:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
have with this is if every vehicle that
 
06:07:57.990 --> 06:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
the police Department of the Town owns
 
06:07:59.910 --> 06:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
has to have these on it uh there are a
 
06:08:02.430 --> 06:08:02.440 align:start position:0%
lot of detect detective vehicles um
 
06:08:04.070 --> 06:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes they Vans or buses we use a
 
06:08:05.150 --> 06:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
lot of different vehicles for
 
06:08:07.468 --> 06:08:07.478 align:start position:0%
surveillance undercovered drug work uh
 
06:08:09.390 --> 06:08:09.400 align:start position:0%
child trafficking work where you don't
 
06:08:11.750 --> 06:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
want to be identified so this would
 
06:08:13.190 --> 06:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
pretty much give the police up everywh
 
06:08:15.030 --> 06:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
they're doing this so I don't think it's
 
06:08:16.670 --> 06:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's prudent to have every vehicle
 
06:08:18.990 --> 06:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
mock with these plates representative
 
06:08:19.910 --> 06:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
Stone would you like to speak to a
 
06:08:22.310 --> 06:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
second uh Mr chairman I would currently
 
06:08:23.670 --> 06:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of at least uh three
 
06:08:24.948 --> 06:08:24.958 align:start position:0%
variations of plates that can be
 
06:08:27.310 --> 06:08:27.320 align:start position:0%
utilized on Municipal police vehicles
 
06:08:29.350 --> 06:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
and uh one of the other issues that uh
 
06:08:31.150 --> 06:08:31.160 align:start position:0%
unmarked vehicles used for in addition
 
06:08:33.708 --> 06:08:33.718 align:start position:0%
to traffic enforcement is also uh if
 
06:08:34.990 --> 06:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
there's a bank robbery that looks like
 
06:08:36.030 --> 06:08:36.040 align:start position:0%
it's going to go down and they staking
 
06:08:37.830 --> 06:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
out a certain location you do not want
 
06:08:39.830 --> 06:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
to have uh you know government plates or
 
06:08:41.548 --> 06:08:41.558 align:start position:0%
Municipal Police plates on it as it's
 
06:08:43.468 --> 06:08:43.478 align:start position:0%
sitting outside a bank or or you know
 
06:08:46.430 --> 06:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
maybe a liquor store thank you um does
 
06:08:48.948 --> 06:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
anyone know if this bill was this did
 
06:08:50.948 --> 06:08:50.958 align:start position:0%
this one already also ex exempt the
 
06:08:54.270 --> 06:08:54.280 align:start position:0%
state police or was this all vehicles
 
06:08:56.190 --> 06:08:56.200 align:start position:0%
Municipal so this just targeted
 
06:08:58.350 --> 06:08:58.360 align:start position:0%
Municipal again yeah yeah that's not
 
06:09:01.868 --> 06:09:01.878 align:start position:0%
right okay um I would just to start the
 
06:09:03.628 --> 06:09:03.638 align:start position:0%
discussion and make one point you don't
 
06:09:06.270 --> 06:09:06.280 align:start position:0%
need to discuss I'm sorry I just wanted
 
06:09:09.708 --> 06:09:09.718 align:start position:0%
to make this point that most people when
 
06:09:11.230 --> 06:09:11.240 align:start position:0%
you're getting pulled over you cannot
 
06:09:13.750 --> 06:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
see the police car's plates he's usually
 
06:09:15.910 --> 06:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
right up against your bumper um you see
 
06:09:18.030 --> 06:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
lights in your thing you you the plate
 
06:09:20.628 --> 06:09:20.638 align:start position:0%
things once the cruiser part's gone now
 
06:09:22.990 --> 06:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
the plates really naturally follow any
 
06:09:25.868 --> 06:09:25.878 align:start position:0%

again taking their eyes off those who

willing
 
06:11:03.948 --> 06:11:03.958 align:start position:0%
participants um we solely we are solely
 
06:11:06.390 --> 06:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
against legalizing sex work in any form
 
06:11:08.390 --> 06:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
according to authors and researchers
 
06:11:11.030 --> 06:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
poic Weiss and Mal legalized
 
06:11:13.350 --> 06:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
prostitution will inadvertently force
 
06:11:15.830 --> 06:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
sex work further into the shadows and
 
06:11:17.590 --> 06:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
expose children to
 
06:11:19.708 --> 06:11:19.718 align:start position:0%
exploitation in fact one of the most
 
06:11:21.708 --> 06:11:21.718 align:start position:0%
concerning side effects of legalization
 
06:11:24.270 --> 06:11:24.280 align:start position:0%
of prostitution is the potential for
 
06:11:26.628 --> 06:11:26.638 align:start position:0%
human trafficking crimes to become
 
06:11:28.628 --> 06:11:28.638 align:start position:0%
easier for perpetrators to commit
 
06:11:31.350 --> 06:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
against children no child should be
 
06:11:33.548 --> 06:11:33.558 align:start position:0%
subject to sex work life in their home
 
06:11:36.190 --> 06:11:36.200 align:start position:0%
or anywhere some would say we are the
 
06:11:38.510 --> 06:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
product of teachings of our
 
06:11:40.708 --> 06:11:40.718 align:start position:0%
environment so we urge you to prevent
 
06:11:42.590 --> 06:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
the influx of human trafficking in the
 
06:11:44.390 --> 06:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire communities protect our
 
06:11:46.548 --> 06:11:46.558 align:start position:0%
childrens and traffic the community by
 
06:11:49.110 --> 06:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill and actually this was
 
06:11:50.910 --> 06:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
something that I wrote a couple years
 
06:11:53.868 --> 06:11:53.878 align:start position:0%
ago for the same
 
06:11:53.878 --> 06:11:55.468 align:start position:0%
ago for the same
bill

06:11:55.468 --> 06:11:55.478 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:11:55.478 --> 06:11:57.150 align:start position:0%
bill
no

06:11:57.150 --> 06:11:57.160 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:11:58.390 --> 06:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
than you like speak to your second
 
06:11:59.708 --> 06:11:59.718 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler just really
 
06:12:01.070 --> 06:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
quickly Mr chairman I just want to Echo
 
06:12:02.788 --> 06:12:02.798 align:start position:0%
what representative goth says I have a
 
06:12:05.270 --> 06:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
very large concern about proliferation
 
06:12:07.230 --> 06:12:07.240 align:start position:0%
of human trafficking in this world and I
 
06:12:09.190 --> 06:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
don't want to do anything that uh allows
 
06:12:12.110 --> 06:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
that prolation to continue thank you uh
 
06:12:16.150 --> 06:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
I would also add that even if the human
 
06:12:17.708 --> 06:12:17.718 align:start position:0%
trafficking were not an issue which it
 
06:12:19.830 --> 06:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
is and it's horrific if that was
 
06:12:21.590 --> 06:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
something we were going to contemplate
 
06:12:23.948 --> 06:12:23.958 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be we the sponsor said well
 
06:12:26.270 --> 06:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
look at Nevada look at Utah well they've
 
06:12:28.270 --> 06:12:28.280 align:start position:0%
could this whole huge infrastructure
 
06:12:31.150 --> 06:12:31.160 align:start position:0%
around that industry you can't just say
 
06:12:33.788 --> 06:12:33.798 align:start position:0%
legal Go I mean the bill was just tossed
 
06:12:36.110 --> 06:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
out I mean if he was serious about this
 
06:12:37.390 --> 06:12:37.400 align:start position:0%
he would have done research he would
 
06:12:39.868 --> 06:12:39.878 align:start position:0%
have had all kinds of studies there was
 
06:12:42.468 --> 06:12:42.478 align:start position:0%
nothing representative uh Murray thank
 
06:12:45.190 --> 06:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um I will be supporting the
 
06:12:47.548 --> 06:12:47.558 align:start position:0%
itl motion today um but I did want to
 
06:12:49.150 --> 06:12:49.160 align:start position:0%
say I do in general support
 
06:12:51.230 --> 06:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
decriminalizing sex work but I spoke to
 
06:12:52.708 --> 06:12:52.718 align:start position:0%
sex workers in the community who said
 
06:12:53.750 --> 06:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
they weren't reached out to by the
 
06:12:55.070 --> 06:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor and did not support this
 
06:12:56.830 --> 06:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
legislation as written and I think
 
06:12:58.868 --> 06:12:58.878 align:start position:0%
you're correct that if we did want to do
 
06:13:00.310 --> 06:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
that in the future it needs to be done
 
06:13:01.750 --> 06:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
carefully in a way that allows for there
 
06:13:03.430 --> 06:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
