K why don't you just give an idea of
 
00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
what the bill is about and why we're

here for this meeting right thank you Mr
 
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
chair I I have shared some information
 
00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:51.800 align:start position:0%
with them including the uh the video
 
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
that we had a few years ago when we
 
00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
first began this bill with the uh actor
 
00:09:58.750 --> 00:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
who portrayed Louis on Sesame Street
 
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
advocate ating so carefully for this uh
 
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
payroll card idea so what happens is
 
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
when you when you have a job and as
 
00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
we've discussed this they do have jobs
 
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh you may be paid with a with cash
 
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
check or a direct deposit and another
 
00:10:19.389 --> 00:10:19.399 align:start position:0%
option is a payroll debit card for those
 
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
particularly who don't have a bank
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
account don't want a bank account but or
 
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
are unable to have one and this is an
 
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
option that is offered uh uh but we want
 
00:10:32.829 --> 00:10:32.839 align:start position:0%
to we I and our committee has previously
 
00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
retained wanted to retain the option of
 
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
a paper check as that should is a choice
 
00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
that when someone wants their wages in a
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
paper check they should have it that's
 
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:43.720 align:start position:0%
where we've come down thus
 
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
far one of the things that important um
 
00:10:48.829 --> 00:10:48.839 align:start position:0%
when we make decisions here in this
 
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:50.680 align:start position:0%
committee is we have to think about
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
everybody we have to think about
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
someone uh you know barely making
 
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
$220,000 a year and trying to to just to
 
00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
stay afloat um and someone making a
 
00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:02.519 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of money a year we have to
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
think about big businesses small
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
businesses um and everyone in between
 
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
not just the simple ones you think about
 
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
of the grocery store or or whatever
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of small different one or
 
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
two man businesses some things that I
 
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
don't even understand some high-tech
 
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
stuff that is far above me um so we make
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
the decisions on these things well this
 
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
may be good for one it may not be good
 
00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:29.240 align:start position:0%
for another exactly so as we come here
 
00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:30.959 align:start position:0%
today we've had a hearing on the
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
bill and we listen to testimony from
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
people who came up to the desk and said
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
why they want this bill or maybe why
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
they don't want the bill and sometimes
 
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
an hour-long conversation is not
 
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
sufficient enough for us to determine
 
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not you know we like it or
 
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:49.240 align:start position:0%
whether there are some mistakes in it
 
00:11:50.829 --> 00:11:50.839 align:start position:0%
where some things that we could change
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
to make it better because we don't like
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
to put out things out of this committee
 
00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
that go to the house floor if they're
 
00:12:00.389 --> 00:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
not ready
 
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
and this one isn't
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
ready and someone has submitted a
 
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
potential Amendment um to make some
 
00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
changes based on the comments that we
 
00:12:11.629 --> 00:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
made in the
 
00:12:13.629 --> 00:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
committee so that's what we're going to
 
00:12:13.639 --> 00:12:14.670 align:start position:0%
committee so that's what we're going to
do

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:14.680 align:start position:0%

today
 
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:18.880 align:start position:0%

amendment by uh the the uh the lobby
 
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
firm that uh has been hired by um ADP if
 
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
any amendment is something that we would
 
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
be agreeable to I'm sure they will have
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor representative kofalt
 
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
bring it
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
forth the two issues I believe that we
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
have on this bill is number
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
one the ability for someone to still
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
have the paper check
 
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.790 align:start position:0%
have the paper check
number

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.069 align:start position:0%
number
two

00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
the requirements of the
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
employer to be responsible if the check
 
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:43.240 align:start position:0%
card Has a
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
Glitch uh in the computer system or if
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
the employee loses or misplaces their
 
00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.990 align:start position:0%
the employee loses or misplaces their
card

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
card
 
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
um and the
 
00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
third issue is whether or not this
 
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
favors one business over another and
 
00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
makes it impossible for others to be in
 
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
the payroll business those are the three
 
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
issues that I have seen is there anyone
 
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
else that has any other things that they
 
00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.629 align:start position:0%
else that has any other things that they
they've

00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
they've
 
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
noticed yeah we can go on all day but
 
00:14:18.269 --> 00:14:18.279 align:start position:0%
I'll keep it brief all right
 
00:14:18.279 --> 00:14:19.749 align:start position:0%
I'll keep it brief all right
representative

00:14:19.749 --> 00:14:19.759 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
avalani uh who's coming who's the who's
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
the lucky recipient of
 
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
questions um dialogue with the four of
 
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
us to discuss oh um so I took it upon
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
myself to download and find um top five
 
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
payall companies um that
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
would possibly benefit from this going
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
forward and their list of
 
00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
fees some I could live with some I could
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
not um you can you provide us an example
 
00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
of uh some of the fees that you have
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
issue with rapid pay card is one company
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
um they're one of the largest in the in
 
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
the country there's five or six of them
 
00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
that provide pay Woll services and other
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
things um they charge for cash ACC cash
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
access at any ring from a $150 to
 
00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:18.839 align:start position:0%
$3.50 so if you just want to take a cash
 
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
deposit off your pay card yep but you
 
00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:23.240 align:start position:0%
don't know whether it gives you the
 
00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.550 align:start position:0%
don't know whether it gives you the
first

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
one for free the first one you get your
 
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
paycheck it's 00 for the week um when

you can take that all without a fee yep
 
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
they can take the first you have to
 
00:15:35.749 --> 00:15:35.759 align:start position:0%
that's have a law first transaction each
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
pay period for those listed with one
 
00:15:38.749 --> 00:15:38.759 align:start position:0%
free otherwise the card holder which
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
charge the listed fee so that is one um
 
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
that charges a whole host
 
00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
of things um monthly maintenance fees
 
00:15:50.189 --> 00:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
was another one on Money Network on top
 
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
of other customer service fees inquiry
 
00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:57.560 align:start position:0%
fees and everything else um also a limit
 
00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
per day
 
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
ATM withdrawal limits $600 per
 
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:05.600 align:start position:0%

00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
everything else then there was uh pin
 
00:16:26.749 --> 00:16:26.759 align:start position:0%
pin uh debit transactions was also a
 
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:29.720 align:start position:0%
limit 3,000 per day signature debt limit
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
signature debit transactions which is
 
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
part of the um branded Visa Mastercard
 
00:16:37.949 --> 00:16:37.959 align:start position:0%
is offer signature debit pce I find this
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
one very interesting to get a
 
00:16:41.949 --> 00:16:41.959 align:start position:0%
replacement card if the employer
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
provides it they still charge you $5
 
00:16:46.949 --> 00:16:46.959 align:start position:0%
even though the employer did everything
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
if uh it's um replacement card done
 
00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:54.279 align:start position:0%
by these the the company Rapid pay card
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
is $10 and 99 now this is not why this
 
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
is not wisely that has some kind of
 
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
ownership relationship with ADP that the
 
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
people that want the bill a bill payment
 
00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:09.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
bill so these are the companies that
 
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.470 align:start position:0%
bill so these are the companies that
would

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:13.480 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
be I don't want to say benefiting but be
 
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
able to enjoy this type of
 
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.230 align:start position:0%
able to enjoy this type of
legislation

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:25.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm all for reducing employer
 
00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:27.079 align:start position:0%
overhead but I don't see how this
 
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
reduces the employee these fees by
 
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:32.200 align:start position:0%
getting a papercheck by getting direct
 
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
deposit by getting what we've done for
 
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:37.240 align:start position:0%
the last 40 or 50 years when all of this
 
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
came about I don't see a problem with
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
what we have now um there is one in
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
the uh I did manage to find the wisely
 
00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:47.789 align:start position:0%
the uh I did manage to find the wisely
pay

00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:47.799 align:start position:0%
pay
 
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:51.039 align:start position:0%
one um which is part of their thing I
 
00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:54.200 align:start position:0%
did highlight one section that came they
 
00:17:57.549 --> 00:17:57.559 align:start position:0%
also have plenty of fees as well um
 
00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
highlighted one section C that was kind
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
of upsetting to
 
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
me um liability for unauthorized
 
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:08.200 align:start position:0%
transactions if you do not tell us
 
00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:09.799 align:start position:0%
within two business days after you learn
 
00:18:12.149 --> 00:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
over the loss or theft of your card and
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
we can prove we could have stopped
 
00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:15.320 align:start position:0%
someone from using your card without
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
your permission if you had told us you
 
00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
could lose as much as
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
$500 how is that beneficial to an
 
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
employe to have a pay card forced upon
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
them by this
 
00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.190 align:start position:0%
them by this
legislation

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
I may they also have an inactivity fee
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
yes and so if you I don't know change
 
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
jobs and you're not getting a paycheck a
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
pay period every week from that job
 
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
maybe you're looking for another job
 
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:43.480 align:start position:0%
your money goes away a little little bit
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
of the time and as you pointed out you
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
know this isn't just for wisely and
 
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:49.960 align:start position:0%
anybody with a payroll card can can do
 
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
this and further the payroll cards are
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
allowed now as an option so I I don't
 
00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
see uh I mean if I had an opportunity to
 
00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:01.640 align:start position:0%
prohibit them I I'd probably be looking
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
at that instead do we know if these fees
 
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
that he was just talking about pertain
 
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
to the company that
 
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
ADP um we kind of went over a number of
 
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
different things the first one was not
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
the wisely company um is um I have the
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
wisely charges was the one he just
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned that one sentence uh about you
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
could be responsible to $500 if you
 
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
don't notify it within 48 hours be lost
 
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
of a pay card and then fraudulent use
 
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
that's yep and there is one from
 
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
Skylight which is also I think is in use
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
in this state um I know
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
Amazon possibly um has this through a m
 
00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
their through their signature MasterCard
 
00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
they also have um a a bit of fees and
 
00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:55.039 align:start position:0%
limited on limited on ATM withdrawal
 
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
limits of 325 per transactions not to
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
receed $940 in any 24-hour period how is
 
00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
that allowing somebody to withdraw all
 
00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
of their paycheck at
 
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
once and I know they've told told us
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
that you know you don't want to you want
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
to be cashing a check because you got
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
all that money you could lose it or be
 
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
robbed you know even if you take you one
 
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
free bite at the Apple there you are
 
00:20:20.029 --> 00:20:20.039 align:start position:0%
walking around with your whole paycheck
 
00:20:20.039 --> 00:20:21.750 align:start position:0%
walking around with your whole paycheck
in

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
cash people do that now I mean some
 
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:25.799 align:start position:0%
people you
 
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
know get their check as you know
 
00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:31.720 align:start position:0%
Employers in New Hampshire must have a
 
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
place for you to cash your check for no
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
fee right so uh they go in there and
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
they don't have an account there maybe
 
00:20:40.029 --> 00:20:40.039 align:start position:0%
they don't have a checking account maybe
 
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
they don't want a checking account um so
 
00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919 align:start position:0%
they have to cash it there I remember
 
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
this is going back a years guys but I
 
00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:51.640 align:start position:0%
used to work at a Grand Union I used to
 
00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
work in the deli in the Grand Union when
 
00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
I was in high school and uh we got our
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
paycheck and I had a little savings
 
00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:02.200 align:start position:0%
account at some local you know Bank
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
interest trust or whatever so I got my
 
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
first paycheck and I was like all right
 
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
get my first paycheck I want to go cash
 
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
this in my bank and the manager said no
 
00:21:11.549 --> 00:21:11.559 align:start position:0%
you have to cash it here so you have to
 
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
go up to the you know the courtesy desk
 
00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
and and cash your check I thought that
 
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
was now this was a long time ago 40
 
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
years ago whatever but um anyway I
 
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
digress sorry was there was there a
 
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
maximum amount I asked that question I
 
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
don't remember what the answer was
 
00:21:29.549 --> 00:21:29.559 align:start position:0%
remember there was a couple of Maximum
 
00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:33.559 align:start position:0%
accounts um uh the Skylight has a 5,000
 
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
overthe counter cash withdrawal limit so
 
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
if you make if you have more than 5,000
 
00:21:39.269 --> 00:21:39.279 align:start position:0%
in your account you can only get you can
 
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
only withdraw it once per day um same
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
thing with uh transfers account to
 
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:47.720 align:start position:0%
account transfer limits not to exceed
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
four transfers or up to, 1500 in any
 
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
24hour period so if you needed to
 
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
transfer your mortgage payment over you
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to do that under some
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
of these options now
 
00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
I did find the ones that were outside of
 
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and they had different
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
fees that weren't as um
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
transparent it looks like some of them
 
00:22:09.669 --> 00:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
that are here that are in the that are
 
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
in the state do offer
 
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
zero um your
 
00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
first withdrawal free and then it adds
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
in other domestic ATM withdrawals it
 
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:23.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't identify which one each
 
00:22:25.149 --> 00:22:25.159 align:start position:0%
withdrawal after the first withdrawal as
 
00:22:25.159 --> 00:22:26.669 align:start position:0%
withdrawal after the first withdrawal as
a

00:22:26.669 --> 00:22:26.679 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:22:28.669 --> 00:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
$1.75 um
 
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
if you go on the website for wisely and
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
others you will find that legisl
 
00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.350 align:start position:0%
others you will find that legisl
legislators

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
00:22:39.269 --> 00:22:39.279 align:start position:0%
have um changed
 
00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
the laws as to when they've implemented
 
00:22:43.269 --> 00:22:43.279 align:start position:0%
these pay
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
cards they um put curves into what fees
 
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
can be
 
00:22:51.789 --> 00:22:51.799 align:start position:0%
charged um some have have said that you
 
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
can't charge for replacement others so
 
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
um it varies by statement what each one
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
of these companies can charge so I'm
 
00:23:02.909 --> 00:23:02.919 align:start position:0%
assuming there's no maximum amount that
 
00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
they can have on the card so let's say
 
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
somebody doesn't have a bank account and
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
they just keep all their money in there
 
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:11.720 align:start position:0%
and may live at home don't spend any
 
00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:13.640 align:start position:0%
money is there a maximum amount that
 
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
they of money that they can actually
 
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
have on the card itself yes per card per
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
account is 15,000 on some of them some
 
00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
of them are 40,000 and some of them are
 
00:23:25.149 --> 00:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
10,000 okay there is there is a maximum
 
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
that you can leave on there um but you
 
00:23:29.789 --> 00:23:29.799 align:start position:0%
get a fee for keeping it there like
 
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
utilizing as kind of a savings account I
 
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
I couldn't I couldn't get into that part
 
00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
of it of their stuff because I wasn't a
 
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
customer I but it looks all nice on the
 
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
front when it says no fees for this or
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
that this or that till you turn it over
 
00:23:45.549 --> 00:23:45.559 align:start position:0%
it was also if he if you wanted to add
 
00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
money yes there is
 
00:23:50.909 --> 00:23:50.919 align:start position:0%
595 that is yeah wisely has that some
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
other ones don't have that option you
 
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
have to there was one on here that you
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
could buy into a program for $10 a month
 
00:23:59.070 --> 00:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
you could load your own checks into your
 
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
card right that you have to buy a
 
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
membership fee to change your card
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
structure right so without being a dead
 
00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
horse here um it's clear we don't
 
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fees right um I'd like to
 
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
go through the through the bill and some
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
of the issues we had with the bill and
 
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
then review um this amendment so one of
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
the first changes of the bill comes on
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
page one line
 
00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:29.480 align:start position:0%
10 uh with written authorization of the
 
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
employee by direct deposit to Banks to
 
00:24:34.389 --> 00:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
the employer's choice now I never I
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
think we asked the question but I don't
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
remember if we got the answer that we
 
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
were really looking for as to why that
 
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
was being stricken out is that because
 
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
when this was written 10 years ago you
 
00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
needed uh authorization because it's so
 
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
common right now uh there's really no
 
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
need for the authorization by the
 
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
employeee uh for direct deposit why is
 
00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
that why was that stricken out that was
 
00:25:02.269 --> 00:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
my question I I I wonder if it's just
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
you know they they didn't give you you
 
00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:05.320 align:start position:0%
didn't give them a payroll card so now
 
00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:07.480 align:start position:0%
their next option is I'm sorry a a
 
00:25:09.549 --> 00:25:09.559 align:start position:0%
direct deposit account information so
 
00:25:12.029 --> 00:25:12.039 align:start position:0%
now the option is payroll card it's
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
that's in D look at I payroll cards are
 
00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
already allowed in New Hampshire right
 
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
so why was with written authorization
 
00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:20.360 align:start position:0%
does anyone from the Department of Labor
 
00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.230 align:start position:0%
does anyone from the Department of Labor
remember

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
remember
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
why they struck that out from the
 
00:25:26.679 --> 00:25:32.990 align:start position:0%
why they struck that out from the
hearing

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
I usually write my notes all over it and
 
00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
I don't recall that we actually got an
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
answer we did not that's the why so I I
 
00:25:42.909 --> 00:25:42.919 align:start position:0%
I see no reason to strike that out I I
 
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:45.640 align:start position:0%
don't see the purpose um I like there to
 
00:25:47.389 --> 00:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
be a little bit of written
 
00:25:47.399 --> 00:25:52.990 align:start position:0%
be a little bit of written
authorization

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
um I don't see that there's a harm I
 
00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:57.039 align:start position:0%
don't see that anyone came and from the
 
00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
banks and saying we don't need it
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
anymore or the employers are saying we
 
00:26:01.149 --> 00:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
don't need it
 
00:26:03.149 --> 00:26:03.159 align:start position:0%
anymore usually you have to give
 
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
authorization because you have to give
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
them your routing number and account
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
number so when you're there they might
 
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
as well just sign in the dotted line
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
saying they gave you the information and
 
00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:14.559 align:start position:0%
it's okay I don't really see any you
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
know trying to if we're trying to have a
 
00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
mindset here of moving forward you know
 
00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
uh to to a newer age with newer
 
00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
technology I just don't see any reason
 
00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:27.320 align:start position:0%
why you wouldn't have that because you
 
00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.389 align:start position:0%
why you wouldn't have that because you
you

00:26:28.389 --> 00:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
someone's got to send you an
 
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
email or send you something or fill out
 
00:26:36.669 --> 00:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
a form hand you a check avoided check or
 
00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
avoided deposit ticket they have to give
 
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
you something as an employer you can't
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
just drop money I can't say okay I just
 
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
hired Mike yesterday I'm going to drop
 
00:26:46.269 --> 00:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
money in this account how how do I how
 
00:26:48.669 --> 00:26:48.679 align:start position:0%
do I do that without your consent or
 
00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
authorization so is there any
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
disagreement as to why that that we
 
00:26:54.389 --> 00:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
should not strike that
 
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
out can can we ask the department how
 
00:26:58.590 --> 00:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
they enforce that rule if they go in and
 
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
do a
 
00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:02.559 align:start position:0%
audit is direct you guys enforce a
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
something what they were looking so
 
00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
avoid a check from an employee in their
 
00:27:59.470 --> 00:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
file would basically authorize the
 
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
employer to direct bonds that's not
 
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
employe so we should Define written
 
00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:31.519 align:start position:0%
authorization then for
 
00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:42.509 --> 00:28:42.519 align:start position:0%
not dep language put in it so how would
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
you how would
 
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
you dispose of this if this line was
 
00:28:48.909 --> 00:28:48.919 align:start position:0%
taken out how would by direct deposit to
 
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
the banks of the employees Choice how
 
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:52.360 align:start position:0%
would you find that How would how would
 
00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:53.320 align:start position:0%
you be able
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
to enforce it enforce
 
00:28:56.399 --> 00:29:00.870 align:start position:0%
to enforce it enforce
that

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:05.590 align:start position:0%
 
Len

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
Cent and therefore the current bill
 
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:11.240 align:start position:0%
would not require um any type of written
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
authorization that that's what it looks
 
00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:16.120 align:start position:0%
like they're trying to do here exactly
 
00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
the way that the inspection unit then
 
00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
would they would be able to step over
 
00:29:21.909 --> 00:29:21.919 align:start position:0%
that one aspect of it that used to be in
 
00:29:24.669 --> 00:29:24.679 align:start position:0%
the law if this passes and look at the
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
fact that the employee did hand over
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
whatever information was
 
00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
required there may be a question as
 
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
to um whether the employee was forced to
 
00:29:37.389 --> 00:29:37.399 align:start position:0%
hand it over because that's the only
 
00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
option or and that's not something that
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
I would be able to dig into right now
 
00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
but if the employee willingly
 
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
voluntarily handed over his banking
 
00:29:46.509 --> 00:29:46.519 align:start position:0%
information for direct
 
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
deposit the department would be able to
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
consenting so if so if you're doing a
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
regular in fact in in if you you're
 
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
called in for a wage claim you would
 
00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
actually look at this and decide whether
 
00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:05.919 align:start position:0%
the employee was forced to participate
 
00:30:07.509 --> 00:30:07.519 align:start position:0%
in direct deposit or would this just be
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
a because it if the employee made a
 
00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
comment if there was a statement that
 
00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
was made that would be further down into
 
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
an inspection but looking at it at face
 
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
value if an employee again if this
 
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
language was
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
stricken if an
 
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
employee offered up their banking
 
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
information for direct deposit
 
00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:31.039 align:start position:0%
with this language being stricken the
 
00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:32.600 align:start position:0%
department would be able to look at that
 
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
during an inspection and be able to
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
determine that that was probably consent
 
00:30:40.029 --> 00:30:40.039 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for clarifying anything
 
00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
further than that would probably require
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
a hearing I know weren't prepared for
 
00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
this um it's okay top of your head any
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
kind of rules that you have in place
 
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
regarding this that helps you better the
 
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
hearing officer better Define this or
 
00:30:56.909 --> 00:30:56.919 align:start position:0%
the inspector to better define whether
 
00:30:59.350 --> 00:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
or not it was authorized in writing by
 
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:02.120 align:start position:0%
the employee
 
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't believe again I know that
 
00:31:07.149 --> 00:31:07.159 align:start position:0%
you were prepared for the questions um
 
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
and I hav bring my rules I haven't but I
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
did bring assistance okay yeah off the
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
top of our head I I don't know if
 
00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
there's a rule that better defines
 
00:31:16.269 --> 00:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
written authorization but we can
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
research that for you okay well is it is
 
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
anyone complaining that it's a problem
 
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
getting written authorization the
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
Inspection Division has not notified us
 
00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
that there has been a problem of maining
 
00:31:30.549 --> 00:31:30.559 align:start position:0%
authorization okay thank you thank
 
00:31:30.559 --> 00:31:32.509 align:start position:0%
authorization okay thank you thank
you

00:31:32.509 --> 00:31:32.519 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
so we don't have any interest in
 
00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
Striking that
 
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
sentence no
 
00:31:43.789 --> 00:31:43.799 align:start position:0%
no I'm going to go to the next one under
 
00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
D you can be paid by a payroll card
 
00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
provided that the employer shall provide
 
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
employee at least one free
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
means has been replaced with the
 
00:31:56.159 --> 00:31:58.909 align:start position:0%
means has been replaced with the
ability

00:31:58.909 --> 00:31:58.919 align:start position:0%
ability
 
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
I don't like that me
 
00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:03.880 align:start position:0%
neither um
 
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
we a Cornerstone of what we do here is
 
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
the employee gets their pay without a
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
fee the ability to withdraw up to
 
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
including the full
 
00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
fee am I missing something nope
 
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.430 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
so now I have to look at the amendment
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at Amendment C with
 
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
written authorization employ we've
 
00:32:47.629 --> 00:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
already agreed that that is going to
 
00:32:47.639 --> 00:32:49.950 align:start position:0%
already agreed that that is going to
stay

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.070 align:start position:0%
 
in

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:32:54.909 --> 00:32:54.919 align:start position:0%
um they have somehow I got to figure out
 
00:32:58.269 --> 00:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
how they've done this
 
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
at least one free means okay so in the
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
in the in the amendment they did put at
 
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.789 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:33:17.789 --> 00:33:17.799 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
okay so then we go down to further down
 
00:33:21.679 --> 00:33:23.950 align:start position:0%
okay so then we go down to further down
in

00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
D um their amend M did not address any
 
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
of these things so on line 15 starting
 
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
with if an employee is enabled to in
 
00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
ending on line 22 with the words 24
 
00:33:40.269 --> 00:33:40.279 align:start position:0%
hours being
 
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
sentence if an employee is unable to
 
00:33:49.389 --> 00:33:49.399 align:start position:0%
access their wages due to technical or
 
00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
processing de deficit the employer shall
 
00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
immediately provide the wages to the
 
00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
employee with a replace
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
debit card check or direct posit or cash
 
00:34:03.389 --> 00:34:03.399 align:start position:0%
I'm going to just do the first sentence
 
00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
first and we can deal with the second
 
00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
right let's think about it from this
 
00:34:12.829 --> 00:34:12.839 align:start position:0%
standpoint check cards are already legal
 
00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
people already have them so anything we
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
do here is we're trying to provide some
 
00:34:19.629 --> 00:34:19.639 align:start position:0%
kind of protection
 
00:34:23.109 --> 00:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
or Clarity M as to what should happen
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
when someone loses their pay
 
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
card if they're able to access their
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
wages due to technical or processing
 
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
deficit the employee shall immediately
 
00:34:33.149 --> 00:34:33.159 align:start position:0%
provide the wages to an employer with a
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
replacement card debit or whatever I
 
00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
don't like the word shall
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
immediately okay for a number of reasons
 
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:49.000 align:start position:0%
um that is hard to Define in law
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
immediately is right now the second
 
00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:54.839 align:start position:0%
after I just said it that's immediately
 
00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:56.919 align:start position:0%
one business day the next business day
 
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
or if sooner by the if the at the
 
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:03.640 align:start position:0%
employer the next business day or sooner
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
if can be you know by by the employer
 
00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839 align:start position:0%
something like
 
00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
that because it's it's tough here
 
00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
because well no you know I take that
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
back because this is because wages are
 
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
due but not able to because of Technical
 
00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:21.640 align:start position:0%
and processing deficit
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
okay def defect
 
00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
sorry as We Know
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
you do your pay
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
right what do you do when someone
 
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't pay the check balances or
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
whatever you say Department of Labor
 
00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.910 align:start position:0%
whatever you say Department of Labor
what

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:38.920 align:start position:0%

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
immediately well you have toine exactly
 
00:35:44.349 --> 00:35:44.359 align:start position:0%
so what what is it how do how do you you
 
00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
know someone calls up hi my pay was due

today it's at 3:30 I always get paid and
 
00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
I got this check card and it's not
 
00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
working and they say there's a technical
 
00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
problem or maybe my employer's check
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
didn't get there on time so there's no
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
money what are you going to do we going
 
00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
to call the
 
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
employer and
 
00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.359 align:start position:0%

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
then oh you're talking about as far as
 
00:36:12.349 --> 00:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
what the Department of Labor will do I
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
thought we were listening to the rest of
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
the story I apologize no
 
00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
I'm um so yeah if they call up the
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor the Department of
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
Labor the Inspection Division has the op
 
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
ability to contact the employer find out
 
00:36:26.349 --> 00:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
what happened instruct them on the law
 
00:36:28.109 --> 00:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
which is that they are entitled to their
 
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
pay on their payday and uh instruct that
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
employer to make sure that something is
 
00:36:37.589 --> 00:36:37.599 align:start position:0%
issued so that employee is paid on that
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
day whether it be check direct deposit
 
00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
cash gold and silver so what say you on
 
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
how we all agree that if a pay
 
00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
card craps
 
00:36:58.309 --> 00:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
out the money is not there for any does
 
00:36:58.319 --> 00:36:59.349 align:start position:0%
out the money is not there for any does
reason

00:36:59.349 --> 00:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
sunspots Verizon going down who knows
 
00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
anything the money is not
 
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
there what do we want to
 
00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
utilize for a term of when they need to
 
00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
day 24 hours within 12
 
00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
hours uh you know what or are you okay
 
00:37:27.309 --> 00:37:27.319 align:start position:0%
with immediately well I mean business
 
00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
day if it's the weekend and then you're
 
00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
not in business that day that's that's
 
00:37:32.309 --> 00:37:32.319 align:start position:0%
another hardship for the I don't like
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
that I I as I as I talk myself through
 
00:37:38.309 --> 00:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
it and out of it I agree the next
 
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
business day is not
 
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:52.349 --> 00:37:52.359 align:start position:0%
day I'm just saying the same day you're
 
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:53.720 align:start position:0%
supposed to get if the money's not there
 
00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
in your pay card my opinion m
 
00:38:01.309 --> 00:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
me a check yeah or cash right now and I
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
want to say immediately because it
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
immediately is within a second well
 
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:06.910 align:start position:0%
immediately is within a second well
that's

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
not right you got to give them a couple
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
hours maybe to figure out what the
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
problem is maybe the system reboots
 
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
itself and and two hours later it's
 
00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:18.280 align:start position:0%
there so that's why I said that the same
 
00:38:20.589 --> 00:38:20.599 align:start position:0%
day don't even say business day because
 
00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
Saturday and Sunday someone's check is
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
due on a Saturday right and it's not
 
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
day we get paid the big bucks for I
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
don't like it at all but this is to
 
00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:44.200 align:start position:0%
protect the employee if the employer has
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
deposited their pay into a pay card and
 
00:38:51.309 --> 00:38:51.319 align:start position:0%
whether it is the ATM or the car that is
 
00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:53.960 align:start position:0%
no longer working having the employer on
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
hook for sending that paycheck to the
 
00:38:59.230 --> 00:38:59.240 align:start position:0%
pay card now having to have them send a
 
00:39:02.309 --> 00:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
second week's pay to that employee you
 
00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
have you're forcing the employer to
 
00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
possibly pay them twice in the same day
 
00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
or week when some employeers might not
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
have that kind of cash on hand or they
 
00:39:12.309 --> 00:39:12.319 align:start position:0%
might use a sweep account where they
 
00:39:15.069 --> 00:39:15.079 align:start position:0%
can't sweep account till the next day or
 
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
they use a private company that might
 
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
not be open Saturday or Sunday to
 
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
authorize that transfer how do we
 
00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
protect the employer as well as the
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
employee by act with this type
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
of language I'm assuming this has
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
happened with debit cards in the past
 
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
where you may
 
00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:39.640 align:start position:0%
have $10,000 in the bank you go to an
 
00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:42.280 align:start position:0%
ATM and for whatever reason your card
 
00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
fails right you can't get you can't get
 
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
cash on the weekend sure what's
 
00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
happening you're not going to call
 
00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:49.400 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get a hold of
 
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
anybody at the bank nope figure it out
 
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
it's going to be on the next business
 
00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:53.829 align:start position:0%
it's going to be on the next business
day

00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:57.640 align:start position:0%
so I would like to know
 
00:39:59.349 --> 00:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
how they resolve those problems because
 
00:40:02.109 --> 00:40:02.119 align:start position:0%
again I don't think it's I mean it's it
 
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
can't it's got to
 
00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
happen how about if we break it down to
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
specifics if an employee is unable to
 
00:40:14.349 --> 00:40:14.359 align:start position:0%
access their wages due to a defective
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
card that way you're talking about a
 
00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
defective card this you know because you
 
00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:19.720 align:start position:0%
can call the system says no the money's
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
there everything's fine you're defective
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
card then they must immediately provide
 
00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
a replacement card check or
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
cash breaking it down to the scenario we
 
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
have a defective
 
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
card you okay with that no okay why so
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
if the if the like you said if you can
 
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
call in and the money is there the
 
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
employer paid them the employeer
 
00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:43.240 align:start position:0%
followed the law right if they can't
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
access their card because of a defect
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
why should the employer have to issue
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
them a check when they've already paid
 
00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:51.160 align:start position:0%
them how about a replacement card
 
00:40:52.589 --> 00:40:52.599 align:start position:0%
replacement card yes but everybody
 
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:55.079 align:start position:0%
charges six to 10 or $20 and then fees
 
00:40:58.589 --> 00:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
to get it EXP Ed or overnight delivery
 
00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
your employee is not going to have some
 
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
of these don't offer
 
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
employer issued
 
00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
cards so how would an employee be able
 
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
to do that gentleman from ADP said it
 
00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
would be an issue as well if it was a
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
Saturday because no way that ADP works
 
00:41:16.109 --> 00:41:16.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to I can issue you a card
 
00:41:17.309 --> 00:41:17.319 align:start position:0%
sure I can give you a card it's not
 
00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:19.720 align:start position:0%
going to be connected to anything until
 
00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
let's look at the second
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
sentence okay since we none of us like
 
00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
the way the first sentences were down
 
00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm looking to protect the employee
 
00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
here MH okay to get their
 
00:41:31.309 --> 00:41:31.319 align:start position:0%
money they got to pay their bill they
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
got to put gas in their car they got to
 
00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
have their money second sentence if an
 
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
employee debit card is lost stolen or
 
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
damaged such the funds are no longer
 
00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
accessible to the employee the employer
 
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
shall provide the employee with a
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
replacement employee debit card within
 
00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
notified is that an
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
acceptable so we're adding another layer
 
00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
of buau ocy to an employer because they
 
00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
choose pay cards which they some of
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
these don't offer the ability for the
 
00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:05.800 align:start position:0%
employer to hand their employee A card
 
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
without some type of processing with the
 
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
payroll card provider their bank and
 
00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:15.400 align:start position:0%
possibly a third party that would load
 
00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:23.190 align:start position:0%
possibly a third party that would load
that

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:25.549 --> 00:42:25.559 align:start position:0%
card but all you're asking to do is
 
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
replace provide another card if they
 
00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
lose their card L know whether it's
 
00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
their fault or not if they choose to
 
00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.470 align:start position:0%
their fault or not if they choose to
take

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
take
 
00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:38.200 align:start position:0%
use a a payroll card they're going have
 
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
to pay the fee correct but it's within
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
24 hours of being notified if I'm
 
00:42:44.589 --> 00:42:44.599 align:start position:0%
notified at 6 o'clock on a Friday I
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
can't provide them with a card till
 
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
Monday well you probably will because
 
00:42:49.549 --> 00:42:49.559 align:start position:0%
you get a you get
 
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
a um the way these things work MH is you
 
00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
get this card reader mhm M okay and you
 
00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
got all these blank cards you ever go to
 
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
the get a get a gift card for Christmas
 
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
you pick up one of the pretty ones
 
00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
Dunkin Donuts and you take it and you
 
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
hand it the guy and say to $25 on this
 
00:43:08.069 --> 00:43:08.079 align:start position:0%
and they swipe it and they put the thing
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
in well that's what you would do as an
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
employer correct if that if that certain
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
Payroll Company offered that there are
 
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
other ones out here that do not but all
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
you're saying is so you're saying what
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
happens if I don't have I don't have
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
those okay so you're in your example you
 
00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
have a CPA that does your payroll right
 
00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:28.280 align:start position:0%
and if the CPA is closed on the weekend
 
00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:30.079 align:start position:0%
mhm and they're the ones that have the
 
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
the cards and they do all that you're
 
00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
going to say you're not going to be able
 
00:43:35.309 --> 00:43:35.319 align:start position:0%
to buy by that it would be impossible
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
because they're closed all right I'm
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
going to play Devil's Advocate because
 
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
that's what we do here what are we going
 
00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:42.200 align:start position:0%
to do about the employee that needs his
 
00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
pay I'm we're going on how this is
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
written not in a h hypothetical because
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to give them their pay if they
 
00:43:50.549 --> 00:43:50.559 align:start position:0%
can't access their card how but they
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
need I would pay them however they need
 
00:43:55.349 --> 00:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
to be paid but I don't want to be forced
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
into a box Bo by forcing to pay them
 
00:43:59.870 --> 00:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
twice if the employee comes to me and
 
00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:01.640 align:start position:0%
says hey I can't access my car blah blah
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
blah I we're going away this weekend all
 
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
right here's a check you know when you
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
get back we'll settle
 
00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:09.800 align:start position:0%
up that would be that's
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
how as a small employer I would do I
 
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
know large employers can't do that but
 
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
when you have a card that's no longer
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
functional the money is in that account
 
00:44:23.549 --> 00:44:23.559 align:start position:0%
in cyberspace M okay the card's not
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
working to grab it out of space you give
 
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
them a new card the money is still there
 
00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
in cyberspace and goes to the new card
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
you're not paying them twice correct
 
00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
well what's the difference between a
 
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:37.720 align:start position:0%
direct deposit into your account that
 
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
account you going to go to your employer
 
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
and say I want a new card because I
 
00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:47.720 align:start position:0%
can't access my wages that's not that's
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
the bank's problem with their debit card
 
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
should be the payroll company's problem
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
by not letting them access their money
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
with debit with check cards it does not
 
00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
become the check card company's problem
 
00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
it becomes the employer problem who is
 
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
utilizing the payroll cards they've
 
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
taken that
 
00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility that that's what they're
 
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
going to do to use the payroll
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
cards so all I'm saying is if the
 
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
employer as this is written right now we

department look at that because I'm I'm
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
as I'm reading this the Department's
 
00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:36.839 align:start position:0%
going to be knocking on their door
 
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.280 align:start position:0%

00:46:42.549 --> 00:46:42.559 align:start position:0%
they doing now yeah what's your
 
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
experience been with payroll
 
00:46:47.349 --> 00:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
cards very minimal actually minimal
 
00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:49.480 align:start position:0%
experience we've had um we've had some
 
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
calls about complaints that came from
 
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
both the employees and the
 
00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
employers um but there's only been a
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
couple of them where there's been an
 
00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:00.200 align:start position:0%
issue with respect to um being paid
 
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
correctly and those are a little
 
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
different situation those are more with
 
00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
the daily cards that they have where
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
they have U paid by daily I'm not even
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
going to get into that but your question
 
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
there one to hear that yeah I thought so
 
00:47:16.589 --> 00:47:16.599 align:start position:0%
um your question about what would happen
 
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
in a situation like that it the employer
 
00:47:20.589 --> 00:47:20.599 align:start position:0%
remains responsible for making sure that
 
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
that employee is paid receives his pay
 
00:47:25.549 --> 00:47:25.559 align:start position:0%
and has access to his pay on his payday
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
and anything after that could be subject
 
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
to number one a Heering to a potential
 
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
violation um in a situation where
 
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
there's uh an issue with the pay card
 
00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:38.200 align:start position:0%
the employer's responsibility does not
 
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
go away that doesn't change you can't
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
shift that responsibility to a pay card
 
00:47:44.829 --> 00:47:44.839 align:start position:0%
company that's a discussion you can have
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
with the pay card company but it's not a
 
00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:47.800 align:start position:0%
shift of
 
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility as far as if you were to
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
have a pay card that was not operational
 
00:47:58.589 --> 00:47:58.599 align:start position:0%
and you're concerned rightfully so
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
making two payments now you have one
 
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
payment sitting on a pay card and one
 
00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
payment that you're going to have to
 
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
make Maybe by check by cash by direct
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
deposit you also have under Section 48
 
00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
where you can get a writing the employee
 
00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
and the employer agree in writing to
 
00:48:17.589 --> 00:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
terms of repayment of an overpayment and
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
this can be done at the same time as
 
00:48:21.549 --> 00:48:21.559 align:start position:0%
you're handing them their replacement
 
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
check at that time so you would put in
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
it can't be any more than 20 % of the
 
00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
gross pay that would normally be taken
 
00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
you know each week um there are
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
limitations to it but the employee can
 
00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
in writing agree to doing that and so
 
00:48:38.589 --> 00:48:38.599 align:start position:0%
the employer would then have the ability
 
00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursed if there was an overpayment
 
00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:44.440 align:start position:0%
there's also the possibility and I don't
 
00:48:46.109 --> 00:48:46.119 align:start position:0%
know if any of those cards have the
 
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
ability to cancel out an amount if
 
00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:51.160 align:start position:0%
you're handing them a check that's
 
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
something worth considering I'm not sure
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
if that would work though if it's paid
 
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
later than the day of payday I don't
 
00:48:59.549 --> 00:48:59.559 align:start position:0%
want to get into um the double payment
 
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
right now okay because there's no way
 
00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:03.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to solve that today there's
 
00:49:04.349 --> 00:49:04.359 align:start position:0%
no way we're going to work oursel
 
00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
through all the different scenarios
 
00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
here if the next 15 minutes if we can't
 
00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:12.200 align:start position:0%
come up with something then we're just
 
00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:13.960 align:start position:0%
going to you know not agree to this
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
entire Amendment here or this entire
 
00:49:20.789 --> 00:49:20.799 align:start position:0%
portion of the bill I'm concerned with a
 
00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
card that is damaged you know you ever
 
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
you you put a pay card up to the back of
 
00:49:27.789 --> 00:49:27.799 align:start position:0%
a cell phone you know what happens you
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
ever been to a hotel and your card
 
00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't work in the hotel because it was
 
00:49:32.829 --> 00:49:32.839 align:start position:0%
next to your cell phone it demagnetized
 
00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:34.640 align:start position:0%
itself it
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
happens um so you know somehow my card
 
00:49:41.589 --> 00:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
got demagnetized so the strips not
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
working I just want a new card don't we
 
00:49:47.309 --> 00:49:47.319 align:start position:0%
think the employee should be have have
 
00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
access to a card with a new card if it's
 
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
just a lost stolen or whatever because
 
00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
if it's l lost or stolen it doesn't
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
matter the money is still sitting in the
 
00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:01.240 align:start position:0%
cloud it's just a the card is just a
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
mechanism to get it so giving them a new
 
00:50:06.109 --> 00:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
card allows them to access it has
 
00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:07.880 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with if it's the the
 
00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:08.870 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with if it's the the
payroll

00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
payroll
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
company doesn't have the funds there or
 
00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
something like that it's just a new card
 
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
that's all I'm trying to get at do we
 
00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
think there should be a certain specific
 
00:50:20.349 --> 00:50:20.359 align:start position:0%
amount of time upon the employee let's
 
00:50:21.789 --> 00:50:21.799 align:start position:0%
say it's not even payday let's say it's
 
00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
five four days after payday okay and
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
your card's not working
 
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
okay should you be able to get a new pay
 
00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:34.040 align:start position:0%
card within within 24 hours I think you
 
00:50:37.789 --> 00:50:37.799 align:start position:0%
should it cost you $30 okay well that's
 
00:50:39.549 --> 00:50:39.559 align:start position:0%
that's the choice the employer made with
 
00:50:41.069 --> 00:50:41.079 align:start position:0%
the employee when they decided to use
 
00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
the damn
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
things but none of the this last
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
sentence none of the employer costs asso
 
00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:49.880 align:start position:0%
with associated with the payable card or
 
00:50:51.309 --> 00:50:51.319 align:start position:0%
payroll account should be passed on to
 
00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
the employee would that be passing on
 
00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:55.640 align:start position:0%
the cost of a a payment card to to the
 
00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
employee by having it overnighted from
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:07.640 align:start position:0%
delivery I would assume that we could in
 
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
language that would have to come out
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
coming up with this bill figuring it out
 
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
if the fees are the problem I mean do we
 
00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:17.640 align:start position:0%
come out with something that says
 
00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:19.640 align:start position:0%
there's no fees to the
 
00:51:23.789 --> 00:51:23.799 align:start position:0%
employee I mean I was actually going to
 
00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:26.680 align:start position:0%
talk to my comrade over here here and
 
00:51:29.069 --> 00:51:29.079 align:start position:0%
tell him to bring that up because it's
 
00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:30.680 align:start position:0%
the biggest poison pill you've ever seen
 
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
on the piece of legislation ever fine no
 
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:34.390 align:start position:0%
on the piece of legislation ever fine no
fees

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
fees
 
00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
ever I'm sure the sponsors won't
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate that but that is I go to the
 
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
bank with my debit card or I go to the
 
00:51:44.069 --> 00:51:44.079 align:start position:0%
store I'm not getting charged fees for a
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
debit card then I you
 
00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
know that's the key right there because
 
00:51:50.589 --> 00:51:50.599 align:start position:0%
they fee you from having the checking
 
00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
account to begin with well he pay me
 
00:51:56.109 --> 00:51:56.119 align:start position:0%
Interest that's true um so so yes that
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
would be um that is actually something
 
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
that we could state that no fees can be
 
00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
passed on to the employee well obviously
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:13.960 align:start position:0%
it in a business from a business
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
standpoint a non-starter then no one
 
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
would do it no pay card companies would
 
00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:19.640 align:start position:0%
engage in
 
00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
that well again I think if this is an
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
option for
 
00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
employers and
 
00:52:30.789 --> 00:52:30.799 align:start position:0%
it's difficult by lot with a lot of
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
things that are going to come down on
 
00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:32.710 align:start position:0%
things that are going to come down on
the

00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:35.549 --> 00:52:35.559 align:start position:0%
employer a lot of employers may decide
 
00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
that they don't want to use the pay
 
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
cards as a means and stay with direct
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
deposit and I guess I'm I'm looking for
 
00:52:47.549 --> 00:52:47.559 align:start position:0%
what the advantage of the pay card is um
 
00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
overall that's I guess I I haven't found
 
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
that and if somebody has an answer for
 
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
that that would be great I mean I
 
00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
cheaper than I guess a $20 as they
 
00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
estimate the cost to process a check per
 
00:53:02.309 --> 00:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
pay period does it cost anything for I
 
00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
mean loo you have a business direct
 
00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:05.839 align:start position:0%
deposit is there
 
00:53:09.069 --> 00:53:09.079 align:start position:0%
anything minimal okay 22 cents if
 
00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:12.760 align:start position:0%
anything to initiate an a I was talking
 
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
to representative Ross Barry before he
 
00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
came up here and he uses TD
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
Bank and um for direct deposit and I
 
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
think it's like $5 a month whether he
 
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
has one employee or three
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
00 he pays one fee of $500 a month to
 
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
have all his employees receive direct
 
00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:35.240 align:start position:0%
deposit yeah we pay a flat weekly
 
00:53:38.789 --> 00:53:38.799 align:start position:0%
fee is the employer getting fees on
 
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
these cards I mean that he has to pay he
 
00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
or she has to pay
 
00:53:47.470 --> 00:53:47.480 align:start position:0%
um I've never I've never used
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
them I'm sure there's a fee guarantee
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
there's a fee there's a fee to use any
 
00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
payroll company they have to get paid
 
00:53:57.309 --> 00:53:57.319 align:start position:0%
right right to to provide a
 
00:53:57.319 --> 00:53:58.870 align:start position:0%
right right to to provide a
service

00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:54:02.789 --> 00:54:02.799 align:start position:0%
but their I think their point is it's
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
cheaper for the
 
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
employee excuse me it's cheaper for the
 
00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
employer than the cost of a
 
00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
check process check get it done FedEx it
 
00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:19.640 align:start position:0%
over you know yeah yeah so the people
 
00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:26.109 --> 00:54:26.119 align:start position:0%
is people that don't have direct deposit
 
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
that may not have a bank account in
 
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
general they're going to go with these
 
00:54:32.309 --> 00:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
cards well that's or they're going to
 
00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
get a papercheck can I be really blunt
 
00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
sure payroll cards are used for a lot of
 
00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:42.280 align:start position:0%
people that are receiving compensation
 
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
it I mean you take advantage of someone
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
that that comes to immigrates here
 
00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:55.950 align:start position:0%
that that comes to immigrates here
illegally

00:54:55.950 --> 00:54:55.960 align:start position:0%
illegally
 
00:54:58.589 --> 00:54:58.599 align:start position:0%
and they're working just to feed
 
00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:00.280 align:start position:0%
themselves you know if you're going to
 
00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:01.069 align:start position:0%
themselves you know if you're going to
do

00:55:01.069 --> 00:55:01.079 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
that pay them cash I don't if you're
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
going to choose to do that as an
 
00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:07.640 align:start position:0%
employer that's fine I'm not going to Pi
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
any dispersions on you but at least pay
 
00:55:11.549 --> 00:55:11.559 align:start position:0%
him cash don't give him one of these
 
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
things and I think some people I mean
 
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
93% according to their own figures 93%
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
of the people get direct deposit in this
 
00:55:21.309 --> 00:55:21.319 align:start position:0%
state mhm okay so we're talking about 7%
 
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
of 750,000 people that are employed
 
00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:27.400 align:start position:0%
that's 49 50,000 people that we're
 
00:55:30.029 --> 00:55:30.039 align:start position:0%
talking about here
 
00:55:30.039 --> 00:55:31.789 align:start position:0%
talking about here
um

00:55:31.789 --> 00:55:31.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:31.799 --> 00:55:33.750 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
um I I I don't like it because I think
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:41.240 align:start position:0%
mechanism I'm showing my age here right
 
00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
remember the old days when you used to
 
00:55:45.789 --> 00:55:45.799 align:start position:0%
go to the airport mhm cash a check no to
 
00:55:47.549 --> 00:55:47.559 align:start position:0%
go to the airport to cash a check well
 
00:55:49.309 --> 00:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
the no but you go to the airport and
 
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
they actually actually gave you some
 
00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
service now I go I put my own stuff in I
 
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
get my own tag I buy the whole thing and
 
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
I bring it up M oh and if and then
 
00:55:58.190 --> 00:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to charge me $25 if you
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
want you to do it so I don't you do it
 
00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:01.480 align:start position:0%
yourself I mean think about all the
 
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
things that we have done in this country
 
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
where we used to provide services
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
employeers used to provide services and
 
00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
now you selfs Serve Yourself Mr chairman
 
00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:14.799 align:start position:0%
I'm surprised because if you fly first
 
00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
class they do that
 
00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:19.640 align:start position:0%
all so I would assume you fly first you
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
don't fly first
 
00:56:23.789 --> 00:56:23.799 align:start position:0%
class I don't fly
 
00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes but I flew last week on spirit
 
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
in the first class seats up front but
 
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
anyway um it's just a
 
00:56:40.109 --> 00:56:40.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:44.029 --> 00:56:44.039 align:start position:0%
don't I don't like the inference of why
 
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
card and I think sometimes you have to
 
00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
think why doesn't someone want a
 
00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:53.870 align:start position:0%
think why doesn't someone want a
checking

00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
checking
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
account well there are some fees I don't
 
00:56:59.309 --> 00:56:59.319 align:start position:0%
like them either you know I probably pay
 
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
10 or 12 bucks a month to have a
 
00:57:06.349 --> 00:57:06.359 align:start position:0%
checking account at at my bank so
 
00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
um you know why doesn't someone want a
 
00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:12.190 align:start position:0%
um you know why doesn't someone want a
checking

00:57:12.190 --> 00:57:12.200 align:start position:0%
checking
 
00:57:14.349 --> 00:57:14.359 align:start position:0%
account okay that's their choice but at
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
least if they get a check they go to the
 
00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
place that they choose where they can
 
00:57:22.349 --> 00:57:22.359 align:start position:0%
get it
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
free they don't have to have a checkm
 
00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:25.549 align:start position:0%
free they don't have to have a checkm
account

00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
account
 
00:57:29.109 --> 00:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
mhm and I I don't think we should
 
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
legislature that you can be forced
 
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
check I'm in circles here let's get back
 
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
to what we're doing here I want to go
 
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
back just a few more years uh to where
 
00:57:54.309 --> 00:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
you would go to a bank drawn on that
 
00:57:56.910 --> 00:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
bank and they would not charge you $7 to
 
00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
cash it because you don't have an
 
00:57:58.200 --> 00:57:59.789 align:start position:0%
cash it because you don't have an
account

00:57:59.789 --> 00:57:59.799 align:start position:0%
account
 
00:58:02.349 --> 00:58:02.359 align:start position:0%
there but uh Credit Unions generally
 
00:58:04.109 --> 00:58:04.119 align:start position:0%
don't do that and they also don't have
 
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
those wacky monthly balances things um I
 
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
don't like the idea that you have that
 
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
the check in this amendment has to be
 
00:58:14.109 --> 00:58:14.119 align:start position:0%
upon request okay I I like I like it
 
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
like here's here's your meth methods you
 
00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
can choose which one is best for you and
 
00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:21.400 align:start position:0%
if the check is on that list and it
 
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
should be then that's what I want to do
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
so line 15 starting with the words if an
 
00:58:29.789 --> 00:58:29.799 align:start position:0%
employee and line 22 ending with being
 
00:58:32.109 --> 00:58:32.119 align:start position:0%
notified we don't like any of it I don't
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
I don't like the whole thing
 
00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
24e um there is a two lines that are
 
00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
crossed out I'd like you to turn to the
 
00:58:50.829 --> 00:58:50.839 align:start position:0%
amendment um
 
00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
where they have added a few other lines
 
00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
here take a second to look at it uh cuz
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
I um can't see where they're trying to
 
00:59:01.029 --> 00:59:01.039 align:start position:0%
inject this thing I don't know if it's a
 
00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:05.480 align:start position:0%
whole brand new e or not doesn't no
 
00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
there if I may yes they're making it
 
00:59:11.589 --> 00:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
that the employee has to request a check
 
00:59:18.109 --> 00:59:18.119 align:start position:0%
right um from a from b c and d the
 
00:59:20.109 --> 00:59:20.119 align:start position:0%
default was always if you didn't get
 
00:59:22.589 --> 00:59:22.599 align:start position:0%
their direct deposit information if you
 
00:59:25.069 --> 00:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
couldn't initiate an EFT to something
 
00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:27.839 align:start position:0%
that they were using um the default was
 
00:59:30.190 --> 00:59:30.200 align:start position:0%
always issuing them a check because they
 
00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.839 align:start position:0%
did not provide the information right
 
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
um further down in this that we haven't
 
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
got to yet takes that away and makes it
 
00:59:41.549 --> 00:59:41.559 align:start position:0%
a request of the employee so it's not an
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
automatic default of people who may not
 
00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:45.640 align:start position:0%
have or companies that may not have
 
00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:47.640 align:start position:0%
access to payroll cards which is your
 
00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
smaller local CPAs little little payroll
 
00:59:54.510 --> 00:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
firms that do um all the all your you
 
00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
know you know maybe don't have access to
 
00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:58.710 align:start position:0%
know you know maybe don't have access to
payroll

00:59:58.710 --> 00:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
payroll
 
01:00:03.150 --> 01:00:03.160 align:start position:0%
cards um this would make them if it
 
01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.950 align:start position:0%
cards um this would make them if it
passed

01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
non-compliant by not being able to offer
 
01:00:12.589 --> 01:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
payall cards in sections further down in
 
01:00:15.029 --> 01:00:15.039 align:start position:0%
this bill which we'll get
 
01:00:16.829 --> 01:00:16.839 align:start position:0%
to and then I'm going to ask the
 
01:00:18.069 --> 01:00:18.079 align:start position:0%
department how they would take care of
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
that go ahead because I'm confused so
 
01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:23.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:23.559 --> 01:00:25.549 align:start position:0%
 
read

01:00:25.549 --> 01:00:25.559 align:start position:0%
read
 
01:00:28.109 --> 01:00:28.119 align:start position:0%
so further down in the
 
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
Bell um page
 
01:00:40.029 --> 01:00:40.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:43.710 --> 01:00:43.720 align:start position:0%
24 a paywall company that does not have
 
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
access to paywall cards in absence an
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:56.109 --> 01:00:56.119 align:start position:0%
of banking information to have their
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
direct deposit initiated would be forced
 
01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:03.350 align:start position:0%
to pay by a payroll card would that be
 
01:01:03.350 --> 01:01:06.990 align:start position:0%
to pay by a payroll card would that be
[Music]

01:01:06.990 --> 01:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
correct in the way that the bill is
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.470 align:start position:0%
 
MH

01:01:25.470 --> 01:01:25.480 align:start position:0%
MH
 
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
there I'm sorry guys I haven't eaten yet
 
01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
figure the language is uh verbose but um
 
01:01:55.470 --> 01:01:55.480 align:start position:0%
I think the answer is likely yes
 
01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
that question would they be forced into
 
01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:06.440 align:start position:0%
paying with the pay card it was page two
 
01:02:11.069 --> 01:02:11.079 align:start position:0%
part yeah 21 through yes um If an
 
01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:12.839 align:start position:0%
employer that wishes to only offer
 
01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:14.799 align:start position:0%
electronic wage payments so they don't
 
01:02:19.789 --> 01:02:19.799 align:start position:0%
want to have checks they can offer b c
 
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
and d let's just
 
01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
say there would be forced with in the
 
01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:33.160 align:start position:0%
consent to a payroll card so you have my
 
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
payroll company doesn't offer let's say
 
01:02:36.589 --> 01:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
a pay company doesn't offer payroll
 
01:02:41.269 --> 01:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
cards but they offer now BC and
 
01:02:44.309 --> 01:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
E by changing the wording in
 
01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:48.200 align:start position:0%
E would be forcing them smaller pay
 
01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
companies who do not have access to
 
01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
payroll cards being out of compliance
 
01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
with this if they pay company does not
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
employee how would the department look
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
at that payroll company and saying
 
01:03:05.069 --> 01:03:05.079 align:start position:0%
you're no longer in compliance because
 
01:03:07.109 --> 01:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
you cannot offer payroll cards and
 
01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:09.160 align:start position:0%
effectively possibly putting them out of
 
01:03:11.069 --> 01:03:11.079 align:start position:0%
business or forcing them into a contract
 
01:03:13.109 --> 01:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
with the payall card company outside of
 
01:03:13.119 --> 01:03:15.910 align:start position:0%
with the payall card company outside of
their

01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:19.799 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction a lot it's okay there the
 
01:03:21.789 --> 01:03:21.799 align:start position:0%
only way to get
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
there I mean fundamentally at the end of
 
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
the day the respon responsibilities on
 
01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
the employer to to pay what regardless
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
of their arrangement with the payroll
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
company they have to be able to provide
 
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
that pay without any cost to the
 
01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:37.720 align:start position:0%
employees or any fee to the employees so
 
01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
no matter how how the employer and the
 
01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:43.240 align:start position:0%
payroll company uh arrange that that
 
01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately when it comes to an
 
01:03:48.029 --> 01:03:48.039 align:start position:0%
enforcement action um that potential
 
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
employer so if my one of my employees
 
01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
said Okay I want I I'm not giving you my
 
01:03:58.910 --> 01:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
payroll information I'm not giving you
 
01:04:00.549 --> 01:04:00.559 align:start position:0%
my bank
 
01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:02.599 align:start position:0%
information with the changes that are
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
here now defaulting to a payroll card my
 
01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:07.960 align:start position:0%
companyes let's just say my company
 
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't offer payroll
 
01:04:12.190 --> 01:04:12.200 align:start position:0%
cards they they go to you guys and say
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
well he's not giving me a payroll card
 
01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:15.880 align:start position:0%
even though I'm entitled to it by law
 
01:04:17.589 --> 01:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen to that employer
 
01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
and that payroll company pay company
 
01:04:20.549 --> 01:04:20.559 align:start position:0%
going to get fined because they're out
 
01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
of compliance possibly by not the do but
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
maybe somebody else
 
01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:26.039 align:start position:0%
and what is the employer going to be on
 
01:04:27.309 --> 01:04:27.319 align:start position:0%
the hook
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
for so it would be the employer election
 
01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
on how they wish to pay if the employee
 
01:04:34.029 --> 01:04:34.039 align:start position:0%
doesn't offer payroll cards then they
 
01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
don't have to as is the current law yes
 
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799 align:start position:0%
but with this change shall pay tells me
 
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
as an employer I have to pay by payroll
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
card in absence of and he didn't request
 
01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
a pay for check MH now I'm forced to pay
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:08.680 align:start position:0%
yes employ offers its employees the
 
01:05:10.589 --> 01:05:10.599 align:start position:0%
option of receiving wages by payroll
 
01:05:13.390 --> 01:05:13.400 align:start position:0%
cards so if the employer is not offering
 
01:05:14.829 --> 01:05:14.839 align:start position:0%
that option and they've elected some
 
01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
other payment you could arguably say
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
that the requirements to pay via payroll
 
01:05:23.109 --> 01:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
card um would not fall under that
 
01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:25.240 align:start position:0%
umbrella um um if the employee is not
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
providing the direct deposit that being
 
01:05:30.549 --> 01:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
said if you're looking at provision to
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
the kind of Standalone it does look like
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
it makes a mandate that in the absence
 
01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
of that information being provided
 
01:05:37.829 --> 01:05:37.839 align:start position:0%
that's going to be the default for the
 
01:05:40.829 --> 01:05:40.839 align:start position:0%
employer so I think if there's any the
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
language may need to be cleaned up if
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
there's any intent to go forward with
 
01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
that I think you could arguably say that
 
01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
if the employer doesn't option offer the
 
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
option at all to to pay the a payroll
 
01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
card then the provisions of 2B in the
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
proposed language would not
 
01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
apply but again I I it's not I don't
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
think it's terribly clearly drafted I
 
01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
don't again the warning is very strong
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
in paragraph B but if you're reading it
 
01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:05.720 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with the opening
 
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph of two
 
01:06:11.269 --> 01:06:11.279 align:start position:0%
um I think you can construe it that way
 
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
and I'll defer to attorney garan if he
 
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
thinks my reading is a that was a much
 
01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:18.760 align:start position:0%
more elegant way of saying what I was
 
01:06:24.430 --> 01:06:24.440 align:start position:0%
trying to say it was but if the upon if
 
01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
um e in the in the original proposed
 
01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:36.200 align:start position:0%
language not in the amendment yes in the
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
out so now what default from okay I only
 
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
offer uh EFT or
 
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
direct deposit so I only offer
 
01:06:58.109 --> 01:06:58.119 align:start position:0%
electronic means we don't have checks we
 
01:07:00.269 --> 01:07:00.279 align:start position:0%
haven't used checks in 20 years we're
 
01:07:02.910 --> 01:07:02.920 align:start position:0%
you know we're with the time so we're
 
01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
whatever now it's telling me I have to
 
01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
pay by payroll card in absence of Bank
 
01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
information because the default of
 
01:07:13.069 --> 01:07:13.079 align:start position:0%
having of being able to write a check
 
01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
because I don't have Bank information is
 
01:07:16.789 --> 01:07:16.799 align:start position:0%
withdrawn because the employee has to
 
01:07:18.269 --> 01:07:18.279 align:start position:0%
consent to having a
 
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
payable uh being cut a live
 
01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
check whether it's in in here or in the
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
amendment either
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
way I think that that that initiating
 
01:07:32.269 --> 01:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
clause in section two I'm looking at
 
01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
this is the original Bill page two line
 
01:07:38.109 --> 01:07:38.119 align:start position:0%
five puts a conditional clause on if the
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
employee if the employer offers its
 
01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
employees the option of receiving wages
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
by payroll card so if that's not an
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:59.309 align:start position:0%
 
anyway

01:07:59.309 --> 01:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:01.880 align:start position:0%
all right so do we pretty much agree
 
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
that we do not like U the changes on
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
lines 26 through
 
01:08:14.470 --> 01:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
Bill oh I
 
01:08:19.390 --> 01:08:19.400 align:start position:0%
don't Crossing all that out you don't
 
01:08:21.070 --> 01:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
agree to it I don't I don't like that oh
 
01:08:23.550 --> 01:08:23.560 align:start position:0%
nor do I do we all agree we do not want
 
01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
that crossed out we do not
 
01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
okay I want to jump to page two lines
 
01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
three and four nothing in this section
 
01:08:35.070 --> 01:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
prohibit an employee or organization
 
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
labor group negotiating the method of
 
01:08:40.030 --> 01:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:43.229 --> 01:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
employer is there any problem with that
 
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
not they going to pass a bill just for
 
01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
that sentence but
 
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
is I don't think anybody should be cared
 
01:08:52.189 --> 01:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
out why should a private employer who
 
01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't have Union
 
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
coverage be forced to abide by a
 
01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:05.470 --> 01:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
CBA they do on a lot of things they do
 
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
but we carve them out on a lot of things
 
01:09:08.910 --> 01:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
when we we're talking about payment of
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
wages why should they be upheld to a
 
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
different standard than everybody else
 
01:09:14.349 --> 01:09:14.359 align:start position:0%
because that that if that's what the
 
01:09:16.749 --> 01:09:16.759 align:start position:0%
contract negotiators come up with with
 
01:09:16.759 --> 01:09:18.349 align:start position:0%
contract negotiators come up with with
the

01:09:18.349 --> 01:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
employer just saying we're carving out
 
01:09:24.269 --> 01:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
that specific
 
01:09:24.279 --> 01:09:25.149 align:start position:0%
that specific
part

01:09:25.149 --> 01:09:25.159 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
of W uh people that people that have
 
01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
wages what do they do with their wage
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
claims they go to the CBA or they go to
 
01:09:31.679 --> 01:09:34.709 align:start position:0%
claims they go to the CBA or they go to
the

01:09:34.709 --> 01:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:36.749 --> 01:09:36.759 align:start position:0%
labor you understand where where he's
 
01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
trying to be consistent y
 
01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
okay um well if that's the only thing we
 
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
agree on we may not just pass the Bill
 
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll wait and
 
01:09:51.309 --> 01:09:51.319 align:start position:0%
see um going down to lines 16 through
 
01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
24 uh which is what you just talked
 
01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:54.269 align:start position:0%
24 uh which is what you just talked
about

01:09:54.269 --> 01:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:09:54.279 --> 01:09:56.229 align:start position:0%
about
right

01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
um we're not in favor of that oh no okay
 
01:10:02.189 --> 01:10:02.199 align:start position:0%
and now all that
 
01:10:02.199 --> 01:10:03.910 align:start position:0%
and now all that
removement

01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
removement
 
01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
correct so getting down to line 27 and
 
01:10:08.719 --> 01:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
correct so getting down to line 27 and
28

01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:09.810 align:start position:0%
28
 
01:10:09.810 --> 01:10:17.910 align:start position:0%
28
[Music]

01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:20.669 --> 01:10:20.679 align:start position:0%
um so again they they want to take out
 
01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
the that the employee voluntarily
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
consents and make it a mandatory
 
01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:27.080 align:start position:0%
issue from the employer from I read it
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
from B going into C starting in part one
 
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
I mean they interconnect to forcing an
 
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
card so now look at the
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
amendment page
 
01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:48.280 align:start position:0%
two in
 
01:10:51.149 --> 01:10:51.159 align:start position:0%
bold has failed to provide I'm trying to
 
01:10:53.709 --> 01:10:53.719 align:start position:0%
see what the difference is fa to provide
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
they need that in order to force the
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
payments okay it's the same thing okay
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
except they added an employee request a
 
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
B okay so someone that gets a
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
check if they don't have a bank account
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
now would have to go to the bank that
 
01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
maybe the business is doing banking with
 
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
right for no fee because I think if you
 
01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:27.590 align:start position:0%
right for no fee because I think if you
go

01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
go
 
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
to I don't even know because I haven't
 
01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
dealt with checks in so long can they
 
01:11:33.149 --> 01:11:33.159 align:start position:0%
even go to another bank to cash a check
 
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
that they don't have an account with you
 
01:11:39.229 --> 01:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
no it's one they can go to any Bank
 
01:11:42.189 --> 01:11:42.199 align:start position:0%
probably show their ID and pay a fee a
 
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
lot of banks still don't like to do that
 
01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
so it's difficult which is why they must
 
01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
provide a bank or a place for them to do
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
it for
 
01:11:53.669 --> 01:11:53.679 align:start position:0%
free you can go to a supermarket yeah
 
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
Supermarket Walmart but you're all
 
01:11:56.669 --> 01:11:56.679 align:start position:0%
you're going to pay a fee at all those
 
01:11:59.310 --> 01:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
places I think it's minimal still that's
 
01:12:00.669 --> 01:12:00.679 align:start position:0%
another option well there's check
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
cashing companies and or you could have
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
your certificant
 
01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
other who does have a bank account
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
cash well I had when I the last time I
 
01:12:16.189 --> 01:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
had live checks um bank my bank um they
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
could go to my bank and they would
 
01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
automatically cash in that was our
 
01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
relationship because that's where the
 
01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:25.480 align:start position:0%
check was drawn off that's and it was
 
01:12:27.149 --> 01:12:27.159 align:start position:0%
you know Regional blah blah blah the
 
01:12:29.149 --> 01:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
whole thing so it wasn't it didn't never
 
01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:31.400 align:start position:0%
came up as an
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
issue so now okay line 32 on page
 
01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
two and instead to receive wages via
 
01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:42.510 align:start position:0%
two and instead to receive wages via
direct

01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:42.520 align:start position:0%
direct
 
01:12:45.870 --> 01:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
deposit the proposed amendment would be
 
01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:47.189 align:start position:0%
deposit the proposed amendment would be
the

01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
same instead to receive wages via direct
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
deposit or paper
 
01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:55.790 align:start position:0%
deposit or paper
check

01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:57.149 align:start position:0%
 
By

01:12:57.149 --> 01:12:57.159 align:start position:0%
By
 
01:13:00.629 --> 01:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
Request Oh by request at any time
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
without penalty to the
 
01:13:05.709 --> 01:13:05.719 align:start position:0%
employee that's that's and that's how we
 
01:13:07.229 --> 01:13:07.239 align:start position:0%
would do it now if they wanted to go
 
01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
from paper check to a direct dep
 
01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
positive and we wouldn't be able to
 
01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:11.960 align:start position:0%
charge them any fees or if they want to
 
01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
come out of direct deposit and they were
 
01:13:14.350 --> 01:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
moving and one of the paper check for a
 
01:13:15.669 --> 01:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
couple weeks till they move to their new
 
01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
house or something but see this provides
 
01:13:19.229 --> 01:13:19.239 align:start position:0%
the employee the ability to say I don't
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
want it anymore right as they can
 
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
anyways no
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
yes provided the employee the part the
 
01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
whole part
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
D now they're mandating direct deposit
 
01:13:34.629 --> 01:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
or pay to check instead of whatever they
 
01:13:37.149 --> 01:13:37.159 align:start position:0%
want whether it be an em transfer or
 
01:13:39.550 --> 01:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
okay all right e lines 34 through
 
01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
37 the employer shall provide employees
 
01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:55.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:59.430 --> 01:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
yeah they all do that in here wisely ATM
 
01:14:02.950 --> 01:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
whatever they have so is this fine would
 
01:14:05.629 --> 01:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
this be fine to add to the current law
 
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
for the people that are already using
 
01:14:10.709 --> 01:14:10.719 align:start position:0%
the cards do you have a comment the only
 
01:14:12.270 --> 01:14:12.280 align:start position:0%
thing that I would look at on this one
 
01:14:14.910 --> 01:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
is the consistency we're talking payroll
 
01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
card and the rest of the the law and the
 
01:14:20.629 --> 01:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
first bill is introduced does have
 
01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies whereas those are
 
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
removed in the amendment but if this is
 
01:14:26.590 --> 01:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
a part of the bill that you would want
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
to keep in here then I would just change
 
01:14:30.669 --> 01:14:30.679 align:start position:0%
debit cards to payroll card correct just
 
01:14:30.679 --> 01:14:35.750 align:start position:0%
debit cards to payroll card correct just
for

01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
consistency I'm just saying you know we
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
can kill it we can we can amend it
 
01:14:44.669 --> 01:14:44.679 align:start position:0%
um some people don't mind lines three
 
01:14:49.709 --> 01:14:49.719 align:start position:0%
and four on page two lines 34 35 36 37
 
01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
do they provide some kind
 
01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:56.709 align:start position:0%
do they provide some kind
of

01:14:56.709 --> 01:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
necessary wording that allows people to
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
utilize their payroll cards and find a
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
place to cash it for
 
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
free um since since payroll cards are
 
01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
already being
 
01:15:12.629 --> 01:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
used it's in there whoever there is they
 
01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:14.920 align:start position:0%
have domestic and
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
ATM right but that's not New Hampshire
 
01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
law that's the fees associated with
 
01:15:23.550 --> 01:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
it I don't think anywhere it say they
 
01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
need to find a place where they can draw
 
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
down their entire payroll card or
 
01:15:41.629 --> 01:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:51.790 --> 01:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:58.750 --> 01:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
disclosures I think e
 
01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:00.629 align:start position:0%
disclosures I think e
is

01:16:00.629 --> 01:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:16:07.629 --> 01:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:09.629 --> 01:16:09.639 align:start position:0%
incorrectly what was the question oh
 
01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm looking at lines 34 through 37
 
01:16:15.229 --> 01:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
right wondering they should be out of
 
01:16:15.239 --> 01:16:16.149 align:start position:0%
right wondering they should be out of
the

01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:18.270 --> 01:16:18.280 align:start position:0%
lawani seems to think that's covered in
 
01:16:21.149 --> 01:16:21.159 align:start position:0%
lines 7 through 15 on page
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
two under two
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
him what I'm seeing in lines 11 and
 
01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
12 is disclosure issues with regards to
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:45.470 --> 01:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
fees but it doesn't tell you where you
 
01:16:49.870 --> 01:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
can get um no no use of a payroll card
 
01:16:51.950 --> 01:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
that has an expiration
 
01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
date and and provision of a replacement
 
01:16:56.189 --> 01:16:56.199 align:start position:0%
payroll card before an expiration date
 
01:16:58.149 --> 01:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
at no cost the
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
employee I I don't see specific language
 
01:17:02.629 --> 01:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
in here that I would interpret that
 
01:17:05.070 --> 01:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
department would interpret as
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
ordering the disclosure of a list of
 
01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
locations where the payroll card can be
 
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:16.669 --> 01:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
fees that would be if I yeah that would
 
01:17:18.270 --> 01:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
be part of the fee structure within the
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
card holder agreement that you would
 
01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
sign with any of these people you would
 
01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:23.960 align:start position:0%
have all your fees instruction of where
 
01:17:25.990 --> 01:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
you can go without having another
 
01:17:27.270 --> 01:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
section of law that tells you you have
 
01:17:30.270 --> 01:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:33.159 align:start position:0%
again New Hampshire law though requires
 
01:17:36.189 --> 01:17:36.199 align:start position:0%
an employee to be able to get their
 
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
payroll without having to pay a fee so
 
01:17:41.550 --> 01:17:41.560 align:start position:0%
even if there is a fee that's associated
 
01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
with any of these particular thirdparty
 
01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
companies that have the pay cards they
 
01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:48.440 align:start position:0%
can have whatever fees they want to but
 
01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
there should it it should be clear that
 
01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
the law currently stands is that there
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
should be no fees correct but it's it's
 
01:17:58.430 --> 01:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
in their C holder agreement which every
 
01:18:00.669 --> 01:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
employee would sign with whomever
 
01:18:03.709 --> 01:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
authorizes their payroll
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
cards I don't see where you're going
 
01:18:09.149 --> 01:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
that that New Hampshire law supersedes
 
01:18:11.629 --> 01:18:11.639 align:start position:0%
an agreement with a pay card fee yeah
 
01:18:12.910 --> 01:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
but you would get this whole stack of
 
01:18:15.229 --> 01:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
paper with your pay card when you sign
 
01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:17.480 align:start position:0%
up for your pay card and sign on to ADP
 
01:18:19.149 --> 01:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
or but it doesn't tell you where you can
 
01:18:22.470 --> 01:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
get your your debt your your payroll
 
01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:23.790 align:start position:0%
get your your debt your your payroll
card

01:18:23.790 --> 01:18:23.800 align:start position:0%
card
 
01:18:26.149 --> 01:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
you withdraw your funds with no fee it
 
01:18:28.189 --> 01:18:28.199 align:start position:0%
does it tells you when here it's their
 
01:18:28.199 --> 01:18:29.870 align:start position:0%
does it tells you when here it's their
ATM

01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
ATM
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
people what happens if they don't I mean
 
01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
these are some that do all of them have
 
01:18:37.870 --> 01:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
access to uh domestic ATM withdrawals
 
01:18:40.189 --> 01:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
all point is one of them star is another
 
01:18:42.669 --> 01:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
one three or four different vendors that
 
01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:47.199 align:start position:0%
have debit and pay card uh
 
01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
availability all have have it in their
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:01.199 --> 01:19:02.550 align:start position:0%
 
that's

01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
only right there's other ones that have
 
01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
it over the I mean we went through all
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
that earlier how much you can and can't
 
01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
some of them do have over the counter
 
01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
limits including banks have over counter
 
01:19:17.470 --> 01:19:17.480 align:start position:0%
limits so the Hamp law really trunp
 
01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:20.590 align:start position:0%
limits so the Hamp law really trunp
banking

01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:34.510 --> 01:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:51.830 align:start position:0%
 
think

01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.840 --> 01:20:21.750 align:start position:0%
 
correct

01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:32.070 align:start position:0%
 
out

01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:34.149 --> 01:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
understood I just
 
01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
want no no I'm just so I have one thing
 
01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:37.750 align:start position:0%
want no no I'm just so I have one thing
to

01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
add and I say this with absolutely no
 
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
disrespect to anybody but when we heard
 
01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
originally I'm just trying to figure out
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
is this a problem in the state or is
 
01:20:54.910 --> 01:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
this legis islation
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
that somebody could make money by
 
01:21:01.229 --> 01:21:01.239 align:start position:0%
selling these debit cards to companies
 
01:21:04.669 --> 01:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
because honestly when we had the public
 
01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
hearing I didn't see companies lined up
 
01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
at the door to either say they like this
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
or they don't like it so I mean is this
 
01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
I guess that's where I'm at is this a
 
01:21:17.390 --> 01:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
problem here or is it something that I
 
01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
mean and I have no isues either way but
 
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
trying to understand the whole thing
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
it's May I think we're confused in the
 
01:21:27.629 --> 01:21:27.639 align:start position:0%
situation and if I mean if it's not an
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
issue and I've always said this with
 
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
legislation if it's not an issue I mean
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
I think we're trying to fix something
 
01:21:38.110 --> 01:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
that's not broken so 97% 93% according
 
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
to all the information people get their
 
01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
things through direct deposit I'm sure
 
01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
there's people that are U utilizing the
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh the payroll
 
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
cards um is it a way for the employer to
 
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
save money Poss on expenses through
 
01:21:56.110 --> 01:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
payroll services
 
01:21:59.870 --> 01:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
sure um could it be convenient to
 
01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:01.390 align:start position:0%
sure um could it be convenient to
certain

01:22:01.390 --> 01:22:01.400 align:start position:0%
certain
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
businesses uh especially businesses
 
01:22:05.189 --> 01:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
where their employees maybe it's a New
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employer and they're all over
 
01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:07.470 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employer and they're all over
the

01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:07.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
country okay and and or there people you
 
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
know in New Hampshire company that has
 
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
people on a oil rig out and go to Gulf
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
of Mexico then payroll card could be
 
01:22:25.470 --> 01:22:25.480 align:start position:0%
uh easy uh maybe at a foreign country if
 
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
they have employees maybe it could be
 
01:22:28.189 --> 01:22:28.199 align:start position:0%
easy for those things so there's a lot
 
01:22:32.830 --> 01:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
of reasons that a payroll card is
 
01:22:35.629 --> 01:22:35.639 align:start position:0%
Justified and and accepted by certain
 
01:22:35.639 --> 01:22:38.070 align:start position:0%
Justified and and accepted by certain
employees

01:22:38.070 --> 01:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:22:40.270 --> 01:22:40.280 align:start position:0%
um we already have on the law the
 
01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
ability to use
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
it to kind of force something on someone
 
01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:47.560 align:start position:0%
I don't no you're right I don't think
 
01:22:50.110 --> 01:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
it's a problem that needs to be uh
 
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
thrust upon
 
01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
someone I was trying to take a couple of
 
01:22:56.709 --> 01:22:56.719 align:start position:0%
the good things out of here and I don't
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
have a problem with lines 34 through 37
 
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
I mean um we can we can amend the bill
 
01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
we can pass the bill as is or we can uh
 
01:23:09.149 --> 01:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
itl the bill uh I thought it was very I
 
01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:10.280 align:start position:0%
think it's a good
 
01:23:13.669 --> 01:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
exercise um that we can tell um the rest
 
01:23:16.350 --> 01:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
of our committee that we looked into
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
this in in a lot of detail and a lot of
 
01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
had good conversation on it uh and then
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
you can all explain to your your fellow
 
01:23:25.709 --> 01:23:25.719 align:start position:0%
members your
 
01:23:29.390 --> 01:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
thoughts um on it and I all I was trying
 
01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
to do is try to be as impartial as I
 
01:23:34.030 --> 01:23:34.040 align:start position:0%
could to try to just go through every
 
01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
single thing what the changes are how
 
01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
the the department would act to it uh
 
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
and if there's anything that we felt um
 
01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
could be needed
 
01:23:48.550 --> 01:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
um I think 34 3567 is is very good for
 
01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:50.229 align:start position:0%
um I think 34 3567 is is very good for
the

01:23:50.229 --> 01:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:23:53.149 --> 01:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
employee I don't have a problem with
 
01:23:56.669 --> 01:23:56.679 align:start position:0%
lines three and four uh about organized
 
01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh labor if they choose to
 
01:24:03.229 --> 01:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
um I think organized labor is pretty
 
01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
smart I think organized labor probably
 
01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:07.719 align:start position:0%
has everybody doing uh direct
 
01:24:11.390 --> 01:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
deposit so um those are the things I
 
01:24:13.310 --> 01:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
think that we can see there the the
 
01:24:16.229 --> 01:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
parts about making the the you know some
 
01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
of these other things we just you know
 
01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
are definitely non-starters for us so um
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
you know I will leave up to the
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
committee this this group as to what you
 
01:24:26.430 --> 01:24:26.440 align:start position:0%
want to do is there is there going to be
 
01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
any recommendation out of this committee
 
01:24:30.870 --> 01:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh the subcommittee at this point uh or
 
01:24:32.590 --> 01:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
is it just
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
um uh are we just going to leave it as
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh no recommendation and you can discuss
 
01:24:41.470 --> 01:24:41.480 align:start position:0%
it with your uh fellow uh committee
 
01:24:42.830 --> 01:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
people when we have the executive
 
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
session your choice is uh it's up to
 
01:24:47.470 --> 01:24:47.480 align:start position:0%
whatever you guys would like to do Mr
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
chairman I would I would respectfully
 
01:24:51.109 --> 01:24:51.119 align:start position:0%
move itl in the
 
01:24:53.870 --> 01:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
entire all right all right we do have a
 
01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
motion I'd support that represent kill
 
01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:01.229 align:start position:0%
motion I'd support that represent kill
second

01:25:01.229 --> 01:25:01.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:04.189 --> 01:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
it any further discussion even the
 
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
amendment leaves me at unrest this is
 
01:25:10.229 --> 01:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
it's obviously I hate to say one company
 
01:25:13.310 --> 01:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
but this is obviously a way to Sho pay
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
cards in as a default instead of a paper
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
check exactly given the amount of fees
 
01:25:24.669 --> 01:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
given the way that um swipes are done um
 
01:25:27.310 --> 01:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
good amount to a
 
01:25:29.470 --> 01:25:29.480 align:start position:0%
large profitability to some of these
 
01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
companies under the guys of saving money
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
for the employer on the backs of the
 
01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
employees kind of like baging your own
 
01:25:39.550 --> 01:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
lugage or doing your own check out at uh
 
01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
certain places I did that last night I
 
01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
wondered why I did it did you ask him if
 
01:25:46.430 --> 01:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
they have off few work on compliation
 
01:25:47.550 --> 01:25:47.560 align:start position:0%
you throw your back out lifting those
 
01:25:49.070 --> 01:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
potatoes on on the
 
01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
belt so we have a motion in the second
 
01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
any additional no
 
01:25:57.109 --> 01:25:57.119 align:start position:0%
comments uh I I think the you know the
 
01:25:59.870 --> 01:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh law already requires that
 
01:26:03.629 --> 01:26:03.639 align:start position:0%
people get their pay without fee so and
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
I think the those who have cards or bank
 
01:26:08.270 --> 01:26:08.280 align:start position:0%
accounts or employers provide the
 
01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
information so I don't think we need to
 
01:26:14.229 --> 01:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
add those lines at the bottom you know
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:21.199 --> 01:26:24.199 align:start position:0%
