00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
are needed to go forward with future
 
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.950 align:start position:0%
are needed to go forward with future
legislation

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:30.639 align:start position:0%

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh we can go through each bill
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
individually briefly
 
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000 align:start position:0%

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
from the committee on how we determine
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
from there there are no minority reports
 
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
we do not vote on them as a full house
 
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
they are just printed in the calendar on
 
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
the recommendations of the committee on
 
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
each of these bills
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions on the
 
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
process first
 
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt has his hand up
 
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
just to clarify representative fontenot
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
sent us a message
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
saying that he is detained by a property
 
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
management issue and will not be with us
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
today okay
 
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
oh okay well that answers that no
 
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
and mr chairman can i just remind
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
members that their
 
00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959 align:start position:0%
raise hand button is at the bottom of
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
the participant panel
 
00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
or if they're on the phone it's star
 
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
nine to raise your hand
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh so we can
 
00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:16.839 align:start position:0%
start uh we'll start with house bill
 
00:10:16.839 --> 00:10:19.910 align:start position:0%
start uh we'll start with house bill
1367.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
and open that up for discussion amongst
 
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
the committees
 
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
on this um i know when we talked there
 
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
was a number of areas that needed work
 
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839 align:start position:0%
and that was the reason why we did
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
interim study to look forward to see if
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
there was
 
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
any work that couldn't be done on this
 
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
or if we thought it was needed
 
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:44.710 align:start position:0%
or if we thought it was needed
[Music]

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire mcguire yes thank
 
00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:53.990 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire mcguire yes thank
you

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh i looked into this i asked
 
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
represent ms smarling to do
 
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
get some data and it appears
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
that in many cases we don't have an
 
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
issue but there are a number
 
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
of professions where we license them
 
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.509 align:start position:0%
of professions where we license them
[Music]

00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:15.519 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
and other states don't
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
and one thing that we that i think is
 
00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:22.790 align:start position:0%
and one thing that we that i think is
that

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
this does need future legislation
 
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
but a more
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
focused bill would be much more
 
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.470 align:start position:0%
focused bill would be much more
appropriate

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:35.519 align:start position:0%
that we we look at each profession any
 
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
profession that we think has an
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
issue and decide what to do about it
 
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
these broad ones broad bills that say
 
00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:49.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
are are very awkward to deal with
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
in a fight if i remember looking at the
 
00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.670 align:start position:0%
in a fight if i remember looking at the
document

00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
document
 
00:12:03.269 --> 00:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
that pam did for us there wasn't a lot
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
of states
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
i mean a lot of licensing that we only
 
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
had we were the only state
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
or one of the handful of states there
 
00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:12.150 align:start position:0%
or one of the handful of states there
was

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
not that many correct yeah yes there
 
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
were three on her list
 
00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
and all three three of those professions
 
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
it have requirements such that it'll be
 
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
easy for somebody
 
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
from out of state to do the same thing
 
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
as somebody from in-state
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
like a waymaster they have to take a
 
00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
test every time they get a new license
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
so you know you move to the state you
 
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
take the same test everybody else does
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
and then apply for the license uh
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
but she pam only looked at the
 
00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
non-medical professions
 
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
so there that's of concern particularly
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
as we're adding new
 
00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
medical imaging technicians are not
 
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
licensed in any of the adjacent states
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
but there are there they do have them
 
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
and we all and that's one that i think
 
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
we particularly ought to look at what
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
so would we need this
 
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
legislation going forward are we looking
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
at something different because we're
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
just looking at
 
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
yes instead of recommending future
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
legislation that we want
 
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
to i'm not sure how we want to work it's
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
not recommended for this one but we
 
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:44.959 align:start position:0%
those ones that are similar yes
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
the bill raises important issues and
 
00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:50.959 align:start position:0%
legislation is needed to address them
 
00:13:50.959 --> 00:13:51.350 align:start position:0%
legislation is needed to address them
but

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
this bill itself i can't see being the
 
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
way to go
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee on
 
00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:04.870 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee on
this

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:09.269 align:start position:0%
this
representative

00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:17.600 align:start position:0%

we
 
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
recommend or not the statement that we
 
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
put up
 
00:14:36.069 --> 00:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
can say basically what carol just
 
00:14:36.079 --> 00:14:37.750 align:start position:0%
can say basically what carol just
suggested

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
suggested
 
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
to me it seems more proper to say
 
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not recommended on this particular
 
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.590 align:start position:0%
i'm not recommended on this particular
bill

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
but as long as you're pointing out that
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps legislation specifying certain
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
professions is pointed out in the
 
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.629 align:start position:0%
professions is pointed out in the
statement

00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
i think that's going to accomplish what
 
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.949 align:start position:0%
i think that's going to accomplish what
what

00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
who else do we have pam uh
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt has his hand up
 
00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
you need to there you go okay yeah i'm
 
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.110 align:start position:0%
you need to there you go okay yeah i'm
good

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
so i agree with representative mcguire
 
00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.110 align:start position:0%
so i agree with representative mcguire
that

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
this is not the right bill but but the
 
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
issue does remain
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
so uh i'm in in agreement with her
 
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
proposal and uh
 
00:15:38.829 --> 00:15:38.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:38.839 --> 00:15:47.910 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i uh we're dancing around a
 
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
particular issue
 
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
or a question and that's when you say
 
00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
when we recommend for future legislation
 
00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
are we aren't necessarily saying this
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
bill but rather this subject matter
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
and i you know i think that the subject
 
00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
matter needs to go
 
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
forward if not this bill so i
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
i i think we we basically agree
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
but i want to be am i clear i get
 
00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:21.759 align:start position:0%
my focused question recommended for
 
00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:22.470 align:start position:0%
my focused question recommended for
further

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
future legislation further legislation
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
does that mean area or this specific
 
00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:33.269 align:start position:0%
does that mean area or this specific
bill

00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
pm i think it all comes out can you
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong in the general
 
00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.389 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong in the general
wording

00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
wording
 
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
when we put it forward is that not true
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:43.720 align:start position:0%
it doesn't always have to be the
 
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
particular bill itself but
 
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
it can be the subject matter it's all in
 
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
the wording of the blurb or committing
 
00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:50.870 align:start position:0%
the wording of the blurb or committing
report

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
that's correct that you know you really
 
00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.189 align:start position:0%
that's correct that you know you really
could

00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
you know pick either option and as long
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
as you're clear in your
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
statement exactly what you're
 
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
supporting whether you you know then
 
00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:05.750 align:start position:0%
supporting whether you you know then
that's

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
really the you know final
 
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
explanation of what you're doing you
 
00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.270 align:start position:0%
explanation of what you're doing you
know

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
okay it's up to you how you want to how
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
defined you want to
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
you know speak about the particular
 
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
language of this bill if you want to
 
00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
think of it as the particular language
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
then that would be very narrow but it's
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
it's generally considered
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
a concept in the bill and whether you
 
00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:30.799 align:start position:0%
are supportive of
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
further work and a new news in a new
 
00:17:33.679 --> 00:17:35.110 align:start position:0%
further work and a new news in a new
session

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
okay yeah this is reflective of the
 
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
committee today and we cannot bind any
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
future legislate
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
legislature to our decision so i mean
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
this is just
 
00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:50.150 align:start position:0%
this is just
a

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none we'll move over to
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
um we did have a subcommittee on this
 
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
representative prove chair that he is
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
not here today
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh representing panda city i think you
 
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
were also on there
 
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
i was you want to give us a little
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
insight on this yeah if i can
 
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
remember correctly i um did have um
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
several committee meetings regarding it
 
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.590 align:start position:0%
several committee meetings regarding it
and

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
we were all in favor of the concept of
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
surveillance cameras but there was
 
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
um there was issues with placements
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
um and and privacy
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
issues um we thought
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
and i and i want to i don't know if this
 
00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.029 align:start position:0%
and i and i want to i don't know if this
is

00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
pam do you remember if there was an
 
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
amendment to this
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
we did did steve did mark draft an
 
00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
amendment to this thing i can't remember
 
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
if if he did he didn't put it in the
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
file there was an amendment from
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
prior to your hearing but not you know
 
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
no other amendment that came in after
 
00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:18.799 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee worked on it so
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
um well i know i know that we both
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
kind of agreed that it was a good thing
 
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
we we listened to some
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh some individuals that came in that uh
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
were all for this thing because i think
 
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
somebody got uh roughed up pretty badly
 
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
and they thought
 
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
having cameras would would uh be the
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
answer but
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
then it became the privacy issue because
 
00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
the cameras could only be in certain
 
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:47.990 align:start position:0%
the cameras could only be in certain
areas

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
and not be in certain areas so we
 
00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.350 align:start position:0%
and not be in certain areas so we
thought

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
thought
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
i believe we agreed that it would
 
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
probably be best to go forward
 
00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
and um continue discussing we thought it
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
was a good idea but
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
i thought there were issues so
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
it was impending city was there also
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
there was also wasn't there an issue
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
as to cost as well those are the two
 
00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.630 align:start position:0%
as to cost as well those are the two
problems

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
there was an issue of cost but we didn't
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
have anybody that came in and said
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
specifically how much it would cost to
 
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
put in
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
put in uh recording systems or any of
 
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
that it was all
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
uh kind of assumptions of it would be
 
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
an expense even even a small expense
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
some of these
 
00:20:33.029 --> 00:20:33.039 align:start position:0%
some of these halfway homes or homes uh
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't afford it uh they couldn't
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
afford any expense
 
00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799 align:start position:0%
whether it was hundreds of dollars or
 
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars they didn't think
 
00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:41.919 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
um they could afford that
 
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
so that was that was kind of uh coming
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
from the home side but they also said it
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
would be a pretty good idea to have them
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
but they didn't know how it was going to
 
00:20:56.549 --> 00:20:56.559 align:start position:0%
be made for that's why we thought
 
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
maybe we should have further discussion
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
okay i i also agree with that i think
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
it's uh worth moving forward on this
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
um but obviously the privacy issues need
 
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
to be addressed as well as the cost
 
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.029 align:start position:0%
to be addressed as well as the cost
issues

00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
um but i think you know this isn't a bad
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:21.909 --> 00:21:21.919 align:start position:0%
further discussion i see
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative schultz has her hand up
 
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
next representative
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
i was just trying to lower it but i
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
guess it bears mentioning that
 
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
i was going to say exactly what
 
00:21:34.149 --> 00:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
representative panda city said
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
write that down america see we can agree
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
so then representative schmidt has his
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
hand up representative schmidt
 
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i second the
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
remarks that have been offered thus far
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
i think it just needs to be factored
 
00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
into our
 
00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
discussion that the pandemic
 
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
has uh has wreaked additional
 
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh hardship uh imposed additional
 
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
burdens on
 
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh the affected community here
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
so that's something we have to make sure
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh that is considered in the legislation
 
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
but i
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
support the position in support of the
 
00:22:19.919 --> 00:22:20.789 align:start position:0%
support the position in support of the
bill

00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
that's been uh offered by a number of
 
00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.950 align:start position:0%
that's been uh offered by a number of
colleagues

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
00:22:29.669 --> 00:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
you know the discussion mr chairman i
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:33.039 align:start position:0%
what your feeling is about attendees
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
participating but there is a hand up
 
00:22:38.549 --> 00:22:38.559 align:start position:0%
in the among the attendees sarah aiken
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
from community bridges
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
all right you should be able to
 
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
hi thank you very much chairman and
 
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
my name is sarah akin and i represent
 
00:22:59.430 --> 00:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
community bridges we're one of 10 area
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
agencies that serve people with
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities and acquired
 
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
brain disorders in new hampshire
 
00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
i wanted to let you know we have been
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
working on this issue
 
00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:09.919 align:start position:0%
with the department of health and human
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
services for some time
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
and i believe the issue has been
 
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.070 align:start position:0%
and i believe the issue has been
resolved

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
resolved
 
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
in that there is a process in place now
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
it is in rule that allows for
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
um surveillance cameras to be used
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
at the request of the individual the
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
parent or the guardian
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
there is a process for it and i'm happy
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
to send you the rule
 
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
um if you're interested
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
but i believe that this has been solved
 
00:23:47.549 --> 00:23:47.559 align:start position:0%
um like i said it is in hem
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
309 and it'll
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
if necessary so the it allows for it but
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
it does not place the financial burden
 
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
and it does not put as many of you
 
00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:04.149 align:start position:0%
and it does not put as many of you
remember

00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
remember
 
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
during our previous discussion we talked
 
00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:07.430 align:start position:0%
during our previous discussion we talked
about

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
how there is a federal settings rule
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
that this bill as written would
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
put all of the wait list
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
funds for people with disabilities in
 
00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.110 align:start position:0%
funds for people with disabilities in
jeopardy

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
jeopardy
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
so that is that is was our very
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
significant concern so at the request
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
of the subcommittee we did go back and
 
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
work with the department and there is a
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
process now in place
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to inform you of that
 
00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
um please be cognizant
 
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking hundreds of millions of
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
dollars at risk
 
00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
from the federal government um and there
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
is now a process in place
 
00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:49.039 align:start position:0%
with that i will end my comment and i
 
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for that information um and
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
just for those folks that are out there
 
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
and so they know that
 
00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
as we talked about the beginning of this
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
meeting that this does not
 
00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
pass the legislation this does not
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
guarantee it's going forward that's all
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
it is is a recommendation from this
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
committee as to whether or not
 
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
future legislation should be brought
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
forward in the subject matter
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
not this particular piece um
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
so while there is something in rules you
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
know it does not stop us from going
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
forward with the concept
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
and addressing the issues we've
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
discussed here today dealing with cost
 
00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:24.630 align:start position:0%
discussed here today dealing with cost
and

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
privacy as well but thank you for
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
letting us know so that we can uh look
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
that up and if you could get that to us
 
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
the host will be informed anyone else
 
00:25:37.039 --> 00:25:37.510 align:start position:0%
the host will be informed anyone else
pam

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
pam
 
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative has his hand up
 
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
representative yeah before
 
00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.070 align:start position:0%
representative yeah before
representative

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh schmidt or mcguire
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
say this can this be done by rule
 
00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
i don't see why not that won't stop
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
i mean the question is if they if an
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
age if a house
 
00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
wants to install cameras for their
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
staff security or whatever they can do
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
that with and the rules would establish
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
what the criteria are or
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
what the limitations would be uh
 
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
if they want to start if you want to
 
00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.310 align:start position:0%
if they want to start if you want to
have

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
cameras all over the place in every
 
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799 align:start position:0%
house that doesn't particularly want it
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
if i may continue was it the point of
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
the legislation that these would be
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
required everywhere
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh what's the point if uh
 
00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:47.919 align:start position:0%
there is an issue of abuse in a
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
particular house that doesn't have a
 
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.070 align:start position:0%
particular house that doesn't have a
camera

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
camera
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
what good's the law what's good what are
 
00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:53.590 align:start position:0%
what good's the law what's good what are
good

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
what good are the rules if it doesn't
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt would you like to
 
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.590 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt would you like to
comment

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
well it is a bit of a conundrum i agree
 
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
with what representative mcguire
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
said uh but of course one of the
 
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
primary uh criteria and one of the
 
00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:17.510 align:start position:0%
primary uh criteria and one of the
primary

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
primary
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
motivating issues was the question of
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
abuse of residents of these homes
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
obviously to the degree that an
 
00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:31.039 align:start position:0%
individual family wants to
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
have their loved ones uh
 
00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh a room surveilled
 
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh that that's probably true but i think
 
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
one of the thrusts is
 
00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
to be able to protect uh inmates
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh residents and so forth
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
and so i think that you would require a
 
00:27:51.919 --> 00:27:53.110 align:start position:0%
and so i think that you would require a
law

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
to do to provide that foundation
 
00:27:59.669 --> 00:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
um and and so i don't i don't think you
 
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative thank you um
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
i think that recommending this although
 
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
it's great to know that
 
00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
that there are things that are happening
 
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
in the right direction
 
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
there are those people who can't speak
 
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
for themselves
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
and who don't have advocates
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
and i think that it's important to
 
00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
consider them
 
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
and i think that recommending this for
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
yes is just saying that this this this
 
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
committee agrees that this is a good
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
thing and
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
it is worth something it is valuable
 
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
so i i do think that still we should
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
consider continuing
 
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
thank you any further discussion
 
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative merchant has his hand up
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
represent a merchant
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
if i miss the chair go back to the
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
original question about
 
00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:05.919 align:start position:0%
rules versus the law rules really have
 
00:29:05.919 --> 00:29:07.029 align:start position:0%
rules versus the law rules really have
the

00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
full force of the law behind it it's
 
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
just a question where it emanates from
 
00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
the legislative body versus the
 
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
executive branch
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
through rulemaking granted to the
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
executive branch from
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
legislative branch so in essence if the
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
department decides to make a rule to
 
00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
make the same requirement
 
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
that would have the same impact as the
 
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
law requiring it itself
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
so to be clear of everyone this could in
 
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
my opinion be done through rulemaking
 
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
as long as the rule says the same thing
 
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
the law would have said
 
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:45.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh so with respect i disagree
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
um to the the course representative
 
00:29:53.909 --> 00:29:53.919 align:start position:0%
merchant is correct that the rules do
 
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
have the force and effect of law
 
00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
but they have to be based on they are
 
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
rules are there to implement statutes
 
00:30:04.149 --> 00:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
they are not there to deal with
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
situations which
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
in which the statutes are silent
 
00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
so to the degree that we wish to
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
to impose this requirement
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
we would have to have a statute to
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
underpin it
 
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
but i would like to just reference the
 
00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
remarks of
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
miss aiken earlier with regard to the
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
jeopardizing of
 
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh federal funding we would have to
 
00:30:34.149 --> 00:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
um we have to have more information of
 
00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
course any statute
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
that would be you know any bill that
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
would come forward
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
would have uh have to go through that
 
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
entire process so
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
but we we have to earmark the whole
 
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
situation as i would say
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
um with regard to the
 
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
potential jeopardizing of the
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire actually
 
00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
peter said it just just fine i agree
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
with them
 
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
thank you any other hands pin
 
00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%

00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:24.389 --> 00:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
very quick how does sarah aiken spell
 
00:31:27.549 --> 00:31:27.559 align:start position:0%

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
establishing committee to study salaries
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%

conduct a study
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
we'll start first by saying we all
 
00:32:04.559 --> 00:32:07.430 align:start position:0%
we'll start first by saying we all
receive

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
some research that pam did on this and
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
where they are
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
at this point with their study and funds
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
and going forward um
 
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
hopefully everyone received that
 
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
that went out it did not actually go out
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%

the governor and council approved a
 
00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.070 align:start position:0%
the governor and council approved a

compensation study and and they were two
 
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
two areas of the the state employee sort
 
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:30.870 align:start position:0%

00:33:33.269 --> 00:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
compensation world that had been
 
00:33:33.279 --> 00:33:34.470 align:start position:0%
compensation world that had been
included

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
included
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
in um a chapter law in
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
house bill 4 actually from 2019
 
00:33:45.269 --> 00:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
and one was reallocation review of
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
all the trooper positions and the second
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
part was a comprehensive review
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
of the state's personnel system which is
 
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
what this
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
bill more or less contemplates
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
was signed in march and
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
they the first part was completed um
 
00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
but not the second part because of covid
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
and so it is
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
that second part of the the
 
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive review of the personnel
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
system study is still there it's still
 
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
funded but it has it's on hold right now
 
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
but the uh the contract does have an end
 
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
date of march 11
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
2022. um so she
 
00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
felt that once
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
people were back in a more traditional
 
00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:36.869 align:start position:0%
people were back in a more traditional
routine

00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
routine
 
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
um that would happen you know they're
 
00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
poised to
 
00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:49.599 align:start position:0%
thank you uh does anyone have any
 
00:34:49.599 --> 00:34:54.790 align:start position:0%
thank you uh does anyone have any
questions

00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
comments i see hands i see
 
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative pearson and schuett
 
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
pearson yeah the
 
00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:07.599 align:start position:0%
the action that was just described
 
00:35:07.599 --> 00:35:07.990 align:start position:0%
the action that was just described
that's

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
that's funded by the that already
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
happened through the governor's office
 
00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:13.599 align:start position:0%
does that in essence do the same thing
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
that 1528 does or is there
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
additional things within this that are
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
not covered under what was
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:28.640 align:start position:0%

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
representative walls in attendance
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
oh when i see her as luck would have it
 
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
her she's got her hand up excellent
 
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
could you unmute her
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
sure sure representative walls welcome
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you um i did raise my hand because
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
i can answer that and the answer is is
 
00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.030 align:start position:0%
i can answer that and the answer is is
that

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
the study that they have sent the
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
contract out on
 
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
and what i intend in this bill are in
 
00:35:56.829 --> 00:35:56.839 align:start position:0%
fact the same thing
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
so like anybody i'm disappointed the
 
00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
study is proceeding slowly i thought
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
that it might
 
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
among other things even help with the
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
current contract pending
 
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh for the poor state employees who
 
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
don't have a contract but i think at
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
this point like everything else
 
00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:12.079 align:start position:0%
uncovered we're just gonna have to wait
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
so i think that the contract's been let
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
given how long it is before they have to
 
00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:20.079 align:start position:0%
complete the contract that it's really
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
another 18 months
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
at this point i don't see a point in
 
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
further legislation
 
00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
i think if there's a problem with it we
 
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
can do legislation in the second year of
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
the session
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
but i think for right now uh probably i
 
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:32.390 align:start position:0%
but i think for right now uh probably i
would

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not on the committee but i would
 
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
recommend the committee not
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
pursue further legislation okay
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you
 
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
and representative schuett has a hand up
 
00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.270 align:start position:0%
and representative schuett has a hand up
representative

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
you um it's actually going to
 
00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
sort of say the opposite uh as a
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on this bill
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
but um i will follow the lead of
 
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
my prime sponsor representative walls
 
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
and agree that if she feels that it's
 
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
not necessary to go forward now
 
00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
that she or i are re-elected
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
we could put a bill in in the second
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
half of the
 
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
biennium to cover this
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
dude uh representative walsh has her
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
hand up again
 
00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
um i just are interested in why
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
representative schuett disagrees what is
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
it she knows that i don't know
 
00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
so that's why i put my hand up
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
um well i i will just point out to you
 
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
representative walls that the main
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
reason that we put this bill
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
into inner study was to
 
00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
sort of be sure to
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
hold the department of administrative
 
00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
services feet
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
with the fire if you will to be sure
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
are going to go forward with this
 
00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:05.839 align:start position:0%
currently i
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
understand the rfp that's been approved
 
00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
only cover a few hundred positions
 
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
and we want to be sure that they are in
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
fact going to
 
00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
continue on and look at the whole
 
00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.910 align:start position:0%
continue on and look at the whole
spectrum

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
spectrum
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
am i unmuted can you hear me you are
 
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
um okay if i could just say one thing
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
first um i think the point being that
 
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
even if we do this
 
00:38:37.109 --> 00:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
as not recommended for future
 
00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
legislation the way we word it
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
can clearly state what representative
 
00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
walls wants it as she has suggested
 
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
that if it um while this is going
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
forward this legislation is not needed
 
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
but in a time certain in the next
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
biennium if it is not completed we can
 
00:38:55.829 --> 00:38:55.839 align:start position:0%
move forward that would be recommended
 
00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
and representative walls um when i
 
00:38:59.829 --> 00:38:59.839 align:start position:0%
talked to the department of
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
and they they actually talked to them
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
the day they put the rfp out
 
00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
they told me at that point that it was
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
going to encompass both all classified
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
and unclassified employees
 
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
um i have not seen the the rfp or the
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
contract to know in fact if that's what
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
they did
 
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
but i think that any recommendation for
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
the committee needs to
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
be cleared that that is the intent of
 
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
what the commit i'm assuming what the
 
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
committee wants as well
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
judging by representative schuett's nods
 
00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
and and the original bill is it was
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
was to encompass all classified and
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
unclassified employees
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately i did not see i was
 
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
not on pam's distribution list so i'm
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
not sure what she put out
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
but um you know i think that that is
 
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
worth following through on and making
 
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
sure that the rfp
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
is consistent with what they told me at
 
00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
the time
 
00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you any uh there are
 
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
discussion any hands up i would just ask
 
00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:01.109 align:start position:0%
discussion any hands up i would just ask
if

00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
if uh mr chair if you want pam to
 
00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:08.839 align:start position:0%
clarify the um terms of the
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
pam what i included in the memo is
 
00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:18.630 align:start position:0%
pam what i included in the memo is
exactly

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
like verbatim what i was given by the
 
00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:23.839 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner the deputy
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner i forget
 
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner and and that was
 
00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:31.839 align:start position:0%
that eagle would would perform a wage
 
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
and benefit study of 100 classified and
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions and i didn't
 
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
how those positions were chosen or
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
anything like that so i i don't know
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
more than
 
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
than what's included there
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
mr chairman if i may uh this is bringing
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
up something the depths of my memory
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
that they do not in fact look at all
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
positions but that they
 
00:40:59.109 --> 00:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
sample at all levels and perhaps that's
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
why they're talking about only a hundred
 
00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
is that they're doing sampling and then
 
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
they will base their study on the
 
00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:06.630 align:start position:0%
they will base their study on the
sampling

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
sampling
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
as i think about this i remember that
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
discussion as well
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
okay and i i would assume if we did all
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
i suspect you're right
 
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
further discussion uh
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
so i just asked as prime sponsor
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative walls you would be
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
satisfied with
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
those terms well if the sampling crosses
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
the spectrum of all classified and
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
unclassified employees yes
 
00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
i just you know i'm assuming that that
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
what they told me is what they're doing
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
and what's in the contract
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
i have no reason to doubt it so assuming
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
that's what they did with their sampling
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
i think it's just fine
 
00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
okay i would rather add that
 
00:41:59.829 --> 00:41:59.839 align:start position:0%
i did reach out to jay ward
 
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
representative from mca testified on the
 
00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:04.870 align:start position:0%
representative from mca testified on the
build

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
build
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
and he said that the
 
00:42:12.069 --> 00:42:12.079 align:start position:0%
sca was satisfied with
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
the rfp that was approved by governor
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
and council
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh but obviously they haven't been able
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
to follow
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
where they're going with it at ex
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
moments so
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that they will also follow
 
00:42:29.109 --> 00:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
through to be sure that
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
and that can be in the report that we
 
00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
put forward
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
one way or the other looking forward
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
i see no hands we will
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
move on to our final bill
 
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh house bill 1536 and i will
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
recognize representative merchants thank
 
00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:04.079 align:start position:0%
you mr chair
 
00:43:06.069 --> 00:43:06.079 align:start position:0%
this bill basically had three components
 
00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
to it
 
00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
one was the issue of the pharmacist in
 
00:43:09.359 --> 00:43:10.230 align:start position:0%
one was the issue of the pharmacist in
charge

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
charge
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
and its legacy back to a period of time
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
which was a lot of independent
 
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
pharmacy owners and when there were
 
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
times the owner would own one or two
 
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:21.349 align:start position:0%
times the owner would own one or two
pharmacies

00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
pharmacies
 
00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
was to have a pharmacist be appointed as
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist in charge
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
take responsibility for the pharmacy and
 
00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:30.079 align:start position:0%
be accountable to the board
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
since that time corporate america for
 
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
the most part owns most
 
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
pharmacies today we have a disconnect
 
00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:37.839 align:start position:0%
between the
 
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
authority in the accountability so the
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
in that arena was to try to correct that
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
imbalance and
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
have those who have the authority and
 
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
control the resources
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
weren't accountable to the board into
 
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
or their responsibilities
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
in going forward and talking with the
 
00:43:59.349 --> 00:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
board of pharmacy at the time
 
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
they felt that the language the way it
 
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
was written was probably problematic
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
and therefore it needed to be revised so
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
that was the first part of it number two
 
00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
for those who are on the committee can
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
remember back there was a time in which
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
the board of pharmacy um has sort of a
 
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
i would say a heavy hand in looking at
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
the preparation of general products for
 
00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:23.829 align:start position:0%
the preparation of general products for
administration

00:44:23.829 --> 00:44:23.839 align:start position:0%
administration
 
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
outside of a hospital predominantly
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
within the physician's office space
 
00:44:32.309 --> 00:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
and it caused a lot of stir and
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
it was changed if you will but what
 
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
happened was the law
 
00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
still requires the board because it says
 
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
the board shall go into
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
an inspect versus it may so the intent
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
of the bill was to clarify that so the
 
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
board would have the authority to go in
 
00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
based upon a complaint which would be
 
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
the may and not be forced to go in when
 
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
there's no reason not to go in
 
00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
just because the law required them to do
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
it and the third
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
prong to it was the issue about
 
00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:01.349 align:start position:0%
prong to it was the issue about
discipline

00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
discipline
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
in certain parts of the statute for the
 
00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:04.390 align:start position:0%
in certain parts of the statute for the
board

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
in some cases the board can either flap
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
you on the wrist
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
or throw the hammer at you and the
 
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
intent here was to give more granularity
 
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
or satisfication in the ability for the
 
00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:16.470 align:start position:0%
or satisfication in the ability for the
board

00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
to align the discipline in concert to
 
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
what the
 
00:45:23.829 --> 00:45:23.839 align:start position:0%
um what the issue was so those are the
 
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
three things in talking with the
 
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
board of medicine and board of nursing
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
issue of may versus shell they were
 
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
bringing back the issue of
 
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
not having war going at all which i
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
think is problematic
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
so we had a committee representative
 
00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:41.839 align:start position:0%
mcguire was on the subcommittee with
 
00:45:41.839 --> 00:45:42.550 align:start position:0%
mcguire was on the subcommittee with
myself

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
um carol i can't remember who the other
 
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
person was
 
00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
but we at that point in time recognized
 
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
the wording in the bill although the
 
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
intent of it was probably fine
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
the wording in the bill itself had to be
 
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
worked on and revised so my
 
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation is to
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
look at this as future legislation the
 
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
concept makes sense but the bill itself
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
yeah the one of the issues is
 
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
that whenever you talk about
 
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
inspecting someone else's
 
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
facilities that is not actually
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
responsible to the pharmacy board
 
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
like a doctor's office they get all
 
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
huffy and say
 
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's my office it's my
 
00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:32.950 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's my office it's my
business

00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
but in some cases you do need
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
a pharmacist or someone who's familiar
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
with it
 
00:46:41.589 --> 00:46:41.599 align:start position:0%
because there were many cases where drug
 
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
storage was incorrect
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
but it's going to be a very difficult
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
matter toward the law
 
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
such that it doesn't get the entire
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.839 --> 00:46:56.470 align:start position:0%
 
again

00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
okay your music
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
yes i had finished okay
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt has his hand up
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i i do think
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
as someone who is both the regular
 
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
consumer of
 
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
medications having reached the age of
 
00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
the gradual self-disassembly of all my
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
physical faculties as well as mental uh
 
00:47:35.109 --> 00:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
so i'm in pharmacies a lot
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
and and having served on the gel car and
 
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
for the past 14 years i have seen
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
this evolution of
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
the of the situation that representative
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
merchant has very accurately described
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
with regard to the the dichotomy that we
 
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
have now
 
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
prob um apologize for the ring
 
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
ringing telephone which i will ignore
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
but the thing is that the the pharmacist
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
in charge still has
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
all the responsibility for everything
 
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
being um kosher in
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
the uh in the pharmacy the word kosher
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
not being
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
a religious term in this regard but
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
rather everything being in order in the
 
00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:26.630 align:start position:0%
rather everything being in order in the
pharmacy

00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
pharmacy
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
and um and yet being a
 
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
a captive if you will of the corporate
 
00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:34.870 align:start position:0%
a captive if you will of the corporate
situation

00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh the um the the pharmacist has
 
00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
no authority to do a lot of the things
 
00:48:44.549 --> 00:48:44.559 align:start position:0%
that has been removed by the corporate
 
00:48:44.559 --> 00:48:45.589 align:start position:0%
that has been removed by the corporate
structure

00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
structure
 
00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh and this is puts the pharmacist
 
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
in charge in a really many respects
 
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
untenable situation and this particular
 
00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh aspect of it is just part of the
 
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
the circumstance so i think that future
 
00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
legislation is
 
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
warranted with regard to studying
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
maybe we're not ready to implement
 
00:49:12.309 --> 00:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
anything yet but i think we have to
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
study this
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
issue uh in order to know how to deal
 
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
with it
 
00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
uh so i i do think that we're we're uh
 
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
we're headed we need to go in that
 
00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:24.790 align:start position:0%
we're headed we need to go in that
direction

00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
direction
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
all right just wanted you to know
 
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:36.800 align:start position:0%

00:49:42.829 --> 00:49:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:42.839 --> 00:49:48.150 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
all right uh seeing no further
 
00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:51.510 align:start position:0%
all right uh seeing no further
discussion

00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
in this work session uh we will move
 
00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
into the executive session
 
00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
pam do i need to do roll call again for
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
executive session are we
 
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
good to go oh just for the votes
 
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
you just can move in without accepting
 
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
just declare it and then you can go
 
00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
ahead and just
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
have cold calls on the actual motion
 
00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:15.349 align:start position:0%
have cold calls on the actual motion
okay

00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
so we'll move into executive session and

legislation

00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:50:38.549 --> 00:50:38.559 align:start position:0%

legislation
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
second second who was that
 
00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:54.559 align:start position:0%
now representative melvin everything
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:58.559 --> 00:51:04.630 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm a little confused i thought
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
in the early discussion we had thought
 
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
that we didn't need this
 
00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
so why would we recommend it for because
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
there was so there were issues
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
did i misunderstand the whole crux of
 
00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
our conversation in the beginning
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
carolyn mcguire yes i think what we said
 
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
is that this bill
 
00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:41.750 align:start position:0%
is that this bill
addresses

00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
all professions but the issue
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
that we regulate a large number of
 
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
professions that
 
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
not all states do including our adjacent
 
00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.150 align:start position:0%
not all states do including our adjacent
states

00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
and therefore we need to consider
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
this but the bill as written is
 
00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
is is too broad and not
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
focused there but there are cases where
 
00:52:08.549 --> 00:52:08.559 align:start position:0%
we have a license requirement that
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
someone who has been doing the same job
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
in say maine or massachusetts
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
they don't have a license and it would
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
be very difficult for them to come to
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:20.110 align:start position:0%
and get a license
 
00:52:20.110 --> 00:52:23.030 align:start position:0%
and get a license
[Music]

00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:52:26.069 --> 00:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
excuse me mr chairman
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
i've been reminded that substitutes
 
00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
cannot second i cannot make motions or
 
00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:32.790 align:start position:0%
cannot second i cannot make motions or
second

00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
and so on unfortunately that's right i
 
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
will eventually
 
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
second to represent mcguire's motion
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
i will second six seconds
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
seconds okay
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
back to representative mcguire anything
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
else to further
 
00:52:59.829 --> 00:52:59.839 align:start position:0%
no when we the reason we put this
 
00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
into interim study was that we agreed
 
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
it was a serious concern and
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
we could do something about it but
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
because of
 
00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
the shutdown and being unable to have
 
00:53:13.589 --> 00:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
meetings we haven't done
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
any of the work that we would have liked
 
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
to but the
 
00:53:19.589 --> 00:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
problem it points out is still valid
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
it's still our
 
00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
our scope essentially and so it's going
 
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
to need further legislation
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
and i think as we discussed earlier that
 
00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:32.559 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:53:36.069 --> 00:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
professions out there that um
 
00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
where this would work and it's this
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation is just
 
00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
too broad and it would be
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have further legislation
 
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with those subjects
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
and representative schuett has her hand
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
up representative
 
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um i'm sort of rethinking
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
what we had talked about originally on
 
00:54:04.079 --> 00:54:06.470 align:start position:0%
what we had talked about originally on
this

00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that i want
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
have the committee give the impression
 
00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
that we are in fact
 
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
endorsing this broad piece of
 
00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:17.670 align:start position:0%
endorsing this broad piece of
legislation

00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
um regardless as we have said regardless
 
00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:21.109 align:start position:0%
um regardless as we have said regardless
of

00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
what the recommendation is
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
the statement that goes along with it
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
can make
 
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
clear what the committee's intent
 
00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
is myself i think i would rather
 
00:54:38.069 --> 00:54:38.079 align:start position:0%
see not recommended for this
 
00:54:42.309 --> 00:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
specific bill but would prefer to see
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
future legislation and then spell out
 
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
exactly what representative mcguire was
 
00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
saying that i think that would be
 
00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:52.789 align:start position:0%
saying that i think that would be
preferable

00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
preferable
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
i see representative grota has her
 
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
actual hand up
 
00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
representative i do thank you
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
so now i'm um
 
00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
what i'm i i understand the vote to say
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
is that if you don't recommend it is
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
that you don't recommend it in principle
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
if you recommend it you're recommending
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
the principle of it
 
00:55:25.829 --> 00:55:25.839 align:start position:0%
not you we're not recommending or not
 
00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
recommending the bill
 
00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
is that right or do i have this again do
 
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
i have this wrong
 
00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
we're not recommending the bill because
 
00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:34.799 align:start position:0%
if we were to recommend the bill we
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have
 
00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799 align:start position:0%
put an interim study so it's
 
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
we're either recommending the principles
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
or not recommending the principles of
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
the bill is that correct
 
00:55:47.829 --> 00:55:47.839 align:start position:0%
that is correct and it all goes into the
 
00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
wording of the
 
00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
report as to the intent of the committee
 
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
going forward with legislation and the
 
00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
intent of what needs to be in
 
00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:57.839 align:start position:0%
future legislation so what would if you
 
00:55:58.950 --> 00:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
were to recommend this
 
00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
sign follow up no i'm just correct me if
 
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
i'm wrong pam on this i believe
 
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
it's all in the intent of the wording of
 
00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
the report
 
00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
that's correct that's correct it's it's
 
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
up to you how you want
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
to view the vote um
 
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
but really the the statement that you
 
00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:21.190 align:start position:0%
but really the the statement that you
make

00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
is going to you know prevail and
 
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
and show exactly what your your intent
 
00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:27.670 align:start position:0%
and show exactly what your your intent
was

00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
okay representative follow-up thank you
 
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
so what we're saying if we recommend
 
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
is that we see that there is
 
00:56:44.069 --> 00:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
a need to
 
00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
um relax
 
00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
i'm using that word look very very
 
00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:54.950 align:start position:0%
i'm using that word look very very
loosely

00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
loosely
 
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
relax um some of our previous
 
00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:59.349 align:start position:0%
relax um some of our previous
legislation

00:56:59.349 --> 00:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:57:02.069 --> 00:57:02.079 align:start position:0%
this bill is not the vehicle to do that
 
00:57:02.079 --> 00:57:03.190 align:start position:0%
this bill is not the vehicle to do that
with

00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
but perhaps in the future you would we
 
00:57:07.589 --> 00:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
couldn't entertain
 
00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
a bill is that what we're saying
 
00:57:11.829 --> 00:57:11.839 align:start position:0%
represent mcguire that
 
00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
your intent um
 
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
yes my intent is that the bill is
 
00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
written is not
 
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
suitable to be passed but that
 
00:57:25.349 --> 00:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
it the issue that the bill raises
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
is important and does need further
 
00:57:27.599 --> 00:57:29.109 align:start position:0%
is important and does need further
legislation

00:57:29.109 --> 00:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to comment that if you look
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
at the calendars
 
00:57:36.789 --> 00:57:36.799 align:start position:0%
from every other session you'll
 
00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
see back back-to-back
 
00:57:44.069 --> 00:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
recommendations for further legislation
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
and against further legislation with
 
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
almost the same wording
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
so i think that the actual
 
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation is kind of you
 
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
is kind of undefined and there's no
 
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
clear understanding of what it means
 
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
it's only the words that really matter
 
00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:02.870 align:start position:0%
it's only the words that really matter
so

00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
if you've got somebody that's willing to
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
make the words that everybody seems to
 
00:58:08.549 --> 00:58:08.559 align:start position:0%
think ought to say
 
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
vote for the motion if you want to write
 
00:58:11.829 --> 00:58:11.839 align:start position:0%
a different kind of words
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
then vote against
 
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.670 align:start position:0%
then vote against
[Music]

00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:58:17.589 --> 00:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
and representative schmidt has his hand
 
00:58:17.599 --> 00:58:18.789 align:start position:0%
and representative schmidt has his hand
up

00:58:18.789 --> 00:58:18.799 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt thank you mr
 
00:58:23.829 --> 00:58:23.839 align:start position:0%
chairman can you hear me okay
 
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
yes okay good um
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
so as we all know when i
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
weekend you said it in your opening
 
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
remarks the legislature cannot bind a
 
00:58:38.309 --> 00:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
future legislature
 
00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
with regard to anything and this is this
 
00:58:41.589 --> 00:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to die at the end of
 
00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:46.799 align:start position:0%
the session one way or the other
 
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
and so to the degree that we
 
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
recognize that there is a situation that
 
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
needs addressing
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative mcguire would be
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
completely within her rights
 
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
should she be re-elected um to file such
 
00:59:03.150 --> 00:59:03.160 align:start position:0%
legislation whether we
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
recommend against it or for it
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
but i think we to the degree that the
 
00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
committee recognizes
 
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
that there is a problem with regard to
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
certain professions
 
00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
that are not licensed in other states
 
00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:18.710 align:start position:0%
that are not licensed in other states
but

00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
may be licensed here that
 
00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
that we ought to deal with that or try
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
to deal with it
 
00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
and accept at the same time
 
00:59:31.829 --> 00:59:31.839 align:start position:0%
that this particular bill is too broad
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
it's not appropriate
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
and to the degree that our language
 
00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
reflects that
 
00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
uh i'm prepared to vote for the motion
 
00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
and and and i think that
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire will likely
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor the legislation
 
00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
to do it the way she
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
understands and we will have a shot at
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
it because it will come back to this
 
00:59:56.559 --> 00:59:57.510 align:start position:0%
it because it will come back to this
committee

00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
the motion is recommended for future
 
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.460 align:start position:0%
the motion is recommended for future
legislation

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:15.470 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
01:00:19.829 --> 01:00:19.839 align:start position:0%
noting that this is not the vehicle that
 
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
we were looking for it's too broad
 
01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
that will be stated in the remarks
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
noting that there is issues in certain
 
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
professions that should be looked at and
 
01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:30.950 align:start position:0%

addressed

01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%

01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
i would recommend this bill be um
 
01:02:43.109 --> 01:02:43.119 align:start position:0%
introduced for future i don't know how
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
you word the emotion but i
 
01:02:47.109 --> 01:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
to support the bill for being presented
 
01:02:48.309 --> 01:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
again with

over privacy
 
01:02:55.589 --> 01:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
but the underlying concept of the bill
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
is very good
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
it needs to be addressed there
 
01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:02.960 align:start position:0%

sorry about that that's okay um yeah
 
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
concerns about the sort of incidents
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
that would be captured by these cameras
 
01:03:42.549 --> 01:03:42.559 align:start position:0%
that would hold
 
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
folks accountable so um folks wouldn't
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
be abused in these settings
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
to provide protection to
 
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
assist families and getting to the
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
bottom of what
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
some situations they've encountered with
 
01:03:57.670 --> 01:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
their loved ones have
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
endured they would be able to figure out
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
what happened
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
hopefully keep it from happening any of
 
01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
these difficult
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
um abusive situations
 
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
so this bill is on the right track and
 
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
we do believe it should be presented
 
01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
again and
 
01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
we specifically want to make sure that
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
concerns over privacy
 
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%

01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative panda city do
 
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
you want to speak to a second
 
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um some committee
 
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:34.240 align:start position:0%

01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
a need
 
01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:37.839 align:start position:0%
um there are people that would love to
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
see this
 
01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
it's good to hear from miss aikens about
 
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
rules have already established
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
certain requirements or certain
 
01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
procedures for for
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
video surveillance it still needs to be
 
01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
looked at there are still cost issues
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
privacy issues
 
01:04:55.829 --> 01:04:55.839 align:start position:0%
that need to be addressed and i think
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
the best way to do that is move forward
 
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:10.070 --> 01:05:10.080 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair um i believe the
three

01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
fundamental issues that this bill
 
01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
addresses are important and should be
 
01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
done with at least discussed um but
 
01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
it does also require additional
 
01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
changes and modifications to the bill
 
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
itself so they can't go any further can
 
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
i get a second
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:09.189 --> 01:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
so i think the concepts of the bill the
 
01:12:10.630 --> 01:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
premise of the
 
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
issues raised by the bill to be
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
addressed by the bill
 
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
are valid and important however the
 
01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
language and the bill that was proposed
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
is in need of revisions and i believe
 
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
future legislation will be able to
 
01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:25.510 align:start position:0%
future legislation will be able to
resolve

01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
resolve
 
01:12:27.669 --> 01:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
the issues and it's a possibility for
 
01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders through
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
future discussion and also input from
 
01:12:31.199 --> 01:12:32.149 align:start position:0%
future discussion and also input from
other

01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:12:34.709 --> 01:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
factors to weigh in on the future
 
01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
legislation to at that point in time
 
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
make the
 
01:12:40.229 --> 01:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
bill the workplace should what it's
 
01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative schmidt would
 
01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to a second
 
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
i thank you mr chairman so this bill
 
01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
will be coming back to us
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
i think we can be fairly confident that
 
01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
that's the case
 
01:12:58.470 --> 01:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
and we will be able to see and we will
 
01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
have plenty of input because we know
 
01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:01.270 align:start position:0%
have plenty of input because we know
that

01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
that some of the other professions are
 
01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:04.870 align:start position:0%
that some of the other professions are
concerned

01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
about pharmacy board overreach and so
 
01:13:09.189 --> 01:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
forth and so on
 
01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
as am i um but
 
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
that these this is a profession which is
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
also evolving
 
01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
and this uh this concept
 
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
of um of infusion and so forth is is a
 
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
procedure that is becoming ever more
 
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
commonly applied
 
01:13:34.149 --> 01:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
and practiced i myself had one after
 
01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
having had an
 
01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
about in the hospital with a
 
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
urinary tract infection and some sepsis
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
so i know that this infusion thing is
 
01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
extremely significant in today's medical
 
01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:50.149 align:start position:0%
extremely significant in today's medical
care

01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:13:54.070 --> 01:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
um and and this is something that also
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
needs to be you know all these
 
01:13:59.840 --> 01:13:59.850 align:start position:0%
evolutions we need to be
 
01:13:59.850 --> 01:14:03.270 align:start position:0%
evolutions we need to be
[Music]

01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
so we get the legislation right and we
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
will have
 
01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
a good chance of having it come to a
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee as well
 
01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
in the next term so i think this is a
 
01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:15.110 align:start position:0%
in the next term so i think this is a
good

01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:19.600 align:start position:0%

01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
to bring
 
01:17:57.510 --> 01:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
forward is to let everybody know some
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
point probably
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
the first half of october
 
01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
i will send something out
 
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
pam i'd like to probably try and do a
 
01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:08.229 align:start position:0%
pam i'd like to probably try and do a
committee

01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
meeting with the new executive director
 
01:18:12.149 --> 01:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
of olpc
 
01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
i've received an email i know
 
01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative schmitz received an email
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
on some of the changes she would like to
 
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
see going forward
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
i think it would be good for the
 
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
committee to sit down
 
01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
